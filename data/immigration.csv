Analysts are still working to understand Zohran Mamdani’s decisive victory in last month’s New York mayoral race. Like the blind men in the old Indian story of the “Blind Men and the Elephant,” the explanations offered have been mostly accurate but incomplete.

Mamdani’s focus on affordability was clearly appealing, as was his compelling affability on display in clever and incisive social media posts. The fact that he was constantly on the move, meeting and engaging voters where they were, was also a factor in his favor. It communicated his authentic desire to know voters and have them know him.

In the stale consultant-driven political environment in which we find ourselves, Mamdani was a breath of fresh air. With his opponents spending tens of millions on negative attack ads, Mamdani’s approach was new and exciting. Despite running against the well-funded campaign of a former governor and much of the New York Democratic Party establishment that saw him as a threat to their hegemony, he not only prevailed but also won more votes than any previous mayoral candidate in the city’s history.

Three other factors were also decisive in shaping the outcome.

The first is the changing demographics of New York City. In 1980, more than one-half of the city’s population was white. Today it is less than one-third white. In 1980, 1,400,000 New Yorkers were Hispanic. Today they number 2 ½ million. During this same period, New York’s Black population remained fairly stable at about 1,700,000, though over one-third of today’s Black population are immigrants or the descendants of recent immigrants from African or Caribbean countries. One of the biggest shifts has been the dramatic growth of New York’s population of Asian descent. They have grown from a few hundred thousand to 1,400,000.

These changing demographics in favor of newer immigrant communities resulted in substantial shifts in the composition of the electorate and it mattered in this election. Mamdani easily won among Asian, Hispanic, and Black voters. But it’s important to note that he almost evenly split the white vote with his main opponent. Performing that well among all demographic groups is unusual in New York politics.

Another critically important factor in Mamdani’s win was the role an empowered grassroots movement played. The political group that powered his victory was the Democratic Socialists of America. With thousands of organizers throughout New York City, they had already accounted for a number of upset wins during this past decade. The first was in 2018, when upstart Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Congressman Joseph Crowley. At the time of his defeat, Crowley was the Chair of the Queens County Democratic Party and Vice-Chair of the Democratic Caucus in Congress. In many ways, Ocasio-Cortez’s win presaged Mamdani’s. Crowley had the support of the establishment and far more money than his unknown insurgent opponent, but the party apparatus he headed had grown lazy and stale. She had a grassroots movement that out-organized the establishment.

In the years that followed, DSA activists won a number of elections for state and local posts across the city (including Mamdani’s 2021 election to New York State Assembly). They showed that an organization of energized grassroots activists can defeat the establishment and their money.

A final factor that played a critical role in Mamdani’s victory was the impact of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza on the electorate in general, and specifically on the Jewish community in New York City.

For decades, the accepted political wisdom was that because of the size of the Jewish community in New York City, a political candidate who wanted to win there had to pay homage to Israel. It was assumed that the Jewish community was in lock-step with Israel and that those who wanted their votes or support should act accordingly. This not only silenced any reasoned discussion of the Middle East, but also had a devastating impact on the ability of Arab Americans and, especially after 9/11, American Muslims to freely participate in the city’s political life.

One example stands out. In 1988 Jesse Jackson’s presidential bid became the first to welcome the Arab community into a presidential campaign. The New York rally and fundraiser Arab Americans organized for Jackson was one of his most successful events. When, the following year, one of Jackson’s New York co-chairs announced that he would run for mayor, the Arab community was ready to play a part. Early in the year, I was called to New York by the candidate and his campaign manager. They told me that the city’s Jewish establishment was upset by the role Arabs had played in Jackson’s effort and by Jackson’s embrace of Palestinian rights. They told me, “Tell your people we don’t want their support. If the Arabs give us a thousand dollars, the Jewish community will raise one hundred thousand to defeat us. Keep them away.”

I left the meeting shocked and upset and went to prominent Jewish writers I knew at the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Village Voice and told them what had happened. They wrote scathing attacks on this bigoted exclusion. But, fear still won, and the exclusion continued.

Given this context, it becomes clear what an enormous difference was in evidence in this year’s New York election. The impact of Israel’s war on Gaza transformed politics. Support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel’s genocidal policies have become mainstream issues. Arabs and Muslims are welcomed. At the same time, this election shattered the myth of a monolithic Jewish vote. Despite the hysterical anti-Mamdani reaction of the Jewish establishment (more than one leader referred to him as “the enemy of the Jewish community”), the majority of young Jews supported Mamdani, along with more than one-third of all Jewish voters.

Combined, these factors demonstrate how New York City has changed, the city’s Democratic Party is changing, and the Arab American, American Muslim, and American Jewish communities are changing—all for the better. The bottom line: It’s not your daddy’s New York anymore.

Ione WellsSouth America correspondent, Santiago

Chile is perceived by many of its neighbours in the Latin American region as a safer, more stable haven.

But inside the country, that perception has unravelled as voters worried about security, immigration and crime chose José Antonio Kast to be their next president.

Kast is a hardline conservative who has praised General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former right-wing dictator whose US-backed coup ushered in 17 years of military rule marked by torture, disappearances and censorship.

To his critics, Kast's family history, including his German-born father's membership in the Nazi Party and his brother's time as a minister under Pinochet, is unsettling.

However, some of Kast's supporters openly defend Pinochet's rule, arguing that Chile was more peaceful then.

In a nod to Chile's past and to accusations levelled at other right-wing leaders in the region after they imposed military crackdowns on organised crime, the 59-year-old pledged in his first speech as president-elect that his promise to lead an ""emergency government"" would not mean ""authoritarianism"".

Sunday's election makes Chile the latest country in Latin America to decisively swing from the left to the right, following Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama.

Peru, Colombia and Brazil face pivotal elections next year.

Kast's victory places Chile within a growing bloc of conservative governments likely to align with US President Donald Trump, particularly on migration and security.

In some cases, like that of Argentina, inflation and economic crisis drove the shift. In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting.

In Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.

Kast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.

At rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.

His message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.

The government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela.

The speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.

""Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,"" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign.

He rejects critics' accusations that Kast's rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.

""What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,"" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.

He says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced ""the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security"".

Kast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.

Many voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity.

Kast's victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.

He, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an ""iron fist"" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.

But in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult.

Venezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited.

Kast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily. But this is unlikely to compel hundreds of thousands to pack up.

For irregular migrants already in Chile, the future feels uncertain.

Gabriel Funez, a Venezuelan waiter, moved to Chile four years ago, crossing the land border irregularly to escape his country's ""very, very bad economic situation"".

He has since submitted his documents to police and immigration authorities and received a temporary ID so he can pay taxes but has so far had no response to his visa request.

His salary is currently being paid into a friend's bank account. ""I'm basically a ghost here,"" he says.

While he fears deportation, his bigger concern is a rise in xenophobia, which he says has already increased.

""Kast is expressing what many Chileans want to express. He's validating it,"" he said.

He recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.

""It was uncomfortable. I'm a foreigner, and I'm hearing all those super hurtful words.""

He explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant's staff are migrants.

With migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business.

Carlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries.

He says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that ""the migrant workforce is very important"".

He explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.

""Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,"" he adds.

Expelling unregistered workers ""will impact Chile's export economy and make raw materials more expensive,"" he warns.

Mr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.

""Many of the customs they have brought haven't been compatible with Chilean customs,"" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.

Mr Kast's party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.

But for many voters, the perception of control may matter just as much as delivering results as anxiety over crime, insecurity and migration is sweeping the continent.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4ff5/live/949b2210-d9b8-11f0-b051-c9966e31459d.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:57:15.134084

However, international law imposes its own obligations to investigate potential violations of both IHRL and LOAC.
Recall that reportable incidents include incidents outside of armed conflict if the conduct would be a war crime during armed conflict.
Whether the boat strikes conducted thus far are assessed under international human rights law, the law of armed conflict, or the Department of Defense’s own policies, they have triggered an obligation on the United States to investigate them.","Operation Southern Spear, the U.S. campaign involving attacks on boats allegedly trafficking drugs from Venezuela, has so far killed 87 individuals. International law experts who have opined on the strikes overwhelmingly condemn them, on the basis that they either constitute violations of international human rights law (IHRL) or of the law of armed conflict (LOAC).

As we have previously explained, the strikes clearly violate the right to life under IHRL, which the United States is required to respect, including extraterritorially. The strikes are arbitrary deprivations of life – extrajudicial killings – because lethal force is deliberately being used against people who, in that moment, pose no immediate threat to the lives of others and who could be apprehended by non-lethal means. Even on the assumption that those killed were drug smugglers, killing them on the high seas is as unlawful as if the police started killing those suspected of dealing drugs on the streets of a U.S. city.

Because U.S. military units are organs of the State under the law of State responsibility (Articles of State Responsibility, art. 4), and because each of the strikes breaches the IHRL obligation to respect life, they constitute “internationally wrongful acts” for which the United States bears responsibility. Moreover, those involved may have committed murder in violation of the domestic criminal law of States that can exercise jurisdiction. (Murder under international criminal law is a different matter.) This includes the domestic law of the United States, as the State of nationality of the perpetrators, and potentially any States whose nationals were among the victims of the strikes.

Although this is the prevailing view among experts, widespread discussion persists over whether the strikes violate the law of armed conflict. Such discussions are counter-normative because that law applies only to actions during armed conflicts. The administration has erroneously asserted that it is involved in a non-international armed conflict with the cartels. That assertion is legally flawed (see, e.g., here, here, and here). To be clear, there is no armed conflict, and LOAC simply doesn’t apply.

Nevertheless, in light of the administration’s mistaken claims that an armed conflict is underway, international law experts have pointed out that the strikes would be unlawful even under LOAC because the individuals aboard the boats are not targetable under that law and the drugs are not military objectives. And in any event, the infamous Sept. 2 strike on the shipwrecked survivors would have been a clear violation of the LOAC prohibition on attacking those who are hors de combat, if LOAC applied (see, e.g., here and here).

Congress has begun demanding answers regarding the legality of the strikes generally, and the Sept. 2 attack specifically. We strongly support this exercise of legislative branch oversight. However, international law imposes its own obligations to investigate potential violations of both IHRL and LOAC. In this article, we explain those binding obligations. Our examination includes the source of the obligations, when they are required, and the criteria according to which they are conducted. In our view, the IHRL obligation to investigate has been triggered and, by the administration’s mischaracterization of the situation, so too would its LOAC counterpart. We close by noting that the Department of Defense’s own policies require an investigation into the operations, irrespective of whether the proper legal regime governing the strikes is IHRL or LOAC.

International Human Rights Law Investigations

State procedural duties to investigate potentially unlawful killings have long been recognized under IHRL as part of the State’s overarching positive obligation to protect the right to life. All human rights bodies take essentially the same approach to the parameters of this obligation. A useful summary can be found in the UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comment No. 36 (¶¶ 27-8 & 64), which sets out the Committee’s approach to interpreting Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the instrument’s provision on the right to life.

Similarly, an instructive summary of the European Court of Human Rights’ jurisprudence on the procedural duty to investigate can be found in its case law guide (pages 35-51) for Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the right to life.

The law of human rights bodies on the procedural duty to investigate unlawful killings is rich and varied, dealing with many different types of situations, including armed conflict. More importantly, that law is clear and unambiguous, and its overall correctness is not open to doubt.

The following principles can be distilled from this body of law.

First, the duty to investigate arises when State authorities “know or should have known of potentially unlawful deprivations of life” (General Comment 36, ¶ 27) (emphasis added). That requirement is clearly met regarding the boat strikes – the State itself is doing them. The fact that the President and the Department of Justice’s Office of the Legal Counsel (OLC) by fiat declared them to be lawful does not make them any less unlawful, let alone potentially so. That’s even more the case if the OLC relied on presidential determinations of a NIAC and other matters (as indicated by reporting), rather than engaging in independent legal assessment of those issues.

Second, investigations “must be aimed at ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice, at promoting accountability and preventing impunity, at avoiding denial of justice and at drawing necessary lessons for revising practices and policies with a view to avoiding repeated violations. Investigations should explore, inter alia, the legal responsibility of superior officials with regard to violations of the right to life committed by their subordinates.” (id.) The issue of superior responsibility, discussed below, looms especially large in these strikes in light of the Secretary of Defense’s personal involvement in them. So does the need to revise practices and policies, which Hegseth suggested never occurred after the shipwreck strike.

Third, it is not sufficient for States to investigate unlawful deprivations of life “merely through administrative or disciplinary measures, and a criminal investigation is normally required, which should lead, if enough incriminating evidence is gathered, to a criminal prosecution.” (id.) Measures short of a criminal investigation might be appropriate for personnel on the operational periphery of the strikes, but certainly not for those who played a direct role in planning, approving, or executing them.

Fourth, “[i]mmunities and amnesties provided to perpetrators of intentional killings and to their superiors, and comparable measures leading to de facto or de jure impunity, are, as a rule, incompatible with the duty to respect and ensure the right to life, and to provide victims with an effective remedy.” (id.) The presumption against immunity and amnesties is especially significant in light of President Trump’s excessive pardon practices.

Fifth, investigations “must always be independent, impartial, prompt, thorough, effective, credible and transparent .… States parties need to take, among other things, appropriate measures to establish the truth relating to the events leading to the deprivation of life, including the reasons and legal basis for targeting certain individuals and the procedures employed by State forces before, during and after the time at which the deprivation occurred.” (General Comment 36, ¶ 28).

Sixth, these duties apply even extraterritorially and in situations of armed conflict, in parallel with similar duties under LOAC, which are discussed below. For instance, this year the European Court of Human Rights found Russia responsible for failing to effectively investigate the role of its authorities in the downing of the MH17 airliner over Ukraine in 2014 (see more here). Of course, the context of an armed conflict may require some flexibility in applying criteria, such as thoroughness and effectiveness, to account for what is realistically feasible under the circumstances (General Comment 36, ¶ 64, and ECHR cases such as Al-Skeini v. UK, Jaloud v. Netherlands, Hanan v. Germany, and Georgia v. Russia No. 2, all discussed in the case law guide, page 47).

It is important to note that no extenuating circumstances would apply to an investigation into the boat strikes. Not only were those strikes not conducted in the course of an armed conflict, as we have explained, but all relevant information and evidence regarding them is in the possession of U.S. authorities. What is crucial at the moment is securing such evidence.

Taken together, these points lead to an inexorable conclusion: the United States has a positive duty under IHRL to investigate the lethal strikes against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean. That duty can be discharged only if the investigation is independent, meaning that the State organs conducting the investigation must be free from undue influence from those they are investigating. Moreover, while Congressional oversight is welcome, the positive duty can only be discharged through a criminal investigation by the armed forces or the Department of Justice, as appropriate. A perfunctory administrative investigation within the Pentagon would clearly not suffice, and any interference in the investigations would be unlawful under IHRL.

Law of Armed Conflict Investigations

As noted, it is clear that the U.S. strikes against the alleged drug traffickers are not occurring in the context of a non-international armed conflict. However, as the administration claims they are, by its logic, the United States would be bound by any obligation to conduct investigations into LOAC violations amounting to war crimes during such conflicts. Moreover, with the administration threatening to conduct operations directly against Venezuela, the obligation to investigate LOAC violations during an international armed conflict, which those operations would trigger, merits attention.

The law of armed conflict imposes a two-tiered obligation to investigate possible war crimes. The obligation derives primarily from the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. Note that since they are considered to reflect customary international law (Nuclear Weapons, para. 79), Geneva Convention obligations are binding on all States. That States shoulder a customary law obligation to investigate possible war crimes is simply beyond dispute (ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 158 and accompanying practice; UNGA Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, prin. I). Indeed, as noted in the DoD Law of War Manual (§ 18.13)

The duties to implement and enforce the law of war also imply duties to investigate reports of alleged violations of the law of war. In addition to taking measures to meet the requirements of DoD policy, commanders may also take other measures they deem appropriate to ensure appropriate investigation and reporting of alleged violations of the law of war within their command. (see also U.S. Navy/Marine Corps/Coast Guard Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, § 6.2.6).

The first tier involves the duty to investigate potential “grave breaches,” which are set forth in the Geneva Conventions (GC I, arts. 49 & 50; GC II, art. 50 & 51; GC III, arts. 129 & 130; GC IV, arts. 146 & 147; see also AP I, arts. 11 & 85). Willful killing of protected persons, which includes civilians and those who are hors de combat (like shipwrecked persons), is one of the enumerated grave breaches.

These provisions require States to pursue prosecution of those suspected of committing grave breaches by: 1) enacting domestic legislation enabling prosecution of offenders; 2) searching for those accused of violating the Conventions; and 3) either prosecuting them or turning them over to another State that is willing to do so (aut dedere aut punire). The requirement to “search” for the accused has long been interpreted as mandating an investigation into a possible grave breach to determine whether to prosecute or to turn the accused over to another State.

Importantly, the grave breaches provisions apply only during an international armed conflict, which the current situation is not, even according to the administration’s mischaracterization of the situation. However, should the United States attack Venezuela, thereby initiating an international armed conflict, these obligations would be triggered. A failure by the United States to satisfy them would constitute an internationally wrongful act.

The second tier of the investigations requirement, and of immediate relevance to the boat strikes on the administration’s own theory that a non-international armed conflict exists, is based on the obligation to “take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present convention other than the grave breaches.” It appears in the same provisions that set out the requirement for investigating grave breaches. The duty to suppress does not encompass a duty to prosecute or send an offender to another State for prosecution, but necessarily implies a duty to investigate in order to determine whether a violation has occurred, take appropriate disciplinary measures against any offender, and assess whether action can be taken to prevent further violations by others.

What is different is that the suppression obligation applies to violations of all of the Conventions’ rules, including Common Article 3. That article, which appears verbatim in all four Conventions, prohibits “violence to life and person” directed at “persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including those placed ‘hors de combat.’” And unlike most other Geneva Convention articles, Common Article 3 sets forth fundamental rules for non-international armed conflict, violations of which have been criminalized in U.S. law (18 USC 2441(c)(3)). The resulting treaty-based duty to investigate and prosecute potential war crimes, even with respect to non-international armed conflicts, undeniably reflects customary international law (ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 158, and accompanying practice). Therefore, the consequence of the administration’s assertion that it is involved in such a conflict is, by its own flawed analysis, that the “suppression” obligation attaches not only to any violations that might occur during operations in Venezuela that trigger an international armed conflict, but also to the strikes on the boats against the cartels.

There are several non-exhaustive principles regarding such investigations that can be identified by examining these and related rules, such as Article 87 of Additional Protocol I (which does not bind the United States), and the practice of States in applying them (see Investigations Study).

First, the legal obligation under LOAC to report possible violations applies to all individuals who exercise command authority over military forces, although “[e]ffective compliance with the requirement necessitates policies extending it to any member of the armed forces with knowledge of a possible … violation” (Study, page 79).

Second, every credible allegation of a war crime must be investigated promptly. In the absence of an allegation, an investigation is required whenever there is a credible reason to suspect a violation has occurred (id.).

Third, the duty to investigate can be “satisfied by investigations at any level of command, but only so long as the investigation in question is effective in terms of uncovering relevant facts and circumstances that will permit appropriate disciplinary or punitive action to be taken” (id.).

Fourth, the investigations must be impartial and independent. This does not necessarily mean that investigators must be outside the chain of command, unlike investigative duties under IHRL, so long as their work is effective in ascertaining the facts. However, any attempt to interfere with the investigation is strictly prohibited. Moreover, commanders and other responsible officers may not order and oversee investigations into incidents involving themselves; instead, they must refer them to a higher command or a law enforcement organization. (Study, page 80, para. 10).

Fifth, in the event “clear and reliable evidence of a war crime” surfaces, States are required to prosecute those who have committed war crimes and take appropriate disciplinary or remedial measures for violations that do not amount to war crimes. (Study, page 81).

And sixth, investigations need not be conducted, as a matter of law, publicly or their findings released. That said, in many situations in which the possibility of a war crime has become public, as in this case, doing so is generally sound policy. (id.)

Given the widespread publicity over the boat attacks, especially the Sept. 2 strike on the shipwrecked survivors, as well as the extensive analysis by international law experts, there are obviously credible allegations of war crimes, assuming the administration’s framing of the situation as a non-international armed conflict is correct. Of course, it is not, as we have explained – war crimes cannot be committed in the absence of an armed conflict. But, given its position on the existence of such a conflict, the administration has no alternative but to launch a prompt, impartial, and independent investigation to comply with the LOAC requirement that applies in such conflicts.

It is crucial to bear in mind that in both international and non-international armed conflict, commanders and other superiors can be held criminally responsible for the war crimes of their subordinates if they knew, or had reason to know, that war crimes were being committed, or about to be committed, by them and failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the war crimes or to punish those responsible for crimes that had already been committed (ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 153 and accompanying practice). Ordering investigations is an effective step in prosecuting offenders and in identifying measures that need to be taken to prevent future war crimes. Based on publicly available information, the Defense Secretary’s apparent failure to change policies following the Sept. 2 double-tap strike is highly relevant in any assessment of compliance with these obligations.

Should a commander or other superior fail to order an investigation when doing so is called for in the circumstances, that individual might be subject to prosecution for the underlying war crime on the basis of command (superior) responsibility. This is true both with regard to military personnel throughout the chain of command and civilian superiors such as the Secretary of Defense (DoD Law of War Manual, § 18.23.3.2). In this regard, it merits emphasis that war crimes are subject to universal jurisdiction, that is, offenders may be prosecuted by any State, even when there is no relationship between the war crime and the State engaging in the prosecution. Additionally, commanders who fail to comply with the obligation to investigate and take other measures to suppress LOAC violations may be punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for dereliction of duty or violation of orders (§ 18.23.3.1).

Finally, we remind readers that IHRL continues to apply during armed conflict, albeit with due regard for military realities. There are none in this case that would meaningfully impede an investigation in full compliance with the aforementioned IHRL criteria. Indeed, as a matter of law, IHRL is the only appropriate framework for the investigations, unless the United States carries out the administration’s threats to take military action against Venezuela itself.

DoD Implementation of the Investigation Requirements under IHRL and LOAC

The United States has implemented the obligation to investigate in DoD Directive 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program (see also, DoD Law of War Manual, § 18.13). It provides that “[a]ll military and U.S. civilian employees, contractor personnel, and subcontractors assigned to or accompanying a DoD Component must report through their chain of command all reportable incidents” (¶ 4.1). A reportable incident is (page GL-15):

An incident that a unit commander or other responsible official determines, based on credible information, potentially involves: a war crime; other violations of the law of war; or conduct during military operations that would be a war crime if the military operations occurred in the context of an armed conflict. The unit commander or responsible official need not determine that a potential violation occurred; they need only find that credible information warrants further review of the incident. (emphasis added)

Importantly, even if an incident occurs outside armed conflict, as in these strikes, the reporting requirement still applies.

The commander of any unit who receives a report “about an alleged violation of the law of war must assess whether the allegation is based on credible information and thus constitutes a reportable incident.” (¶ 4.2). Information is credible when “a reasonable military commander would believe [it] to be sufficiently accurate to warrant further review of an alleged violation.” Note that “[t]he unit commander or responsible official need not determine a potential violation occurred, only that credible information merits further review of the incident.” Among the examples of “incidents that must be reported,” the U.S. Navy’s Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations includes the following: “Offenses against … Survivors of Sunken Ships;” “When military interests permit, failure to search out, collect, make provision for the safety of, or to care for survivors of sunken ships;” “Attacks on individual civilians;” and proportionality violations (§ 6.3).

If a report is credible, the commander concerned has to direct a “properly scoped” assessment, investigation, inquiry, or other review that is deconflicted with any ongoing criminal investigation. Even if there is a criminal investigation, the commander would still want to determine the facts, as they may require measures to avoid repetition, such as changing the Rules of Engagement. Should no such investigation be underway, the commander is obligated to “refer information about alleged war crimes to, or request an investigation by, a responsible Defense Criminal Investigative Organization” (DoD Law of War Program, ¶ 4.2).

Even if the unit commander concludes that there is no credible information to support an allegation, that commander is nevertheless obligated to forward this determination through the chain of command to the appropriate Combatant Commander. In the case of the boat strikes and any attack on Venezuela, it would likely be the Commander of U.S. Southern Command, although the involvement of Special Operations Command complicates matters. In any event, the responsible Combatant Commander must then assess the decision and forward all reportable incidents to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and applicable Service Secretaries (¶ 4.3).

There is no question that boat strikes are reportable incidents that, based on credible information, should lead a reasonable commander to conclude there may have been a war crime, especially in light of the Navy’s own guidance on the type of incidents that qualify. If an armed conflict were underway, as the administration claims, it would raise serious questions about targeting individuals who are neither members of an organized armed group nor directly participating in the hostilities. Even if those killed in the attack were reasonably believed to be targetable in the circumstances, the prohibition on attacking those who are shipwrecked, one of the most fundamental rules in the law of naval warfare, was undeniably implicated. There are also problematic proportionality and precautions in attack issues. The intense controversy that the reports of the strike have sparked is a testament to the extent to which the entire campaign raises questions of both State responsibility for LOAC violations on the part of the United States and possible war crimes by some of those involved (see, esp. here).

Importantly, even though the strikes are not occurring during armed conflict (contrary to the administration’s claims), they still have to be reported and investigated. Recall that reportable incidents include incidents outside of armed conflict if the conduct would be a war crime during armed conflict. That is very clearly the case here. Simply put, it would be unsupportable to argue that the incident did not fall within the four corners of the “reportable incident” standard.

Concluding Thoughts

All of this leads to a relatively straightforward conclusion. Whether the boat strikes conducted thus far are assessed under international human rights law, the law of armed conflict, or the Department of Defense’s own policies, they have triggered an obligation on the United States to investigate them. That obligation is obligatory, not discretionary, and it is not satisfied by the administration’s claims to be acting lawfully or by congressional hearings. International law is clear. The boat strikes, and any questionable operations that may occur in the future, necessitate prompt, impartial, and effective investigations capable of gathering the facts and identifying those responsible. The fact that the United States controls the factual record of the incidents heightens the imperative to act promptly.

We are, however, not naïve. In the current political context, it is doubtful that across-the-board investigations into the boat strikes will occur. If any investigation is ordered, we anticipate it will be limited to the Sept. 2 second strike incident that has drawn so much attention. But this does not mean that the United States is not under a legal obligation to conduct one or more broader investigations into all of the strikes in accordance with its international obligations. The impunity resulting from a failure to do so is one we have seen at least once before – when the use of torture by U.S. officials in the “war on terror” went largely unpunished. A clear line connects that episode of impunity with the ongoing situation, in which uniformed and civilian government lawyers have no real choice but to carry out their legal and ethical duties.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The_Pentagon_January_2008-1024x585.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:57:19.494290

Iranian man says ICE detention in NM is unlawful

In U.S. legally since 2024, Hamid Ziaei was jailed in June without explanation

In 2024, Hamid Ziaei came from Iran to the U.S. and was detained.Soon after, an immigration judge said that because Ziaei would likely face persecution if he returned to Iran, he could stay here under certain conditions, and he settled into a life in San Diego, an Innovation Law Lab news release said.In a regularly scheduled check-in in June, the judge's decision was ignored, and Ziaei was held without explanation by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and taken to the Torrance County Detention Facility in New Mexico.On Monday, Dec. 15, Ziaei and legal counsel will be in federal court in Albuquerque with a habeas corpus petition asserting that he has been detained unlawfully. Tiffany Wang, a fellow attorney at Innovation Law Lab — which is representing Ziaei — said the best outcome would be an immediate decision allowing him to return to his home in California. The judge could also want more time to decide, or could consider having Ziaei deported to another country. No such country has been named, and returning him to Iran is not allowed, Wang said.""I think it's important to understand that so many people just like Hamid have been building lives in the U.S., contributing, and have been indiscriminately swept away by ICE, shipped hundreds of miles away from the communities and everything they were doing,"" Wang said. ""There are procedures that ICE must follow, and they have completely thrown those out the window. And we're fighting against that."".

As Nezer told me: “Before this year, detaining pregnant women was the rare exception, and there were safeguards.","Absorbing the news about the brutal treatment of detainees, to say nothing of the outright murder of “suspected” drug runners in the Caribbean, I think back to a conversation I had in February of this year. My interlocutor was a Trump voter who had just had a friendly encounter with an African immigrant striver – the kind who came from poverty and had started a successful business here.

I recall saying, “I hope he has his documents in order.”

The Trump voter scoffed: “They’re not going after people like him. They’re only going after the criminals.”

Eleven months later, that naive faith has been smashed. Not his – mine. I have no idea how that person feels about the Trump administration now, but when I advised in February that they were going to cast a wide net for deportations, I had no idea how bad it would be. This is not just a matter of aggressive deportation. The things that are being done by our government to our fellow human beings are monstrous.

The testimony of the Venezuelans who were deported to CECOT prison in El Salvador is harrowing. Snatched from workplaces or homes on mere suspicion of being criminals, 252 men were bundled onto planes and flown to a prison known for torture. There, courtesy of a heinous bargain between Trump and Nayib Bukele, the dictator of El Salvador, they were “trampled, kicked … forced to kneel for hours,” as well as waterboarded, forced to sleep on mesh metal bunks, shot with rubber bullets, forced into stress positions (including the “crane” in which their wrists were handcuffed behind their backs and then lifted to put pressure on the shoulders and back) and sexually assaulted. At least one attempted suicide. Their accounts are available now only because El Salvador arranged a prisoner exchange with Venezuela in July.

Copious reporting has since demonstrated that only a fraction of those deported had criminal records in the United States and most of those were for relatively minor offenses such as shoplifting, possession of drug paraphernalia or traffic violations. Only six had convictions for violent crimes.

Those enjoying what they imagine is righteous pleasure at the abuse of the “worst of the worst” might want to consider the testimony of Physicians for Human Rights or the Women’s Refugee Commission, both of which have reported on the treatment of a group that the Trump administration apparently considers a dire threat: pregnant, nursing and postpartum women.

Melanie Nezer, vice president for advocacy and external relations at the Women’s Refugee Commission, described the conditions that hundreds of these women are facing in U.S. detention centers. A woman who was four months pregnant and experiencing bleeding had not been seen by a doctor for months. Another had a miscarriage and was deported while still bleeding.

Nezer described pregnant women being forced into overcrowded detention facilities with inadequate sanitary facilities, only frozen burritos or potato chips to eat, lack of clean drinking water (except by purchase) and no medical care or medicines. Some pregnant women were sleeping on concrete floors. A woman who was four months pregnant was denied medication for gestational diabetes.

Among these dangerous criminals that the Trump administration is devoting huge resources to detaining and deporting were a mother arrested as she was on her way to pick up her special-needs child from school, a mother separated from her 2-month-old baby, the mother of a 5-year-old whose husband is a U.S. citizen and hundreds of others (though exact numbers are impossible to obtain due to government noncooperation). Among those Nezer interviewed in Honduras were housecleaners, restaurant workers and stay-at-home moms. All of them were working, and quite a few had open asylum cases pending.

As Nezer told me: “Before this year, detaining pregnant women was the rare exception, and there were safeguards. Now it happens all the time and conditions are beyond inhumane.”

This comes after Ramsey County Attorney John Choi requested an opinion to clarify if Minnesota sheriffs are allowed to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE and if those agreements permit local police officers to detain anyone who would otherwise be released from custody without a civil detainer from ICE.

The opinion highlights that sheriffs can enter contracts for police services with towns and cities, but not with the federal government. This distinction indicates that the omission of federal contracts is intentional, according to AG Ellison's opinion.

The opinion also clarifies that 287(g) agreements do not authorize Minnesota law enforcement to detain individuals solely based on ICE detainers. Officers must comply with state arrest laws.

""After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Ethiopia no longer continues to meet the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a notice posted in the Federal Register.

Temporary Protected Status is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. It provides eligible migrants with work authorisation and temporary protection from deportation.

The program was created in 1991, and under Biden, it was extended to cover about 600,000 Venezuelans and 521,000 Haitians. Noem reversed the extensions in February, saying they were no longer justified.

In recent months, the administration has removed the protective status for migrants from numerous countries, including Haiti, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela. In November, Trump announced the termination of protection for Somalis in Minnesota.

Trump has made controlling immigration a central plank of his second White House term. Cancelling TPS protections is a boost to the administration's campaign to deport millions of people.

The cancellations have been challenged in court.

The Supreme Court in October cleared the way for the administration to revoke TPS for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the United States, granting a request to put on hold a federal judge's ruling that Noem lacked the authority to terminate the status while litigation proceeds.

The Homeland Security department also said on Friday it was no longer processing legacy cases under the Cuban and Haitian family reunification parole program, according to a post in the Federal Register.

The Department of Politics and International Relations sponsored a conversation about ICE tactics and the Trump administration’s immigration policies on Dec. 3. The discussion was moderated by department chair Michael McKoy. About 300 people attended.

Director of Wheaton’s Center for Faith, Politics and Economics David Iglesias ‘80, and Vice President of Advocacy and Policy at World Relief Matthew Soerens ‘06 participated in the conversation. Both speakers are Wheaton graduates.

“We hold this event with a certain amount of trembling,” McKoy said before the conversation began. The event follows a discussion panel in late November about the immigration crackdown.

McKoy acknowledged that the topic of ICE is controversial, even on Wheaton’s campus, and said that the goal of the discussion was shalom, “a wholesome, righteous and just peace.”

On Oct. 12, Wheaton students organized a prayer and worship service in front of Broadview ICE Processing Facility as a form of protesting ICE in Chicagoland. Many students have been involved with off-campus anti-ICE efforts.

Soerens and Iglesias began by sharing their experiences with immigration.

Iglesias served in the Navy from 1985 to 1988 and from 2008 to 2014. He also served as team leader, prosecutor and spokesman for the U.S. Military Commissions, dealing with war crimes and terrorism cases. He was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico from 2001 to 2007.

Soerens interned for World Relief during college, and has worked for them the past 20 years. He received his masters in international public service from DePaul University in 2010. He has previously taught for the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton and has co-authored three books about refugees and the immigration system.

After making introductions, the pair moved on to the topic of immigration policy changes under Trump’s administration.

Soerens said that last year ICE’s budget was between $3 billion and $4 billion. This year, as a result of the “Big Beautiful Bill”, the budget is now $170 billion. He added that the funding was drawn from various government programs, including the Transportation Security Administration.

Iglesias focused on how every administration has to implement immigration reform.

“I think there has been a crisis for a long time,” he said. “The crisis is that we don’t have a system that works.” Iglesias framed this crisis as a bipartisan problem that both the Obama and Bush administrations failed to solve. He asked the audience to suspend judgement on the policies of the current administration.

“Just give it a chance,” Iglesias said. “Just wait — if Trump’s right, you could see some real world changes.”

He was particularly weary of media coverage comparing the Trump administration to the Nazis.

“We’re not living in a new Nazi age, we are trying to fix problems that have been unresolved for decades,” Iglesias said.

Soerens discussed some possible solutions to the decades-long immigration crisis that Iglesias referred to. He said there should be an easier pathway for undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. to become legal citizens, barring any criminal convictions. This solution has been proposed in Congress as the Dignity Act, which has been gaining bipartisan support in Congress recently.

This proposal intrigued sophomore international relations major Katherine McCulloch, who said that Soerens offered “a solution I hadn’t heard before.”

Throughout the conversation, Iglesias expressed concern about whether the U.S. has the capacity to accommodate the number of people hoping to immigrate. He cited a poll taken in Mexico showing that most Mexican citizens would choose to live in the U.S. According to Iglesias, the U.S. does not have enough infrastructure, vehicles or food to support 100 million immigrants.

Soerens said he is more concerned about population decline than overpopulation, particularly given that the U.S. fertility rate hit an all-time low in 2024. While Iglesias emphasized the need for immigration limits, Soerens emphasized that immigrants are crucial for the U.S. economy’s well-being.

Junior urban studies student Anya Miller, who admitted that she had walked into the event with a bias toward a particular side, remarked that the discussion was more “civil” than she expected — reflecting the goals McKoy outlined at the beginning of the event.

“Shalom requires the courage to have difficult conversations, and that is why we are here tonight,” McKoy said.",https://thewheatonrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unknown.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 22:57:21.253359

“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” said Joseph Rupnick, chairman of the Tribal Council. “We were placed here because we were treated as prisoners of war. So we must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and trauma once done to our people.”

A company affiliated with the tribe’s business arm signed a year-long, $29.9 million contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Nov. 29. The contract requested the recipient, KPB Services, which is affiliated with Prairie Band LLC, design warehouse structures on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees, according to a public federal contract database. Before KPB Services signed the contract, the federal government upped the dollar amount.

The Tribal Council fired members of Prairie Band LLC’s leadership Tuesday after Topeka TV station KSNT made news of the contract public the day before.

Rupnick, in a nearly 3-minute video address, said the tribe is “working on canceling this contract and fully disassociating the nation from it.”

He said the tribe risks losing future government contract awards in its efforts to extract itself from this one, but he said the tribe’s values must come first.

“I am sick to my stomach and frankly heartbroken that members of our nation put economic development — though it is sorely needed — above our moral obligations to other persecuted people,” Rupnick said.

The Tribe owns Prairie Band LLC, and Rupnick said it was created to secure employment and economic opportunities, “but it is also why we cannot compromise our values and seek to profit off the backs of our brothers and sisters in struggle.”

The second Trump administration has targeted immigrants, sometimes regardless of citizenship status or criminal history, detaining more than 65,000 people as of Nov. 16, according to ICE data analyzed by TRAC, a nonprofit data research project. Most of those people, nearly 48,000 did not have a criminal conviction.

Kansas has three facilities that house detainees and the potential for one more. Authorities at the Chase County jail in Cottonwood Falls, the Finney County jail in Garden City and the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth detain a combined average of 175 people on a given day.

“Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by ICE agents,” Omar, who said her son was born in the U.S., told WCCO-TV of the Twin Cities in an interview Sunday. “Once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go.”

Omar, who immigrated to the U.S. when she was 12 after having fled Somalia’s civil war, also accused ICE of “racially profiling” her community.

“They are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented,” she said.

About 80,000 people of Somali descent live in Minnesota.

Representatives for ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and Omar’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An administration official previously told NBC News that ICE was not specifically targeting Somali immigrants.

Omar’s on-air remarks came after she sent a letter to DHS on Friday about this month’s immigration operations in her state while signing onto another letter to DHS with other Democratic lawmakers the same day requesting answers about President Donald Trump’s pledge last month to “immediately” end temporary legal protections for Somalis living in Minnesota. The administration has taken steps to end similar protections for Haitians, Afghans and Venezuelans living in the U.S.

Trump has repeatedly disparaged Omar, Somalia and Somali immigrants.

“We always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right?” Trump told a crowd of supporters last week in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. “Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”

The Michigan Supreme Court’s order in Michigan Immigrant Rights Center v. Governor, decided December 12, 2025, is formally modest: the Court denied leave to appeal from an unpublished Court of Appeals decision. No new binding majority rule is announced. Yet the case is doctrinally important because two detailed dissents, by Justice Welch and Justice Thomas (joined by Chief Justice Cavanagh), crystallize competing approaches to three interlocking questions:

Does the Court of Claims Act’s one-year notice provision, MCL 600.6431, apply to actions seeking purely prospective relief (injunctions/declarations aimed at future harms)?

Does that notice provision apply to suits against state officers (e.g., the Governor) in their official capacity?

How does Michigan’s doctrine of sovereign immunity interact with the enforcement of federal and state constitutional rights, especially under the federal Ex parte Young framework for prospective relief?

The underlying dispute concerns access to workers’ compensation benefits for undocumented workers in Michigan, and whether a policy of denying such benefits violates due process under the United States and Michigan Constitutions. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC), a nonprofit legal organization, sued Governor Gretchen Whitmer in her official capacity, seeking only prospective declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the continued enforcement of the allegedly unlawful policy.

The Court of Appeals held that MIRC’s action was barred because MIRC failed to comply with the Court of Claims Act’s one-year notice requirement. The Michigan Supreme Court declined to review that ruling. Justice Welch and Justice Thomas, however, would have granted leave and reversed, articulating significant legal principles about:

the temporal reach of notice and limitations provisions, and

the ability of private parties to seek prospective constitutional relief against state officials despite sovereign immunity and statutory procedural barriers.

This commentary analyzes those dissents, the precedents they rely on, and the implications for constitutional litigation in Michigan.

II. Summary of the Opinion and Procedural Posture

A. The Order of the Court

The majority of the Michigan Supreme Court issued a one-paragraph order:

On order of the Court, the application is again considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.

This is a discretionary denial of leave to appeal. Under Michigan practice:

It decides nothing on the merits beyond leaving the Court of Appeals judgment in place for this case.

It has no precedential value as to the legal questions presented. See Haksluoto v Mt Clemens Regional Med Ctr, 500 Mich 304, 314 n 3 (2017).

B. The Court of Appeals’ Decision (Unpublished)

The Court of Appeals:

Assumed, without deciding, that MIRC had standing and that there was an “actual controversy.”

Held that MCL 600.6431, the Court of Claims Act (COCA) notice provision, applies to all claims against the state unless expressly exempted, citing Christie v Wayne State Univ, 511 Mich 39 (2023).

Applied general accrual principles (a claim “accrues” when suit may first be brought), relying on AFSCME v Highland Park Bd of Ed, 457 Mich 74, 90 (1998).

Concluded that MIRC’s claim accrued no later than 2019 (when it hired additional staff in response to the alleged policy), but MIRC did not file its complaint or a notice of intent to sue within one year of that date.

Ordered dismissal under MCR 2.116(C)(7) (claim barred by statute or immunity) for failure to comply with MCL 600.6431.

Because the Supreme Court denied leave, that unpublished Court of Appeals opinion governs this particular case but is not binding precedent on other panels, see MCR 7.215(C)(1).

C. The Dissents

Two justices filed separate, substantial dissents from the denial of leave:

Justice Welch focused on the temporal scope of the COCA notice provision, arguing that it cannot apply to claims seeking purely prospective relief to prevent future harm.

Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Cavanagh, focused on sovereign immunity, statutory text, and constitutional structure. He argued:

Textually, MCL 600.6431 does not apply to suits against “officers,” even though the COCA’s jurisdictional provision does.

As a matter of federal law, under Ex parte Young, state officials lack immunity to prospective federal constitutional claims; state-created notice conditions premised on sovereign immunity cannot bar such suits.

As a matter of state constitutional law, a parallel principle should apply to claims under the Michigan Constitution, limiting the Legislature’s ability to insulate state officers from prospective relief for ongoing constitutional violations.

Both dissents would have granted leave and allowed MIRC’s claims for prospective relief to proceed, rejecting the Court of Appeals’ application of the COCA notice provision.

III. Factual and Legal Background

A. The Parties and Underlying Dispute

Plaintiff: Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC), a nonprofit providing legal resources to immigrants in Michigan.

Defendant: Governor Gretchen Whitmer, sued in her official capacity.

Beginning in 2017, MIRC’s farmworker and immigrant rights program received numerous calls from undocumented workers alleging they had been denied workers’ compensation benefits because of their immigration status. MIRC alleges:

The denial of benefits systematically affected undocumented workers injured on the job.

This denial strained MIRC’s resources, leading it to hire additional staff in 2019.

B. The Legal Basis: Sanchez v Eagle Alloy and the Workers’ Compensation Statute

The controversy is rooted in:

MCL 418.361(1), which includes a provision that workers’ compensation benefits are unavailable “whenever commission of a ‘crime’ prevents the person from obtaining or performing work.”

Sanchez v Eagle Alloy, Inc, 254 Mich App 651 (2003), where the Court of Appeals held that:

Using false documents to obtain employment is a “crime” for purposes of this statute.

Therefore, injured workers who obtained employment through such means could be denied workers’ compensation benefits.

MIRC contends that, in practice, this interpretation (or policy derived from it) has been applied to deny benefits to undocumented workers as a class, in violation of due process.

C. Relief Sought by MIRC

MIRC sought only prospective, non-monetary relief

A declaratory judgment that the “commission of a crime” language in MCL 418.361(1) is unconstitutional and unenforceable;

A declaration that Sanchez wrongly held that working while undocumented is itself a crime (or that using false documents in this context should not be treated as barring benefits); and/or

A declaration that subsequent Michigan Supreme Court precedent has significantly limited or undermined Sanchez.

Crucially:

MIRC did not seek damages for past denials of benefits.

It asked the court only to prohibit enforcement of the challenged policy going forward.

D. The COCA Notice Provision at Issue

MCL 600.6431(1) provides:

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a claim may not be maintained against this state unless the claimant, within 1 year after the claim has accrued, files in the office of the clerk of the court of claims either a written claim or a written notice of intention to file a claim against this state or any of its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms, or agencies.

MCL 600.6431(2) further requires that the notice specify:

“the time when and the place where the claim arose,”

“a detailed statement of the nature of the claim and of the items of damage alleged or claimed to have been sustained,” and

a verified signature.

The central dispute is whether these requirements make sense—or can even logically be satisfied—when the plaintiff:

is suing for future harm that has not yet occurred, and

seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief (no damages).

IV. Detailed Analysis

A. Justice Welch’s Dissent: Notice Provisions Do Not Apply to Purely Prospective Relief

1. Core Principle

Justice Welch argues that Michigan law already recognizes a fundamental distinction between:

Retroactive relief (e.g., damages, refunds of money already paid), and

Prospective relief (e.g., injunctions or declarations to prevent future unlawful conduct).

Her central legal claim: Notice and limitations provisions govern claims for retroactive relief but do not bar suits seeking to prevent future harms.

2. Reliance on Taxpayers Allied for Constitutional Taxation v Wayne Co

Justice Welch’s primary precedent is Taxpayers Allied for Constitutional Taxation v Wayne Co, 450 Mich 119 (1995).

In Taxpayers Allied:

Wayne County had adopted a tax increase in 1981.

In 1991, taxpayers sued, seeking:

a declaration that the tax increase was invalid,

an injunction against future assessment and collection of the increased tax, and

a refund of taxes already paid.

Lower courts dismissed on statute-of-limitations grounds.

The Michigan Supreme Court reversed in part, drawing a sharp temporal distinction:

For refunds (retroactive money relief), the claims accrued when taxes became due; the statute of limitations barred refunds for taxes due more than one year before suit.

For prospective injunctive relief, the statute of limitations could not bar a taxpayer from seeking to enjoin the future imposition of unconstitutional taxes:

“[A] suit for injunctive relief may seek to prevent a future wrong, [so] the cause of action necessarily arises before the wrong occurs.” 450 Mich at 127.

But Michigan’s accrual statute, MCL 600.5827, provides that “the claim accrues at the time the wrong upon which the claim is based was done regardless of the time when the damage results.” The Court reconciled these rules by holding that:

Limitations periods apply to claims for retroactive monetary relief.

They do not bar otherwise valid claims for prospective injunctive relief directed at future wrongs.

Declaratory relief follows the same pattern: if it is essentially retroactive (e.g., a declaration that money must be refunded), it is subject to limitations; if it is derivative of a non-time-barred prospective injunctive claim, it is not barred. See 450 Mich at 128–129.

Justice Welch imports this structure directly into the COCA context. She treats the COCA notice provision as a functional analog to a statute of limitations, citing Christie and Fairley, which view notice as a condition precedent to the state’s waiver of sovereign immunity.

3. Application to MIRC’s Suit

Applying Taxpayers Allied, Justice Welch reasons:

If MIRC had sought money damages or compensation for past economic harms (e.g., costs incurred in 2017–2019 because of the policy), those claims would have accrued when the past wrongs occurred and would be subject to the one-year notice requirement; failure to comply would bar retroactive relief.

But MIRC seeks only prospective declaratory relief—to stop continued enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional policy. For that category of relief, under Taxpayers Allied, the notice/limitations framework should not apply.

She thus would hold that:

“The COCA’s notice provision does not prevent MIRC from seeking declaratory relief for harm that has not yet happened.” (Welch, J., dissenting, p 4)

4. Textual Argument: Logical Impossibility of Noticing Future Harm

Justice Welch also reads the text of MCL 600.6431(2) as implicitly oriented toward past harm:

The notice must contain a “statement of the time when and the place where the claim arose” and “items of damage alleged or claimed to have been sustained.”

Those requirements presuppose that a discrete wrong has already occurred and that concrete damages have already been sustained.

In her view, it is impossible to satisfy these terms for a claim aimed at a future wrong:

There is no specific “time” when the claim “arose” if the wrong has not yet occurred.

There are no “items of damage” yet sustained.

This textual point dovetails with Taxpayers Allied: both emphasize that standard limitations and accrual concepts do not fit neatly with claims designed to prevent future violations.

5. Purpose-Based Argument: Notice’s Rationales Don’t Fit Prospective Relief

Justice Welch invokes the purpose of the COCA notice requirement, as explained in Christie v Wayne State Univ, 511 Mich 39 (2023), and Fairley v Dep’t of Corrections, 497 Mich 290 (2015):

To ensure the proper state entity learns of a potential claim;

To allow timely investigation and discovery;

To allow the state to create fiscal reserves to cover potential liability.

She reasons that these goals are ill-suited to purely prospective constitutional claims:

There is no danger of stale evidence when the alleged wrong is an ongoing policy and no past damages are being adjudicated.

There is no need to set aside funds for damages if no monetary relief is sought.

Thus, applying the notice requirement to such suits neither fits the text nor advances the statute’s purposes; instead, it would “truncate the plaintiff’s legitimate claim to prospective relief”, contrary to Taxpayers Allied.

6. Welch’s Bottom Line

Justice Welch concludes:

Statutes of limitation and notice provisions apply to declaratory or injunctive claims that are functionally retroactive.

They do not apply to declaratory or injunctive actions that seek to prevent future harms arising from ongoing government policies.

The Court of Appeals therefore erred in treating MIRC’s prospective declaratory action as accruing in 2019 and subject to MCL 600.6431’s one-year notice requirement.

She would have granted leave and reversed, allowing MIRC’s prospective challenge to proceed on the merits.

B. Justice Thomas’s Dissent: Sovereign Immunity, State Officers, and Ex parte Young

1. Statutory Text: Notice Applies to the State and Its Entities, Not to Officers

Justice Thomas begins with a close reading of the COCA:

Jurisdictional provision – MCL 600.6419(1)(a) gives the Court of Claims jurisdiction:

“[t]o hear and determine . . . any demand for monetary, equitable, or declaratory relief or any demand for an extraordinary writ against the state or any of its departments or officers . . . .” (emphasis added)

Notice provision – MCL 600.6431(1) bars maintenance of a claim “against this state” unless a written claim or notice is filed “against this state or any of its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms, or agencies” within one year.

Key observation: The jurisdictional provision expressly includes suits against officers, but the notice provision does not mention “officers” at all.

Applying standard canons of statutory interpretation (context, avoidance of surplusage, reading provisions harmoniously), Justice Thomas concludes:

The Legislature knew how to include officers when it wished to; it did so in MCL 600.6419.

Its omission of “officers” in MCL 600.6431(1), while still listing the state, departments, commissions, boards, etc., indicates an intent that the notice requirement not apply to suits against individual state officers.

He finds support in Pike v Northern Mich Univ, 327 Mich App 683 (2019), where the Court of Appeals distinguished suits against state employees from those against the state itself and noted the absence of any reference to officers in MCL 600.6431.

Thus, purely as a matter of statutory construction, Justice Thomas would hold that:

MCL 600.6431 does not govern constitutional claims seeking prospective relief against state officers in their official capacities.

2. Constitutional Avoidance and Legislative Awareness

Justice Thomas notes:

Michigan courts assume the Legislature legislates against the background of existing common law and constitutional doctrines.

By the time of the relevant COCA enactments, the Ex parte Young doctrine, allowing suits against state officers for ongoing constitutional violations, was well established and recognized.

Michigan itself had acknowledged such suits in cases like Thompson v Auditor General, 261 Mich 624 (1933).

Against that background, he reads the statutory omission of “officers” from the notice provision as a conscious decision to avoid conflict with the longstanding rule that officials lack immunity from prospective constitutional claims.

He also invokes the doctrine of constitutional avoidance: where a case can be resolved on statutory grounds without reaching constitutional questions (e.g., about the Legislature’s power to insulate officers from constitutional accountability), courts should prefer that route.

3. Federal Law: Ex parte Young and Federal Due Process Claims in State Court

Justice Thomas then examines the federal law of sovereign immunity in the context of:

federal constitutional claims,

against state officials,

seeking prospective relief.

Under Ex parte Young, 209 US 123 (1908), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a state official enforcing an unconstitutional law:

“comes into conflict with the superior authority of [the Federal] Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.” 209 US at 159–160.

This fiction allows courts to grant prospective relief against state officials in their official capacity, despite state sovereign immunity, so long as:

the plaintiff alleges an ongoing violation of federal law, and

the relief sought is prospective (injunctive or declaratory), not retroactive monetary damages. See, e.g., Va Office for Protection & Advocacy v Stewart, 563 US 247, 255 (2011); Edelman v Jordan, 415 US 651 (1974).

Justice Thomas emphasizes:

This doctrine applies in state courts as well as federal courts. See Alden v Maine, 527 US 706, 747 (1999); Gen Oil Co v Crain, 209 US 211 (1908).

Michigan recognized this over 90 years ago in Thompson v Auditor General, which endorsed allowing mandamus or injunction against state officers for federal constitutional violations in state courts.

MIRC’s federal due process claims, as described by Justice Thomas, fall squarely within Ex parte Young:

MIRC alleges an ongoing violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by the continued enforcement of a policy denying workers’ compensation to undocumented workers.

It seeks only prospective declaratory and injunctive relief, no damages.

From this, Justice Thomas draws a key conclusion:

Because Ex parte Young recognizes that officials lack sovereign immunity to federal constitutional suits for prospective relief, such suits do not depend on the state’s waiver of immunity and thus cannot be conditioned on compliance with state-law notice provisions that derive from that waiver.

In other words, for federal due process claims:

MIRC does not need the benefit of the state’s waiver of immunity.

The COCA notice provision—an expression of conditions on that waiver—simply does not apply.

4. State Constitutional Claims: Extending the Ex parte Young-Type Principle

Justice Thomas then turns to state law: should a similar principle apply when plaintiffs allege ongoing violations of the Michigan Constitution by state officers?

He begins from Michigan’s own constitutional structure:

The Michigan Constitution of 1963 is a limitation on government power, not a grant.

The people are the sovereign; the branches of government, including the Legislature, are creatures of the Constitution.

The courts have a special role in vindicating constitutional rights, as recognized in decisions like:

Bauserman v Unemployment Ins Agency, 509 Mich 673 (2022),

Mays v Governor, 506 Mich 157 (2020), and

Sharp v Lansing, 464 Mich 792 (2001).

In Smith v Dep’t of Pub Health, 428 Mich 540 (1987), a fractured Court nonetheless agreed that sovereign immunity is “not available” in state court to bar constitutional tort claims alleging that the state, by custom or policy, violated rights conferred by the Michigan Constitution. That case concerned damages, not prospective relief, and lacked a single majority rationale, but it stands for the idea that:

The Legislature cannot use immunity doctrines to leave state constitutional rights effectively without a remedy.

Justice Thomas reads these cases, together with Bauserman, as reinforcing a core principle: rights require remedies. The Legislature cannot, by statute, license constitutional violations or wholly remove judicial remedies for ongoing constitutional harms:

“[T]he Legislature cannot grant a license to state and local government actors to violate the Michigan Constitution.” – Sharp v Lansing, 464 Mich at 810.

“Those choices are contained within the Constitution.” – Bauserman, 509 Mich at 704.

From this, he suggests that Michigan should adopt, at least by analogy, the core insight of Ex parte Young for state constitutional claims:

When a state officer enforces a policy that violates the Michigan Constitution, that official acts beyond constitutional authority.

Such conduct cannot be shielded by state sovereign immunity, because immunity is itself subordinate to the Constitution.

Therefore, state officers cannot assert sovereign immunity against suits for prospective relief that seek to halt ongoing violations of the Michigan Constitution.

He also observes that COCA’s structure—jurisdiction over suits against “officers” but no notice requirement applied to them—aligns with this understanding.

5. Thomas’s Bottom Line

Justice Thomas’s conclusions can be summarized as:

Statutory holding (preferred): By its own terms, MCL 600.6431 applies only to suits against “the state” and its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms, or agencies, not to suits against “officers.” Therefore, the notice provision does not bar MIRC’s suit against the Governor in her official capacity.

Federal constitutional overlay: Even if the Legislature had intended MCL 600.6431 to apply to such suits, it could not bar MIRC’s federal due process claim, because under Ex parte Young the Governor lacks immunity to suits seeking prospective relief for ongoing violations of federal law.

State constitutional structure: A similar principle should apply to state due process claims; the Legislature cannot immunize officers from suits that seek prospective relief against ongoing violations of the Michigan Constitution.

He thus would have granted leave, clarified the law of sovereign immunity and COCA’s reach, and allowed MIRC’s prospective constitutional claims to be heard on the merits.

C. Precedents and Doctrinal Threads

The dissents collectively invoke several doctrinal strands worth unpacking.

1. Christie v Wayne State Univ and the Scope of COCA Notice

In Christie, 511 Mich 39 (2023), the Court:

Reaffirmed that the COCA is “this state's controlling legislative expression of waiver of the state's sovereign immunity,” quoting Greenfield Constr Co v Dep't of State Hwys, 402 Mich 172 (1978).

Held that compliance with MCL 600.6431 is mandatory for claims within the Court of Claims’ jurisdiction.

Interpreted the notice requirement broadly and strictly as a condition precedent to suit.

The Court of Appeals, in MIRC’s case, relied on Christie to support a sweeping view: the notice requirement applies to “all claims” against the state unless a specific statutory exemption appears.

Justice Welch does not dispute Christie’s general characterization of MCL 600.6431 but argues that Taxpayers Allied shows how limitations/notice regimes function differently when the relief sought is entirely prospective. Justice Thomas, by contrast, narrows the scope of “claims” subject to MCL 600.6431 by focusing on the entities it names (state, departments, etc.) and the omission of “officers.” Both approaches seek to harmonize Christie with long-standing doctrines ensuring judicial review of ongoing unlawful governmental action.

2. Taxpayers Allied, AFSCME, and Accrual

The Court of Appeals’ reliance on general accrual principles from AFSCME v Highland Park Bd of Ed (claim accrues when suit may be brought) clashes, in the dissents’ view, with the nuanced approach in Taxpayers Allied:

AFSCME sets a default rule; Taxpayers Allied recognizes that where the relief is to prevent a future wrong, “the cause of action necessarily arises before the wrong occurs,” and the statute of limitations “does not prevent” such a taxpayer from seeking an injunction.

Justice Welch extends this logic to the COCA notice provision, treating it as analogous to a limitations bar for purposes of temporal reach.

3. Ex parte Young, Alden v Maine, and Federal Law in State Courts

Ex parte Young and its progeny establish that:

State sovereign immunity (including Eleventh Amendment immunity in federal court) does not bar suits against state officials for ongoing violations of federal law seeking prospective relief.

This principle governs in both federal and state courts. Alden v Maine clarified that states retain sovereign immunity in their own courts, but that does not undermine the viability of Ex parte Young-type suits against officials.

Justice Thomas stresses that Michigan courts must apply United States Supreme Court precedent on federal questions, citing Abela v Gen Motors Corp, 469 Mich 603 (2004). Thus, Michigan courts must permit Ex parte Young-style actions. A state-law notice provision tied to waiver of sovereign immunity cannot undercut that federal command.

4. Smith, Bauserman, Mays, and State Constitutional Remedies

Smith v Dep’t of Pub Health recognized that plaintiffs can bring direct state constitutional claims (so-called “constitutional torts”) for damages against the state where no adequate alternative remedy exists. While fractured, it commonly rejected broad sovereign immunity from such claims. Later:

Mays v Governor (Flint water crisis) reaffirmed the judiciary’s central role in enforcing constitutional limitations on government.

Bauserman v Unemployment Ins Agency emphasized that rights in the Michigan Constitution require judicially enforceable remedies unless the Constitution itself says otherwise.

Justice Thomas reads these cases as supporting a robust remedial principle: the Legislature may regulate remedies, but it may not functionally nullify state constitutional rights by insulating ongoing violations from judicial scrutiny through procedural conditions tied to sovereign immunity.

D. Impact and Future Ramifications

1. No Immediate Precedent, But Strong Signals

Because:

The Supreme Court denied leave without opinion; and

The Court of Appeals’ decision is unpublished and thus nonbinding;

there is no binding new rule on:

whether MCL 600.6431 applies to suits seeking purely prospective relief, or

whether it applies to suits against officers in their official capacities.

However, the detailed dissents:

Offer a roadmap for future litigants and lower courts.

Set out two analytically distinct, but converging, paths to allowing prospective constitutional challenges to proceed:

The temporal distinction between prospective and retroactive relief (Taxpayers Allied/Welch).

The entity-based and sovereign-immunity-based distinction between claims against the state itself and claims against officers (Ex parte Young/Thomas).

2. Practical Litigation Strategy

For plaintiffs challenging ongoing state policies as unconstitutional, these dissents suggest several strategic considerations:

Pleaded defendant: Suing the relevant state officer in an official capacity rather than the “state” or a “department” may better align with Justice Thomas’s statutory reading (that “officers” are not subject to MCL 600.6431).

Type of relief: Framing the suit as seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, without damages or retroactive relief, strengthens the argument under Justice Welch’s Taxpayers Allied-based approach.

Federal vs state claims: Including federal constitutional claims, especially under the Fourteenth Amendment, invokes Ex parte Young directly and may foreclose reliance on state-law notice provisions as bars to suit.

Conversely, the state may:

Continue to argue, based on Christie and an expansive reading of COCA, that notice is a condition for all claims within the Court of Claims’ jurisdiction, including those styled as prospective constitutional challenges.

Distinguish Taxpayers Allied as concerning ordinary statutes of limitations, not an immunity-based notice condition.

3. Doctrinal Development: Open Questions

The dissents highlight several unresolved questions likely to return to the Court:

Scope of MCL 600.6431: Does the notice provision apply to:

All claims over which the Court of Claims has jurisdiction, regardless of the named defendant?

Only claims in which the state or its enumerated entities (departments, boards, etc.) are defendants?

Accrual for prospective relief: How should “accrual” be understood for claims that seek to prevent future harms from ongoing government policies?

State constitutional Ex parte Young analogue: Will the Court expressly adopt a doctrine that state officers are stripped of immunity when they enforce policies that violate the Michigan Constitution, at least as to suits seeking prospective relief?

Interaction with federal remedies: How will Michigan courts harmonize COCA, Ex parte Young, and state court jurisdiction over federal constitutional claims, especially in light of cases where plaintiffs could alternatively sue in federal court?

4. Substantive Policy Stakes

Though the Supreme Court did not reach them, the case’s substantive stakes are significant:

Access of undocumented workers to workers’ compensation benefits, and the interpretation of MCL 418.361(1) and Sanchez, affect workplace safety and economic security in sectors like agriculture and food processing.

Nonprofits like MIRC, which bear the brunt of counseling and representing affected workers, seek clarity on whether systemic denial of benefits can be challenged as unconstitutional policy.

Procedural bars like notice provisions can have the practical effect of insulating contested policies from judicial review, even when substantive constitutional issues are weighty.

The dissents underscore that, for rights to be meaningful, there must be a viable procedural path to raise such constitutional challenges, particularly in the face of ongoing statewide policies.

V. Key Concepts Simplified

1. Sovereign Immunity vs. Governmental Immunity

Sovereign immunity refers to the state’s immunity from being sued without its consent. In Michigan, this applies to the state and its departments and is governed by statutes like the COCA.

Governmental immunity typically refers to immunity for local governments (cities, counties, school districts), governed by the governmental tort liability act (GTLA), MCL 691.1401 et seq.

They are related but distinct doctrines. This case primarily concerns sovereign immunity.

2. Court of Claims and the COCA Notice Provision

The Court of Claims is a specialized Michigan court with jurisdiction over claims against the state and its officers for money, equitable, and declaratory relief.

The COCA notice provision (MCL 600.6431) requires that, within one year after a claim “accrues,” a claimant must file either:

a written claim, or

a written notice of intent to file a claim,

containing specific information about when and where the claim arose and what damages were sustained.

Failure to comply generally bars the claim because the state has conditioned its waiver of immunity on compliance with this requirement.

3. Prospective vs. Retrospective Relief

Prospective relief aims to prevent future or ongoing harm. Examples:

An injunction ordering a government official to stop enforcing an unconstitutional policy.

A declaratory judgment clarifying that a law or policy is unconstitutional going forward.

Retrospective relief addresses past harms. Examples:

Monetary damages for injuries already suffered.

Refunds of taxes or fees previously paid.

Taxpayers Allied teaches that statutes of limitations and similar temporal bars apply robustly to retrospective relief, but not to otherwise valid claims for prospective relief aimed at preventing future violations.

4. Accrual of a Claim

A claim “accrues” when:

the alleged wrongful act occurs, and

the plaintiff has a right to bring suit.

Michigan’s accrual statute, MCL 600.5827, states that a claim accrues “at the time the wrong upon which the claim is based was done regardless of the time when the damage results.” For usual damages claims, this is straightforward. For prospective relief, however, the “wrong” may be the anticipated enforcement of an ongoing policy—raising special problems that Taxpayers Allied and Justice Welch’s dissent emphasize.

5. Ex parte Young Doctrine

Ex parte Young is a century-old U.S. Supreme Court doctrine that allows individuals to sue state officials in their official capacity for ongoing violations of federal law, seeking prospective relief (injunctions, declaratory judgments). The key points:

Such suits are deemed to be against the officer, not the state, for immunity purposes.

Sovereign immunity does not bar these suits, even though the relief may indirectly affect the state treasury or policies.

The doctrine’s limits:

The violation must be ongoing, not purely in the past.

The relief must be forward-looking, not retrospective monetary damages.

Justice Thomas’s dissent argues that:

Michigan courts must honor Ex parte Young when hearing federal constitutional claims.

State procedural rules tied to sovereign immunity (like COCA notice) cannot override the federal right to bring such suits.

6. Declaratory vs. Injunctive Relief

Declaratory relief – A court declaration that a law or policy is (un)constitutional or that certain rights exist. It does not by itself order anyone to do or stop anything but often forms the basis for further relief.

Injunctive relief – A court order compelling or prohibiting specific conduct (e.g., “Governor X is enjoined from enforcing Policy Y”). Violating an injunction can lead to contempt sanctions.

In practice, declaratory and injunctive relief often travel together in constitutional litigation, and the temporal analysis (prospective vs. retrospective) usually follows the character of the underlying substantive claim, as highlighted in Taxpayers Allied.

VI. Conclusion

Michigan Immigrant Rights Center v. Governor leaves the Court of Appeals’ unpublished dismissal of MIRC’s suit in place, but the Michigan Supreme Court’s order creates no binding precedent on the reach of the Court of Claims Act’s notice provision. The real significance of the case lies in the dissents.

Justice Welch articulates a clear doctrinal framework: notice and limitations regimes govern retroactive relief, not purely prospective efforts to halt future harms. Relying on Taxpayers Allied, she argues that applying MCL 600.6431 to MIRC’s prospective declaratory action misreads both the text and purpose of the statute and unjustifiably truncates legitimate constitutional claims.

Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Cavanagh, advances a complementary but distinct analysis: COCA’s notice provision, by its terms, does not apply to suits against “officers”. Even if it did, the federal Ex parte Young doctrine and Michigan’s own constitutional structure prevent the Legislature from insulating state officers from suits seeking prospective relief for ongoing federal and state constitutional violations.

Together, the dissents:

Reaffirm that constitutional rights—federal and state—must be paired with effective remedies, especially in the face of ongoing official policies;

Highlight significant unresolved questions about the interaction between COCA, sovereign immunity, and constitutional enforcement; and

Provide a detailed intellectual blueprint for future challenges, both statutory and constitutional, to overly broad applications of procedural bars in constitutional litigation.

Although not yet the law of Michigan, these dissenting opinions are likely to influence future cases. They delineate two powerful, interlocking principles:

Prospective constitutional relief should not be foreclosed by limitations or notice rules designed for retrospective damages claims; and

State officers cannot hide behind sovereign immunity or statutory notice barriers when asked to answer for ongoing violations of superior constitutional law.

If and when the Michigan Supreme Court revisits these issues in a precedential opinion, Michigan Immigrant Rights Center v. Governor will stand as a key precursor, marking the contours of an emerging debate over the procedural and doctrinal architecture of constitutional accountability in Michigan.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 23:56:32.210270

The U.S. has ramped up tensions with the government of Maduro, whom administration officials have dubbed an “illegitimate leader,” in recent months.

The Pentagon has built up a significant presence in the U.S. Southern Command region, while President Trump has authorized at least 22 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, killing at least 87 people.

Europe experiencing a growing sense of division

Immigration has risen dramatically over the past decade in some European countries, driven in part by millions of asylum-seekers who have come to Europe fleeing conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine.

Asylum-seekers account for a small percentage of total immigration, however, and experts say antipathy toward diversity and migration stems from a mix of factors. Economic stagnation in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the rise of charismatic nationalist politicians and the polarizing influence of social media all play a role, experts say.

In Britain, there is “a frightening increase in the sense of national division and decline” and that tends to push people toward political extremes, said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Unit at King’s College London. It took root after the financial crisis, was reinforced by Britain’s debate about Brexit and deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Duffy said.

Social media has exacerbated the mood, notably on X, whose algorithm promotes divisive content and whose owner, Elon Musk, approvingly retweets far-right posts.

Across Europe, ethnonationalism has been promoted by right-wing parties such as Germany’s AfD, France’s National Rally and the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Now it appears to have the stamp of approval from the Trump administration, whose new national security strategy depicts Europe as a collection of countries facing “economic decline” and “civilizational erasure” because of immigration and loss of national identities.

The hostile language alarmed many European politicians, but also echoed what they hear from their countries’ far-right parties.

National Rally leader Jordan Bardella told the BBC he largely agreed with the Trump administration’s concern that mass immigration was “shaking the balance of European countries.”

Racist rhetoric and hate crimes on the rise

Policies once considered extreme are now firmly on the political agenda. Reform UK, the hard-right party that consistently leads opinion polls, says if it wins power it will strip immigrants of permanent-resident status even if they have lived in the U.K. for decades. The center-right opposition Conservatives say they will deport British citizens with dual nationality who commit crimes.

A Reform UK lawmaker complained in October that advertisements were “full of Black people, full of Asian people.” Conservative justice spokesman Robert Jenrick remarked with concern that he “didn’t see another white face” in an area of Birmingham, Britain’s second-largest city. Neither politician had to resign.

Many proponents of reduced immigration say they are concerned about integration and community cohesion, not race. But that’s not how it feels to those on the receiving end of racial abuse.

“There is no doubt it has worsened,” said Dawn Butler, a Black British lawmaker who says the vitriol she receives on social media “is increasing drastically, and has escalated into death threats.”

U.K. government statistics show police in England and Wales recorded more than 115,000 hate crimes in the year to March 2025, a 2% increase over the previous 12 months.

In July 2024, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim violence erupted on Britain’s streets after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Authorities said online misinformation wrongly identifying the U.K.-born teenage attacker as a Muslim migrant played a part.

In Ireland and in the Netherlands, protesters often demonstrate outside municipal meetings in communities where a new asylum center is proposed. Some protests have turned violent, with opponents of asylum-seekers throwing fireworks at riot police.

Across Europe, the main focus of protests has been hotels and other housing for asylum-seekers, which some say become magnets for crime and bad behavior. But the agenda of protest organizers is often much wider.

In September, more than 100,000 people chanting “We want our country back” marched through London in a protest organized by a far-right activist and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson. Among the speakers was French far-right politician Eric Zemmour, who told the crowd that France and the U.K. both faced “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture.”

Outflanking the right

Mainstream European politicians condemn the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Britain’s center-left Labour Party government has denounced racism and says migration is an important part of Britain’s national story.

At the same time, it is taking a tougher line on immigration, announcing policies to make it harder for migrants to settle permanently. The government says it is inspired by Denmark, which has seen asylum applications plummet since it started giving refugees only short-term residence.

Denmark and Britain are among a group of European countries pushing to weaken legal protections for migrants and make deportations easier.

Human rights advocates argue that attempts to appease the right just lead to ever-more-extreme policies.

“For every inch yielded, there’s going to be another inch demanded,” Council of Europe human rights commissioner Michael O’Flaherty told The Guardian. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around?”

Calls for calmer rhetoric

Politicians of the political center also have been criticized for adopting the language of the far right. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in May that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers,” a phrase that echoed a notorious 1968 anti-immigration speech by the politician Enoch Powell. Starmer later said he had been unaware of the echo and regretted using the phrase.

Germany’s center-right Chancellor Friedrich Merz has hardened his language on migrants as the Alternative for Germany has grown more powerful. Merz caused an uproar in October by saying Germany had a problem with its “Stadtbild,” a word that translates as “city image” or cityscape. Critics felt Merz was implying that people who don’t look German don’t truly belong.

Merz later stressed that “we need immigration,” without which certain sectors of the economy, including health care, would cease to function.

Duffy said politicians should be responsible and consider how their rhetoric shapes public attitudes — though he added that’s “quite a forlorn hope.”

“The perception that this divisiveness works has taken hold,” he said.

In July 2024, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim violence erupted on Britain’s streets after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Authorities said online misinformation wrongly identifying the U.K.-born teenage attacker as a Muslim migrant played a part.

In Ireland and in the Netherlands, protesters often demonstrate outside municipal meetings in communities where a new asylum center is proposed. Some protests have turned violent, with opponents of asylum-seekers throwing fireworks at riot police.

Across Europe, the main focus of protests has been hotels and other housing for asylum-seekers, which some say become magnets for crime and bad behavior. But the agenda of protest organizers is often much wider.

In September, more than 100,000 people chanting “We want our country back” marched through London in a protest organized by a far-right activist and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson. Among the speakers was French far-right politician Eric Zemmour, who told the crowd that France and the U.K. both faced “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture.”

Outflanking the right

Mainstream European politicians condemn the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Britain’s center-left Labour Party government has denounced racism and says migration is an important part of Britain’s national story.

At the same time, it is taking a tougher line on immigration, announcing policies to make it harder for migrants to settle permanently. The government says it is inspired by Denmark, which has seen asylum applications plummet since it started giving refugees only short-term residence.

Denmark and Britain are among a group of European countries pushing to weaken legal protections for migrants and make deportations easier.

Human rights advocates argue that attempts to appease the right just lead to ever-more-extreme policies.

“For every inch yielded, there’s going to be another inch demanded,” Council of Europe human rights commissioner Michael O’Flaherty told The Guardian. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around?”

Calls for calmer rhetoric

Politicians of the political center also have been criticized for adopting the language of the far right. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in May that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers,” a phrase that echoed a notorious 1968 anti-immigration speech by the politician Enoch Powell. Starmer later said he had been unaware of the echo and regretted using the phrase.

Germany’s center-right Chancellor Friedrich Merz has hardened his language on migrants as the Alternative for Germany has grown more powerful. Merz caused an uproar in October by saying Germany had a problem with its “Stadtbild,” a word that translates as “city image” or cityscape. Critics felt Merz was implying that people who don’t look German don’t truly belong.

Merz later stressed that “we need immigration,” without which certain sectors of the economy, including health care, would cease to function.

Duffy said politicians should be responsible and consider how their rhetoric shapes public attitudes — though he added that’s “quite a forlorn hope.”

“The perception that this divisiveness works has taken hold,” he said.

The only way to obtain data about asylum seeker deaths is via freedom of information (FoI) requests to the Home Office, which officials do not always comply with. However, the NHS produces regular figures about deaths in hospitals and the Ministry of Justice does so with deaths in custody.

Fifty-one people died in Home Office-provided asylum accommodation in 2024, an increase of 11 on the previous year and a more than twelvefold rise on 2019 when four people died, according to FoI data.

The department initially claimed that only 30 people had died during that year, but had to apologise after it emerged there were 21 additional deaths.

Deaths in recent years include those of Leonard Farruku from Albania, who died on the Bibby Stockholm barge in December 2023; Mehrab Omrani from Iran, who is thought to have lain dead for four months in Home Office accommodation before his body was discovered in March 2024; and Hussein Haseeb Ahmed, a Kurdish Iraqi man who died at Manston processing centre in Kent after contracting diphtheria in November 2022.

An amendment to the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act 2025 proposed publishing this data but was not passed. The investigative journalism unit Liberty Investigates argued in an appeal to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) that the Home Office should make these deaths public but was unsuccessful.

The ICO agreed with the Home Office, which said that “preventing potential harassment or violence against vulnerable individuals and staff would outweigh any countervailing interests in transparency”.

The Home Office said giving the names of those who died could assist in “indirectly identifying the relatives of deceased individuals and/or the accommodation providers. This could expose relatives of the deceased to harassment or violence, particularly in light of recent incidents in August 2024 where asylum locations were targeted.”

Officials added: “This targeting of asylum locations could also expose the staff who work there to harassment or violence. Therefore it is our view that disclosure of the requested information would lead to endangerment.”

The charity Asylum Matters is coordinating a campaign calling for both deaths of asylum seekers in the care of the Home Office and those who die trying to cross the Channel to be published.

Louise Calvey, the executive director at Asylum Matters, said: “People are dying in our asylum system. They’re dying at our borders, yes, but they’re also dying in camps, hotels, and other privately run, profit-driven Home Office funded accommodation. People are dying by suicide, dying of infectious disease, dying avoidable deaths. What we know for certain is that lives are being lost – but what we don’t know is how many.

“It’s an utterly shameful outlier: when people die in government care in other settings, such as the prison system, there’s a duty to report and track that data. Not tracking the figures in the asylum system makes it impossible to take effective action to reduce these tragedies – and it sends the appalling message that the deaths of people seeking sanctuary don’t matter.”

The Home Office previously revealed it did not routinely inform family members when asylum seekers died in its care and did not want to supply details of these deaths publicly in case it upset them and “endangers their mental health”.

A department spokesperson said:“Our thoughts and sympathies are with the families and friends of any asylum seeker or migrant who has died. We have taken immediate action to restart asylum processing and robust measures are in place to prioritise the safety of anyone in asylum accommodation. Our Border Security Act will also make it an offence to endanger another life during perilous small boat crossings, including a sentence of up to five years in prison.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/983a017fa4d1ca7acb557974c47373b08a79aa03/743_0_3937_3151/master/3937.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d1c43eff05098f8cb05f2b85646a50b4",N,,2025-12-14 15:56:52.289538

""It is clear to me that this surge came in direct response to Trump's racist comments about Somali people, and about me in particular,"" Omar wrote.

""It is appalling to witness this unlawful behavior by ICE agents, which echoes some of the darkest chapters in our nation's history,"" she added.

Omar asked for a detailed report of ICE actions, including the number of people arrested and number of citizens detained. She also asked for clarity about the number of warrants prepared in advance for the surge, and the estimated cost of the operation to taxpayers.

“We are known across the nation now as traitors and treasonous to another race of people,” said Ray Rice, a 74-year-old who said he and other tribal members were blindsided. “We are brown and they’re brown.”

ICE deals with tribes generate scrutiny

Tribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick promised “full transparency” about what he described as an “evolving situation.” In a video message to tribal members Friday, he said the tribe is talking with legal counsel about ways to end the contract.

He alluded to the time when federal agents forcibly removed hundreds of Prairie Band Potawatomi families from their homes and ultimately corralled them on a reservation just north of Topeka.

“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” Rupnick said in the video message. “We were placed here because we were prisoners of war. So we must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and the trauma once done to our people.”

The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way in September for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration raids and use apparent ethnicity as a relevant factor for a stop. With some Native Americans being swept up and detained in recent raids, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s overtures to tribes and even longstanding deals are generating extra scrutiny.

An LLC owned by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama also has a multimillion dollar contract with ICE to provide financial and administrative services. Meanwhile, some shareholders of an Alaska Native corporation say their values don’t align with the corporation’s federal contracting division, Akima, to provide security at several ICE detention facilities.

“I’m shocked that there is any tribal nation that’s willing to assist the U.S. government in that,” said Brittany McKane, a 29-year-old Muscogee Nation citizen who attends the tribe’s college in Oklahoma.

Some tribal nations have advised their citizens to carry tribal IDs.

Last month, actor Elaine Miles said she was stopped by ICE agents who alleged her ID from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon was fake.

Economic pressure increases as federal funding decreases

The economic arms of tribes, which can be run by non-Natives, are under increasing pressure to generate revenue because of decreased federal funding, high inflation and competition from online gambling, said Gabe Galanda, an Indigenous rights attorney based in Seattle.

But the economic opportunities presented to tribes don’t always align with their values, said Galanda, a member of the Round Valley Indian Tribes in northern California.

The Prairie Band Potawatomi has a range of businesses that provide health care management staffing, general contracting and even interior design.

The tribal offshoot hired by ICE — KPB Services LLC — was established in Holton, Kansas, and is not listed on the tribe’s website. It previously qualified along with dozens of other companies to provide logistical support to the U.S. Navy although, to date, it hasn’t performed any work for the federal government.

The ICE contract initially was awarded in October for $19 million for unspecified “due diligence and concept designs” for processing centers and detention centers throughout the U.S., according to a one-sentence description of the work on the federal government’s real time contracting database. It was modified a month later to increase the payout ceiling to $29.9 million. Sole-source contracts above $30 million require additional justification under federal contracting rules.

The contract raises a number of questions and seems to go against the Trump administration’s stated of goal of cleaning up waste, fraud and abuse, said Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law.

“The public’s trust in the federal procurement system depends on transparency and competition,” said Schnell. “Although there is a role within this system for multimillion dollar sole-source contracts, these contracts are an exception to statutory competition requirements, and taxpayers are entitled to know how the government is spending their money.”

Backlash swift as news about the ICE contract spread

It’s unclear what the Tribal Council knew about the contract. A spokesperson for the Tribal Council did not respond to repeated requests from the AP for details, including who was terminated.

What is known is that KPB was registered by Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a retired U.S. naval officer with degrees in engineering and business who is a member of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, according to a website for his one-time consulting firm, Burton Woodward Partners LLC.

The website described Woodward as a serial entrepreneur and tribal adviser on mergers and acquisitions, accessing capital and landing federal contracts. The consulting firm was registered to an office park in Sarasota, Florida, in 2017 but was delisted two years later after it failed to file an annual report.

The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in a 2017 news release said Woodward’s firm advised it on its acquisition of another government contractor, Mill Creek LLC, which specializes in outfitting federal buildings and the military with office furniture and medical equipment.

Woodward also is listed as the chief operating officer of the Florida branch of Prairie Band Construction Inc., which was registered in September.

Attempts to locate Woodward were unsuccessful. The phone number listed on Burton Woodward Partners was disconnected, and he did not respond to an email sent to another consulting firm he’s affiliated with, Virginia-based Chinkapin Partners LLC.

Every day we witness terrifying new ways that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is being empowered to take whatever actions it wishes while justifying them as necessary — supposedly in order to keep us safe. The continued dehumanization of our immigrant communities proceeds alongside proliferating cases of U.S. citizens being detained, as ICE’s reign of terror shows no concern for fundamental human rights or even basic human dignity.

As a result, our immigrant communities are living in fear that corrodes the essential components of life. Community members are now skipping doctor visits and are afraid to send their children to school or even attend their houses of worship. Western North Carolina residents got a firsthand look at ICE in action back in April 2018, when the federal agency detained an estimated 25 community members.

President Trump proclaims that ICE will make our communities safer and that somehow the alphabet soup of federal law enforcement agencies (ATF, DEA, FBI, etc.) lacks the personnel, expertise or funding needed to arrest violent criminals and break up drug trafficking rings. But while the war on drugs — a war on people suffering from addiction — has been a colossal failure over the past 40-plus years, no one has suggested holding a PTA bake sale because the DEA is underfunded. (To be clear, ICE was also empowered under President Obama, though in a more limited fashion.)

Afraid to report crimes

In an interview with Mountain Xpress earlier this year, Henderson County Sheriff Lowell Griffin defended his cooperation agreement with ICE. (Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act empowers ICE to delegate immigration officer functions to state and local law enforcement personnel.)

In the interview, Sheriff Griffin hinted that the federal agency might employ tactics that push the limits of what’s legal or perhaps acceptable. “I have met with officials from ICE from Atlanta and Charlotte, and there’ve been zero requests,” he said, adding, “I was concerned about how ICE may be operating in the county, and I wanted to be aware of what’s going on.” Later in the interview, however, Griffin said, “I don’t think we’re going to see an aggressive ICE response in Henderson County because we’ve basically already done the work to try to remove those that have ties to any kind of criminal organization.”

But immigrants and undocumented folks are sometimes victims of crime just like everyone else. And because of programs like 287(g), residents in these communities are often scared to report crimes they witness or are the target of. There’s a good reason that the Department of Homeland Security has two special types of visas providing legal protection for undocumented individuals who are victims of specified crimes and who cooperate with law enforcement. Underreporting crime makes all of us less safe. And every person, regardless of their skin tone, background or immigration status, wants and deserves to live in a community where they feel secure.

Let’s go after drug trafficking, not people

From 2019-24, I served as director of public affairs under Buncombe County Sheriff Quentin Miller. Immediately after taking office, Miller and members of his staff began meeting with individuals and immigrant rights organizations to determine how local law enforcement could do a better job of serving those communities.

In 2019, I drafted the sheriff’s policy that declined to honor ICE “detainer requests,” which ask local law enforcement to hold a prisoner for up to 48 hours past when they would otherwise be released. Although compliance with these requests was voluntary, conservatives lambasted officials who refused to honor such requests, claiming that “sanctuary sheriffs” were breaking the law. But as Miller clearly communicated, in order for his office to hold anyone at the county jail, the law required a warrant signed by a judge, and courts have upheld that position. (The N.C. General Assembly has since passed legislation that requires local law enforcement, as well as judges in the state, to comply with ICE detainer requests.)

Meanwhile, both state and local authorities have aggressively targeted drug trafficking operations in our area, which does serve to improve community safety. In fact, under Sheriff Miller, the specialty unit focused on high-level drug trafficking made a record number of arrests for fentanyl and meth trafficking in Buncombe County — without any assistance from either ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.

To be clear, I do believe that arresting and prosecuting high-level drug traffickers and the gun crime that very often accompanies those activities make our communities safer. ICE, however, seems rather to excel at pushing people further into the shadows. By discouraging them from reporting crimes such as domestic violence — or even, for that matter, from simply going to work due to fear of arrest — ICE is ultimately making our entire community less safe. But as is the case with Trump and MAGA, the cruelty is really the point — and there seems to be no limit to it.

(WTVF) — Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested at least 15 people in Middle Tennessee this past week, according to advocates who are documenting the activity throughout the region.

Music City Migra Watch says they have witnessed armed agents making stops in unmarked vehicles, including a detention in Gallatin that was captured on video. The advocacy group says agents are targeting people in work vans as people travel to their jobs.

""They're going after people with families that are just going to work, trying to get by, trying to support their family, trying to have a better life,"" said Ashley Warbington, an advocate who has been recording encounters.

Warbington emphasized the importance of documentation during these stops.

""It's very important that they know they have the right to remain silent, and documenting that encounter is really incredibly important in this moment,"" Warbington said.

Warbington says the recent activity differs from operations conducted in May, when the Tennessee Highway Patrol stopped more than 600 vehicles over six nights in majority Hispanic neighborhoods in South Nashville. Those stops, conducted in partnership with ICE, led to nearly 200 arrests.

""This last week has certainly been more activity than we've seen in a while, but this activity is very different than what we saw in May,"" Warbington said. ""These are agents, ICE agents, going out into the community anywhere in Nashville and surrounding counties, and pulling over individuals going to work in their work bands. They're pulling them over without the help of another law enforcement agency.""

An ICE supervisor confirmed to NewsChannel 5 that agents are making arrests in Middle Tennessee, describing them as part of ongoing efforts to detain people who are in the country illegally and have committed crimes.

An ICE spokesperson provided a statement when reports first emerged three weeks ago: ""As part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation's immigration laws. All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention, and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.""

However, data from the Deportation Data project shows that in the first nine months of President Trump's second term, around 75,000 people arrested by ICE did not have a criminal record. That represents over a third of all ICE arrests during that period.

A suspected ICE vehicle was also spotted near an Inglewood elementary school, though Metro School Board Member Zach Young posted on Facebook that there were no reports of ICE entering school property. Young said schools should remain safe spaces for families.

Community organizes toy drive

Advocates are working to support families affected by immigration enforcement activities. They continue to assist families impacted during the May operations while organizing holiday support for children whose parents have been detained.

The organization is partnering with community members for ""House of Hope"" to collect more than 1,000 toys for kids whose parents were detained and for those too afraid to leave home to shop. Only 300 toys have been collected so far.

""Regardless of what's going on out in the communities, regardless of what's going on in the household, in the family, within the families, we want to make sure that the kids feel that sense of joy,"" said Toy Drive Organizer Dulce Castro.

People can drop off toys by December 19 at Viva La Fresa, a Mexican and French fusion coffee shop at 17 S. Lowry St. in Smyrna, and receive a free drink in return. Online donations are also accepted.

The program's disruption upended projects across hundreds of communities in both Republican- and Democratic-led states, thwarting plans to improve stormwater drainage, harden electrical lines and even help relocate households living in areas most vulnerable to disasters.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told The Associated Press Thursday that DHS “has not terminated BRIC,” but did not elaborate on the program’s status.

“The Biden Administration abandoned true mitigation and used BRIC as a green new deal slush fund,” the spokesperson said, referring to a Democratic plan to combat climate change. “It’s unfortunate that an activist judge either didn’t understand that or didn’t care.”

The order comes at a time of profound uncertainty over FEMA's future and on the same day that a long-awaited meeting of the FEMA Review Council to present a report recommending reforms to the agency was abruptly canceled by the White House because it had not been fully briefed on the latest version of the report, according to a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Congress funded BRIC during the first Trump administration through the 2018 Disaster Recovery Reform Act, and FEMA launched the program in 2020. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made an additional $1 billion available for BRIC over five years, though only about $133 million had been delivered to communities by April, according to FEMA.

The program was criticized by some for being difficult to access for rural and less wealthy communities due to a complicated application process and cost-sharing requirements. But even Republican lawmakers like Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana opposed the cancellations and called for BRIC's reinstatement.

“It protects families and saves taxpayer dollars in the long-run,” Cassidy said on the Senate floor a week after the funding cancellation. “That’s efficient in my book.”

Judge Richard G. Stearns found that FEMA's actions were unlawful since Congress appropriated the money specifically for the grants and that there was an “inherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law.”

“The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives,” Stearns wrote in the court order.

The Trump administration has slashed disaster preparedness dollars across multiple FEMA programs this year as part of its campaign to transfer more responsibility for disasters to states.

Since February, Trump has not approved any requests for hazard mitigation funding, a typical add-on that helps states, tribes and territories complete resilience projects after major disasters.

Emergency preparedness grants that states and local governments rely on to staff emergency management agencies and buy equipment are currently frozen after 12 states sued the Trump administration over unprecedented grant stipulations related to the administration's immigration agenda.

Multiple studies have shown that preemptive investments in disaster readiness can yield significant savings. A 2024 study funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found every $1 invested in disaster preparation saved $13 in economic impact, damage and cleanup costs.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51d54d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F3c%2F88c1cb004a1d98d09ef59e4209b0%2Fap25189814651285.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 17:56:28.319835

recipients from deportation has helped about 200,000 migrants, according to the National Immigration Project, which is representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit.","On a crisp November morning in White Plains, N.Y., six lawyers spent hours in a federal courtroom arguing about the government’s plan to deport a teenager from the Bronx.

Agents had detained the boy, Joel Camas, 16, during a routine check-in at 26 Federal Plaza, the New York City headquarters for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They held him at a shelter for three weeks while the New York Civil Liberties Union fought for his release, arguing that Joel had followed orders and that forcing him to return to his native Ecuador would put him in danger.

When the hearing ended, Judge Cathy Seibel ordered that Joel be freed while she considered the merits of his case. But his future in the United States remains uncertain. Joel, like thousands of other young migrants, has become a target of the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown, and immigration officials are working to dissolve long-established protections meant to help young people like him stay.

Joel is a recipient of a decades-old designation known as special immigrant juvenile status, which, until recently, had shielded some undocumented young migrants who could prove that they had been abused or neglected by at least one parent. Beginning in 2022 under President Joe Biden, migrants who were granted this status were immediately told whether they would be protected from deportation through an immigration classification known as deferred action. Those who received the deferred action designation were eligible to apply for a work permit while awaiting a pathway to permanent residency.

But in April, Trump administration officials quietly stopped granting deferred action designations and instead began to deport S.I.J. status holders with little notice and no chance to appeal, alarming immigration lawyers.

A coalition of immigrant advocates filed a federal lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York seeking class-action status to challenge the new policy. In late November — two days after Joel’s hearing — a judge granted the plaintiffs a partial victory by ordering the government to temporarily halt its new policy, though it did not set a deadline to comply. A final decision has not been made.

“People with S.I.J. or in the process of getting S.I.J. are being ordered removed, and they are not able to access this relief that as a child or young person they would have,” said Beth Baltimore, Joel’s lawyer. “We’re just so concerned about this happening with more and more people.”

Immigration officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Joel had fled South America with his mother, Elvia Chafla, about three years ago, making the arduous journey through the Darién Gap on foot in search of a safer place to live, away from gang violence. In the United States, he dreamed of becoming an auto mechanic or Army soldier. The government determined he was eligible for S.I.J. status because he had been abandoned by his father.

He had been without his mother for about four weeks, staying with relatives and attending Gotham Collaborative High School, when he was detained by immigration officials. His detention in October stunned his lawyer, Ms. Baltimore, who emerged from the federal building with tears in her eyes. She had believed his S.I.J. status and his age would spare him.

Instead, he was placed in a shelter in the Bronx, where Ms. Baltimore and the rest of his legal team argued that he was falling behind in school because the classes at the shelter were not guaranteed to be accepted for credit by the public education system. A family court later granted Joel’s uncle legal guardianship over him, clearing a way for his release.

At his hearing, Judge Seibel criticized what she described as superfluous bureaucracy that had kept Joel confined longer than necessary. She lamented that migrant children were being held even when they had a safe place to go, but she stopped short of criticizing the Trump administration’s effort to deport Joel.

“It’s not my place to decide whether what the government is doing is heartless or an inexplicable expenditure of resources,” Judge Seibel said. “My job is to decide whether they’re allowed to do what they’re doing.”

The federal law establishing special immigrant juvenile status was enacted in 1990 and then expanded in 2008. It does not grant legal status, but it allows recipients to apply for a visa to become legal permanent residents and to obtain a work permit.

The Biden-era policy to protect S.I.J. recipients from deportation has helped about 200,000 migrants, according to the National Immigration Project, which is representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Roughly 150,000 migrants who have been approved for special immigrant juvenile status could be affected by the government’s decision to stop the policy, according to court documents.

The group argued that the government violated the law by ending the policy without proper notice or justification, leaving thousands of immigrant youth in legal limbo and at risk of deportation.

Despite the uncertainty, young migrants like Mamadou Mouctar Diallo, 20, are still applying for special immigrant juvenile status in hopes that it will help them secure a place in the United States. Mr. Diallo was arrested in Lower Manhattan in August and detained for about three months before he was released in November upon being granted asylum from Guinea.

Young people living in New York make up the largest portion of recipients of special immigrant juvenile status who are waiting for a green card compared with other states, at about 20 percent, followed by those in California, who made up 15 percent, according to data obtained and analyzed by the End SIJS Backlog Coalition, an advocacy group.

From Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January through mid-October, ICE has arrested about 2,600 children younger than 18 across the country, according to federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California, Berkeley. In the New York City area, it has arrested at least 140 minors.

This year, ICE has sent 600 immigrant children into the federal shelter system — more than in the previous four years combined, according to an investigation by ProPublica. It is the highest number since record-keeping began a decade ago.

Polling has consistently shown that Americans are more focused on economic issues than broader concerns about how government is functioning.
But Crosswell said public corruption doesn’t have to be separate from that.","ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Many political candidates like to talk up their résumés in their stump speeches.

Ryan Crosswell reads from his resignation letter.

A former federal prosecutor now running for Congress, he quit in February when President Donald Trump’s administration dropped corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in return for his cooperation on immigration enforcement.

“I pray that the Department of Justice remains dedicated to upholding the rule of law evenly without fear or favor. Sincerely, Ryan Crosswell,” he read at a recent campaign event.

The line got applause and whoops from dozens of Democratic Party activists who had gathered to see him in the West End Taproom in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Crosswell is one of five candidates who are vying for the opportunity to unseat Republican Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a top target of Democrats in next year’s midterm election, when control of the U.S. House will be on the line.

Polling shows that voters prioritize economic issues, and Democrats have focused on concerns about affordability as they try to claw back power in Washington.

Crosswell is testing a different approach, relying on his law enforcement and corruption-fighting background amid fears about how Trump is reshaping the nation’s justice system.

Voters often ask him about Trump’s pardons for the politically connected, immigration enforcement officers using force, U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean, or prosecutions against the president’s enemies.

“I think I get asked that probably more than the average candidate, but I also lean into it,” Crosswell said in an interview.

Mackenzie’s campaign said voters in Pennsylvania “aren’t interested in a lecture. They’re interested in the issues—affordability, public safety and national security.”

Running amid fears of authoritarianism

Crosswell’s background was a draw for many who came to see him at the event.

“I like that he quit his job because he was given a job that went against his moral compass,” said Elisabeth Grant.

Grant and others said they believe Trump is attacking the rule of law, and many described it a top motivation.

Some described personal fears. Joe McDermott said he is outspoken on Facebook about his criticism of the Trump administration—”I refer to it as a ‘crime family'”—and people ask him if he isn’t afraid that someone will come after him.

He is, and he wouldn’t discount the Department of Justice going after someone like himself.

“I would not put anything beneath them right now,” McDermott said.

Joniel Colon Rosario is thinking twice about whether he should speak his native Spanish on the street around strangers.

“I don’t know if some random guy in a ski mask is going to come down and tackle me because I’m speaking my native tongue,” said Colon Rosario, who is originally from Puerto Rico.

Crosswell said voters are worried that the government “appears to do anything the president orders.”

“People aren’t asking, ‘How can my government protect me?’ It’s, ‘How can I protect myself from my government?’” he said.

A prime swing seat in Pennsylvania

It’s no wonder Democrats are eager to challenge Mackenzie. A freshman, Mackenzie was a state lawmaker when he won his race for Congress by 1 percentage point last year, among the narrowest margins in the country.

Crosswell—also a former active-duty U.S. Marine and a current reservist—isn’t alone in leaving federal government service this year to run as a Democrat.

Zach Dembo, a former federal prosecutor and Navy lawyer who worked briefly for Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, is running for an open seat in Kentucky. And John Sullivan, a former FBI intelligence official, is running for a Republican-held seat in New York’s Hudson Valley.

Crosswell, 45, will have some baggage in his primary contest.

He changed his registration from Republican to Democrat a year ago. After he resigned in February, he moved from Washington, D.C., to Allentown—about 45 miles from where he grew up in Pottsville, Pa.

Crosswell remembers thinking, “Do I want to leave public service, or do I want to fight back?”

Economic fears are No. 1 in polls

It’s unclear whether a corruption-fighting message will carry the day in either a primary or general election.

Polling has consistently shown that Americans are more focused on economic issues than broader concerns about how government is functioning.

A CNN poll from August found roughly 4 in 10 U.S. adults said economic concerns were the most important problems facing the country, and only about 1 in 10 named attitudes about government, including concerns about the rule of law or corruption.

The House Democrats’ campaign arm, which is officially neutral in Crosswell’s primary race, said the midterms are “shaping up to be a referendum on who is going to lower costs and help improve the lives of everyday Americans, not the wealthy and well-connected.”

Crosswell acknowledges that not everybody is concerned about how Trump wields power and that it depends on the audience.

Jon Macklin, a Crosswell supporter who goes door-to-door for Democratic candidates, told a similar story. People he meets who are less engaged with politics are most concerned about their finances and how the economy is affecting them.

But Crosswell said public corruption doesn’t have to be separate from that. And he intends to drive home that message. In other words, a corrupt government and a corrupt economy can hurt everyone.

“Corruption is a kitchen table issue,” Crosswell said. “Because public office is a public trust.”",https://fox56news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2025/12/AP25344772866598.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-14 12:57:32.245232

Homan was joined at the U.S.-Mexico border by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott and local Border Patrol officials. The visit included a heavily secured appearance near the border wall.

Homan said the administration’s immigration crackdown has led to sharp declines in sex trafficking, fentanyl smuggling and the number of suspected terrorists attempting to cross the border illegally.

“A secure border means stronger national security, but most importantly, it means saving migrants’ lives and American lives,” Homan said.

Justin De La Torre, the chief patrol agent for the San Diego sector, pointed to recent deaths tied to human smuggling as evidence of the dangers migrants face.

“Just recently in San Diego, we had four people die in the ocean at the hands of human smugglers who did not care about the lives of the people they were smuggling,” De La Torre said.

Homan also said Homeland Security has recovered about 62,000 children who were smuggled into the United States, many during recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. While some were eventually found with family members, he said others were victims of sex trafficking or forced labor.

Commissioner Scott said increased cooperation between ICE and Border Patrol agents has led to a rise in deportations while also slowing illegal crossings.

“We will track you down, we will arrest you, we will deport you,” Scott said. “The number one thing that stops illegal immigration is changing the dynamic — not releasing people and making sure they know they cannot freely move about the United States if they cross illegally.”

Immigrant rights advocates, however, argue the enforcement strategy is violating civil rights and targeting people who are actively pursuing legal status.

Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s U.S.-Mexico border program, said agents are arresting immigrants at ICE check-ins, court hearings and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services interviews.

“These are individuals who have been vetted over and over,” Rios said.

Homan rejected the criticism, saying President Donald Trump has given him authority to enforce immigration laws and remove anyone in the country illegally.

“They cheated the system,” Homan said. “They entered the country illegally, which is a crime.”",https://fox5sandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/12/snapshot-2025-12-13T222326.878.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-14 10:59:34.072875

“All the immigrants he’s targeting, we escaped war; there’s a bunch of doctors and business owners in my community,” Munye said.","Dec. 2 marked a point of no return for Minnesotans.

At a cabinet meeting at the White House, President Donald Trump disparaged the state’s Somali community, saying he did not want them in the United States. He said they contributed nothing to the country and referred to them as garbage.

The same day, reports emerged that 100 Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents were being deployed to the state to target Somali immigrants. Raids have been rampant across the Twin Cities since, with immigrants and citizens alike caught in the crossfire.

For members of the Somali community, it has been a difficult several weeks, with students left to adjust to a rapidly changing situation.

Despite the warning signs of imminent immigration enforcement operations in the Twin Cities, President of the University of Minnesota’s Somali Student Association Dahir Munye said it was still hard to believe.

“We heard the talks coming a couple weeks ago, but now to really see things in effect is almost shocking,” Munye said.

The Trump administration’s sudden escalation against Somalis has made Munye’s position on SSA all the more important. A student group with no political affiliations, the organization was thrust overnight into a position of guidance for the University’s Somali community.

“A lot of people are reaching out to us, wanting our perspective on things,” Munye said. “It’s really been a lot.”

It is also unclear exactly who is being targeted. Despite the Trump administration’s stated goal of removing undocumented immigrants from the country, the majority of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, and even more are permanent residents.

That has left many American citizens of Somali descent in the Twin Cities fearful for their safety. According to Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, that is the point.

“The majority of people who are concerned are U.S. citizens, because that’s the majority [of the population],” Hussein said. “To target a community, call them garbage and then to send the police after them with a mission they cannot be successful at — because the majority of the people are citizens — tells you that this is a targeted attack against the black community.”

The fears are not unfounded. On Tuesday, a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis’ Cedar-Riverside neighborhood was physically restrained and arrested by ICE agents despite offering to show identification, and was only released after being taken to ICE offices in Fort Snelling.

He was then told to walk home, a nearly two and a half hour walk in the cold.

For Hussein, situations like these mean Somali residents need to take new, unprecedented steps to protect themselves.

“People are now worried if they should carry their passports around, and we are recommending to have those documents handy,” Hussein said. “You should not live in the United States walking around with your passport, but that’s where America is.”

ICE on the streets

The morning of Wednesday, Dec. 10, began unassumingly for Mahamed, a resident of Cedar-Riverside.

It snowed the night before, so he grabbed a shovel and began digging out his car. There was no indication it would be anything other than a typical winter morning in Minneapolis until, minutes later, he looked up to find himself surrounded by eight federal agents.

“I didn’t even know if it was ICE,” Mahamed, who wished not to use his last name for fear of retaliation, said. “I just saw some cars driving by. I was looking down ‘cause I’m trying to get the snow out of the way of my car, and when I looked up, they’d already surrounded me.”

Agents approached Mahamed and asked him to present identification. They refused to identify themselves and had arrived in unmarked vehicles.

Alone with his mother nearby, Mahamed was afraid of what might happen.

“It was actually quite terrifying,” he said. “I was very intimidated.”

Adding to his fears was a man with the agents, using a phone on an extended mount to film Mahamed. Mahamed said he was uncomfortable providing identification while being filmed by someone who was clearly not law enforcement.

“It felt like a reality show,” he said.

That man was Ben Bergquam, an influencer from right-wing television network Real America’s Voice. Bergquam’s role in the operations is unclear, and neither Bergquam nor Real America’s Voice responded to the Minnesota Daily’s request for comment.

Agents proceeded to ask Mahamed questions about where he was born and whether he was a citizen, accusing him of making things difficult when he refused to show identification. When Mahamed continued to refuse, agents threatened to detain him.

“They basically threatened me and said, ‘Hey, we either figure this out in 7 minutes, or we hold you for 72 hours,’” he said.

Agents questioned Mahamed’s mother as well, who is also a U.S. citizen, and prevented Mahamed from approaching her when she began crying. He said agents criticized him when he spoke Somali to his mother and asked why he was using a foreign language.

Mahamed believed the agents first approached him because his mother wears a niqab, a face covering often worn by Muslim women. He also said he felt agents were trying to intimidate him to present identification, which he had no legal obligation to do.

“I was very much willing to be detained, because I’m a U.S. citizen and I was born in this country,” he said.

Agents showed no signs of leaving until community members began arriving to confront officers, according to Mahamed.

Community members on foot and bike recorded the interaction and blew whistles to alert other bystanders of ICE’s presence. Agents left shortly thereafter without detaining Mahamed or his mother.

Mahamed said the community response provided a sense of reassurance during an otherwise scary experience.

“That’s what made me feel a lot better, when the community was there, and everybody was witnessing it,” he said. “Because the community was there, there’s lots of people recording it, they [the agents] became a lot more wary and careful with what they were doing.”

Shortly after leaving Mahamed and his mother, agents made their way to Riverside Plaza, where they were, again, confronted by community members.

Federal agents gained access to a residential apartment complex in the plaza, according to eyewitnesses, but did not detain any individuals. Bergquam was once again present with agents during the operation, and video taken by the Daily showed him arguing with community members as agents returned to their vehicles.

Another video captured by the Daily showed a federal agent pepper-spraying bystanders out of the passenger side window as agents drove off. Bystanders stood on the sidewalk or side of the road and were not obstructing the agents’ vehicle.

Minutes after agents had departed, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey arrived at a nearby cafe to grab some coffee. Stumbling onto an ICE raid was not on the agenda, Frey said.

“Initially, we were out here to get some coffee as the day is starting and obviously show support to our Somali community,” Frey said. “On our way over, we heard yet another one [raid] had taken place.”

Minneapolis has long been a target of the Trump administration’s anger, owing to the city’s sanctuary city ordinance. Frey and Trump have exchanged verbal jabs in recent weeks, with Trump calling Frey a fool.

On Wednesday, Frey doubled down on Minneapolis’s sanctuary city status.

“We won’t cooperate with them in any way, shape or form, and we’re doing everything possible to work with our community members, including those who are here right now,” Frey said.

While agents departed Riverside Plaza, ICE raids across the city continued. Community members continued showing up as well, documenting agents’ actions and blowing whistles, just as they had been doing since raids began.

The community’s relentless pursuit is not a coincidence. Across the Twin Cities, individuals and organizations have been preparing for this moment.

The community responds

On the morning of Dec. 5 at the corner of East Lake Street and Stevens Avenue, Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee organizer Alvin was keeping watch. The corner had been a hotspot of ICE activity in recent days, and Alvin was ready to send out the alert if he saw more.

Alvin, who preferred not to use his last name for fear of retaliation, is no stranger to ICE raids. He was present at previous ICE operations in St. Paul and was even shot at with pepper balls by agents.

But what has been happening in the Twin Cities over the past several weeks has proven to be a new challenge, he said.

“These are operations where ICE comes by and tries to pick up just one or two folks off the street,” Alvin said. “Those operations are really hard to stop because once the observers get notice of it and try to go to the location, oftentimes ICE has already left.”

These targeted raids have been occurring throughout the cities, leaving organizers and concerned citizens like Alvin scrambling to keep up. The shorter duration and more isolated nature of these raids mean that community members can no longer afford to wait to receive news of operations.

“We are now trying to be more proactive,” he said. “It’s very hard to get notice and then go out to the situation, so we’re being more proactive by stationing MIRAC members at particular hotspots across the city so they can observe and be immediately ready to act should something happen.”

The increase in observers is not reserved for MIRAC or even community organizations.

Up the street at Karmel Mall, Miri Villerius was stationed on the corner of West Lake Street and Pillsbury Avenue, keeping watch. They had been there since 4:45 a.m., looking for ICE.

They were representing no organization or community group, only themself.

A popular destination for South Minneapolis’ Somali population, Karmel Mall was a likely target for federal agents, and not only for Somalis. The day before, Villerius responded to an attempted detention of a Hispanic man, who was ultimately let go.

Villerius is not alone in their efforts, both at Karmel Mall and throughout the cities. A series of Signal chats has emerged for individuals like him to share information about ICE activity and mobilize community members to the scene.

With these networks, individuals have taken to the streets in high-risk areas to keep watch for ICE agents and spread information they capture of their activity. When ICE operations are confirmed, community responders may be called for support, as was the case at Riverside Plaza.

There are other organization-led response networks as well. MIRAC, the Immigrant Defense Network, Unidos and Monarca all have their own response networks to mobilize responders to ICE operations.

As raids continue throughout Minneapolis and St. Paul, this response continues to be tested.

Making sense of the chaos

At the University, the SSA has been left to pick up the pieces of a difficult situation. As president, that responsibility has fallen heavily on Munye.

“It’s been a rollercoaster,” he said.

Munye said the organization took its time releasing a statement on the ICE raids, wanting to ensure it was doing its best to provide accurate information and helpful resources for the community. Being in a position of suddenly having to educate the community on how to protect themselves was not something they had anticipated.

“We’re not a political group or anything like that, we’re just a bunch of students,” Munye said.

“That means that us, as board members, we have to find the answers for ourselves.”

On Saturday, however, at nearby Augsburg University, a student was targeted by ICE agents on campus grounds.

Given the close relationship between the University and the surrounding community, students are on high alert. What happens outside the University boundaries can easily make an impact inside as well, something Jaylani Hussein understands in his role at CAIR.

“They [students] are worried about their family,” Hussein said. “Their parents might have different statuses and they were born here, so that’s important.”

For Munye, the attacks against the Somali community have been difficult and certainly unfair. He says the hateful rhetoric and actions they have been facing are not a reflection of the truth.

“All the immigrants he’s targeting, we escaped war; there’s a bunch of doctors and business owners in my community,” Munye said. “These are really people who strive to do good for their community.”

Munye believes they will once again prevail here.

“We’re taking a lot of wounds,” he said. “But I know my community, and I know there’s nothing we can’t come back from.”",https://mndaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/icesomali.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 10:59:41.583404

This story about the Justice Department was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.","The 10-year-old was dragged down a school hallway by two school staffers. A camera captured him being forced into a small, empty room with a single paper-covered window.

The staffers shut the door in his face. Alone, the boy curled into a ball on the floor. When school employees returned more than 10 minutes later, blood from his face smeared the floor.

Maryland state lawmakers were shown this video in 2017 by Leslie Seid Margolis, a lawyer with the advocacy group Disability Rights Maryland. She’d spent 15 years advocating for a ban on the practice known as seclusion, in which children, typically those with disabilities, are involuntarily isolated and confined, often after emotional outbursts.

Even after seeing the video, no legislators were willing to go as far as a ban. Nor were they when Margolis tried again a few years later.

In 2021, however, the federal Justice Department concluded an investigation into a Maryland school district and found more than 7,000 cases of unnecessary restraint and seclusion in a two-and-a-half-year period.

Four months later, Maryland lawmakers passed a bill prohibiting seclusion in the state’s public schools, with nearly unanimous support.

“I can’t really overstate the impact that Justice can have,” said Margolis. “They have this authority that is really helpful to those of us who are on the ground doing this work.”

Within the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division is a small office devoted to educational issues, including seclusion, as well as desegregation and racial harassment. The division intentionally chooses cases with potential for high impact and actively monitors places it has investigated to ensure they’re following through with changes. When the Educational Opportunities Section acts, educators and policymakers take notice.

Now, however, the Trump administration is wielding the power of the Justice Department in new and, some say, extreme ways. Hundreds of career staffers, including most of those who worked on education cases, have resigned. The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights also has been decimated, largely through layoffs. The two offices traditionally have worked closely together to enforce civil rights protections for students. The result is a potentially lasting shift in how the nation’s top law enforcement agency handles issues that affect public school students, including millions who have disabilities.

“There are those who would say that this is an aberration, and that when it’s over, things will go back to the way they were,” said Frederick Lawrence, a lecturer at Georgetown Law and former assistant U.S. attorney under President Ronald Reagan. “My experience is that the river only flows in one direction, and things never go back to the way they were.”

The Justice Department’s lawyers historically have worked on a few dozen education cases at once, concentrating on combating sexual harassment, racial discrimination against Black and Latino students, restraint and seclusion, and failure to provide adequate services to English learners.

In the last 11 months, however, the agency has sued over and opened investigations into concerns about antisemitism, transgender policies and bias against white people at schools. It sued at least six states for offering discounted tuition to undocumented immigrants and pressured the president of the University of Virginia to resign as part of an investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies. And it joined other federal departments to form a special Title IX investigations team to protect students from what the administration called the “pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.”

As the Educational Opportunity Section’s mission shifted, it shrunk in size. In January, before President Donald Trump took office, about 40 lawyers tackled education issues. In the spring, the U.S. Senate confirmed Harmeet Dhillon as leader of the Civil Rights Division. Dhillon founded the conservative Center for American Liberty, which describes itself as “defending civil liberties of Americans left behind by civil rights legacy organizations.”

After her confirmation, staff who weren’t political appointees began resigning en masse, concerned Dhillon would promote only the administration’s agenda.

By June, no more than five of the 40 lawyers were left, according to former employees. Some new staff have been hired or reassigned to the section, but the head count remains well below usual. It’s far from enough to sustain the typical workload, said Shaheena Simons, who was chief of the Educational Opportunities Section until she resigned in April. “There’s just no way the division can function with that level of staffing. It’s just impossible,” said Simons, who took over the section in 2016. “The investigations aren’t going to happen. Remedies aren’t going to be sought.”

Department officials responded to a list of questions from The Hechinger Report about changes to their handling of student civil rights protection with “no comment.”

The Department of Justice, including its educational work, has always been somewhat subject to White House interests, said Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom. During President Joe Biden’s term, for example, the agency pursued allegations of discrimination against transgender students, reflecting administration priorities.

McCluskey added, though, that the Trump administration is more aggressive in how it is pursuing its goals and is bypassing typical protocols, noting that in many cases “it’s like they’ve already decided the outcome.”

Related: Which schools and colleges are being investigated by the Trump administration?

An investigation into allegations of antisemitism at the University of California, Los Angeles, for instance, took just 81 days before the department concluded the school had violated federal law. DOJ investigations typically have taken years, not months, to complete.

Lawrence, who also serves as president of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, said he could not speak to specific investigations, but the UCLA timeline “does suggest a rather accelerated process.”

A federal judge recently ruled that the administration could not use the findings from its UCLA investigation as a reason to fine the university $1.2 billion, which if paid would have unlocked frozen federal research funding. She wrote that the administration was using a playbook “of initiating civil rights investigations of preeminent universities to justify cutting off federal funding.”

As new investigations are opened, older ones remain unresolved, including one of practices in Colorado’s Douglas County Public Schools.

In 2022, Disability Law Colorado submitted a complaint to the Justice Department about the district’s use of seclusion, as well as restraint, where school employees physically restrict a student’s movement.

The following year, three other families sued the school system, alleging racial discrimination against their children. The students were repeatedly called monkeys and the N-word, threatened with lynchings and “made by teachers to argue the benefits of Jim Crow laws,” according to the complaint.

The Department of Justice decided to investigate both issues. Four staffers were assigned to the restraint and seclusion investigation, said Emily Harvey, co-legal director at Disability Law Colorado.

As part of the inquiry, Justice officials visited the district twice. The second time was during the final week of Biden’s presidency.

After that visit, Douglas County didn’t hear anything about the investigation from the Trump administration until a mid-May email. “Good morning,” it read. “We are having some staffing changes.”

The email, which The Hechinger Report obtained through a public records request, said that going forward, the district could contact two staffers on the restraint and seclusion case. The racial harassment case would be reduced to only one employee until another Justice staffer returned from leave in the fall.

One Douglas County parent, who asked her name be withheld because she is afraid of retaliation from the district, said that although she knew the investigation could take a couple of years, the longer it goes without a resolution, the more children could be harmed.

“The justice system is just moving so incredibly slow,” she said.

The parent said she knows of dozens of families who have dealt with restraint and seclusion issues in the district. Her own son, she said, was secluded in kindergarten. “He was scared of the person who put him in there. He kept saying, ‘I can’t go back,’” she said. “I never envisioned, until my son was secluded, a world where the school would not care about my child.”

When Harvey, of Disability Law Colorado, first contacted the Department of Justice, she hoped for statewide reform. She wanted to see a ban on seclusion, like Margolis had helped secure in Maryland, and for the state to commit to more accurate tracking of use of restraints. The way Colorado law is written, restraints must be recorded only if they last more than a minute. Douglas County, the second largest in the state with 62,000 students, reported 582 restraints to the Colorado Department of Education in the 2023-24 school year. The number of shorter-term restraints, however, is unknown.

“We believe this is an arbitrary distinction,” Harvey said. “My hope was that the Department of Justice would potentially weigh in on that as a violation” of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Douglas County school administrators said in a statement to The Hechinger Report that their “focus is on taking care of each and every one of our students” and that they take all concerns seriously.

They have worked with the federal government to set up school visits and interviews during their visits, according to emails from January.

Subsequent emails between district and federal officials describe a phone call over the summer and requests for additional documents. Another DOJ employee was included in the messages.

There are signs that the Justice Department is not abandoning restraint and seclusion work, said Guy Stephens, founder of the national advocacy group Alliance Against Seclusion and Restraint. A webpage about previous cases that was removed after Trump took office has been restored, and in July, the DOJ announced a settlement with a Michigan district over these issues.

Yet Stephens has concerns. “There are still people very, very dedicated to this work and the mission of this work, but it’s very hard to work in a system that is shifting and reprioritizing,” he said.

Former DOJ employees worry that it might not only be future investigations that are markedly different. The department has historically monitored places where it has reached agreements that demand corrective action, rewriting them if districts or colleges fail to live up to their promises. It also provides support to achieve the new goals. Now, provisions written into past resolutions might be at odds with Trump administration actions, and oversight of some settlements is ending early.

Take, for instance, a DOJ investigation into Vermont’s Elmore-Morristown Unified Union School District over allegations of race-based harassment against Black students. Investigators found that the district didn’t have a way to handle harassment or discrimination not targeted at a specific person, according to David Bickford, the school board chairman.

As part of a settlement agreement signed two weeks before Trump was inaugurated, the district agreed to provide staff training on implicit bias. A Trump executive order, however, calls for eliminating federal funding for anyone that discusses such a concept in schools.

Bickford said that the district has complied with everything the settlement called for, including professional development.

The investigation itself, he said, was extremely thorough, and required handing over nearly a thousand pages of documentation. Since then, the district has sent regular reports to the department but has not received any lengthy response or input, Bickford said. He also noted there had been staffing changes in who the district reports to.

Justice officials decided to end supervision of a 2023 settlement early following a racial harassment investigation in another Vermont district, Twin Valley. The original plan was to monitor the district for three years. In October 2024, investigators visited the district to check in. In a letter two months later, officials noted that while Twin Valley had made significant progress, they still had several areas of concern, including how the district investigated complaints, as well as “persistent biased language and behavior on the basis of multiple protected classifications; a pervasive culture of sexism; and lack of consistent and effective adult response to biased language and behavior.”

Even so, the department was pleased overall with its visit, said Bill Bazyk, superintendent of Windham Southwest Supervisory Union, which includes Twin Valley. “But things certainly sped up after the election,” said Bazyk, who started his job after the case had been settled.

Throughout the spring, Bayzk and his staff checked in with the department, and in May the district was told oversight of the settlement would end a year early, as Twin Valley had fully complied with the terms.

“We were doing all the right things,” Bayzk said, noting that the district’s work on diversity and equity is ongoing. “We took the settlement very seriously.”

The investigation began in 2021 after the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont filed a complaint. Legal Director Lia Ernst said it is possible that Twin Valley resolved those lingering problems between December and May, stressing that it’s impossible to know from the outside. But still, she said, there is a larger pattern of ambivalence to the Justice Department’s approach to civil rights complaints.

“It is disappointing to see that one ending early,” she said. “It is my hope that it is ending early because Twin Valley has made so much progress, but it is my fear that it is ending early because DOJ just doesn’t care.”

And senior politicians advocated the deportation of longtime U.K. residents born abroad.

The overt demonization of immigrants and those with immigrant roots is intensifying in the U.K. — and across Europe — as migration shoots up the political agenda and right-wing parties gain popularity.

In several European countries, political parties that favor mass deportations and depict immigration as a threat to national identity come at or near the top of opinion polls: Reform U.K., the Alliance for Germany and France’s National Rally.

President Donald Trump, who recently called Somali immigrants in the U.S. “garbage” and whose national security strategy depicts European countries as threatened by immigration, appears to be endorsing and emboldening Europe's coarse, anti-immigrant sentiments.

Amid the rising tensions, Europe's mainstream parties are taking a harder line on migration and at times using divisive language about race.

“What were once dismissed as being at the far extreme end of far-right politics has now become a central part of the political debate,” said Kieran Connell, a lecturer in British history at Queen’s University Belfast.

Immigration has risen dramatically over the past decade in some European countries, driven in part by millions of asylum-seekers who have come to Europe fleeing conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine.

Asylum-seekers account for a small percentage of total immigration, however, and experts say antipathy toward diversity and migration stems from a mix of factors. Economic stagnation in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the rise of charismatic nationalist politicians and the polarizing influence of social media all play a role, experts say.

In Britain, there is “a frightening increase in the sense of national division and decline” and that tends to push people toward political extremes, said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Unit at King’s College London. It took root after the financial crisis, was reinforced by Britain's debate about Brexit and deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Duffy said.

Social media has exacerbated the mood, notably on X, whose algorithm promotes divisive content and whose owner, Elon Musk, approvingly retweets far-right posts.

Across Europe, ethnonationalism has been promoted by right-wing parties such as Alliance for Germany, France’s National Rally and the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Now it appears to have the stamp of approval from the Trump administration, whose new national security strategy depicts Europe as a collection of countries facing “economic decline” and “civilizational erasure” because of immigration and loss of national identities.

The hostile language alarmed many European politicians, but also echoed what they hear from their countries' far-right parties.

National Rally leader Jordan Bardella told the BBC he largely agreed with the Trump administration’s concern that mass immigration was “shaking the balance of European countries.”

Policies once considered extreme are now firmly on the political agenda. Reform UK, the hard-right party that consistently leads opinion polls, says if it wins power it will strip immigrants of permanent-resident status even if they have lived in the U.K. for decades. The center-right opposition Conservatives say they will deport British citizens with dual nationality who commit crimes.

A Reform UK lawmaker complained in October that advertisements were “full of Black people, full of Asian people.” Conservative justice spokesman Robert Jenrick remarked with concern that he “didn’t see another white face” in an area of Birmingham, Britain’s second-largest city Neither politician had to resign.

Many proponents of reduced immigration say they are concerned about integration and community cohesion, not race. But that's not how it feels to those on the receiving end of racial abuse.

“There is no doubt it has worsened,” said Dawn Butler, a Black British lawmaker who says the vitriol she receives on social media “is increasing drastically, and has escalated into death threats.”

U.K. government statistics show police in England and Wales recorded more than 115,000 hate crimes in the year to March 2025, a 2% increase over the previous 12 months.

In July 2024, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim violence erupted on Britain’s streets after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Authorities said online misinformation wrongly identifying the U.K.-born teenage attacker as a Muslim migrant played a part.

In Ireland and in the Netherlands, protesters often demonstrate outside municipal meetings in communities where a new asylum center is proposed. Some protests have turned violent, with opponents of asylum-seekers throwing fireworks at riot police.

Across Europe, the main focus of protests has been hotels and other housing for asylum-seekers, which some say become magnets for crime and bad behavior. But the agenda of protest organizers is often much wider.

In September, more than 100,000 people chanting “We want our country back” marched through London in a protest organized by a far-right activist and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson. Among the speakers was French far-right politician Eric Zemmour, who told the crowd that France and the U.K. both faced “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture.”

Mainstream European politicians condemn the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Britain’s center-left Labour Party government has denounced racism and says migration is an important part of Britain’s national story.

At the same time, it is taking a tougher line on immigration, announcing policies to make it harder for migrants to settle permanently. The government says it is inspired by Denmark, which has seen asylum applications plummet since it started giving refugees only short-term residence.

Denmark and Britain are among a group of European countries pushing to weaken legal protections for migrants and make deportations easier.

Human rights advocates argue that attempts to appease the right just lead to ever-more-extreme policies.

“For every inch yielded, there’s going to be another inch demanded,” Council of Europe human rights commissioner Michael O’Flaherty told The Guardian. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around?”

Politicians of the political center also have been criticized for adopting the language of the far right. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in May that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers,” a phrase that echoed a notorious 1968 anti-immigration speech by the politician Enoch Powell. Starmer later said he had been unaware of the echo and regretted using the phrase.

Germany’s center-right Chancellor Friedrich Merz has hardened his language on migrants as the Alternative for Germany has grown more powerful. Merz caused an uproar in October by saying Germany had a problem with its “Stadtbild,” a word that translates as “city image” or cityscape. Critics felt Merz was implying that people who don’t look German don’t truly belong.

Merz later stressed that “we need immigration,” without which certain sectors of the economy, including health care, would cease to function.

Duffy said politicians should be responsible and consider how their rhetoric shapes public attitudes — though he added that's “quite a forlorn hope.”

""The perception that this divisiveness works has taken hold,” he said.

And senior politicians advocated the deportation of longtime U.K. residents born abroad.

The overt demonization of immigrants and those with immigrant roots is intensifying in the U.K. — and across Europe — as migration shoots up the political agenda and right-wing parties gain popularity.

In several European countries, political parties that favor mass deportations and depict immigration as a threat to national identity come at or near the top of opinion polls: Reform U.K., the Alliance for Germany and France’s National Rally.

President Donald Trump, who recently called Somali immigrants in the U.S. “garbage” and whose national security strategy depicts European countries as threatened by immigration, appears to be endorsing and emboldening Europe's coarse, anti-immigrant sentiments.

Amid the rising tensions, Europe's mainstream parties are taking a harder line on migration and at times using divisive language about race.

“What were once dismissed as being at the far extreme end of far-right politics has now become a central part of the political debate,” said Kieran Connell, a lecturer in British history at Queen’s University Belfast.

Europe experiencing a growing sense of division

Immigration has risen dramatically over the past decade in some European countries, driven in part by millions of asylum-seekers who have come to Europe fleeing conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine.

Asylum-seekers account for a small percentage of total immigration, however, and experts say antipathy toward diversity and migration stems from a mix of factors. Economic stagnation in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the rise of charismatic nationalist politicians and the polarizing influence of social media all play a role, experts say.

In Britain, there is “a frightening increase in the sense of national division and decline” and that tends to push people toward political extremes, said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Unit at King’s College London. It took root after the financial crisis, was reinforced by Britain's debate about Brexit and deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Duffy said.

Social media has exacerbated the mood, notably on X, whose algorithm promotes divisive content and whose owner, Elon Musk, approvingly retweets far-right posts.

Across Europe, ethnonationalism has been promoted by right-wing parties such as Alliance for Germany, France’s National Rally and the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Now it appears to have the stamp of approval from the Trump administration, whose new national security strategy depicts Europe as a collection of countries facing “economic decline” and “civilizational erasure” because of immigration and loss of national identities.

The hostile language alarmed many European politicians, but also echoed what they hear from their countries' far-right parties.

National Rally leader Jordan Bardella told the BBC he largely agreed with the Trump administration’s concern that mass immigration was “shaking the balance of European countries.”

Racist rhetoric and hate crimes on the rise

Policies once considered extreme are now firmly on the political agenda. Reform UK, the hard-right party that consistently leads opinion polls, says if it wins power it will strip immigrants of permanent-resident status even if they have lived in the U.K. for decades. The center-right opposition Conservatives say they will deport British citizens with dual nationality who commit crimes.

A Reform UK lawmaker complained in October that advertisements were “full of Black people, full of Asian people.” Conservative justice spokesman Robert Jenrick remarked with concern that he “didn’t see another white face” in an area of Birmingham, Britain’s second-largest city Neither politician had to resign.

Many proponents of reduced immigration say they are concerned about integration and community cohesion, not race. But that's not how it feels to those on the receiving end of racial abuse.

“There is no doubt it has worsened,” said Dawn Butler, a Black British lawmaker who says the vitriol she receives on social media “is increasing drastically, and has escalated into death threats.”

U.K. government statistics show police in England and Wales recorded more than 115,000 hate crimes in the year to March 2025, a 2% increase over the previous 12 months.

In July 2024, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim violence erupted on Britain’s streets after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Authorities said online misinformation wrongly identifying the U.K.-born teenage attacker as a Muslim migrant played a part.

In Ireland and in the Netherlands, protesters often demonstrate outside municipal meetings in communities where a new asylum center is proposed. Some protests have turned violent, with opponents of asylum-seekers throwing fireworks at riot police.

Across Europe, the main focus of protests has been hotels and other housing for asylum-seekers, which some say become magnets for crime and bad behavior. But the agenda of protest organizers is often much wider.

In September, more than 100,000 people chanting “We want our country back” marched through London in a protest organized by a far-right activist and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson. Among the speakers was French far-right politician Eric Zemmour, who told the crowd that France and the U.K. both faced “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture.”

Outflanking the right

Mainstream European politicians condemn the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Britain’s center-left Labour Party government has denounced racism and says migration is an important part of Britain’s national story.

At the same time, it is taking a tougher line on immigration, announcing policies to make it harder for migrants to settle permanently. The government says it is inspired by Denmark, which has seen asylum applications plummet since it started giving refugees only short-term residence.

Denmark and Britain are among a group of European countries pushing to weaken legal protections for migrants and make deportations easier.

Human rights advocates argue that attempts to appease the right just lead to ever-more-extreme policies.

“For every inch yielded, there’s going to be another inch demanded,” Council of Europe human rights commissioner Michael O’Flaherty told The Guardian. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around?”

Calls for calmer rhetoric

Politicians of the political center also have been criticized for adopting the language of the far right. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in May that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers,” a phrase that echoed a notorious 1968 anti-immigration speech by the politician Enoch Powell. Starmer later said he had been unaware of the echo and regretted using the phrase.

Germany’s center-right Chancellor Friedrich Merz has hardened his language on migrants as the Alternative for Germany has grown more powerful. Merz caused an uproar in October by saying Germany had a problem with its “Stadtbild,” a word that translates as “city image” or cityscape. Critics felt Merz was implying that people who don’t look German don’t truly belong.

Merz later stressed that “we need immigration,” without which certain sectors of the economy, including health care, would cease to function.

Duffy said politicians should be responsible and consider how their rhetoric shapes public attitudes — though he added that's “quite a forlorn hope.”

""The perception that this divisiveness works has taken hold,” he said.

Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling along the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, people gathered with paintings of Our Lady of Guadalupe on her feast day, Dec. 12, for a special prayer service for those detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Auxiliary Bishop Kevin T. Kenney of St. Paul and Minneapolis and Father Christopher Collins from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul led the prayer service, which was held as federal officials conducted an immigration enforcement effort in the Twin Cities.

Barred from entering building

A parent of a local Catholic school student was apprehended by ICE the same day. A monthly prayer service is common at the Whipple Federal Building, but Dec. 12 many prayer members were surprised to find they were barred from entering. Security staff asked them to move off the building’s grounds. The request for a permit had been denied.

About a block from their usual spot for prayer, a tall evergreen tree protected about 40 people from below-zero windchill. Members of parishes such as the Basilica of St. Mary and Ascension, both in Minneapolis, huddled together and prayed a decade of the rosary — led by Bishop Kenney — sang hymns, and offered each other words of encouragement.

After the rosary, Bishop Kenney asked the group, “What’s the best way to get rid of ice on your sidewalks?” The answer was salt.

Salt in the Old Testament

“In the Old Testament, you sprinkle that salt, you rid the area of evil and bad happenings,” Bishop Kenney said. “I would recommend you bring salt to church with you and have it blessed and share it with your neighbors to sprinkle around homes, parishes, cars. It does offer protection. … Maybe if we put salt on the sidewalk, the ice will disappear.”

Evangeline Dhawan-Maloney, an associate attorney at a local law firm, and the attorney representing the person apprehended by ICE, stopped by the prayer service to thank everyone for their support. She said the individual was being detained in Brainerd.

Family is ‘pretty torn up’

“I know her family really appreciates it,” Dhawan-Maloney said. “They’re pretty torn up right now. … I don’t know if there’s going to be a lot of options for her, to be honest.”

Father Collins told those gathered that the opposite of chaos is not order, but community, such as the one gathered in the cold outside the federal building.

Marking the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Bishop Kenney joined Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda and Bishop Michael Izen of St. Paul and Minneapolis in releasing a video Dec.12 reminding immigrants and their families that the Catholic Church stands beside them.

“Our Catholic faith teaches that every person is made in the image of God,” Archbishop Hebda said in the video. “And deserves respect, dignity and care.”

Our Lady of Guadalupe ‘walks with us’

“In this beautiful celebration of Our Lady of Guadalupe, we remember that she walks with us, especially with those who left their homeland in search of a better future,” Bishop Kenney said in the video.

During the prayer service, Bishop Kenney reminded those gathered of what Our Lady of Guadalupe said to St. Juan Diego. “Am I not here, I who am your mother?”

People lit candles and sang “Sancta Maria.” Several cried and embraced each other. After the prayers and hymns Bishop Kenney blessed the images of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

He didn’t earn much in Colombia and had a daughter to look after. He crossed the Darién Gap with an injured knee; he paid bribes to cartels in Mexico so that he would be allowed to continue his journey. Even so, he emphasizes, nothing compares to what he experienced at the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), the mega-prison in El Salvador built by President Nayib Bukele. That’s where he was sent — along with more than 200 other men — after being accused by U.S. President Donald Trump of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.

“I have nothing to do with it, nor have I ever had anything to do with it,” he says, in a park in northern Bogotá, after almost five months of freedom. “It’s been very hard to go back to normal life. It’s like starting from scratch.”

The Colombian-Venezuelan spent about a year in the United States. After applying for asylum, he lived between Los Angeles and Miami, doing various jobs: repairing cars, washing dishes, making deliveries and working in construction.

In January 2025, he had a court date in California, in order to determine his immigration status. He went, hoping to finally regularize his situation. “They took me into a room and told me to wait a while. Without warning, four immigration agents came in, slammed me against the wall and handcuffed me. I explained that I hadn’t done anything, but they didn’t care.”

Palencia says they took him to a basement, where other migrants were being held in a kind of makeshift jail. They allowed him to make a single phone call to notify his family about his arrest. Agents then took him to a detention center in the border city of Calexico, California. There, along with other Venezuelans, he learned that they were being linked to the Tren de Aragua gang. The only basis for this? Their origins and their tattoos.

According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) — one of the largest civil rights organizations in the U.S. — there’s an arbitrary profiling system in place. If a Venezuelan migrant has tattoos of ordinary images — such as a clock, a crown, or a star — ICE may suspect them of being a gang member.

In early-March, U.S. authorities promised Palencia and his cellmates that they would soon be deported to Venezuela. By the middle of the month, they were on a plane to go home. Or so they thought.

Unbeknownst to them, President Trump had reached an agreement with his Salvadoran counterpart — Nayib Bukele — to deport more than 200 migrants to the Central American country under an 18th-century law that allows for the expulsion of “alien enemies” without judicial oversight. This meant that U.S. authorities never had to prove that the men were criminals.

Humanitarian organizations point out that half of those deported had no criminal record. The legality of this action — ordered by the White House — remains in dispute.

“The agents who were with us told us that we were going to Venezuela. We were happy and calm… even though our hands, feet and waists were tied up. On the first landing, they told us we had arrived in Honduras for a technical stop. The plane took off again, but touched down about 30 minutes later. We didn’t understand what was happening,” Palencia recounts. “We opened the windows and saw the army, riot police, trucks, armored vehicles…”

They were forcibly removed from the plane, beaten and taken to CECOT. In this mega-prison — according to several NGOs — hundreds of gang members are incarcerated and subjected to human rights violations.

Palencia had heard about this facility on TikTok. He knew gang members were imprisoned there, but he didn’t know that it was “a hellhole.”

As soon as they arrived at CECOT, the Salvadoran agents changed them into white uniforms and shaved their heads. “They told us that we were going to spend the rest of our lives there. That no one came out alive.” The routine consisted of waking up at 4 a.m., taking a shower and spending almost the entire rest of the day sitting in silence until bedtime, at around 9 p.m. If the prisoners made any noise or didn’t stick to the established schedule, the guards punished them without mercy.

The moments Palencia remembers most vividly are when the inmates tried to protest their detention. “We went on a hunger strike and a blood strike [self-inflicted wounds]; we rioted to keep the guards from entering our cellblock. But they came in anyway. Once, they used pepper spray on us, which [temporarily] blinded me and set my whole body on fire. They also hit me in the face with a baton. It opened a deep cut on my eyebrow, which a nurse closed without anesthesia,” he recounts.

Today, Palencia considers himself to be among the lucky ones. Several of his cellmates were hit at point-blank range by rubber bullets, causing serious injuries, as documented in a report published by Human Rights Watch.

Palencia was also on “the island” — the nickname for the isolation and torture cell at CECOT. “They dragged me in as I was bent over, almost licking the floor. The only thing I could see before they started kicking and hitting me with batons were their black boots. I had to pretend to faint for them to stop,” he recalls. “The island,” as he remembers it, has a few cells and a tiny opening, with a bit of light coming through. Each cell consists of a toilet and a small cement bed.

His release was sudden and without warning. It was July 18. “Around 3 a.m., some guards arrived and ordered us to shower. We couldn’t be sure, but several of us started celebrating and crying because it was very likely that we would be freed.” Indeed, this turned out to be the case.

That night, Palencia didn’t sleep in the cell where he had been held for what felt like years. He slept in a hotel in La Guaira, near Caracas. The horror was over. Trump had reached an agreement with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s government to exchange more than 200 migrants for prisoners in Venezuelan jails, including several U.S. citizens.

Looking back, he doesn’t hesitate to call what happened to him “the worst experience” of his life. “Being tortured for four months when you’re innocent is truly a nightmare,” he asserts. Palencia denounces the U.S. government’s policy on migrants, specifically Venezuelans. “They say we’re criminals, but they’re the real criminals.”

After a few months in Venezuela, he returned to Bogotá, where his parents and daughter live. “I cried with joy when we were reunited. I could only thank God for being with her again,” he sighs.

Otherwise, his return to freedom has been marked by uncertainty. “It’s been tough. I went [to the United States] with a purpose, to be able to [work and] buy the things [we needed]. Going back means starting from scratch. And I’m worse off than before I left: I came out [of the prison] with a diabetes problem. Because of the beatings, my arm can’t handle heavy work,” he laments.

Aside from the physical ailments, he says that he’s not sleeping very much. He sometimes wakes up in a daze. He drives a motorcycle for ride-hailing apps and delivery services, in order to continue supporting his family. When asked if he would consider returning to the United States, Palencia is emphatic: “If they give me papers, yes. But I’m never going back to prison.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GMX23D3TCFAVZCUXYIVXDWZFSI.jpg?auth=24ddab273bdb9cddcf4ee0a385fef867f1ee447adf7da9645e1bb3624ae86eb7&width=1200,N,,2025-12-14 01:56:50.842887

Before Trump, ICE didn’t get involved with domestic travel—and the TSA didn’t concern itself with immigration matters. But since March, according to a new report by The New York Times, the two agencies have quietly been working together to apprehend people at the airport at the command of the Trump administration.

According to the Times, it’s not clear how many arrests have been made so far. But the paper obtained documents that show the program led to the arrest of 19-year-old Any Lucía López Belloza, who was picked up at Boston Logan Airport when trying to visit her family in Texas for Thanksgiving. Two days later, López was deported to Honduras, where she had not been since she was 7 years old.

According to former ICE officials interviewed by the Times, the program can help the agency meet its high deportation quotas—plus, it allows agents to quickly deport those caught, like López.

“The administration has turned routine travel into a force multiplier for removals, potentially identifying thousands who thought they could evade the law simply by boarding a plane,” said former deputy head of ICE in New York City, Scott Mechkowski.

Since Trump took office in January, many in the U.S. have been living in fear. Trump’s deportation campaign has led to the arrest and detention of immigrants and citizens alike. People have been grabbed by ICE off the street, from their apartments, from their places of work. Now, the airport is another place that’s no longer safe.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, expressed no remorse for the position she’s put people in. “The message to those in the country illegally is clear: The only reason you should be flying is to self-deport home,” she said.

In the wee hours of Saturday morning, the president laid into Republicans who voted against his gerrymandering campaign in Indiana. Perhaps unable to sleep due to the crushing sting of defeat, Donald Trump took to Truth Social close to 1 a.m. to mock and threaten the state’s legislators.

“Republicans in the Indiana State Senate, who voted against a Majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, should be ashamed of themselves,” Trump wrote. “Headed by a total loser named Rod Bray, every one of these people should be “primaried,” and I will be there to help! Indiana, which I won big, is the only state in the Union to do this!”

On Thursday, Indiana lawmakers voted down Trump’s midcycle redistricting push, choosing to keep election maps the same rather than gerrymander them to Republicans’ advantage. For weeks leading up to the vote, the president had been bullying the Hoosier state’s lawmakers in an attempt to shore up support.

After the vote, Trump turned his fury on state Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, the main opponent to redistricting. Bray believes the state should instead work on flipping a preexisting district rather than blowing up the whole map—a risky move that would narrow Republicans’ margins in the new districts, and could even result in a loss of seats, he told Politico.

Trump has made it clear that if a Republican is unwilling to follow his agenda to the letter, he’ll put his weight behind a primary challenger. Hours before the vote Thursday, he posted, “Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.”

Republicans are scrambling for a next move after President Donald Trump’s humiliating failure to bully Indiana lawmakers into bending to the president’s gerrymandering scheme.

On Thursday, Indiana lawmakers rejected the president’s push for midcycle redistricting in the Hoosier State to ensure Republican victory in the 2026 midterms. Indiana Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith claimed that the Trump administration had even threatened to withhold federal funding if they refused—but lawmakers wouldn’t budge.

With the midterms fast approaching and the Republican Party’s prospects looking increasingly grim, Trump’s allies have started to discuss where to turn up the heat next.

“Nebraska and Kansas are two top targets,” wrote Tyler Bowyer, chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, the advocacy arm of Charlie Kirk’s organization, in a post on X Friday.

But even he had to admit that Republicans faced some challenges in those states. “Nebraska did not help the President by passing winner-take-all last year. Not a great sign for redistricting. Kansas is controlled by the Koch HQ,” Bowyer wrote.

In Nebraska, the unicameral legislature requires the support of every Republican to advance redistricting, but 83-year-old state Senator Merv Riepe is not buying in. He previously blocked Trump’s 2024 effort to reshape the state’s split Electoral College vote into a winner-takes-all state, and seems similarly uninterested in supporting his gerrymandering this time around.

“I don’t think it’s a necessity for us,” Riepe said in October.

In Kansas, Republicans haven’t seemed all that anxious to get on board the president’s push for redistricting, either. Republicans will need a two-thirds majority to redraw the maps and override an expected veto from Governor Laura Kelly.

Meanwhile, the Heritage Foundation, the far-right think tank behind Project 2025, this week published a report that listed ending ranked-choice voting as a policy priority in 2026. Michigan is currently the only state circulating a ranked-choice ballot petition, meaning that Republicans are likely to target efforts to impose a new voting system there.

The chair of the Republican National Committee is issuing a dire warning to Republicans: Anticipate losing next November.

The president’s handpicked RNC leader, Joe Gruters, has been preaching the caucus’s impending doom ahead of the 2026 midterms in a transparent attempt to lower expectations. Gruters joined several right-wing podcasts and Christian television networks to spread the word that the GOP is coming up against a “looming disaster.”

“The chances are Republicans will go down and will go down hard,” Gruters said.

“This is an absolute disaster. No matter what party is in power, they usually get crushed in the midterms,” Gruters told Salem News Channel, a new media entity co-owned by Trump’s son Don Jr.

Republicans have had a trifecta in Washington since Donald Trump returned to office, white-knuckling every branch of the federal government. If history is any indicator, that won’t bode well for the party come next year: In a typical midterm cycle, the presidential party loses grounds via midterms, a phenomenon known as the “presidential penalty.” Those are the basic odds, even before Trump’s devastating tariffs and wildly controversial immigration agenda are taken into account.

But early indicators—such as a healthy dose of special elections in the last year—suggest that the national backlash to Trump’s second-term agenda could be worse for the party than usual. Democrats have seen surprising gains in unexpected areas of the country, including in Tennessee, Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

Meanwhile, Republicans seem to be on the verge of panic. Anxious about midterms, the White House has spent months trying to pressure red states to gerrymander their congressional lines to turn a handful of seats in Congress. But so far, the pressure campaign has backfired: On Thursday, Indiana state senators overwhelmingly voted against the effort, citing Trump’s open threats and his crass mouth as their rationale.

Gruters’s comments have similarly raised a stir. The Heritage Foundation’s news site, Townhall, blasted The Bulwark for first publishing Gruters’s opinion, claiming that the “story is FAKE” because the publication had edited out Gruters’s words to eliminate his alleged faith in the caucus. But in doing so, Townhall cut out Gruters’s conclusion: “We are facing almost certain defeat,” he said.

President Donald Trump just got hit with a lawsuit over his enormous $300 million ballroom that would dwarf the White House.

In a 65-page complaint filed Friday, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit organization working to save America’s historic places, argued that Trump did not have the constitutional authority to fast-track construction for a project of this scale, and has violated the Administrative Procedures Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

The lawsuit also notes that Congress is required to approve any construction on federal land, and the White House is located at the White House and President’s Park, a national park.

In October, Trump fired all six members of the Commission on Fine Arts, which is charged with advising the federal government on the art, design, and architectural development of Washington, seeming to clear the way for him to make any changes he likes to the nation’s monuments. A Trump official said the members would be replaced by those who were “more aligned with President Trump’s ‘America First’ policies,” but two months later, the seats still remain empty.

The legal challenge is just the latest issue to complicate Trump’s plans for a behemoth ballroom. Trump has reportedly had a falling-out with his architect, James McCrery II, who argued that the 90,000-square-foot blueprint would overshadow the 55,000-square-foot White House mansion, violating basic architectural principles.

Trump has repeatedly misled the public about the construction process, claiming that the original structure of the White House wouldn’t be touched—before razing the entire East Wing. He also claimed that the project would only cost $200 million, but that number has since ballooned to $300 million.

The privately funded ballroom has presented a golden opportunity for the country’s wealthiest families and biggest corporations to make good with the Trump administration—and a few defense companies like Lockheed Martin and Palantir have also tossed the president some cash for his vanity project.

Trump has repeatedly turned his attention away from actually governing to the destruction of American landmarks. Trump has redone the Oval Office in the gaudy gold style of Mar-a-Lago, added stupid signs and white marble bathrooms to the White House, paved over the Rose Garden, pitched an “Arc de Trump” monument, and the builder in chief recently declared his intention to “fix” the 100-year-old Reflecting Pool on the National Mall in Washington. Fix what, exactly? Your guess is as good as ours.

Unfortunately for Indiana Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith, what he posts on the internet stays forever.

Beckwith deleted a Thursday post that confirmed the Trump administration had threatened to pull federal funding from Indiana if state legislators refused to bend to the president’s gerrymandering scheme.

“The Trump admin was VERY clear about this,” Beckwith wrote in the since-deleted post. “They told many lawmakers, cabinet members and the Gov and I that this would happen. The Indiana Senate made it clear to the Trump Admin today that they do not want to be partners with the WH. The WH made it clear to them that they’d oblige.”

He was responding to another post by the Heritage Foundation, which claimed that Trump would withhold national funding from Indiana if it refused to draw new congressional lines, just five years after approving the last batch of maps.

“Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame,” the official account for the Heritage Foundation wrote.

But Indiana’s Senate did reject the White House’s pressure campaign late Thursday, with 21 Republican senators voting against the scheme. Their rationale for doing so ranged from personal disgust with the president’s language to the personal, violent threats they endured for considering voting against the effort.

Why Beckwith would have felt pressured to delete his post—within hours of making it—is not clear.

Anxious about the 2026 midterms, Trump issued directives to several red states, including Indiana, to redraw their congressional maps in order to bolster Republicans’ razor-thin majority in the House. In Indiana’s case, that unprecedented, long-shot effort would have won the GOP two more seats in the U.S. House.

But so far, bullying lawmakers and barking demands has not been a successful midterm strategy for the Republican leader. Redistricting efforts have crumbled in other red states where Trump issued gerrymandering directives, though not always due to the same ferocious local pushback.

The White House’s propaganda is getting sketchier.

The official X account for the executive mansion released new figures about the economy Thursday, proclaiming that 91 percent of Americans noticed “gas prices were dropping.” The source of that information, however, was from a White House email survey.

Meanwhile, practically every American has felt the ramifications of Donald Trump’s rattling economic policies. The Drudge Report, the most heavily trafficked conservative news aggregator, topped its site Friday with the headline: “POLL: ‘TIS THE SEASON FOR INFLATION.”

The AP-NORC poll found that large shares of American shoppers are dipping into their savings to afford buying presents this holiday season, with half of polled Americans reporting that it’s harder than usual to afford the things they would typically try to buy.

Roughly the same percentage of U.S.-based shoppers said they were cutting back on nonessentials or big purchases in order to afford their needs, according to the poll.

The findings make sense: An analysis by the Groundwork Collective of popular holiday gifts found that prices skyrocketed by a whopping 26 percent this holiday season.

The disparity between the White House’s messaging and what’s actually happening boils down to the president, who has repeatedly insisted without evidence that there is “no” inflation, that the word “groceries” is an “old fashioned” term, and that the issue of affordability is a “con job” and a “fake narrative” invented by Democrats to trick the public into not supporting him.

“When will I get credit for having created, with No Inflation, perhaps the Greatest Economy in the History of our Country? When will people understand what is happening?” Trump whined Thursday on Truth Social. “When will Polls reflect the Greatness of America at this point in time, and how bad it was just one year ago?”

Inflation has been accelerating since April, when Trump first announced his “liberation day” tariffs. Eight months later, practically everything on the U.S. market is more expensive than it used to be, as companies pass off the cost of the president’s tariffs onto consumers. Food and energy costs are up compared to figures from last year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even American-made goods have taken a hit by the tariffs, since more often than not they are created with parts sourced from other areas of the world.

But the commander-in-chief seems to be completely out of touch with that reality. In an interview earlier this week with Politico’s Dasha Burns, Trump remarked that he would rate the current state of the economy “A+++++.”

President Donald Trump still can’t seem to wrap his head around the fact that the United States is a democracy.

While signing an executive order aimed at preventing states from regulating artificial intelligence, Trump whined that states needed to be “unified” on his approach to AI, in order for the country to win global dominance over China.

“We have to be unified. China is unified because they have one vote, that’s President Xi [Jinping]. He says ‘do it,’ and that’s the end of that. You know, we have a different system,” Trump said. “But we have a system that’s good—but we only have a system that’s good if it’s smart.”

As the president spoke, sitting behind his desk, he covered his right hand, where a massive, mysterious bruise has formed.

Meanwhile, the folks watching at home weren’t impressed by Trump’s longing for a unitary government and his dismissal of his own country’s so-called “different system.”

“Yes, it’s called DEMOCRACY,” wrote California Governor Gavin Newsom on X.

This isn’t the first time Trump has longed for another form of government. After visiting China earlier this year, the president said he wished his Cabinet secretaries would greet him with stoic compliance (even though their meetings are already a well-documented spectacle of sycophancy).",https://images.newrepublic.com/669f97794d4e652c5c2b007ccb40d140cadafc41.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-12-13 23:56:28.634567

Since the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington last month, President Trump has clamped down on immigration from Afghanistan. The administration has paused programs Afghans can use to legally come to the U.S., including visas, and has stripped temporary permissions to stay from Afghans who are already here. Among those impacted are Afghan citizens who helped the U.S. during the war. As NPR's Ximena Bustillo reports, some Republicans think these restrictions have gone too far.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Shawn VanDiver is the founder of #AfghanEvac, an organization that advocates for Afghans who supported the U.S. military. He's been tracking how these wartime allies have been impacted by Trump's immigration policies.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SHAWN VANDIVER: Halting asylum decisions, suspending visa processing for Afghans, rereviewing every refugee admitted under the last administration, while fast tracking others they see as more desirable.

BUSTILLO: Some of these changes came after the deadly shooting of a National Guard member allegedly by an Afghan national. The policy changes have highlighted a rift within the GOP over who should be allowed into the United States. Some Republicans still want to extend a legal pathway. Here, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina talking about the aftermath of the shooting.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

THOM TILLIS: It's unfortunate that it happened, but that by itself can't be a reason to shut down any consideration going forward or even reconsidering some of the other ones.

BUSTILLO: Others like Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine agree with the Trump administration that there needs to be more vetting but not that the program should be shut down.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SUSAN COLLINS: There are Afghan citizens who acted as guards, drivers, interpreters, cooks for our troops. So I think the answer is more intensive and careful vetting.

BUSTILLO: And others, like Republican Senator James Lankford, who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, say it's not Congress' job to intervene.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES LANKFORD: Primarily that's an executive branch issue. The vetting process does exist and is out there. It's just a matter of its execution at this point or making...

BUSTILLO: The suspected shooter was approved for asylum earlier this year, but it's unclear what additional vetting could've helped. He had previously worked for a unit of the CIA. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the Afghan national had been radicalized after coming to the U.S. A spokesperson for the department told NPR the safety of the American people always comes first when asked about the policy changes. Still, some advocates, like VanDiver, say Congress is not doing enough to stand up for America's allies after a long war.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VANDIVER: Instead of asserting its constitutional role, Congress has allowed itself to be sidelined, failing to provide meaningful oversight. The vacuum they have left is being filled with fearmongering, not facts, politics, not policy.

BUSTILLO: Some lawmakers had added a bipartisan provision to the national defense policy bill that would've brought back a State Department office that relocates Afghan refugees, but House GOP leaders pulled it out of the bill that they voted on this past week.

According to observers, ICE agents surrounded the site around 10 a.m., blocking access and attempting to detain two construction workers. Video shared with reporters shows a tense but mostly peaceful standoff between agents and roughly 100 demonstrators who arrived after word of the operation spread.

Ann Wiesner, who was on scene, said the crowd remained peaceful despite the nearly 50 federal agents. “There were people there of all different races who were saying, This is not the country I want to live in,” Wiesner said. “There were people of faith there who were praying.”

Democratic State Representative Alex Falconer, who was also on scene, says the way ICE conducted its raid is alarming.

“Immediately, when I showed up, I was asking, Do you have a judicial warrant? Do you have the names of the people you’re looking for?” Falconer said. “They said no. They did not have a warrant, which raises obvious concerns.”

Observers say the operation lasted more than three hours in frigid conditions. Both Falconer and Wiesner say that after spending hours on the roof in the freezing cold, one of the workers was placed on a stretcher by EMS and taken to the hospital with ICE agents following behind.

Now, many in the community, according to immigration advocates, are panicking after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced on Friday that it's terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of Ethiopia. That means any Ethiopians in the United States under the TPS designation have 60 days to leave the country or be subject to deportation.

""It just doesn't make sense,"" said Lidia Tamerat, with the nonprofit Colorado Ethiopian Community. ""We're business owners. We're part of the community.""

She says many Ethiopians immigrated to the United States seeking safety from the civil war that started in 2018, with many immigrating to the U.S. in 2022.

""It was very hard. There is famine. There was killing. There was a lot that was happening. And the country is still very unsettled,"" Tamerat said.

About 4,500 Ethiopian immigrants have been granted TPS designation by the U.S. government so they could resettle and work, according to Congressional data, but those days have come to an end.

Regarding the cancellation, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson said, ""Temporary Protected Status designations are time-limited and were never meant to be a ticket to permanent residency,"" and ""conditions in Ethiopia no longer pose a serious threat to the personal safety of returning Ethiopian nationals.""

The U.S. Department of State has a Level 3 Travel Advisory for Ethiopia right now, saying on its website, ""Reconsider travel to Ethiopia due to sporadic violent conflict, civil unrest, crime, communications disruptions, terrorism and kidnapping in border areas.""

Tamerat says the Ethiopian community is in a state of panic and disagrees that Ethiopia is a safe place to return to.

""For people that have been here since 2022, they've established a life. They're just sending their children to school. A lot of them do have employment authorization cards, so they have started work,"" Tamerat said. ""There's still a lot of ethnic war happening. It's really hard for those that are living there to find jobs, to feed their family. There's still parts of Ethiopia that's facing famine.""

DHS is giving Ethiopians under TPS designation until February 2026 to self-deport. The agency added that if they use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection mobile app to report their departure, they will get a complimentary plane ticket and a $1,000 exit bonus.

“It doesn’t make sense. I’m trying to understand and have faith that there’s some logical explanation behind any of this, but there isn’t. I’m not the first,” she said during a Friday appearance on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”

“I’m surely not going to be the last. There’s thousands of women and families and children being separated daily. Where does it end? When does it stop?” she added.

Ferreira said she believes she was targeted, as police seemed to know her movements and whereabouts. Her attorney told Burnett that she’s been working to apply for her green card after being brought to the United States by her parents at age 6.

“The reality is here that she’s in line for her green card, like tens of thousands of other people. And throughout the country, people are just being illegally arrested when they’re in the middle or the beginning or the end of a lawful process that congress created roughly in the mid ’90s,” her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, said.

“The laws aren’t perfect, but they’re there for a reason. People are entitled to due process of law,” he added.

Earlier this week, an immigration judge ordered Ferreira’s release, however, she still faces scrutiny as the Department of Homeland Security previously alleged she’s a criminal.

Do I not know about it?’ Gossip in school,” she added.

She was originally arrested while attempting to pick up her son, Michael, whom she shares with Leavitt’s brother, in a Boston suburb.

Justice G.R.
The immediate trigger for the impeachment notice was an order passed by Justice Swaminathan in relation to Thiruparankundram in Madurai.
Conclusion The Justice G.R.","Introduction

The proposed Justice G.R. Swaminathan Impeachment has triggered one of the most serious constitutional debates in recent years, bringing into focus the balance between judicial independence and judicial accountability. A notice for his removal, signed by more than 100 opposition Members of Parliament, has been submitted to the Lok Sabha Speaker alleging misconduct and lack of impartiality by a sitting judge of the Madras High Court.

Impeachment of judges is constitutionally permitted but intentionally made extremely difficult. The present controversy therefore raises a fundamental question: can disagreement with judicial reasoning justify invoking the impeachment mechanism?

Who Is Justice G.R. Swaminathan?

Justice G.R. Swaminathan was elevated as a judge of the Madras High Court in 2017. He is known for detailed judgments that frequently engage with constitutional philosophy, legal history, and comparative jurisprudence. His judicial work spans criminal law, constitutional interpretation, religious and cultural disputes, and questions of social justice.

What Triggered the Justice G.R. Swaminathan Impeachment Motion?

The immediate trigger for the impeachment notice was an order passed by Justice Swaminathan in relation to Thiruparankundram in Madurai. The dispute concerned the lighting of a Karthigai Deepam on a traditional stone pillar located near a dargah. The court permitted the lighting of the lamp, which led to political backlash from certain parties.

Critics alleged that the order reflected ideological bias and raised concerns regarding religious neutrality and constitutional secularism.

Allegations Mentioned in the Impeachment Notice

Judicial bias and lack of neutrality

Conduct unbecoming of a constitutional court judge

Violation of secular constitutional principles

Judicial indiscipline in observations and reasoning

Notably, the notice does not allege corruption, bribery, or personal enrichment, which have historically formed the core grounds for impeachment proceedings.

Constitutional Framework for Removal of Judges

Articles 124(4) and 218 of the Constitution govern the removal of judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. A judge may be removed only on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.

Procedure for Impeachment

Notice signed by at least 100 Lok Sabha MPs or 50 Rajya Sabha MPs

Admission of the motion by the Speaker or Chairman

Constitution of a three-member inquiry committee

Proof of charges after investigation

Special majority vote in both Houses of Parliament

Opposition by Former Judges

In response to the Justice G.R. Swaminathan impeachment notice, 56 former judges of the Supreme Court and various High Courts publicly opposed the move. They warned that using impeachment to challenge judicial reasoning threatens judicial independence and could intimidate judges from delivering fearless decisions.

They emphasized that the proper remedy against incorrect or controversial judgments lies in appeal or review, not impeachment.

Judicial Independence vs Judicial Accountability

The controversy highlights a constitutional tension. Judicial independence protects judges from political retaliation and allows them to decide cases without fear. Judicial accountability ensures ethical conduct and adherence to constitutional values.

The central issue is whether disagreement with a judge’s interpretative approach can amount to constitutional misbehaviour.

Historical Perspective on Impeachment in India

India has witnessed very few impeachment attempts against judges, and none have resulted in removal through parliamentary vote. In past cases, allegations involved financial impropriety or abuse of office rather than dissatisfaction with judicial reasoning.

Legal Significance of the Justice G.R. Swaminathan Impeachment Attempt

It focuses on judicial reasoning rather than corruption

It risks expanding the meaning of proved misbehaviour

It may weaken the separation of powers doctrine

It could have a chilling effect on judicial independence

What Happens Next?

The Speaker of the Lok Sabha will decide whether to admit the impeachment motion. If admitted, an inquiry committee will be formed to examine whether the allegations meet the high constitutional threshold required for removal.

Conclusion

The Justice G.R. Swaminathan Impeachment controversy is a test of India’s constitutional framework. While judicial accountability is essential, transforming ideological or legal disagreement into impeachment risks undermining the independence of the judiciary.

How this episode is handled will have lasting consequences for the balance of power between Parliament and the judiciary and for the future of constitutional governance in India.",https://www.legalserviceindia.com/Legal-Articles/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/justice-gr-swaminathan-impeachment-constitutional-debate.webp,N,,2025-12-14 06:56:20.741435

“The Ninth Circuit’s decision means that, come Monday, there will be no National Guard troops deployed in California.
Let me repeat: For the first time in six months, there will be no military deployed on the streets of Los Angeles,” the state’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in a statement.
At the deployment’s high point in June, about 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were commandeered by the Trump administration and dispatched to Los Angeles.","The Trump administration must remove California National Guard troops from Los Angeles by Monday, a federal appellate court ruled. The decision upheld a lower court order that halted the mobilization that had roiled the nation’s second-largest city for six months.

The ruling late Friday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit substantially upheld a district court decision from earlier this week that found the federal government had illegally prolonged the military presence in Los Angeles months after intense protests over immigration enforcement had died down.

The decision by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit effectively blocked the Trump administration from using the remaining 100 or so National Guard troops in California — at least, for the moment.

But the appellate judges temporarily blocked a key part of the order by District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer that would have forced the Trump administration to return control of the troops to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who ordinarily commands them.

California officials celebrated the move as a partial victory in a battle that has dragged on for months.

“The Ninth Circuit’s decision means that, come Monday, there will be no National Guard troops deployed in California. Let me repeat: For the first time in six months, there will be no military deployed on the streets of Los Angeles,” the state’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in a statement.

“California did not ask to be a testing ground for the president’s militarized vision of America,” he added. “There is no crisis to justify the National Guard’s continued presence, and we look forward to continuing to prove that in court.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At the deployment’s high point in June, about 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were commandeered by the Trump administration and dispatched to Los Angeles. State and local officials objected strenuously to the move, calling it an inflammatory overreaction to scattered demonstrations that were being ably handled by local and state law enforcement agencies.

Mr. Newsom sued over the initial deployment, but the administration argued that the troops were responding to an emergency and were needed to protect federal agents and property. In June, the Ninth Circuit ruled that conditions in Los Angeles were sufficient for Mr. Trump to take control of the state’s National Guard and direct troops to provide protection during the enforcement of immigration laws.

The administration began gradually drawing down the number of federalized troops in July as public condemnation grew and protests abated. As of last month, about 300 California National Guard members remained under the president’s command, and most were in the process of being released to their usual duties, which generally involve part-time service controlled by the state.

State officials said on Friday that the California deployment consisted of about 100 troops on federal orders that were scheduled to last into February. Last week, Judge Breyer ruled that any emergency the president might have cited as justification for the deployment had long since ended, and that all remaining troops should be released from federal orders and returned to the governor’s command.

Lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the law required an emergency only at the time the president decided to federalize National Guard troops, after which he could extend the deployment as long as he deemed necessary. They also said that troops were still needed to protect federal workers from threats stemming from immigration raids that have been intensely unpopular in immigrant-heavy Southern California.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/19/multimedia/13nat-ca-guard-01/19nat-ninth-circuit-fmwv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 19:56:45.554576

DHS said the “gross attack” involving Maximiliano Perez-Perez happened in Tullos, a town in the central part of Louisiana.

Officials released an image purportedly showing the ICE officer’s bloodied hand following the alleged attack.

“During the arrest, Perez-Perez attempted to flee by pushing officers. He used his teeth as a weapon and clamped down on an ICE officers’ hand, breaking the skin and drawing blood,” Homeland Security said.

“This criminal illegal alien is being charged with assault after he savagely bit a law enforcement officer in an attempt to evade arrest. DHS law enforcement is facing a 1,150% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats,” added DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.

“This is the reality of what our ICE officers are facing every day as they go to work to simply do their job and enforce the law,” McLaughlin also said.

“Many of these assaults, including biting and vehicle rammings, are happening as a direct result of sanctuary politicians encouraging illegal aliens to evade arrest.”

DHS said Perez-Perez entered the United States at an unknown date and time and was not inspected or paroled by an immigration officer.

News of the arrest came on the same day ICE released an image showing a suspect accused of threatening federal agents being taken into custody by an officer from Homeland Security Investigations.

The agency said, “Threatening to assault, murder or interfere with a federal agent is a FELONY.”

Accountability has deteriorated amidst the hiring spree and tougher enforcement environment, said Genevra Alberti, a longtime Kansas City immigration attorney.
Feliciano said the threat of violence from community members won't dissuade his Kansas City team from following their orders.","Second of two stories looking at the role of ICE in the changing landscape of immigration enforcement.

KANSAS CITY, Missouri ‒ Inside an ICE headquarters in a suburban office park hangs a printed text-message that immigration officers feel is aimed at them: ""Get a gun and shoot them in the streets.""

It's tacked on a cubicle wall that dozens of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pass by daily. The screenshot message also declares, ""This is a war.""

In response, an ICE agent wrote on the printout in all caps: ""BE VIGILANT!!""

For ICE Supervisory Detention and Deportation Officer Keone Feliciano, the note is an unavoidable reminder of the danger he and his colleagues face amidst rapidly increasing anger over the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement.

Across the country, Feliciano and other longtime ICE officers accustomed to operating below the radar have been thrust into the spotlight by President Donald Trump's orders to conduct the largest mass deportation in history.

For many, it's an uncomfortable position as they work to balance their self-image as patriotic, law-and-order Americans with the perception that they have suddenly become, in the words of one ICE officer, ""the bad guys.""

In response to Trump's orders, the deployment of masked federal agents across American communities has spawned sometimes violent backlash including shootings, attacks on ICE facilities and vehicle rammings

Protesters, the vast majority peaceful, say agents are crossing dangerous lines for American society, smashing car windows, chasing workers through restaurants and targeting people for detention seemingly at random.

To report on the perspective of both sides, USA TODAY journalists spent several days this November in Kansas City, accompanying ICE officers as they detained suspects, collected detainees from local jails, and loaded others onto a charter flight to Texas for eventual deportation.

We also spoke with Kansas City-area migrant advocates and local elected officials who say the expanded immigration enforcement is tearing communities apart, turning neighbor against neighbor and sparking heated confrontations over the tactics now being deployed.

On a cool November morning, Feliciano, an 11-year veteran of the department, raced his Dodge truck through the pre-dawn darkness to join his team as they arrested a previously deported Venezuelan man convicted of sex crimes.

Feliciano's white pickup was fresh from the repair shop after protesters tailed and rammed him on a busy street in Chicago amidst the controversial Operation Midway Blitz, during which Border Patrol agents fired tear gas at protesters after being confronted by angry crowds.

He helped chain and load the Venezuelan man into the back of an unmarked ICE vehicle. Then, Feliciano urged his officers to get off the streets quickly.

""The longer we're out here, the more attention it's going to draw,"" he said. ""Some people just like to drive by and be looky-loos, but some people could have hostile intentions. We just want to keep everybody safe and get out of here.""

'Pendulum swings' of enforcement strategies

Feliciano, a Navy veteran and former local police officer, said the pendulum swings between different presidential administrations have sometimes interfered with the reason he got into immigration enforcement: to remove criminals from American communities.

He said he's particularly proud whenever his team can deport convicted sex offenders, who he believes pose a significant public risk even after serving a criminal sentence.

There was a time under President Joe Biden, when, ""if we weren't able to immediately effect a removal, we were being ordered to just release them,"" Feliciano said. ""Which is why we have now such a huge backlog of aliens just floating in the country with pending cases that have gone nowhere.

""Now we have an administration that's saying, 'Stop releasing them. Put them back in custody,'"" he said.

The Venezuelan man Feliciano's team arrested in November had previously been deported from the United States following a statutory rape conviction. He reentered illegally; when he got arrested, he requested asylum, saying he feared returning to Venezuela.

A judge ruled the man could be deported to a third country like Mexico, ordered him fitted with a GPS tracker and released him back into the community, according to ICE officials. Re-entry after deportation is a felony, but making an asylum claim, especially during the Biden years, could qualify some people to remain free while their cases were pending.

Feliciano's team decided to detain the man after his GPS tracker detected tampering. It could have been a false alarm but potentially indicated the man had tried to remove it.

After staking out the man's house for several days, the team waited until he left for work early one morning before stopping his Honda Pilot near an empty intersection, blocking him in with multiple vehicles. Agents prefer traffic stops to entering homes for safety reasons.

The man surrendered immediately and was shackled. At his request, an officer drove his car back to his nearby house.

Growing tensions between ICE and advocates

Back at the ICE office in Kansas City, longtime officers sit next to fresh-faced recruits brought on under Trump's rapid agency expansion. Under the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" passed by Congress this summer, federal immigration agencies have been ordered to hire 18,500 new agents and support staff – roughly doubling the force.

Nationally, these new federal agents, often from Customs and Border Protection, have orders to pursue undocumented immigrants whether they have criminal convictions or not. Just over 40% of those currently in detention have only immigration violations ‒ no criminal convictions or pending charges ‒ a 25-fold increase since the start of the Trump administration, according to Ausin Kocher, an expert in immigrant enforcement at Syracuse University.

Like other hardline immigration enforcers, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has suggested that prior presidential administrations broke faith with the American public by failing to properly restrict illegal immigration.

""We will not allow criminal illegal aliens to take over American communities. We will continue to track down illegal aliens in Los Angeles, Chicago, or any other city we choose,"" Bovino said in a Nov. 15 social media post. ""That is the way THIS team operates.""

This more combative approach took shape in Kansas City in late July when ICE officers swarmed into two popular Mexican restaurants in the western and southern suburbs, detaining about a dozen workers.

ICE had a criminal federal search warrant, signed by a judge, to search the premises as part of an ongoing investigation, officials said. Under the Trump administration priorities, ICE officials say they are under orders to question suspected undocumented immigrants whenever they encounter them.

As the raids unfolded, dozens of migrant-rights activists and community members surrounded the restaurants, screaming at federal agents and officers and damaging one of their vehicles. While protesters portrayed the raids as unwarranted and immoral, ICE officials consider the protests ill-informed activism.

ICE has still not explained specifically what officers were looking for during the raids, but note the restaurants had previously been under investigation for wage theft during the Biden administration. Activists say ICE's refusal to explain why the two restaurants were targeted for immigration enforcement is contributing to a lack of trust.

""We are feeling scared and worried but in a strange way we feel more empowered to speak up for our community. We feel this commitment to defend our people,"" said Melanie Arroyo, a member of the suburban Lenexa City Council, across the state line in Kansas.

Around Kansas City, community activists are handing out fliers advising people of their constitutional rights, including their right to remain silent, to not open the door to agents without seeing a warrant, and to film interactions from a safe distance.

The ""pendulum swings"" in immigration enforcement are spilling into local politics, too.

Arroyo's own citizenship was briefly investigated by state and local police after one of her constituents misunderstood legislative testimony she had given.

At first she thought it was amusing that someone had questioned her citizenship – until she realized neighbors were demanding to see her papers although she was an American citizen.

""This is a scary pattern and people need to wake up and recognize that we can't just be compliant. Because this is not OK,"" Arroyo said.

Accountability has deteriorated amidst the hiring spree and tougher enforcement environment, said Genevra Alberti, a longtime Kansas City immigration attorney. In recent months she's found the Kansas City ICE office less responsive to her inquiries about her clients and detention officers less cooperative when it comes to her concerns about overcrowded cells or health issues.

""There have always been officers here who I could tell enjoyed what they were doing, and for them, this is great,"" she said. ""They get to do what they've always wanted to do.""

Kansas state Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Democrat who represents suburban Kansas City, said the new harsher approach is rupturing the trust built between local police and immigrant communities, who have long been encouraged to report crimes against them even if they're living illegally in the United States.

""It has come to the point where no one is trusting each other. People are not out in the community like they normally would be. That means they're not shopping. They're not going to school. It's affecting our entire way of life because you don't know who to trust. Can you trust your neighbor?"" Ruiz said.

'We're just enforcing the laws as written'

Feliciano and his team say they're using appropriate levels of force at a time when an increasing number of immigrants know that getting detained means they'll get deported.

Under past presidential administrations, undocumented immigrants were often allowed to remain free on bond or on GPS monitoring while their cases played out.

But the Trump White House has essentially ordered detention without bond until their case is decided for anyone livingwithout legal status in the United States. Others are being deported to third countries.

In the face of this shift, immigrants are feeling more desperate and are more likely to resist arrest, Feliciano said ‒ raising the danger for everyone involved.

""The detention space hasn't changed much but we're able to get people through the system faster,"" Feliciano said. ""We're getting people out of the country very, very quickly.""

That means undocumented immigrants stopped for routine traffic violations are now increasingly running away or refusing to cooperate with local police or ICE agents.

For longtime agents like Feliciano, this shift means being prepared for violence both from the person they're stopping and from community members angered by the White House orders. Hence the printout tacked to the cubicle wall.

Feliciano said the threat of violence from community members won't dissuade his Kansas City team from following their orders. He takes pride in the work his agents do targeting criminal offenders through surveillance and documentation.

Later in the week as he navigated his pickup to the Kansas City airport to oversee a deportation flight, Feliciano listed off all the ways detainees have their chance to plead their case in court, appeal the decisions and request asylum.

He said ICE officers like him are going to keep arresting people who pose a danger to the public, working as ordered by the White House, despite the concerns of what he called ""social justice warriors"" protesting in Chicago and other cities.

On the airport tarmac, Feliciano watched as members of his team frisked and chained detainees before they were loaded onto a charter flight headed to a centralized deportation facility in Texas. His phone rang; one of his other officers was calling to discuss details of ongoing surveillance for their next targeted arrest.

""We're not the feelings police. We're the law police,"" he said. ""And we're just enforcing the laws as they're written.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PTX1/87657208007-keone-ice-4319.JPG?crop=3497,1967,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-13 18:56:45.685506

And Tina Smith is a Democrat who represents Minnesota and announced this year that she won’t be seeking re-election in 2026.
Senator Flake, when you left the Senate, you had been serving in Congress for 18 years.
Flake: It’s not in vogue now, but I don’t think it’s gone.
So all of that argues to me that we need a Senate and a Congress that’s capable of making those big changes.","The United States Senate is at a precarious moment. From tariffs to agency funding to foreign affairs, the Senate’s check on the executive branch is arguably weaker than ever, with some critics, and some senators, warning that the body is abandoning its constitutionally prescribed role. (Congress is also incredibly unpopular: A recent Gallup poll showed its approval rating at a dreadful 15 percent.)

With that in mind, I wanted to have a different sort of conversation than we usually do on The Interview: a round table about the state of the Senate, and how we got here, with three lawmakers who decided to leave the body at different points in the Trump era.

Jeff Flake is a Republican who represented Arizona for 18 years, initially in the House and then in the Senate, before announcing that he would not seek re-election in 2018 because of President Trump’s influence on the Republican Party. Joe Manchin represented West Virginia, first as a Democrat — one who drove other Democrats crazy by frequently voting with Republicans — and later as a registered independent. He decided not to run for re-election and left the Senate at the start of the year. And Tina Smith is a Democrat who represents Minnesota and announced this year that she won’t be seeking re-election in 2026. I gathered them in Washington to get their read on the state of the Senate and of our politics and democracy more broadly. I told them that I hoped, because they are out of or nearly out of office, that they would feel free to be candid, to which Manchin replied, “That’s why we left!”

I want to start by asking you all to give me a word or a sentence that describes the state you think the Senate is in right now.

Tina Smith: Broken.

Jeff Flake: Retreat. The presidency, just by virtue of the system, gains more power over time. But what has been frustrating is to see the Senate just willingly give up Article I authority.

Joe Manchin: Abdication. They’ve abdicated their responsibilities. The Senate is the most unusual body in the world. Our framers designed it to be that way, and it was ingrained in me that the filibuster is the holy grail, keeping us talking and working and becoming friends. They’ve abdicated that type of responsibility.

Those are all pretty bleak words.

Manchin: You want us to call them cowards?

I want you to say what you think. Senator Flake, when you left the Senate, you had been serving in Congress for 18 years. In a speech you gave on the floor, you gave this warning: “Let us recognize, as authoritarianism reasserts itself in country after country, that we are by no means immune.” Do you think you were right to be concerned?

Senator Smith, you’ve said that you’re stepping down to spend more time with family and that it has nothing to do with politics. A lot of politicians who leave say that.

Manchin: Come on, tell us the truth!

Smith: [Laughs] I actually mean it, because I really like my family. But I’ve also said a few other things about why I’m leaving.

Representative Jared Golden of Maine, who is stepping down from the House, talked about the political nastiness and the political violence as reasons that he’s not seeking re-election. Are those issues weighing on you too?

Smith: Everything that has happened this year has certainly not made me wonder whether I made the right decision. This horrible political assassination of my dear friend Melissa Hortman, the speaker emeritus of the Minnesota House. We had the shooting at the Annunciation school, which is literally 10 blocks from where I live. And so the reality of these political attacks, and in this moment fueled by the president of the United States, who just a couple of weeks ago said that two of my colleagues and four members of the House of Representatives should be tried for treason and executed — of course these things all have impact. But there was another part of it for me, which is that I will be 68 next year.

Pretty young for a Democratic senator!

Smith: [Laughs] Yes, it is. And I am not burdened by the belief that I am the only one who can do this job.

Flake: When I left, I never said I wanted to spend more time with my family. I love my family, but I would have liked to have served another term. You don’t get all the way to the most exclusive club in the world and just want to stay one term. But the price for doing so would have been for me to say, “Those principles I said I believed in — I no longer do.” And that price was too steep to pay.

Manchin: Jeff, those of us who’ve been in these tough races before, when you’re facing something that you know is going to turn you into a different animal — that’s not who we are. But we’d have had to turn into another animal if we wanted to go on. I never faced an election where I thought the other side was the enemy. I learned from every election. If I was in a debate, after the election was over — I won most of them — I’d call the person, and I’d say: “You had some good ideas in that debate. Can we talk about that?” And start building relationships. That’s gone.

Flake: It’s not in vogue now, but I don’t think it’s gone.

Smith: I don’t think it’s gone either. I haven’t given up hope on that, Joe.

Manchin: I never give up. I’m just dealing with reality today. The thing that I saw, and Jeff, you can talk about this because you came from the House: I came from being a governor, which is the most collegial of all institutions. You could go to a governor’s [convention]. If I didn’t know that the person was a Republican or a Democrat, you could not tell the difference. We were all curing the same problems. But the House, you all operate on a simple majority. You don’t even have to acknowledge the other side. Don’t even have to let them be involved if you don’t want to. And I kept noticing more and more congresspeople that kept coming to the Senate with that mind-set made it harder for the Senate to stay collegial. Am I right?

Flake: Oh, definitely. The real turn in the House came in 2005. I got there in 2001, when we didn’t adopt formally but basically lived by the so-called Hastert rule. It wasn’t Hastert; it was really Tom DeLay and a few others, who said if you’re going to bring something to the floor as a Republican — and we had a bigger cushion at that time in the majority — that you should be able to pass it just with Republican votes. And if it might gather bipartisan votes, then knock some provisions off so it won’t be attractive and then use that as a cudgel during the next election. You had people mature as politicians under that system, and some of them have gone to the Senate.

One reason I wanted to bring you here is because you have the long view, and clearly all of this predates the era that we’re in now. But this era has supercharged what you’re discussing. And you’ve touched on one of the main critiques of the Senate right now. It’s something I heard when I sat with Senator Lisa Murkowski earlier this year, which is that the Senate, regardless of the partisan nature, is just not doing its job. It’s not acting as a check on the executive. Do you think that this is an enduring shift away from congressional power?

Flake: I don’t think it’s an enduring condition. I think it has to do with leadership. I look at the potential field on the Democratic and Republican sides, and you see some who will try to replicate what President Trump has done in terms of amassing power and stiffing the House and the Senate. But the vast majority of Republican senators who I’m most familiar with don’t like this at all. They want to reassert their prerogatives.

Smith: I completely agree with Jeff that behind the scenes you will hear many Republicans in the Senate say: “I don’t like this. I don’t think this is right.” But then they also say, “We’re just waiting for the right moment to actually do something about it.” And meanwhile, the powers of the Senate and the powers of the legislative branch are gushing out of the Capitol. I’m always so fascinated by the interpersonal relationships of everybody in the Senate. And the people that seem to feel the most betrayed right now are my Democratic colleagues who stake their careers on working across party lines to accomplish things. They were part of the gangs — so much of the work that you did, Joe, around the infrastructure act — and they feel as if the bonds of trust between Democrats and Republicans have been so broken because of the ways in which Republicans in the Senate have kowtowed to the president, not only allowing him to undo our budget bills, but on the ways that they have confirmed — against their better judgment, I would argue — some of these really terrible nominees like R.F.K. Jr. and the secretary of defense. Part of the problem, and I believe this is where I differ from both of my colleagues here, is that the Senate rules have so completely stymied the ability of the Senate to do anything.

You’d like to get rid of the filibuster?

Smith: I would at least like to reform it so that if you’re going to filibuster a bill you ought to at least have to stand on the damn floor and talk, instead of just saying, “Oh, I don’t like this, so I’m going to object and then go out for dinner.”

Manchin: We’re exactly alike on that.

Flake: Every president who has a majority is going to want to get rid of the filibuster. And every Senate ought to resist that, Republican or Democrat, because it is one of the few mechanisms left that forces people to work together.

Smith: I’ve watched the Senate for the last eight years, and I have not seen that the filibuster is the pill to cure partisanship. Sometimes it creates the very systems that make it very difficult for the things that Americans want to get done to actually get done.

Smith: In a functioning legislative body, you would think that the Democratic leader and the Republican leader would talk to each other all the time, to try to figure things out, to try to get things going. It just doesn’t happen anymore. But this informal group that I am a part of is a group of senators who have been complaining and unhappy primarily with the ways in which the leader has been identifying what candidates he wants to run in what states.

Which is interesting, because when I spoke to Senator Schumer, he touted that as his greatest strength, that he really can choose candidates that win. And so you get a Gov. Janet Mills running for Senate in Maine at 77 years old against Graham Platner, who’s 41 and more progressive, and that sets up an intraparty fight.

Smith: Yes, it does. To be clear, I haven’t endorsed anybody in Maine —

Manchin: I’m endorsing Susan Collins in Maine. They get rid of a Susan Collins, then you’re really losing the Senate. People that have that mind-set, we can’t even get them to run anymore.

Flake: You mentioned Chuck Schumer. I was part of a gang of eight with Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin on immigration. We passed a bill, 68 to 32. That was one of the last examples we’ve seen of the Senate working how it used to work. My point is that some of the same characters that we now look at and say, “They could never do this” — they can. And they have in the past.

I’m wondering what you think of the Republican leader, John Thune, who people broadly view as being less obsequious to Trump than the House speaker, Mike Johnson, who, according to critics, really takes everything that he’s doing from the White House. That said, Thune has been accused of chipping away at the filibuster by allowing a number of simple-majority votes, ushering in what The New Yorker called the Senate’s “Age of Irrelevance.” Senator Flake, why do you think he’s so weak? Is he so weak?

Flake: When I mentioned before that there are Republican senators who want the Senate to be like it used to be, he’s one of them. He’s an institutionalist. But when the other day the president said, “Get rid of the filibuster,” John Thune’s response was, “We don’t have the votes,” which is true. But I would have liked him to say: “That’s a terrible idea, Mr. President. We’re not going to do it.” Or on tariffs, actually pull your power back. Get ahead of the Supreme Court. You don’t want to have them fight your battles for you. So yeah, I am frustrated sometimes. But I do think that he’s often doing the best he can given the political situation.

Why isn’t he pulling his power back, though? He is the Senate majority leader.

Manchin: His caucus.

Flake: Yeah, and you get angry tweets every day if you do.

From the president, you mean?

Flake: Yes, definitely. The president has been able to say, in any Republican seat in the country, “I can get a primary opponent for you if you don’t do what I say.” That’s a powerful political incentive. We may like it to be different, but that’s the incentive structure that most of my former colleagues are working under. They don’t like it, but they’re in it.

Manchin: I’ve come to the conclusion there’s two things that would change politics in America: [congressional] term limits and open primaries. Our friend Lisa Murkowski would not get elected through the primary process in Alaska if it wasn’t for the open primary. When you can control the primary, that’s what gives President Trump, or gives a Democrat president, the power in a real blue state or a red state, knowing that they have that power to name who they want or primary you. An open primary — boom. The best will succeed, and he can’t target you.

Flake: If you had five or six states with open-primary laws like Alaska has, that would create a whole different power structure in the Senate.

Let me give you the counterpoint to this dream of bipartisanship, which is: Did we get here because the Senate has been ineffective at responding to the real problems that voters have because, essentially, it has been incremental? There are just not any big swings anymore. People at the moment seem to be clamoring for ideas that can solve their very real problems. Does incrementalism, which can be read as bipartisanship, actually get the job done?

Smith: This is exactly the issue. Significant majorities of Americans have said that they think things are terribly on the wrong track, that they’re working as hard as they possibly can and nothing is really changing. And so if you have a governing body that hasn’t been capable of making the big changes that need to be made, of course people are going to be frustrated. We often get sucked into this [question]: Are you moderate or are you progressive? I don’t think that’s the right continuum at all. I think it’s a question of whether you actually think that the status quo is working, or do you think that it needs to be fundamentally changed? And Americans are telling us that the status quo is not working for them. And they’re telling us that things that maybe would be seen as progressive — paid family and medical leave, child care that people can afford, raise the minimum wage, even Medicare for All, which was seen as being incredibly radical, a majority of Americans want to a see a complete revamping of our health care system. So all of that argues to me that we need a Senate and a Congress that’s capable of making those big changes.

Flake: I’ll make the case for incrementalism. Being a conservative means preserving institutions that work, and the Senate has worked over time, so incrementalism is what you want. That’s why I like the filibuster, for example, because it helps from having wide swings of popular opinion back and forth like you have in the House. The Senate is all about incrementalism, and that has served the country well. So I don’t think that’s the problem. Look at Joe Manchin. He was always in the middle of every bipartisan fight, every bill that looked for bipartisan support, saying, “Hey, compromise is the coin of the realm here,” because you don’t want to have these wide swings.

Manchin: There used to be an old saying, “Guilt by association.” If someone was a bad actor and you were working with them, [people thought] you must support that. Now it’s guilt by conversation. You can’t even be seen having a conversation with someone who might not be on the same side. That is so ridiculous to me. The Democrats chastised me for working across the aisle.

There’s this perception that people who are fortunate enough in a closely divided Senate to wield a lot of power —

Manchin: I don’t recommend that to anybody. But if it happens, be ready.

Fair. But I’m giving you the counterargument that they are obstructing actual progress. James Carville, the longtime Democratic strategist who is a self-described centrist, recently argued that Democrats need to run on, and presumably eventually legislate on, “a sweeping, aggressive, unvarnished, unapologetic and altogether unmistakable platform of pure economic rage.”

Smith: When I read what James Carville said, I was thinking about how, for the last 10 years, the national Democratic Party has been stuck in a bad relationship. We’ve so defined ourselves by being opposed to Trump that it’s like we’ve forgotten how to do the other part of our job, which is to put forward an aggressive, strong, positive vision of where the country ought to go.

Flake: When I hear “economic rage,” that suggests a very leftist platform, a Mamdani kind of thing, and I hope the Democrats don’t do that. They would be responding to that subset of a subset of a subset of voters in Democratic primaries, just like too many Republicans respond to that subset on the right. But it doesn’t do much for the country, and it allows the Republicans to be more extreme than they could otherwise be. I think if the Democrats would be more centrist, it would force the Republicans back into that more centrist mode as well.

That’s the other side of this coin. You certainly can’t accuse the Trump administration of moving incrementally. Should the Democrats be emulating what the Trump administration’s doing? Because Republicans are really taking the ball and running with it.

Smith: Super interesting question. What Trump is doing is seizing massive amounts of power. Let’s just take for example his policy around what to do about people who are inside the country without documents, maybe illegally, maybe they are here legally. He is doing something very radical when it comes to his immigration policy. It’s dramatically unpopular. People do not like it. So the thing that’s missing in your question that I’m responding to is that we ought to be able to meet the needs of Americans and what they want. And that’s not been happening.

Flake: I don’t disagree with you about immigration overreach. Talk about going after criminals — everybody wants that. But he has gone far beyond that. Every president coming in exaggerates the mandate that they were given. And they’re usually given a whooping in the midterm elections. This time it’ll be significant, I think. And so you’ll now have a period of divided government, which, as a fiscal conservative concerned about debt, I am looking forward to. The pendulum swings, and we’re seeing that swing in a big way on a few things. I wrote a piece the other day called “The Great G.O.P. Migration Has Begun.” Marjorie Taylor Greene —

Smith: There’s cracks in the facade.

Flake: There are. When people realize that it’s popular now to be against the president on a couple of issues and in order to survive some of these general [elections] coming up, you’ll see a different attitude.

But coming back to this idea of when things have really moved in the Senate, it’s because a party has said, “We’re going to put all of our power behind this issue, whether it be Obamacare or something else, and we’re going to make this a priority.”

I want to end with this question of how much power the Senate has right now. It has ceded control over tariffs, as we’ve discussed, but also over foreign affairs. There’s an uproar over the double-tap strike on a Venezuelan boat allegedly carrying drugs. There are Navy ships in the Caribbean now. Do you feel like the Senate’s response to the questions about what we’re doing in and around Venezuela is sufficient? Why isn’t there more questioning over something that, again, was a core purview of the Senate?

Flake: That has been the frustrating thing. I do think that this double-tap strike, particularly if that video is released — there will be revulsion on most Americans’ part. Sure, they want a strong response on drugs, but you can have that with some humanity as well. It has been frustrating because in all areas of foreign policy, whether it’s tariffs, whether it’s war powers, whether it’s support for Ukraine — there’s a bill in the Senate now with 85 co-sponsors that the Senate could, if it wanted to assert itself, pass that veto-proof bill. And there are sufficient votes in the House too. But they just haven’t, because they’re afraid of what the president can do to them.

Manchin: Someone needs to ask Pete Hegseth: “Your commander in chief, the president, said he’d like people to see the video. How do you not take that seriously?” [Trump has since changed his position on this.]

Would you like to see the senators do more, from both parties?

Manchin: They have to do more. The senators have to do their job. There’s not another body that can fix this. The House is not going to fix it. The Senate can right the ship. Are they waiting for another election to see what’s going to happen in the midterms, or is it so serious right now that [they think], We just need to do something? I’m praying to God that we can put the politics aside and reach across for the sake of the country and do the right thing. We’ll see if that happens.

Do you miss it?

Manchin: Not at all. And the reason I don’t miss it is I could tell that I could get more done on the outside than I can on the inside. I’d been in the Senate for almost 15 years. Tried everything humanly possible to make those changes.

So what’s an unvarnished truth that you weren’t able to say then that you could say now?

Flake: Well, I can say that most of my former colleagues don’t agree with the policies they’re pursuing on tariffs and foreign policy and this Venezuela stuff. The political incentives are not aligned for them to speak truth to power here. That’s the bottom line. Like I said, I think that’s shifting, but as of now, re-election is a strong pull.

Julianne Murray, the former chair of Delaware’s Republican Party, resigned as U.S. attorney on Dec. 12, a position she had tenuously held without required congressional approval since her temporary appointment by the Trump administration earlier this summer.

She cited a recent court ruling by a federal appeals court that disqualified a similar Trump appointee as U.S. attorney in New Jersey. She also took a parting shot at Delaware’s Senate delegation that did not support her permanent appointment for what she described as “highly politicized” and “flawed” reasoning.

“The people that think they have chased me away will soon find out they are mistaken,” she said in a resignation statement that indicated she will continue to work within Delaware’s federal prosecutor’s office.

Upon Murray’s resignation, Delaware’s District Court judges appointed Ben Wallace, her top deputy, as Delaware’s U.S. attorney, a powerful position that instigates and oversees prosecutions of federal crimes and acts as the federal government’s representative in other legal matters in their state.

While the president has appointment power and their candidate of choice often reflects their political party, these positions have historically been viewed as apolitical enforcers of federal law that come from prosecutorial backgrounds − not politics − and are moored to the law, not the president’s social media postings.

Trump’s second term has seen a shift in that with his administration pushing to install loyalists without prosecutorial legal backgrounds and in some cases, have been blatantly devoted to the president’s encroachment of power upon the legal checks of Congress and the judiciary.

But the requirement that U.S. attorneys be approved by the U.S. Senate is becoming one the administration’s highest hurdles in its expansion of executive power. It ultimately caused what became a standoff between Trump's administration and Delaware's congressional delegation that led to Murray never being put to Congress for approval and her eventual resignation.

""I did not have complete confidence that Julianne Murray had the experience in criminal prosecution, in managing and supervising a complex office and demonstrating political independence that met the moment we are currently in,"" said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons in an interview after her resignation.

Julianne Murray's lack of local support

Murray, whom Trump once described as ""MAGA all the way,"" was appointed interim U.S. attorney for Delaware in ther summer.

Under the law, an interim appointment lasts 120 days. When that 120-day period expired, the Trump administration evolved Murray’s title from interim to acting, a move that has parallels to appointments in other states, which federal judges have invalidated as an illegal bypass on Congress’s appointment of power for the role.

In an interview, Coons said the Trump administration approached him about nominating Murray and he, along with Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, talked to Murray earlier this year.

While nominees for U.S. attorney must be approved by the full Senate, the senators from the state they will work in have informal veto power over a president’s nominee for the role under what is known as the “blue slip” tradition. That tradition has been under attack by Trump but has been continued by Republicans in charge of Congress.

Coons said he wasn’t convinced Murray had the prosecutorial or management experience necessary and had larger questions about her “political independence.” He said her “previous statements” and “political activity” raised concerns about her “ability to be an independent federal prosecutor.”

In her resignation post, Murray said the blue-slip tradition is “highly flawed” and added that Coons’ and Blunt Rochester’s refusal to support her appointment was “highly politicized.”

“I naively believed that I would be judged on my performance and not politics,” Murray wrote. “Unfortunately, that was not the case.”

Murray has presided over the conclusion of some high-profile criminal cases during her six months in office. Her tenure also saw the initiation of a fight in which her office is trying to get the court to compel the state’s Department of Labor to hand over data to immigration authorities in Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

Coons said his lack of support for her isn’t naked politics but “part of the checks and balances in our constitution.”

He added that in another time, those concerns would not be as grave as they are in the context of the Trump administration's “broadly illegal conduct that has challenged the very guardrails of our democracy.""

A national fight

This conflict is a microcosm of the larger issue in other states with the Trump administration seeking to install loyalists. These fights have had implications over political prosecutions and whether the judiciary can still serve as a check on the Trump administration’s power.

In New Jersey, the Trump administration appointed his former personal attorney, Alina Habba, as U.S. attorney first as interim. When that role expired, the federal court in New Jersey appointed her deputy as U.S. attorney, but that deputy was immediately fired by the Trump administration, who argued that move returned Habba to the position.

National coverage: Former Trump lawyer Alina Habba resigns as US attorney for New Jersey

However, earlier this month, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that Habba was unlawfully filling that position and she resigned. That ruling was cited in Murray’s resignation notice, as well. The Trump administration has said it would appeal the ruling.

The implication of these fights over the rule of law is most clear in Trump’s efforts to employ the federal government to seek retribution against his political foes in Virginia. Recently, a federal judge ruled that Lindsay Halligan, Trump’s former personal lawyer and insurance law specialist with no experience as a prosecutor, was illegally installed as U.S. attorney there by the Trump administration.

That had the effect of dismissing two-high profile criminal cases that bear hallmarks of political retribution campaigns sought by the Trump administration: the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letita James. Trump's vendetta against both goes back years.

In 2017, he fired Comey as head of the FBI, which was investigating possible contacts between the 2016 Trump campaign and the Russian government. Afterward, Comey became an outspoken critic of Trump.

James brought a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump in 2022, claiming he engaged in years of fraud as a real estate mogul.

On social media and in public statements, Trump has openly clamored for his government to seek prosecutions of those individuals.

In September, Halligan’s predecessor, Erik Siebert, was working in an interim status when he expressed concerns to top Department of Justice officials about the validity of pursuing charges against Comey and James, according to court filings. Trump told reporters he wanted Siebert out and he resigned.

Two days later, Halligan was appointed as U.S. attorney there without congressional approval and quickly delivered grand jury indictments against Trump’s political foes.

Last month, a federal judge ruled that Halligan was illegally installed and dismissed the indictments. Federal prosecutors have sought to reindict the cases, but have failed to convince a grand jury to do so multiple times, according to reporting by the Associated Press this week.

Meanwhile, CNBC has reported that the Trump administration will now seek congressional approval to appoint Halligan.

Julianne Murray's resignation prompts new appointment

While uncertainty over Murray's non-permanent appointment bubbled over the past six months, the chief judge of Delaware's federal court began a legal process by which judges on that court can appoint a U.S. attorney when the position remains vacant.

In September, Chief Judge Colm Connolly, a former U.S. attorney himself, posted notice that the court was accepting applicants for the position. In November, when Murray's interim status expired and the Trump administration changed it to ""acting,"" the court posted notice it was declining to appoint anyone at that time.

Then, on the morning of Dec. 12, the court posted notice of Wallace's appointment. Connolly declined to comment for this story.

In an interview, Wallace said the appeals court ruling upholding the disqualification of Habba earlier this month raised concerns that Murray's position exposed legal cases brought by her office to ""significant litigation risk.""

He said they felt the federal government had strong legal arguments to justify her ongoing tenure, but the risk to the office's ongoing work made Murray uncomfortable and so she decided to step aside.

He said conversations between the White House and Department of Justice administrators in Washington, D.C., eventually centered on him, as her deputy, as a replacement. And, with the blessing of Delaware's federal judiciary, the court exercised its authority to appoint him to the job in a permanent role when Murray resigned.

Wallace is a registered Republican, but in an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal, he described his politics as ""apolitical"" and said would run the office ""by the book.""

Coons said he looks forward to working with Wallace, whom he described as ""skilled"" and ""capable.""

“I don’t know what comes next,” Coons said. “But I hope it is stability and professionalism and political independence for the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office.”

The seizure of the sanctioned ship, called Skipper, is the most recent swipe by the Trump administration against Maduro, whom U.S. officials have called an “illegitimate leader” and accused of heading a drug-trafficking cartel.

The president has ordered lethal strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean, in the vicinity of Venezuela, indicated that Maduro’s days are “numbered” and established a massive military presence in the U.S. Southern Command (Southcom) region.

When asked on Thursday whether the campaign against Venezuela is about acquiring oil or thwarting the trafficking of illegal drugs in the region, Trump pointed to various reasons, including barring Venezuelan migrants from illegally entering the U.S.

“Well, it’s about a lot of things,” the president told reporters at the White House. “But one of the things it’s about is the fact that they’ve allowed millions of people to come into our country from their prisons, from gangs, from drug dealers and from mental institutions, probably proportionately more than anybody else.”

Here are the main factors that seem to be driving Trump’s multi-front campaign against Maduro:

Migration

Trump often pins the blame on Maduro for two things when asked about his pressure on Venezuela: migrants and drugs.

“We just have to take care of Venezuela. They dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country from prisons,” the president said last month.

Venezuela is still one of the biggest sources of migrants in the world. The majority of Venezuelan migrants, over 80 percent, live in Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., there were about 770,000 Venezuelan immigrants as of 2023, according to the Migration Policy Institute, making up below 2 percent of the entire U.S. immigration population.

The number of Venezuelan migrants in the U.S has gone up from about 33,000 in 1980 to 770,000 in 2023, according to the Migration Policy Institute’s report in February.

After an early October ruling by the Supreme Court, more than a quarter million Venezuelans lost Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Before it later expired in November, the Biden-era program shielded Venezuelan nationals from deportation until October next year.

Drugs

The president has accused the Maduro regime of pouring illegal narcotics into the U.S., which it says justifies the ongoing lethal strikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats off the coast of Venezuela.

Since early September, when the lethal military campaign began, the U.S. military has conducted at least 22 strikes against purported drug-smuggling vessels in both the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing at least 87 suspected “narco-terrorists.”

The boat strikes have become a political lightning rod for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, after survivors of a strike in September were killed in what many Democrats have called a war crime. Hegseth authorized the strikes but has denied specifically ordering the killing of survivors.

The administration has linked some of the individuals on the boat to the drug cartels and argued that every blown-up vessel saves 25,000 American lives. However, the target vessels in the Caribbean are believed to be carrying cocaine, not the far more deadly fentanyl, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the strikes.

In Latin America, the top producer and exporter of cocaine is Colombia.

Trump has touted that maritime illegal drug trafficking in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific has drastically plunged since his administration’s boat strikes began.

“If you look at drug traffic, drug traffic by sea is down 92 percent. And nobody can figure out who the eight is, because I have no idea,” the president said on Thursday. “Anybody getting involved in that right now is not doing well. And we’ll start that on land too. It’s gonna be starting on land pretty soon.”

As part of the pressure campaign, the U.S. government has designated the so-called “Cartel de los Soles” as a foreign terrorist organization and accused Maduro of being its leader.

Oil and Minerals

Venezuela has lucrative oil and gas reserves. Oil makes up close to 90 percent of the country’s export revenues, part of the reason Maduro’s regime has argued that U.S. moves in recent months are meant to secure access to the nation’s energy reserves.

The vessel the U.S. seized on Wednesday, which was previously sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2022 and was sailing under a different name, was believed to be carrying more than 1 million barrels and was falsely flying Guyana’s flag.

If the U.S. were to continue to seize more of Venezuela’s oil tankers, it could thwart the nation’s ability to purchase weapons, buy food and keep the government’s lights on, experts told The Hill on Thursday.

Although the analysts said a full oil blockade would likely be improbable due to Washington’s reliance on Caracas’s oil imports and international pushback, they stated that the president could get to a similar outcome by seizing more tankers.

“So you could get a complete collapse in Venezuelan oil exports if the US does this, because it would be equivalent to imposing a de facto naval blockade of Venezuela,” said Francisco R. Rodríguez, a senior research fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Ousting Maduro

Trump and other top administration officials have said that Maduro’s days are “numbered” and the president has not ruled out the option of putting boots on the ground in Venezuela.

In recent weeks, the U.S. has established a gigantic military presence in the Southcom area, dispatching F-35 fighter jets, warships, Marines, spy planes, at least one submarine and USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier.

Trump has also repeatedly warned that strikes inside Venezuela could come “soon,” but the president has not closed the door on negotiating with Maduro, who he spoke with recently.

Some experts say Trump’s actions are aimed at regime change, a charge that Secretary of State Rubio denied.

Rubio, a Cuba hawk and son of Cuban immigrants who are vehemently anti-socialist, views Maduro’s potential ouster as a heavy blow to Cuba’s leadership, with whom the Venezuelan president has close ties.

The New York Times reported on Friday that the Skipper was part of Venezuela’s efforts to support Cuba financially.

The secretary, who also serves as Trump’s national security adviser, has said that the U.S.’s goal in the region is not to enact regime change in Venezuela, although he recently cast doubt that Washington can strike a deal that Maduro would honor.

“At the end of the day with Maduro — and his problem basically is that this is a guy, if you wanted to make a deal with him, I don’t know how you’d do,” Rubio said during his recent appearance on Fox News’s “Hannity.” “He’s broken every deal he’s ever made.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/WhyVenezuela_Timotija_AP_CristianHernandez.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-13 19:56:58.339588

The group held its protest on a pathway in front of the El Paso Field Office for ICE here in El Paso and within view of the Fort Bliss migrant camp and its white tents.

“The purpose of this vigil is to protest the horrific and inhumane conditions in the Camp and to bring attention to the unlawful, abusive, and unconstitutional conduct of government officers towards the detainees, that now number approximately 2,700, both men and women,” the group said in its news release.

This week, a coalition of human rights organizations, including the ACLU, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to quit detaining migrants at the facility on Fort Bliss property.

The groups summarized in the letter accounts of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

The letter follows months of interviews with more than 45 detained people at Fort Bliss and is accompanied by 16 sworn declarations by immigrants detained at the facility, the human rights groups said.

Saturday’s protest was held in what they called a “theater” format. Many participants were dressed in black and held signs that describe alleged conditions within the facility.

“This is not a left or right issue. This is a humanitarian issue. Human rights are being violated every day in this facility,” said Erika Hisey, one of the organizers. “We stand with the ACLU. We stand with local organizations (like Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center) to say shut it down — now, today, right now.”

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, has been critical of the migrant facility numerous times after talking to detainees there after it opened last summer.

In September, a Washington Post report noted that a leaked internal ICE inspection found the Fort Bliss facility violated over 60 federal detention standards in the first 50 days of its opening.

“We have murderers on death row being treated better than these people out here. These are not criminals. These are people who came to America to better their lives, just like your past family members and my past family members,” Hisey said.",https://www.ktsm.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-13-133329.png?w=1280,N,,2025-12-13 21:56:56.799163

These rights were enshrined in the European convention on human rights, a document that has since been signed by 46 countries.","The battle had been brewing for months. But this week it came to a head in a flurry of meetings, calls and one heady statement. Twenty-seven European countries urged a rethink of the human rights laws forged after the second world war, describing them as an impediment when it came to addressing migration.

Amnesty International has called it “a moral retreat”. Europe’s most senior human rights official said the approach risked creating a “hierarchy of people” where some are seen as more deserving of protection than others.

The roots of the clash can be traced back to May, when nine EU states, including Denmark, Italy and Poland, published a letter arguing that the European convention on human rights was hindering their ability to exert sovereignty over their states and deport people who committed crimes. “We have to restore the right balance,” the letter noted. “What was once right might not be the answer of tomorrow.”

This week 27 countries shared these grievances, though several, including France, Spain and Germany, declined to sign the letter, hinting at a divide in how states view the convention.

Speaking to the Guardian this week, Europe’s top human rights official hit out at politicians’ “lazy language”, laced with assumptions and inaccuracies, which led countries to erroneously target human rights legislation.

One example was the “lazy correlation” of migration and crime, said Michael O’Flaherty, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights. “This doesn’t correspond with reality,” he said.

Even so, this distorted perception had been widely peddled. “What’s at issue is this feeding into the misunderstanding in society that we’re opening the door to criminals to run amok in our societies doing untold damage,” he said. “No wonder people get frightened, no wonder people are demanding limits on migration.”

Politicians from across the spectrum were to blame, he said. “What happens is middle-of-the-road politicians use this lazy language, but then it’s instrumentalised by those who would actively promote disinformation.”

He pointed to the UK, where tremendous attention had been given to court cases where the convention on human rights had stymied the expulsion of criminals. “And again here, the figures simply don’t correspond with that,” said O’Flaherty. “The figure is tiny, and it’s completely manageable in any modern rule of law state. And very few of these cases ever reach the European court of human rights because there are all those checks and balances at the national level that kick in first.”

His view was backed by a report, published this week by the University of Oxford, which found that media reporting in the UK was “dominated by often inaccurate or misleading reports” when it came to the impact of the convention on immigration control.

The report also highlighted the many ways in which the convention, whose first signatory was the UK when it launched 75 years ago, safeguards people in workplaces, hospitals and care homes and protects victims of domestic violence and modern slavery.

The history of the convention traces back to the aftermath of the second world war when countries came together to launch the Council of Europe, envisioning it as a guardian of fundamental rights across the continent. These rights were enshrined in the European convention on human rights, a document that has since been signed by 46 countries.

O’Flaherty said he saw no need for the convention to now be modernised, warning that the call by politicians risked creating a “false expectation” among voters. “Is that really going to change migratory flows?” he asked. “Is that going to stop people from crossing the Channel? Is that going to ruin the business model of the migrant smugglers? I don’t think so.”

He also pushed back against the assertion that the convention impeded on states’ sovereignty. Individuals and countries could only make an application to the European court after they had exhausted domestic options, he noted, while the European court of human rights is made up of judges representing every member state. “This is not a bunch of foreign judges imposing something on us,” he said.

Writing in the Guardian this week, the UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, and his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, argued that an update of the convention on human rights was needed to help see off the rise of the populist right.

O’Flaherty rejected the link. “For every inch yielded, there’s going to be another inch demanded,” he said. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around? What happens when another small vulnerable, weak, marginalised group catches the eye of some populist schemers?”

Yielding ground on human rights would ultimately serve the interest of these populists by weakening the rule of law, he said, and risk creating a “hierarchy of people”, a notion he described as “very, very worrying” given the convention’s roots in the horrors of the second world war.

He said: “The convention and the whole human rights system emerged out of the most barbarous hierarchisation of rights holders that you could imagine, where you had not only some humans more worthy than others, but certain humans, because of their origin, as having no value whatsoever.

“A universal system of human rights was built, strategically built, to make sure that we could never end up in that nightmare scenario again,” O’Flaherty added. “We’re not there now, of course we’re not. But we have to be very cautious and careful about the ultimate consequences, albeit unintended, of the paths we might embark on.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71177f45052606d51e8af071642f11a6a424b5d3/401_0_3496_2797/master/3496.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a05e4b65bd4fc8e37dbffafa40b80bd",N,,2025-12-13 16:57:34.791487

As the Buzz forecast last week, on December 11, 2025, the U.S. Senate approved a package of ninety-seven executive branch nominees. Included in the package were Scott Mayer and James Murphy—both nominated to fill empty seats on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)—as well as Crystal Carey, who will now be the Board’s general counsel.

With Mayer and Murphy joining current Democratic member David Prouty, the Board has a functional quorum for the first time since January of this year. But even though Republicans will have a majority, reversing Biden-era Board decisions may not be so easy. While not required by law, traditionally, the Board does not overturn case precedent without at least three affirmative votes. If Mayer and Murphy adhere to this tradition, it means they will need one additional vote—likely from a future Republican nominee—to reverse Board cases issued between 2021 and 2024.

Court of Appeals Upholds Removal of NLRB, MSPB Members. On December 5, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed district court rulings that found President Donald Trump’s removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protections Board (MSPB) were unlawful. In reversing the lower courts’ decisions, the court of appeals ruled that these terminations were lawful because the statutory language prescribing fixed terms for members of the NLRB and MSPB, while allowing for removal for neglect of duty or malfeasance, unconstitutionally limits the president’s ability to remove agency officials who wield executive power on his or her behalf. With specific regard to the Board, the court of appeals determined that the agency wields significant executive authority, including the power to promulgate regulations, craft national labor policy through adjudication, order remedies through enforcement authority, conduct litigation, and oversee union elections.

CBP Proposes Social Media Vetting for Tourists, Short-Term Business Travelers. In a notice published in the Federal Register on December 10, 2025, and pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is soliciting public comment on proposed changes to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). With an ESTA approval, most nationals of Visa Waiver Program countries are permitted to travel to the United States for business or tourism for ninety days or less without obtaining a visa. Specifically, CBP proposes to “require ESTA applicants to provide their social media from the last 5 years.” Comments must be submitted by February 9, 2026.

The administration has already initiated similar social media vetting protocols as applied to F, J, and M visa holders and, most recently, to H-1B visa holders.

DOL Seeks to Help Faith-Based Organizations. On December 10, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) published a Federal Register notice titled, “Addressing Barriers to Participation of Faith Organizations in DOL Programs and Funding.” The notice seeks input from responders on “specific DOL regulations, guidance, or policies, explicitly or implicitly restrict or discourage faith-based organizations from participating in DOL-funded programs (e.g., job training, workforce development, or employment services).” Specifically, DOL seeks information regarding potential “accommodations, policies, or tools could DOL develop to ensure faith organizations receive reasonable accommodations for their religious beliefs and practices” to participate in DOL programs. Comments must be submitted by February 9, 2026.

The solicitation of information is consistent with the current administration’s efforts to support faith-based groups and target religious-based discrimination.

USCIS Cuts Work Authorization Times. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated its policy manual to amend the maximum validity period for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for certain foreign nationals. Effective December 5, 2025, the maximum EAD validity period for the following foreign nationals will be reduced from five years to eighteen months:

Those admitted as a refugee

Those granted asylum

The line of people outside the office for Mexico’s refugee agency formed before 7 a.m., stretching down the sidewalk on a September morning in Tapachula, a small city near the border with Guatemala.

“Strong Cuban coffee!” a woman advertised in Spanish, walking up and down the line.

Haitian women sat across the street selling pastries from large, plastic tubs.

As 9 a.m. approached, the line continued to grow, each new arrival verifying they had found the end of the queue.

Mostly a mix of Haitians, Cubans and Venezuelans, those standing in line were all there to sign in — to prove to the Mexican government that they hadn’t left Tapachula, that they were waiting as instructed for the government to process their asylum applications. They said they had to return and sign in again roughly every two weeks.

When asked how long they’d been waiting in Tapachula, they answered with the number of times they’d come to sign in. A Cuban man who had arrived about three months ago was on his second signature. A Venezuelan woman had signed in 11 times, and two Cuban men said they’d come to sign in nearly 20 times.

None of the asylum-seekers interviewed by Capital & Main were willing to be identified because of their uncertain, vulnerable situations.

The two Cuban men who’d been in Tapachula roughly a year seemed resigned to their indefinite waits.

“When God says,” one of the men responded when asked when his final appointment would happen.

Since President Donald Trump came back into office and shut down a phone application called CBP One that under the Biden administration was the only way to request protection in the U.S., migrants in Mexico have had to recalculate their plans.

Some have continued on to the U.S. anyway, crossing the border without permission — the only way left to gain access to U.S. soil and possibly request protection — and risking deportation without any review of their cases. Others have opted to go back to their home countries or to pursue asylum claims in Canada or Europe.

The people waiting outside the refugee agency in Tapachula were among those who chose a third option, to try to start their lives over in Mexico. COMAR, as the refugee agency is known, has not yet released data about asylum applications in 2025, but organizations including Asylum Access Mexico, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights and Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración have reported long wait times for processing.

The Trump administration’s cuts to foreign aid slashed COMAR’s budget, one of the reasons for the increased waits, according to the human rights organizations.

The U.S. State Department would not comment on the record, but responded with a statement from an unnamed spokesperson:

“In managing U.S. foreign assistance funding, the State Department puts the American people first and ensures every hard-earned taxpayer dollar spent is justified by a concrete benefit to U.S. national interests,” the statement said.

Because of the administration’s cuts, many of the organizations that helped migrants in Mexico have also lost funding and either closed or cut staff, according to Miguel Hernández, head of the Tapachula office for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA.

“Those who stayed trapped in Mexico face a rather broken refugee system,” Hernández said.

Migrants are also still arriving in Tapachula, said Joselin Zamora of Centro de Derechos Humanos Fray Matías de Córdova, a human rights nonprofit that helps migrants in Tapachula.

“They haven’t stopped arriving because the reasons they left their countries haven’t disappeared,” she said.

Requesting protection in Mexico

To apply for asylum in Mexico, migrants first go to the COMAR office and give their information. Workers tell them to wait for an email with appointment details. The entire process is supposed to take about a month and a half, Zamora said, but in reality, it’s much longer.

The wait for just the initial email can take one to four months, Zamora said. From there, asylum-seekers often wait about a year for an interview to determine their eligibility. In the meantime, COMAR requires them to check in periodically and sign in to prove they’re still waiting.

Those needing interviews in languages other than Spanish take the longest, Zamora said, because of limited interpretation resources for the interviews.

For several years, the office has received more applications than it has the resources to complete. More people turned to the Mexican asylum process during the Biden administration because the U.S. government pressured Mexico to stop migrants from heading north, and completing at least part of the process at the time allowed for safer passage through the country.

Now, for many, it’s the only way to avoid deportation to places where they fear for their lives.

The two Cuban women selling coffee that September morning said they’d been in Tapachula since January, and that after Trump came into office, they decided to apply for asylum in Mexico.

From February through September, they signed in at the COMAR office 17 times, they said.

They said they weren’t allowed to leave the state of Chiapas, where Tapachula is located, until they finished the process and had received refugee status. They said they struggled to find work to make ends meet in Chiapas, one of the poorest states in the country.

Every morning, they arrived outside the COMAR office before 7 a.m. to sell coffee and fried food — chicken croquetas, churros and Cuban tamales — to those waiting in line. They said they stayed until either they sold out or there were no more people in line.

What they made from the breakfast sales wasn’t enough to pay rent, they said, so they were constantly looking for other ways to make money.

Hernández said that the cost of living in Tapachula has increased significantly in the past couple of years.

“They can’t get dignified work,” he said of the asylum-seekers still stuck there.

A Haitian woman who had lived in Chile before coming north to Mexico sold drinks next to the Cuban women. She hadn’t been able to sell much, she said.

“Life is really difficult,” the woman said in Spanish.

She worried about being able to take care of her daughter. They had been waiting nine months — or 15 signatures — she said.

A Haitian man named Job stood talking with her. He said that Haitians, in particular, struggle in Tapachula. Over time, as the town became a migrant hub — a place some called a prison city for migrants — many locals discriminated against arriving Haitians.

“We’re looking for life, and there isn’t life really,” Job said in Spanish.

He said he’d been an English and Spanish teacher in Haiti before bandits took control and he had to leave.

‘Starting over from zero’

A little after 9 a.m., the COMAR line started to move, guided by federal police who instructed people to put their phones away and take off hats, glasses and headphones as they entered. Many carried stacks of documents in colorful, plastic folders.

The line wound through crowd-control fencing to the back of a long room.

A man on a megaphone inside the office informed those in line that their next appointment to sign in would be in two weeks at a new location. Workers at two desks called people up one by one from the line to check in.

As the morning wore on, the people still in line outside the building shifted to the shade to avoid the heat of the sun.

The Venezuelan woman who had already signed in 11 times stood toward the back of the line. She said she still hoped to go to the U.S. one day.

“I think that’s the dream of everyone that’s here,” she said in Spanish.

She had crossed through the Darién Gap, a notorious jungle that separates Colombia and Panama that in recent years became a common migrant path north.

She said she had been willing to risk her life taking that route toward the hope of a better future, but she did not want to risk her family. She hoped to be able to bring her adult children, ages 27, 20 and 19, to Mexico once she finished the asylum process.

A Cuban man who stood behind her in line had left his 5-year-old son and wife back home. He traveled from Cuba to Nicaragua and then north through Central America. He, too, hoped to obtain Mexican residency and bring his family to join him.

Both the Venezuelan woman and Cuban man said they had worked in the medical field before deciding they needed to flee their countries because of the political situations there.

They weren’t sure whether they would be able to get relicensed in Mexico.

“It’s starting over from zero,” the Venezuelan woman said, “but nothing is impossible.”

Going home

That same week, in an upscale neighborhood in Mexico City, a group of Venezuelans stood in line outside a building with a different purpose: They were trying to go back to their home country.

They were waiting at the Venezuelan embassy to get help to go home. Those with passports could buy plane tickets home, but otherwise, they had to request safe passage, the only alternative without taking the risky journey through the Darién Gap a second time.

After seeing that path for themselves as they traveled north, those waiting outside the embassy said they didn’t want to repeat their experiences. They were also afraid of staying longer in Mexico. Several said they had been victims of kidnapping or other violence against migrants.

“Here, everything is a fight,” one Venezuelan woman said in Spanish.

Another woman said she’d come north looking for freedom, education for her children, access to health care and work to be able to support family members still in Venezuela. She was worried about starting over back home.

“But we’ll be in known territory,” she said in Spanish.

They were staying in a shelter in Mexico City while they waited for approval of their safe passage requests, she said.

This process, too, was backlogged, according to Gretchen Kuhner, co-founder and director of Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración, or IMUMI. Several faded pieces of paper with QR codes offering information about lists for passports or safe passage requests, relics of that backlog, were still taped to the wall outside the embassy in late September.

But the people waiting that afternoon said they expected to finish the process in a matter of weeks now that fewer people were applying.

A couple waiting for their safe passage documents said they had CBP One appointments to request asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border for Jan. 26, but the Trump administration cancelled the program days before their scheduled date. They said traveling through Mexico was even worse than the Darién Gap, and because of that, they wanted to go home by plane.

They had taken a bus to Mexico City, they said, and Mexican police strip-searched them on the way, looking for money.

“It was horrible,” the wife said. “They abuse you as a migrant.”

They were afraid of going back to Venezuela, but more afraid of staying, they said. They couldn’t find enough work to take care of their basic needs, and schools wouldn’t accept their children because they are not Mexican, they said.

“Our dream was to arrive in the United States, but we couldn’t,” the husband said.

Now, he’s not sure if he would want to live in the U.S. anyway. He’d seen videos online of immigration officials making violent arrests.

“I prefer to be free,” he said.

My family, along with all the family members of high school students involved in the AFS club, hosted students to stay in their homes for a weekend. My family hosted a teenage girl from Ecuador. I’ll call her “Maria.”

“Maria” was the first person I ever met from a different country who was bilingual. Maria spoke both English and Spanish fluently. I remember being so intrigued.

I remember Maria sharing what life was like in Quito, and how different and similar it was to the United States.

As a grade-schooler, I had been clueless how the world operated until that weekend. I was young and naive. I thought the entire world was just like Skokie. I had no idea what it was like living on a farm, on the ocean, in mountains, etc. It was my first real exposure to the concept of cultural diversity.

The last night of the weekend, all the families that sponsored students, along with the foreign exchange students, gathered in the “Oakton Street Lobby” at Niles West. We all sat by the fireplace. Together, all the students connected to AFS sang the song “Guantanamera.”

It was the first time I ever heard a song sung totally in Spanish. That moment has been embedded in my brain for over 50 years.

It was the early 1970s. It was a time of unrest in the United States. The song, and the experience of meeting so many foreign exchange students for the first time, started me thinking outside my sheltered little box.

When learning the words to “Guantanamera,” I started to understand the concept that politics, racism and political terrorism had on our universe.

The song “Guantanamera” opened my eyes up to much more than racism and segregation in the United States. It made me think on a global level for the first time in my life. Even though the song was written in the 1920’s, it became one of the protest songs of the 1970s.

Flashing forward to the unrest in the world today, I just can’t comprehend how the grandchildren of the hippie generation, the grandchildren of flower children — turned into people unable to utilize their own ability to critically think. So many of these young people have become extremely self-centered, prejudiced individuals, who are unable to think for themselves.

How is it that this new generation never learned the concepts of “Peace, Love and Rock and Roll?” What happened to the concept of saving our planet and creating a utopian society? Or a world in which peace, love and understanding prevailed?

I just can’t comprehend how my generation allowed our nation to be brainwashed to the degree that it has. How is it that voters ignored the warning signs of a dictator wanna be?

Twice our nation elected an individual to become President who is a known sexual predator, a person who filed bankruptcy numerous times, a man who has spewed hate against just about every ethnicity, and has made fun of those with physical challenges, along with individuals who risked their lives serving our nation.

How is it so many of today’s politicians grew up during a time in which we all strived for social change? We strived to make the world a better place, and NOT one in which a sociopathic dictator wannabe would use Gestapo-like tactics on innocent people, like what he is doing with ICE.

It’s time to stop this insanity and start singing songs like “Guantanamera” again.",https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/blogs/uploads/users/vicki-polin-new-new1680114980-400x400.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 21:57:10.986283

Grijalva (AZ-07), Greg Stanton (AZ-04), and Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03) in sending a letter to the Chairs and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees calling for a formal congressional investigation into a troubling pattern of abusive conduct and obstruction of independent journalism and congressional oversight by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The request follows a recent DHS operation in Tucson, Arizona, during which agents deployed chemical agents against a crowd that included Rep. Grijalva and clearly identified journalists.

“In a recent incident, DHS agents demonstrated an aggressive response that included the deployment of chemical agents during an operation in Tucson, Arizona, where Representative Adelita S. Grijalva presented herself as Member of Congress to use her legal authority and constitutional duty to obtain pertinent facts, observe policies, and conduct oversight of the executive’s implementation of federal law,” the lawmakers wrote. “On the same day, DHS issued a public statement denying the incident, which is inconsistent with independent press accounts, information from eyewitnesses, and video footage. Such contradictions further erode public trust in the Department and underscore the need for clear, transparent congressional review of its operations.

“This episode is part of a growing and deeply concerning national pattern that raises serious questions about DHS’ operations. Under the current administration, DHS personnel have repeatedly used force or obstructed elected officials and members of the press attempting to observe or inquire about enforcement actions and detention. The growing number of incidents collectively suggest a systemic disregard for oversight, transparency, and constitutional protections by DHS and its component agencies,” the lawmakers continued.

The letter requests a formal congressional investigation into DHS, including to: “Investigate the extent of DHS’ obstruction of Congressional oversight, interference with the right of the press to document and report on DHS operations, excessive use of force tactics against American civilians, including the use of chemical agents and other extraordinary measures, and the impact these tactics have on businesses and local communities.”

In a September ruling, a federal judge wrote that federal officers “unleashed crowd control weapons indiscriminately and with surprising savagery” during protests that occurred in Los Angeles. “Specifically, the Court concludes that federal agents’ indiscriminate use of force … will undoubtedly chill the media’s efforts to cover these public events and protestors seeking to express peacefully their views on national policies,” the judge wrote.

Mary stands nearby outside the Lake Street Church in Evanston, Illinois, wearing a plastic gas mask and flanked by Roman soldiers in tactical vests labeled ""ICE.""

In another Chicago suburb, not far from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has drawn protests over detentions, a sign at the manger outside the Urban Village Church says ""Due to ICE activity in our community the Holy Family is in hiding."" And more than a thousand miles away, the Christ child went missing from a Nativity scene at St. Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced by a hand-painted sign: ""ICE was here.""

These and other stark reimaginings of Christ's birth are drawing praise and outrage as churches turn the Christmas tableau into a commentary on federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. Their creators say they are placing the ancient story in a contemporary frame, portraying the Holy Family as refugees to reflect on the fear of separation and deportation that many families — including their own parishioners — are experiencing today.

Supporters of the displays say the Bible is on their side, but critics call the scenes sacrilegious and politically divisive, accusing the churches of abusing sacred imagery and some arguing they should lose their tax-exempt status. The archdiocese in Massachusetts ordered that the manger must be ""restored to its proper sacred purpose.""

The debate comes as immigration enforcement intensifies in states and cities whose leaders object to the immigration crackdown. In September alone, a combined total of at least 2,000 people were arrested in Illinois and Massachusetts, according to federal arrest figures released by immigration authorities.

""A grave scandal for Catholics""

For churches, Christmas is a time ""when we have public art out on the lawn and we get an opportunity to say something,"" said Rev. Michael Woolf, senior minister at Lake Street. Another Nativity scene created by the Baptist congregation one recent year showed Jesus in rubble — a ""plea for peace"" in Gaza, he said.

St. Susanna parishioners locked baby Jesus in a cage in 2018 to protest how President Donald Trump's first administration was separating families at the border. Another year, they depicted the infant floating in water polluted with plastic to highlight climate change.

Boston Archbishop Richard Henning ordered this year's display taken down. As of Thursday, Father Steve Josoma was seeking a meeting and had yet to comply.

""The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging,"" a diocesan spokesperson said.

Some Catholic activists want the priest punished.

""This is really a grave scandal for Catholics, and I think he's playing with fire,"" said C.J. Doyle, director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. ""The archbishop can remove him as pastor, suspend him from active ministry — he can even close the parish and sell the property right out from under him.""

The community's reality

Josoma said the display's purpose is to move ""beyond static traditional figures and evoke emotion and dialogue"" in response to the fear many parishioners face as federal forces arrest more than undocumented immigrants, sweeping up longtime legal residents and spreading anxiety.

In Illinois, the detention campaign has left bystanders choking on chemical sprays and children traumatized at the site of neighbors and teachers being taken away, prompting state and local investigations.

""We wanted to reflect sort of the reality that our community is experiencing,"" said Jillian Westerfield, associate minister at the United Methodist church in Evanston.

After the figure of Joseph blew down and was damaged, leaving Mary alone with the baby, they put up an explanatory sign: ""Joseph didn't make it. We hold this space to honor and remember all the victims of immigration enforcement terror.""

Critics either don't fully understand the message or ""find it really challenging to their conscience and are lashing out at the art rather than engaging with what the actual message is,"" Westerfield said.

""Not a stunt""

Phil Mandeville, who sits on St. Susanna's Parish Council and coordinates a multi-church refugee support committee, said long-standing relationships make the parish resolute about keeping the display.

The committee has worked with about 10 refugee families since 2019, helping them find housing, enroll in school, learn English and secure work. Much of the effort is done in partnership with the federal government, which puts families through extensive vetting before they arrive, he said.

""Just to emphasize the reason for all of this — it's not a stunt,"" Mandeville said. ""We work on a daily basis with refugees. But people get upset about a bit of plaster. I care more about individuals than I do a manger scene. I understand what it represents — I don't understand why no one cares about these human beings.""

""Look at the Gospel just before Christ was executed — that was political,"" he added. ""We were always taught: when you're unsure how to act, ask, 'What would Christ do?' Now we're doing that, and it doesn't seem to jibe.""

Divided reaction

The controversy in Evanston drew volunteers from a nearby synagogue, who stood outside during Lake Street's services to help worshippers feel safe. Reactions outside the Dedham church ranged widely.

Walter Niland snapped a selfie and said he disagreed with the display. ""I believe that the church enjoys a tax-exempt status,"" said Niland, a Catholic from a neighboring town. ""We should speak to spiritual matters, not matters of political division.""

Others came to challenge the parish directly — including one man who livestreamed his attempt to pull on locked church doors.

Steve Grieger, a former Catholic schoolteacher, drove an hour from Worcester to show his support.

""The Archdiocese says, 'Oh no, that goes against our tradition.' Well, we're living in times that are totally abnormal. We can't just proceed as normal,"" Grieger said. ""If we're following the scriptures of Jesus, then we have to recognize that these ICE raids, and all of these terrible things going on, are totally against that.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8107x4560+0+422/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7c%2F46%2F32c5bcba4003ae298987247ee090%2Fap25345010903357.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 13:57:06.668267

SEE: Federal judge issues order to prohibit immigration officials from detaining Kilmar Abrego Garcia

Mr. Abrego Garcia – Maryland resident, union sheet-metal worker, father of three, and longstanding member of his community – was previously wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March 2025 despite a prior judicial order forbidding his removal to that country. His case has drawn national attention as a stark example of unchecked immigration enforcement and the human cost of policies that prioritize punitive tactics over due process and family unity.

“Today’s ruling is an important affirmation that no person – regardless of immigration status – should be detained without a lawful basis or separated from their family without legitimate cause,” said CAIR’s Maryland Director Zainab Chaudry. “We welcome the judge’s decision, and call on policymakers at all levels of the government to ensure that our immigration system respects basic human dignity, adheres to the rule of law, and keeps families together.”

CAIR Maryland welcomed previous federal court rulings in Abrego’s favor, and has consistently advocated for immigration policies that are humane, fair, and rooted in respect for fundamental rights and civil liberties. This includes ensuring transparency and accountability in enforcement actions and opposing practices that lead to family separation, unlawful detention, and retaliation against individuals exercising legal rights.

SEE: CAIR Welcomes Federal Judge’s Reaffirmation of Due Process in Kilmar Abrego Garcia Case

Judge Xinis’s ruling highlights critical concerns about due process and government overreach. It reinforces that judicial oversight must remain a safeguard against arbitrary detention and that the judiciary plays a crucial role in upholding constitutional protections when executive action exceeds legal authority.

Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case is one of many across the country where immigrant community members – workers, parents, and neighbors – have been caught up in expansive enforcement actions that lack transparency and undermine community safety. CAIR Maryland continues to stand with immigrant families and advocates for comprehensive reforms that ensure fairness and accountability in immigration policy.

The US is ending temporary legal status for citizens of Ethiopia in the United States, according to a government notice on Friday, as the Trump administration continues its crackdown on legal and illegal immigration.

“After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, the secretary determined that Ethiopia no longer continues to meet the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status,” homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said in a notice posted in the Federal Register.

Temporary protected status is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

The program was created in 1991, and under Donald Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, it was extended to cover about 600,000 Venezuelans and 521,000 Haitians. Noem reversed the extensions in February, saying they were no longer justified.

In recent months, the Trump administration has removed the protective status for people from numerous countries, including Haiti, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela. In November, the president announced the termination of protection for Somalis in Minnesota.

Trump has made controlling immigration a central plank of his second White House term. Canceling TPS protections are a boost to the administration’s campaign to deport millions of people. The cancellations have been challenged in court.

The US supreme court in October cleared the way for the administration to revoke TPS for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan people in the United States, granting a request to put on hold a federal judge’s ruling that Noem lacked the authority to terminate the status while litigation proceeds.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also said on Friday it was no longer processing legacy cases under the Cuban and Haitian family reunification parole program, according to a post in the Federal Register. Those programs make it easier for US citizens and lawful permanent residents to bring family members into the country.",https://www.hiiraan.com/uploads/2025/12/1765601648Screenshot2025-12-13075347.png,N,,2025-12-13 13:57:13.629790

If you’re someone who might be subject to deportation in the United States, then it’s probably worth being aware of this new reality…","I don’t think anyone will be surprised to learn this, but there’s a new level of cooperation between government agencies in the United States, which could lead to more airport arrests, including of domestic travelers.

Airline passenger data is helping Trump’s deportation efforts

The New York Times reports how the Trump administration is increasingly using the airline tickets that people book to help with deportation efforts.

When passengers book airline tickets, it’s standard that the data is provided to the TSA, and is compared against national security databases, to identify people on watch lists, suspected terrorists, etc. The TSA hasn’t historically used this information to get involved in domestic criminal or immigration matters. However, that has now changed.

Under a program that was launched in March 2025, multiple times per week, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shares the names of all travelers booked on flights with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE then matches the list against its own database of people subject to deportation, and sends agents to airports to arrest people.

This is of course being done as part of the goal of carrying out the largest deportation campaign in United States history. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson released a statement that “the message to those in the country illegally is clear: the only reason you should be flying is to self-deport home.”

A former deputy head of the ICE office in New York City said the following about this program:

“The administration has turned routine travel into a force multiplier for removals, potentially identifying thousands who thought they could evade the law simply by boarding a plane. This isn’t about fear; it’s about restoring order and ensuring every American knows their government enforces its laws without apology.”

An example of how this program was recently used

Last month, there was a story that got quite a bit of attention about Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a 19-year-old who was attending college in Boston. On November 20, 2025, she showed up at the airport in Boston to fly to Texas to visit her family for Thanksgiving.

Moments before getting on her flight, she was told there as a problem with her boarding pass, and on her way to the customer service desk, she was “surrounded, (placed) in handcuffs, and dragged out of the airport,” according to her attorney.

Within 48 hours, she was deported to Honduras, a country she hadn’t lived in since she was seven years old, when her parents brought her to the United States, while seeking asylum. Her attorney claims she was removed even after a federal judge issued an order barring the government from removing her outside of Massachusetts. She was also never shown a warrant, a removal order, or given any explanation, by ICE officials.

DHS claims that an immigration judge ordered her removal in 2015, but she “illegally stayed in the country since.” Meanwhile her attorney claims the only record he found in the government’s database indicates her case was closed in 2017.

Obviously immigration is a contentious topic. I think a vast majority of reasonable people agree that violent criminals should be deported (I certainly do!). But my heart breaks for children who were brought to this country by their parents (through no choice of their own), and are now being sent to a country that is really “foreign” to them, and that they don’t really know.

At this point it seems like the government is deporting people just to reach a quota. I mean, top White House official Stephen Miller has made it a goal for 3,000 people to be arrested everyday for immigration. To me, it’s sad when you’re deporting people just to deport them, especially someone like this young woman, who was trying to contribute positively to society, was pursuing education, etc.

But hey, I have to be balanced. We live in a democracy, and not in my imaginary dream world. Trump promised the largest mass deportation in history, and that’s what we’re getting.

Bottom line

In recent months, the TSA has started frequently sharing airline passenger lists with ICE, in order to facilitate airport arrests of people subject to deportation orders. Historically, domestic passenger data hasn’t been used for these purposes, but instead, the data was just shared in order to screen potential terrorists.

If the goal is to simply deport as many people as possible, then I can see how using airports is one of the easier ways to do so — you know exactly where and when someone will be, and if they’ve been screened by the TSA, you also know they don’t have weapons.

Since the shooting of two national guard soldiers in Washington DC late last month, with the authorities charging an Afghan man as the suspect, the Trump administration has taken harsh action, especially against Afghans in the US, generating a mix of fear, outrage and defiance in the diaspora.

The government has completely frozen asylum decisions at US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), paused visa and immigration applications filed by Afghans and, more widely, halted all legal immigration cases for nationals of 19 countries listed on its travel ban, including citizenship ceremonies.

“The attacker hasn’t been put on trial, but the whole Afghan community has been labeled as guilty,” said Yahya Haqiqi, president of the Afghan Support Network in the US, an organization founded shortly after the fall of Kabul to Taliban control in 2021 that has helped thousands of Afghan refugees settle in Oregon.

“There are folks that came here because they fought for American values in Afghanistan, and because of the action of one individual, they and the whole community are being harmed. They are scared of their future, of not knowing what’s going to happen tomorrow.”

The administration also directed officials to re-investigate the cases of immigrants from those 19 countries who were granted legal status under the Biden administration, and reduced the validity period for work permits issued to several groups of immigrants, including asylum-seekers and refugees.

Trump administration officials have argued the changes are necessary after federal authorities identified the suspect in the shooting of the national guard soldiers, one of whom died, as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan evacuee who entered the US in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025.

The moves also come amid reports of stepped-up apprehensions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in some heavily Afghan communities.

Afghans who spoke with the Guardian said they condemn the killing of national guard soldier Sarah Beckstrom and that they hope guardsman Andrew Wolfe fully recovers after being critically wounded. But, they said, the policy changes introduced by the administration are unnecessarily creating uncertainty for thousands of families fighting to stay in the United States.

Shir Agha Safi said he worked as an intelligence officer alongside American forces fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. He came to the US in 2022 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden administration effort to resettle tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees.

Safi said he applied for a green card in 2023 through the special immigrant visa (SIV) program, which offers permanent residency to Afghans who supported the American war effort, as translators or in other roles.

“I agree with the re-examination of green cards,” he said in a telephone interview with the Guardian last week – but not for the reasons the Trump administration is citing.

“The US government should recognize the faces of those who served the US mission in Afghanistan,” he said. Safi is now the executive director of Afghan Partners in Iowa, a non-profit in Des Moines, where around 500 Afghan families settled after the 2021 evacuations.

“Some are feeling a sense of betrayal in my community, of being marginalized, but I said that if they have not done anything wrong, they should not be afraid of the changes,” he said.

Some 80,000 Afghan immigrants were granted humanitarian parole to enter the United States under Operation Allies Welcome. As of 2022, nearly 200,000 Afghan immigrants had been welcomed into the United States, with California, Virginia, Texas and New York being the states with the highest concentrations of Afghans.

Haqiqi , in Oregon, said that Afghans in the Portland metro region “are scared of just living, they are scared of exposing themselves as Afghans, not just to immigration officials, but how people will react to them as part of their community”.

Meanwhile, Safi added that in Des Moines, Afghans have been detained by federal immigration officials following the announcement of the sweeping changes to US immigration policies. The government defended the reason behind the reshaping of the process of asylum, visas and green cards, citing concerns for the safety of the country.

“Military-age males were routinely flown into the United States before their identities and backgrounds were fully established, with the Biden administration asserting that thorough vetting would occur only after arrival,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security.

“Under the Trump administration, we have instituted rigorous, multilayered screening: mandatory biometric enrollment, comprehensive social-media vetting, expanded recurrent background checks, and a requirement for annual in-person reporting. The safety of Americans must come first.”

In 2022, a report by the inspector general said that the National Counterterrorism Center had failed to use Department of Defense biometric data when vetting Afghan evacuees after the chaotic 2021 troop withdrawal.

In June, a federal report that reviewed the participation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the evacuation of Afghans since 2021 said: “When potential threats to national security were identified related to certain evacuees, we found that the FBI proactively used its investigative authorities and continuous identity discovery tools to mitigate those potential threats.”

In the wake of the latest policy changes, Vermont’s governor, Phil Scott, a Republican, said: “The shooting in Washington DC is a painful reminder that people can become violent for inexplicable reasons, especially those involved in warfare. Although there’s no excuse for what happened, it’s also not fair to cast blame on an entire group of people who are doing the best they can to integrate into our communities and follow the American dream.”

In a recent memo, USCIS confirmed it had paused all pending immigration applications from 19 countries on the travel ban, including Afghanistan. This means that those people with pending applications for green cards and other benefits, like Safi, are in limbo indefinitely, with their cases unable to move forward for the foreseeable future.

Even before the new restrictions, only a small number of visas were issued to Afghans due to the inclusion of Afghanistan in the travel ban. The majority were special immigrant visas.

According to a federal report, from January to March of 2025, there were more than 10,000 Afghan applicants seeking approval of special immigrant visas. That process has been brought to a complete halt since the shooting in Washington.

Immigration lawyers and Afghan refugees are still scrambling to understand how the Trump administration’s new restrictions will be implemented and for how long. But what is clear is the far-reaching scope of the crackdown. The asylum pause, for example, could affect some 1.5 million applicants awaiting a decision on their cases.

One of them is Freshta, a 29-year-old Afghan immigrant who came to the US in 2022 on a visa for highly qualified students. She asked for her real name to be withheld, citing fears about being targeted and ultimately deported by federal immigration officials amid the recent crackdown.

Freshta said she applied for asylum with USCIS in the first months of 2023. But her case has been brought to a complete halt due to the pause in asylum decisions.

“I came here the legal way. I came here because everyone said there was freedom of speech and I could pursue my dreams as an Afghan woman,” Freshta said in an interview over tea on a recent afternoon in New York City.

“That doesn’t exist in Afghanistan. Everybody knows that women can’t go to school, can’t work, let alone have an opinion. See? I don’t wear scarves, I don’t follow the Taliban’s rule, so small things like these, if not kill me, would create a lot of challenges.”

Decisions on the granting of asylum are made by the Department of Homeland Security. The Guardian reached out to the agency asking whether asylum applicants should expect their applications to be terminated, but the question wasn’t addressed.

“I feel like I am getting close to who I was dreaming to be but it’s hard to be an immigrant now,” Freshta added. “If I speak the language, I pay taxes, I integrate into this society, what else can I do? I want a normal life, a normal human being with dignity.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc7ff4f78ad829425141874c8425717c218f472/239_0_2371_1897/master/2371.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a6726bc3ac71d0fa06943bd13862d7a",N,,2025-12-13 10:58:28.789426

So what happens when immigration agents show up to question the people working at your house? One woman in Charlotte, North Carolina, had to face that situation last month when Border Patrol agents suddenly appeared on her front lawn. NPR's Adrian Florido has her story.

ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: There's a big pine tree in Rheba Hamilton's front yard, about 10 feet tall. Each year, just before Thanksgiving, she has it strung with Christmas lights. But this year, the lights are wrapped only around the very top of the tree, just the tip.

RHEBA HAMILTON: It looks completely ridiculous unless you know why it looks like that.

FLORIDO: On November 15, Hamilton was on her front porch drinking coffee while two men she'd hired to put the lights up set up their ladder and got to work. They'd just gotten started when an unmarked minivan pulled up out front.

HAMILTON: I see the car rolling to a stop, and I see the door's already open with the guys getting out. Border Patrol is here.

FLORIDO: Two uniformed agents with their faces covered got out of the van and approached her workers. Hamilton grabbed her phone and started filming.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAMILTON: Randy (ph), they're in our yard.

FLORIDO: She yelled out to her husband as the agents started peppering her workers with questions in Spanish.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED BORDER PATROL AGENT: (Speaking Spanish).

FLORIDO: I want to know what country you're a citizen of, the agents say. You're not answering my question. I'm a federal agent. In the video, you see the worker on the ladder freeze in place. The one on the ground slowly moves away. Neither says a word. Hamilton gets up close to record.

HAMILTON: I wanted their faces. I wanted to be able to show them hiding their faces. They're not proud of the work they're doing.

FLORIDO: She says she was terrified for the workers, who were undocumented. Then, suddenly and without saying a word, the agents stop their questions and run back to their van and drive off. At that moment, Hamilton felt her fear turn to rage. She rushed toward the van.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAMILTON: Get the hell out of my yard, you [expletive].

I was so angry, and I was really surprised to hear myself bid them farewell because I don't really cuss. But I stand by it.

FLORIDO: DHS says its agents do not racially profile, but Hamilton says that is what it felt like. The agents came onto her property without permission, she says, ready to haul away two men because they look Latino.

HAMILTON: Of course, they chose them because they were brown. But I think, also, they chose them because they thought they were going to be a real easy target.

FLORIDO: Once the agents were gone, her workers ran to their truck and drove off themselves.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAMILTON: Yeah. Just go home.

FLORIDO: Hamilton says she fully supports law enforcement, but she thinks immigration agents under Trump are terrorizing good people like her workers.

HAMILTON: If this is happening in your yard - and while you do not know the people well, you know them well enough to know that they are well and truly screwed if this goes down, that they will maybe never see their families again. So I feel like a lot of people would have done exactly what I did.

FLORIDO: As for the still half-decorated Christmas tree in her yard...

HAMILTON: I thought maybe we'll just leave it like this as a symbol of what happens when ICE and Border Patrol gets involved in your world. Things don't go as planned.

FLORIDO: And you wind up, she says, with no work getting done.

404 Media previously obtained internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement emails revealing the agency’s facial recognition app, called Mobile Fortify, and catalogued social media videos showing agents scanning people’s faces to verify their citizenship.
The app runs the person’s face against a database of 200 million images, according to internal ICE material 404 Media viewed.
The need for Mobile Fortify, according to that internal document, is for immigration authorities to identify people who can be removed from the country.
“It is conceivable that a photo taken by an agent using the Mobile Fortify mobile application could be that of someone other than an alien, including U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents,” the document reads.","This article is a partnership between Reveal and 404 Media.

Jesus Gutiérrez, 23, was walking home one morning from a Chicago gym when he noticed a gray Cadillac SUV with no license plates. He kept walking, shrugging it off. Then the car pulled over and two men got out.

The federal immigration officials told him not to run. They then peppered Gutiérrez with questions: Where are you going? Where are you coming from? Do you have your ID on you?

Gutiérrez is a US citizen. He told the officials this. He didn’t have any identification on him, but, panicking, he tried to find a copy on his phone. The agents put him into the car, where another two agents were waiting, and handcuffed him. Just sit there and be quiet, they said.

Without Gutiérrez’s ID, the agents resorted to another approach. They took a photo of his face. A short while later, the agents got their answer: “Oh yeah, he’s right. He’s saying the right thing. He does got papers,” Gutiérrez recalled the agents saying.

Gutiérrez’s experience, which he recounted to Reveal, is one snapshot of something that federal authorities have acknowledged to 404 Media that they are doing across the country: scanning people’s faces with a facial recognition app that brings up their name, date of birth, “alien number” if they’re an immigrant, and whether they have an order of deportation. 404 Media previously obtained internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement emails revealing the agency’s facial recognition app, called Mobile Fortify, and catalogued social media videos showing agents scanning people’s faces to verify their citizenship.

Now, Reveal has spoken to a person who appears to have had that technology used against them. Gutiérrez sent Reveal a copy of his passport to verify his citizenship.

“You just grabbing, like, random people, dude,” Gutiérrez said he told the agents after they scanned his face. The officials eventually dropped off Gutiérrez after driving for around an hour. For several days, he didn’t go anywhere, not even to the gym. Gutiérrez told his father at the time that he “got kidnapped.”

“This is a flagrant violation of rights and incompatible with a free society,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy project director for the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “Immigration agents have no business scanning our faces with this glitchy, privacy-destroying technology—especially after often stopping people based on nothing more than the color of their skin or the neighborhood they live in.”

Mobile Fortify is available to ICE and Customs and Border Protection officials on their work-issued phones. After an agent scans someone’s face, the app queries an unprecedented collection of US government databases, including one run by the FBI and another that checks for outstanding state warrants, according to user manuals seen by 404 Media. The app runs the person’s face against a database of 200 million images, according to internal ICE material 404 Media viewed.

“The photograph shown [in the app’s results] is the photograph that was taken during the individual’s most recent encounter with CBP, however the matching will be against all pictures CBP may maintain on the individual,” said an internal Department of Homeland Security document 404 Media obtained. The app turns the system usually used for verifying travelers at the border inward against people on US streets.

The need for Mobile Fortify, according to that internal document, is for immigration authorities to identify people who can be removed from the country. But it acknowledges that it may be used against US citizens, like in Gutiérrez’s case.

“It is conceivable that a photo taken by an agent using the Mobile Fortify mobile application could be that of someone other than an alien, including U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents,” the document reads.

Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, previously told 404 Media that ICE will prioritize the results of the app over birth certificates. “ICE officials have told us that an apparent biometric match by Mobile Fortify is a ‘definitive’ determination of a person’s status and that an ICE officer may ignore evidence of American citizenship—including a birth certificate—if the app says the person is an alien,” he said. “ICE using a mobile biometrics app in ways its developers at CBP never intended or tested is a frightening, repugnant, and unconstitutional attack on Americans’ rights and freedoms.”

404 Media has found other instances in which ICE and CBP agents have used a facial recognition app to verify someone’s identity and citizenship. In one that appeared to take place in Chicago, a Border Patrol officer stopped two young men on bicycles before asking his colleague, “Can you do facial?” The other official then scanned one of the boy’s faces, according to a video posted on social media. In another, a group of ICE officers surrounded a man driving a car. He said he was an American citizen. “Alright, we just got to verify that,” one of them said. A second then pointed their phone’s camera at the man and asked him to remove his hat. “If you could take your hat off, it would be a lot quicker,” the officer said. “I’m going to run your information.”

In Gutiérrez’s case, there is little indication that he was stopped for any reason beyond the color of his skin. He is of Mexican descent, he said. Stops of people based on their race, use of Spanish, or location (such as a car wash or bus stop) have become known among critics as “Kavanaugh stops,” after Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh justified the method in a September opinion.

“The Government sometimes makes brief investigative stops to check the immigration status of those who gather in locations where people are hired for day jobs; who work or appear to work in jobs such as construction, landscaping, agriculture, or car washes that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English,” the opinion says. (Gutiérrez speaks Spanish but conducted his interview with Reveal in English.) “If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go. If the individual is illegally in the United States, the officers may arrest the individual and initiate the process for removal.”

The ACLU’s Wessler added: “In the United States, we should be free to go about our business without government agents scanning our faces, accessing our personal information, saving our photos for years, and putting us at risk of misidentifications and wrongful detentions. ICE and CBP’s use of Mobile Fortify on the streets of America should end immediately.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, “DHS is not going to confirm or deny law enforcement capabilities or methods.” CBP said that the agency built the app to support ICE operations and that it has been used by ICE around the country.

A CBP spokesperson added in a statement, “Mobile Fortify is a law enforcement app developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection for ICE agents and officers. It helps field personnel gather information during immigration inspections, but agents must consider all circumstances before deciding on someone’s immigration status. CBP personnel working with ICE teams can access the app after completing required training. Further details cannot be shared due to law enforcement sensitivities.”

The H-1B visa program allows employers to hire foreign workers with specialized skills for jobs where U.S. workers with similar qualifications cannot be found, mainly in science and technology.
“The $100,000 visa fee is devastating for all states, including California, and threatens the quality of education, health care and other core services available to our residents,” Attorney General Rob Bonta of California said in a statement.
An earlier challenge to the $100,000 fee was filed in October by a group of unions, higher-education professionals and religious organizations, who said that the fee would harm hospitals, churches, schools and small businesses.
The $100,000 fee has significantly added to the costs for companies that are considering using the program to hire workers, on top of legal fees and other administrative expenses.","The attorneys general of 20 states including California and New York sued the Trump administration on Friday over its decision to impose a $100,000 fee on visas for skilled foreign workers.

President Trump signed a proclamation in September imposing the fee. His administration has argued that some employers had abused the program to keep wages low, hurting American workers. The policy took effect Sept. 21.

The states have asked a federal court to declare the policy unlawful and to block its enforcement.

The H-1B visa program allows employers to hire foreign workers with specialized skills for jobs where U.S. workers with similar qualifications cannot be found, mainly in science and technology.

California and Massachusetts were the lead plaintiffs in the suit, which was filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. California-based tech companies including Meta, Google and Apple were among the largest employers of H-1B visa holders this year, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Schools and universities also use the program to bring educators and researchers to the United States.

“The $100,000 visa fee is devastating for all states, including California, and threatens the quality of education, health care and other core services available to our residents,” Attorney General Rob Bonta of California said in a statement.

An earlier challenge to the $100,000 fee was filed in October by a group of unions, higher-education professionals and religious organizations, who said that the fee would harm hospitals, churches, schools and small businesses.

The H-1B policy has created a rift among Mr. Trump’s supporters, with his backers in the tech industry on one side and opponents of immigration on the other.

Immigration hard-liners approve of it, saying it would encourage companies to hire American workers. Tech start-ups are among the critics of the new fee, which they say will hurt their ability to fill critical roles and stay competitive. Health care associations have said the fee would exacerbate physician shortages.

Employers apply for the three-year visa on behalf of foreign workers, a process that can be highly competitive because Congress capped the number of H-1Bs issued each year at 85,000. The $100,000 fee has significantly added to the costs for companies that are considering using the program to hire workers, on top of legal fees and other administrative expenses.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/20/multimedia/12trump-news-h1b-suit/20biz-h1b-visas-lfcz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 10:58:25.785283

Contrary to Trump’s ranting, the United States did in fact restrict admission to only include white, European immigrants by law through much of the past century.
Today, the Trump administration is closing immigration pathways by which people enter the US, and gain status when here.
But it is not just through the physical brutalization that this ethnic cleansing is being executed.
This ethnic cleansing can only be accomplished through the destruction of all of the above, in ways that touch the lives of each and every person within the nation, American or not.","A rally on affordability in Pennsylvania on 9 December devolved into a racist tirade when Donald Trump said to the crowd: “We only take people from shithole countries. Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few? … From Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”

Referring to the US representative Ilhan Omar’s hijab as a “little turban”, Trump continued: “She should get the hell out. Throw her the hell out.” His supporters erupted in chants of: “Send her back.”

The rant is abhorrent and factually incorrect, but it does hold one truth – the Trump administration’s vision for the United States is one of a white Christian nation. And the path to accomplish it is through the exclusion and removal of all who do not fit that vision – in other words, through ethnic cleansing.

To that end, Trump and his acolytes have increasingly been using the term “reverse migration” and even proposed an “office of remigration”. The idea, borrowed from white supremacists in Europe, understands immigrants as an inherent threat to the identity of what they imagine to be “white” nations. Immigrants’ forcible and systematic removal – remigration – is envisioned as a way to “restore” that whiteness.

This vision of an ethnically cleansed, white US is being enacted in policy.

Contrary to Trump’s ranting, the United States did in fact restrict admission to only include white, European immigrants by law through much of the past century. Racial quotas were only abolished through Black activism and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s.

Whether immigrants are welcome or not has always been an issue of racial inclusion in this settler colonial state – it is the mechanism by which we decide who belongs in this nation.

Today, the Trump administration is closing immigration pathways by which people enter the US, and gain status when here. Asylum is dead. Resettlement is cancelled except, tellingly, for white Afrikaners. Temporary protective status, which protects people from deportation due to turbulence in their nations of origin, has been or will be cancelled for Haitians, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Syrians and others, leaving hundreds of thousands of people deportable to countries the US recognizes as unsafe. Fees for all immigration processes have sharply increased.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is exploring how to block pathways to citizenship for people who qualify. Citizenship ceremonies are being cancelled as people are being pulled out of line while waiting to take their oaths. Mohsen Mahdawi was detained on 14 April at his citizenship appointment for his participation in a civil pro-Palestinian protest at his university.

Trump issued an executive order to cancel birthright citizenship – the mechanism by which formerly enslaved Black Americans became citizens – that has made its way to the supreme court. And he has said he would “absolutely” denaturalize American citizens if he could.

While this commentary seems bombastic, it is not without precedent in United States history, where in the first half of the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of people were denaturalized due to politicized accusations of fraud, lacking “good moral character” or having “racial ineligibility” (ie not being white).

These current policies sit against the backdrop of the grotesque expansion of the mass deportation system. In September, two months after the so-called Big Beautiful Bill was passed – adding $75bn to ICE’s budget, giving it a bigger budget than all but seven of the world’s militaries, and making it the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government – the supreme court authorized ICE officers to racially profile people.

This makes every person of color, regardless of status, a potential target. And, in a nation that remains segregated by race, where people of color often live apart from white people, ICE is terrorizing communities of color.

US citizens have also been caught up in ICE raids: members of the Navajo and Mescalero nations; a Black man in Chicago with his birth certificate in his backpack; a 20-year-old in Minnesota of Somali origin who kept trying to show ICE officers his passport, only to be forced by officers to undergo a facial scan to prove his citizenship. The investment of millions of dollars in cybersurveillance technology – which can hack phones in a certain radius and uses AI to recognize faces and places – presents a violation of privacy for every single person in this country regardless of race or status.

Meanwhile, the rhetoric that once justified deportations has been revealed as a lie. Data shows that the vast majority of immigrants detained have no criminal record. Concerns of the fiscal burden that immigrants pose (never actually borne out in data) are shown for their absurdity when Trump says there is “no price tag” on his mass deportation agenda. Somalis added $8bn to Minnesota’s economy, though their contributions should have no bearing on their humanity.

There seems to be joy in the cruelty, when Trump trolls “I love the smell of deportations in the morning” as we watch men and women dragged from the arms of their children, sobbing. Many of them are sent to privatized detention centers rife with human rights violations that turn a profit on human lives – incentivized to limit healthcare, food and comfort to detainees to maximize shareholder profit.

But it is not just through the physical brutalization that this ethnic cleansing is being executed. There is also violence in systematic disinvestment that disproportionately cuts essential lifelines for Black and brown people. The Big Beautiful Bill rolls back social spending, denying millions of people healthcare coverage, food benefits and welfare benefits. It enacts policies that exacerbate burdens of student debt. It raises the budgets of police and carceral facilities.

The idea that those who cannot be removed should be subjugated is alive in our academic institutions, through attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion, on students’ right to dissent, on affirmative action.

The strength of this imperfect nation, which has never repaired for its original sins of genocide and enslavement, is in the incredible diversity of people who make it great, in the freedoms it claims to uphold – of life, liberty and justice. This ethnic cleansing can only be accomplished through the destruction of all of the above, in ways that touch the lives of each and every person within the nation, American or not.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dc3b7156f50e2115bbde29a9d9e9a3445b7d7c0/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d964b1de4337ec6ed51cace563407eab",N,,2025-12-13 09:57:08.724402

The debate comes as immigration enforcement intensifies in states and cities whose leaders object to the immigration crackdown. In September alone, a combined total of at least 2,000 people were arrested in Illinois and Massachusetts, according to federal arrest figures released by immigration authorities.

‘A grave scandal for Catholics’

For churches, Christmas is a time “when we have public art out on the lawn and we get an opportunity to say something,” said Rev. Michael Woolf, senior minister at Lake Street. Another Nativity scene created by the Baptist congregation one recent year showed Jesus in rubble — a “plea for peace” in Gaza, he said.

St. Susanna parishioners locked baby Jesus in a cage in 2018 to protest how President Donald Trump’s first administration was separating families at the border. Another year, they depicted the infant floating in water polluted with plastic to highlight climate change.

Boston Archbishop Richard Henning ordered this year’s display taken down. As of Thursday, Father Steve Josoma was seeking a meeting and had yet to comply.

“The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging,” a diocesan spokesperson said.

Some Catholic activists want the priest punished.

“This is really a grave scandal for Catholics, and I think he’s playing with fire,” said C.J. Doyle, director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. “The archbishop can remove him as pastor, suspend him from active ministry — he can even close the parish and sell the property right out from under him.”

The community’s reality

Josoma said the display’s purpose is to move “beyond static traditional figures and evoke emotion and dialogue” in response to the fear many parishioners face as federal forces arrest more than undocumented immigrants, sweeping up longtime legal residents and spreading anxiety.

In Illinois, the detention campaign has left bystanders choking on chemical sprays and children traumatized at the site of neighbors and teachers being taken away, prompting state and local investigations.

“We wanted to reflect sort of the reality that our community is experiencing,” Jillian Westerfield, associate minister at the United Methodist church in Evanston.

After the figure of Joseph blew down and was damaged, leaving Mary alone with the baby, they put up an explanatory sign: “Joseph didn’t make it. We hold this spaced to honor and remember all the victims of immigration enforcement terror.”

Critics either don’t fully understand the message or “find it really challenging to their conscience and are lashing out at the art rather than engaging with what the actual message is,” Westerfield said.

‘Not a stunt’

Phil Mandeville, who sits on St. Susanna’s Parish Council and coordinates a multi-church refugee support committee, said long-standing relationships make the parish resolute about keeping the display.

The committee has worked with about 10 refugee families since 2019, helping them find housing, enroll in school, learn English and secure work. Much of the effort is done in partnership with the federal government, which puts families through extensive vetting before they arrive, he said.

“Just to emphasize the reason for all of this — it’s not a stunt,” Mandeville said. “We work on a daily basis with refugees. But people get upset about a bit of plaster. I care more about individuals than I do a manger scene. I understand what it represents — I don’t understand why no one cares about these human beings.”

“Look at the Gospel just before Christ was executed — that was political,” he added. “We were always taught: when you’re unsure how to act, ask, ‘What would Christ do?’ Now we’re doing that, and it doesn’t seem to jibe.”

Divided reaction

The controversy in Evanston drew volunteers from a nearby synagogue, who stood outside during Lake Street’s services to help worshippers feel safe. Reactions outside the Dedham church ranged widely.

Walter Niland snapped a selfie and said he disagreed with the display. “I believe that the church enjoys a tax-exempt status,” said Niland, a Catholic from a neighboring town. “We should speak to spiritual matters, not matters of political division.”

Others came to challenge the parish directly — including one man who livestreamed his attempt to pull on locked church doors.

Steve Grieger, a former Catholic schoolteacher, drove an hour from Worcester to show his support.

“The Archdiocese says, ‘Oh no, that goes against our tradition.’ Well, we’re living in times that are totally abnormal. We can’t just proceed as normal,” Grieger said. “If we’re following the scriptures of Jesus, then we have to recognize that these ICE raids, and all of these terrible things going on, are totally against that.”

Data obtained and recently released by the Deportation Data Project show immigration arrests skyrocketed in the state and mostly were made through local jails, following new state laws requiring cooperation between local sheriffs and ICE.

Federal agents are following through with the Trump administration's directives to fill immigration jails — ICE made about 3,400 arrests in North Carolina from Jan. 20 through Oct. 15 this year compared to about 1,720 arrests in all of 2024, according to a WUNC analysis of the data.

The Deportation Data Project is a team of researchers based out of UCLA and UC Berkeley which filed Freedom of Information Act requests and sued the government to obtain federal data for 2025, 2024 and a part of 2023.

Note: The data in many cases include location identifiers, but not in all. The federal government has not released specific numbers, nor verified figures reported by the Deportation Data Project. WUNC identified North Carolina immigration arrests through a combination of attribution to counties, localities, metro areas and detention facilities where detainees were processed. Figures reported in this story are close estimates, but should not be considered exact.

Data for all of the U.S. published by the Deportation Data Project show that in this same time frame, around 75,000 people arrested by ICE did not have a criminal record, which is more than one-third of all ICE arrests, NPR reported.

ICE is a separate agency from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, whose green-vested agents targeted the state in last month's operation dubbed ""Charlotte's Web"". ICE primarily conducts arrests through agreements with local jails and is aided by the new North Carolina laws under House Bills 10 and 318.

Maine resident opens up about his journey in ICE detention, which included wedding at Texas facility

A man living in Maine who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for weeks is sharing the wild story of how he and his fiancée got married at the Texas immigration facility where he was being held. Lucas Segobia, a Searsport resident and Brazilian native, said that back in May, he was driving to work in Bar Harbor with his friend Marcos Henrique after attending a festival out of state. Driving on the Maine Turnpike through Scarborough, they were pulled over by the Maine State Police for improper license plates.""I was asleep, my friend was driving,"" Segobia recalled. ""He said, 'Oh, the cops just pull us over,' and I say, 'Okay, what happened? What did you do? An accident?' He said, 'Nothing, I was just driving normal.'""In heavily redacted body camera footage — obtained by Segobia and shared with Maine's Total Coverage — a state trooper can be heard asking the pair for their licenses. The footage does not show exactly what was given to the officer, but Segobia had overstayed his visa, and Henrique was driving without a license.""Because you have no license, I need to give you a couple tickets, so it's going to take a while,"" the trooper said in the video.""He said, 'OK, you guys just wait here,'"" Segobia said of the encounter. ""He went to his car, and we waited, like, 40 minutes, almost an hour. And when he comes back, he comes back with the Border Patrol.""In the video, the trooper makes a few calls about the situation, including to someone who said they needed about 30-40 minutes to come ""get those guys."" About a half hour later, an official with U.S. Border Patrol arrived. When the Border Patrol official determined Segobia and Henrique did not have legal status, the official took them into custody. “On May 26, 2025, the Maine State Police requested Border Patrol assistance in verifying the identities of two individuals encountered during a traffic stop,"" a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in response to the detainments this past spring. ""Border Patrol agents determined that one of the individuals had overstayed their B2 visa, and neither had legal status in the United States. Both individuals were taken into custody and turned over to ICE/ERO (Enforcement Removal Operations) for removal.”""They arrest me and arrest my friend who was driving, and we were asking, 'Why? Where are we going?' And they don't say anything,"" Segobia recalled. ""The first moment I was like, 'OK, I'm going to get deported.' Like, I don't know where I'm going. I don't know what's happening or what's going on.""By this time, Segobia's fiancée and now wife, Laura, had arrived on the scene, but there was nothing she could do but watch her fiancé be taken away.""I was pretty frantic and was talking with both officers because I knew at that point, there's nothing in my power that I could do to convince officers to release him,"" she said. ""I was just being like, 'I need to keep track of him,' because this is the reality of our country right now, is that this is happening all over the place.""Laura and several friends made calls to try to locate Lucas, and over the next few days, he was moved around to a few facilities in Maine.""They put like nine people inside the room, inside a cell, and it's supposed to be just one, so it's really small,"" Segobia said of his time at a facility in Fort Fairfield. ""People before me, they were there three days or four days, just with no showers, one burrito and one bottle of water (a day).""""They left the lights on,"" he added. ""I don't even know what time is, like, if it's day or night.""A CBP spokesperson said Border Patrol does not operate long-term holding facilities and seeks to transfer individuals into ICE custody within 72 hours.""Within the State of Maine, there are no long-term immigration holding facilities,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""Several factors governed by law and internal policy affect when, where, and how a detainee will be transferred to ICE ERO custody. Detainees may be transported by vehicle or aircraft to ICE ERO custody in other states.""""Adult detainees are provided food at regularly scheduled mealtimes,"" the spokesperson continued. ""Reasonable efforts are made to provide showers for detainees who are approaching 72 hours in detention. Blankets are made available to all detainees.""Segobia said after pleading with the officers, he was able to make some calls and get in contact with the Brazilian consulate. He was also able to get in contact with Laura, thanks to a list of contacts he slipped into his shirt pocket before being detained.""When I see that I was getting arrested, I started to write numbers, to have the numbers to talk with someone,"" Segobia said. ""And I put in my clothes, my pocket of my shirt."" Laura continued to gather support, even holding a rally in Portland, sharing Lucas's story. But right before the rally, she found out he was moving to a facility in Texas. ""When I found out he was in Texas, I was like, 'I'm going,'"" she said. Laura crashed on a friend's couch in Austin for weeks and was only able to see Lucas in the facility once a week for an hour. In that time, she was able to secure an attorney, who encouraged the couple to move up their wedding date. ""One of the guards gave me a packet to fill out,"" she said, explaining the process to apply for a marriage license and request the ability to marry within the facility. ""I, Laura Anderson, drove 3,000 miles from Maine to the state of Texas on my own free will, and I am not getting paid to do this.""The couple's request was approved, and in a small ceremony at the Karnes County Immigration Process Facility in South Texas, they were married.""I mean, after I got to go have Brazilian barbecue with his mom, and I got a hotel,"" Laura joked. ""It was kind of funny because like guards for you were nicer afterwards, they were like, 'Oh, you got married, congratulations.'""""Yeah, I got famous in the jail,"" Lucas said.Luana Morine, Segobia's immigration attorney, said the marriage helped Segobia's bond application, along with his ties to the community and evidence of employment. ""Upon considering all the evidence, the immigration judge concluded and determined that he would not pose a flight risk and that Lucas himself does not pose a danger to the community,"" Morine said. ""We do want to show the judge that this individual has a lawful pathway to obtaining status in the United States,"" she continued. ""We were able to do just that in Lucas' case, because during his time in detention, he married his wife Laura, who has been very supportive throughout this process and is a U.S. citizen, which makes him eligible for an adjustment of status.""Lucas was released and is now back home in Maine, but his legal journey is not over. Morine said they are asking the court to end removal proceedings so Lucas can apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to adjust his legal status, given his marriage to a U.S. citizen.Lucas' next court date is Dec. 18.

“On May 26, 2025, the Maine State Police requested Border Patrol assistance in verifying the identities of two individuals encountered during a traffic stop,"" a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in response to the detainments this past spring. ""Border Patrol agents determined that one of the individuals had overstayed their B2 visa, and neither had legal status in the United States. Both individuals were taken into custody and turned over to ICE/ERO (Enforcement Removal Operations) for removal.”

""They arrest me and arrest my friend who was driving, and we were asking, 'Why? Where are we going?' And they don't say anything,"" Segobia recalled. ""The first moment I was like, 'OK, I'm going to get deported.' Like, I don't know where I'm going. I don't know what's happening or what's going on.""

By this time, Segobia's fiancée and now wife, Laura, had arrived on the scene, but there was nothing she could do but watch her fiancé be taken away.

""I was pretty frantic and was talking with both officers because I knew at that point, there's nothing in my power that I could do to convince officers to release him,"" she said. ""I was just being like, 'I need to keep track of him,' because this is the reality of our country right now, is that this is happening all over the place.""

Laura and several friends made calls to try to locate Lucas, and over the next few days, he was moved around to a few facilities in Maine.

""They put like nine people inside the room, inside a cell, and it's supposed to be just one, so it's really small,"" Segobia said of his time at a facility in Fort Fairfield. ""People before me, they were there three days or four days, just with no showers, one burrito and one bottle of water (a day).""

""They left the lights on,"" he added. ""I don't even know what time is, like, if it's day or night.""

A CBP spokesperson said Border Patrol does not operate long-term holding facilities and seeks to transfer individuals into ICE custody within 72 hours.

""Within the State of Maine, there are no long-term immigration holding facilities,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""Several factors governed by law and internal policy affect when, where, and how a detainee will be transferred to ICE ERO custody. Detainees may be transported by vehicle or aircraft to ICE ERO custody in other states.""

""Adult detainees are provided food at regularly scheduled mealtimes,"" the spokesperson continued. ""Reasonable efforts are made to provide showers for detainees who are approaching 72 hours in detention. Blankets are made available to all detainees.""

Segobia said after pleading with the officers, he was able to make some calls and get in contact with the Brazilian consulate. He was also able to get in contact with Laura, thanks to a list of contacts he slipped into his shirt pocket before being detained.

""When I see that I was getting arrested, I started to write numbers, to have the numbers to talk with someone,"" Segobia said. ""And I put in my clothes, my pocket of my shirt.""

Laura continued to gather support, even holding a rally in Portland, sharing Lucas's story. But right before the rally, she found out he was moving to a facility in Texas.

""When I found out he was in Texas, I was like, 'I'm going,'"" she said.

Laura crashed on a friend's couch in Austin for weeks and was only able to see Lucas in the facility once a week for an hour. In that time, she was able to secure an attorney, who encouraged the couple to move up their wedding date.

""One of the guards gave me a packet to fill out,"" she said, explaining the process to apply for a marriage license and request the ability to marry within the facility. ""I, Laura Anderson, drove 3,000 miles from Maine to the state of Texas on my own free will, and I am not getting paid to do this.""

The couple's request was approved, and in a small ceremony at the Karnes County Immigration Process Facility in South Texas, they were married.

""I mean, after I got to go have Brazilian barbecue with his mom, and I got a hotel,"" Laura joked. ""It was kind of funny because like guards for you were nicer afterwards, they were like, 'Oh, you got married, congratulations.'""

""Yeah, I got famous in the jail,"" Lucas said.

Laura Segobia

Luana Morine, Segobia's immigration attorney, said the marriage helped Segobia's bond application, along with his ties to the community and evidence of employment.

""Upon considering all the evidence, the immigration judge concluded and determined that he would not pose a flight risk and that Lucas himself does not pose a danger to the community,"" Morine said.

""We do want to show the judge that this individual has a lawful pathway to obtaining status in the United States,"" she continued. ""We were able to do just that in Lucas' case, because during his time in detention, he married his wife Laura, who has been very supportive throughout this process and is a U.S. citizen, which makes him eligible for an adjustment of status.""

Lucas was released and is now back home in Maine, but his legal journey is not over. Morine said they are asking the court to end removal proceedings so Lucas can apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to adjust his legal status, given his marriage to a U.S. citizen.

Lucas' next court date is Dec. 18.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/01405fca-7deb-4cd0-b1ea-6255a5869361/903dde0c-af19-4671-9aca-364b598c83bf.jpg?crop=0.805xw:0.803xh;0.0977xw,0.00289xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-12-13 10:58:44.777510

Photos appeared to show dozens of migrants wearing life jackets being brought in to Dover, Kent, aboard a Border Force vessel.

Before the weekend, no migrants had made the journey for four weeks, according to Home Office figures. The last recorded arrivals before Saturday were on 14 November, marking the longest uninterrupted stretch since 2018.

December is typically a quieter month for crossings due to adverse weather conditions, and this is thought to have contributed to the lull.

Home Office figures on the number of migrants that arrived in the UK on small boats on Saturday will be published on Sunday.

So far this year, 39,292 people have made the Channel crossing, the highest figure for any year other than 2022 when there were 45,774 arrivals.

More than 187,000 people have arrived in small boats since figures were first recorded in 2018.

The UK government has ramped up efforts to tackle small boat crossings in recent months, but the measures are not expected to have an immediate impact.

At the Labour Party conference, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would ""smash"" people smuggling gangs and cut the number of crossings by 2029.

Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy met with ministers from other European nations last week to discuss reforms to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to make it easier to deport illegal migrants.

In November, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced asylum changes including making refugee status in the UK temporary and subject to review every 30 months, and sending refugees home if their country is deemed safe.

A ""one in, one out"" pilot agreed between the UK and France began in August. Under the scheme, for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in Britain comes the other way.

Sonja Hutson

If you spend a lot of time online, you may have seen videos like this one.

[VIDEO CLIP PLAYING]

Videos of people being arrested by federal immigration agents.

The Trump administration says it’s deported more than half a million people who entered the country unlawfully. It wants that number to grow dramatically. And just how government officials gather information on the people they wanna deport is changing in a big way.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is Swamp Notes, the weekly podcast from the Financial Times, where we talk about all of the things happening in US politics, finance and the economy. I’m Sonja Hutson, and this week we’re asking: how is the US government using private data to carry out immigration enforcement? Here with me to discuss is Peter Andringa, he’s a reporter on the FT’s visual investigations team. Hi, Peter.

Peter Andringa

Hi, Sonja.

Sonja Hutson

And we’ve also got Stefania Palma, the FT’s US legal and enforcement correspondent. Hi, Stefania.

Stefania Palma

Hi.

Sonja Hutson

So Peter, you recently published a big investigation into how the Department of Homeland Security uses this web of private contractors, data brokers and government agencies to help deport more people. What made you wanna report this story?

Peter Andringa

So some colleagues and I have been looking at federal contracts a lot this year. In part because ICE received a huge amount of money, over $75bn in the Big, Beautiful Bill that the Trump administration passed over the summer. And so when ICE is trying to ramp up its operations so quickly, it turns to contractors to deploy that money into the field as fast as it can.

So we’ve been looking at detention centres. We were looking at the deportation flights around the globe, and then later in the summer and early in the fall, I started seeing more and more videos of ICE operations on the ground, and wondering, how does any of these get organised? You know, where does the data come from? How do they find out whether someone they’ve arrested is or isn’t a citizen, or is or isn’t who they are? And so I started digging into the contracts and I was surprised to learn that there really was this huge and growing web of contracted private companies involved in piecing this whole data system together.

Sonja Hutson

Stefania, before we delve any further into Peter’s reporting, I think we should go over some definitions here. So ICE or Immigration and Customs Enforcement sits under the Department of Homeland Security. What has DHS done historically and what’s so different about this year?

Stefania Palma

So DHS was set up right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks here in the US, sort of as a response in trying to put under a single umbrella different government efforts to counter that kind of risk. But obviously since then, the agency has been involved in a string of different things, be it immigration, drugs, or human trafficking. And so by definition, given there’s no one single mandate per se, you could argue there always has been a bit of tension as to what really defines this department in terms of responsibilities. And currently under the Trump administration, just because of how important the immigration policy has become for his second term, the DHS and ICE has therefore been heavily focused on immigration and deportations.

Sonja Hutson

Well, that leads us into, you know, this particular area that you reported on, Peter. Can you give us some examples of the companies that we’re talking about here when we’re talking about the use of private data for immigration enforcement? I mean, who is ICE buying from?

Peter Andringa

So there’s a whole range of companies, but one that people will have probably heard of is a company called Palantir, which has been a vendor for ICE for a long, long time, who was often building tools that were helping with their criminal investigation. Palantir has been contracted to build a system that they’re calling ImmigrationOS that’s trying to track the identity and path. They call it the immigration life cycle of immigrants all throughout the country at all stages of their immigration process. And they’re also using that then to manage tracking down who they’re going to arrest and who they’re going to deport and watching who leaves the country.

Sonja Hutson

So Palantir is basically this kind of data synthesis company. Like, they’re bringing together all these sources of data to paint a really complete picture of how specific immigrants are moving through the country.

Peter Andringa

That’s exactly right. Palantir, you can think of as the, like, connecting layer that pulls in data from a ton of different government systems. You know, ICE has been acquiring data from the IRS and from the Social Security Administration. They’ve been buying data from data brokers — from established companies as well. Like Thomson Reuters — which is, you know, a big legal services data provider — has an investigative product called Clear, that provides all sorts of utility bills, court records, internet data, vehicle registrations that ICE can use to find data, both private and public, on individuals all across the country.

Sonja Hutson

I don’t think of Thomson Reuters as a company that would be working on this type of immigration enforcement. Palantir obviously, you know — and I think in a lot of people’s minds is really synonymous with this type of work — but it’s interesting that immigration enforcement is also working with these really household names.

Peter Andringa

Yeah, and to be clear, Palantir and Thomson Reuters didn’t comment for our investigation, and I don’t know how much the companies themselves are choosing whether or not their tools are being used for immigration. Palantir has obviously signed up to build this ImmigrationOS system, but in Thomson Reuters’ case, their tools are designed for criminal enforcement, and they sell tools to law enforcement — you know, local, state, federal — for all sorts of investigations.

Sonja Hutson

What kind of tools are we talking about here?

Peter Andringa

One of the tools that has been really, really popularly used for criminal investigations for a long time are these automated licence plate readers, which are networks of cameras across the country that ICE has bought through Thomson Reuters to be able to sort of tag different vehicles as they travel. You can look up one car as it travels from place A to place B. You can look up the whole history for that car. You could look up any car that passed the specific camera at the specific time.

And you know, historically, that’s really useful for tracing criminals across the country, or the movement of drugs or weapons or whatever it may be. Now, we see examples where ICE is using this and linking it up with the registration data and with their citizenship data in order to make more arrests and ultimately sort of feed their deportation targets.

Sonja Hutson

Do we know how many companies ICE and DHS are purchasing data from? Like how big is this web?

Peter Andringa

There’s definitely hundreds of different companies that ICE is buying stuff from, but the funny and surprising thing about it is that the dollar amounts involved are not always that large. ICE spends billions of dollars on deportations and on flights every year, and on detention centres even more. But the total surveillance that we could find for the fiscal year 2025 was only about $350mn. And so, you know, in the big scheme of things, I think one of the interesting things we discovered is how inexpensive it is to acquire these surveillance tools, and that’s in part because of the nature of the internet.

All of us have this trace data about our lives, about our social media activity, about products and services that we purchased, and that data is being sold and resold among data brokers on the internet every single day. And so, ICE and law enforcement more generally, is able to tap into those data brokers for much, much less expensive than they might have otherwise sort of had to build surveillance capabilities on their own.

Sonja Hutson

Stefania, does any of this data collection and the way it’s being used raise legal concerns?

Stefania Palma

I think definitely. I think as it often has happened in recent decades when it comes to data collection and distribution linked to the internet age, there always are legal questions.

Sonja Hutson

Hard to avoid.

Stefania Palma

Yes, exactly. And I think in this case, there have been many questions around things like confidentiality and privacy. And we saw that in one case, for instance, sort of a non-profit group and others filed a lawsuit arguing that the IRS was actually turning its back on its internal rules when it comes to protecting the confidentiality of information tied to taxpayers. And actually, last month in that case, the judge decided to halt the agreement that IRS had with ICE. It’s essentially arguing that it’s very likely that this entire set-up is in fact unlawful. So it definitely raises a lot of important questions, and ones that also have important ties to the Constitution.

Sonja Hutson

There are constitutional protections about privacy from the government. How does that change when we’re talking about privacy protections from private companies?

Stefania Palma

I think critics of, say, what ICE is doing, especially with this use of data that it is purchasing also from companies and not necessarily just from other parts of the government, definitely raises questions around the Fourth Amendment of the US constitution, which basically protects the population from untoward seizures or surveillance, essentially. And I think critics of ICE at the moment are arguing ICE purchasing this data from private companies is seen as an effort, kind of a sidestep things like Fourth Amendment rights, but also other processes that would kick in, like having to go out and seek court orders in terms of trying to get access to this information. But having these deals is sort of seen as kind of a backchannel to try and evade all of those responsibilities. And of course, this is going to be, I think, an enormous legal and constitutional question in this Trump administration.

Sonja Hutson

And Peter, you spoke to some former DHS staffers who faced similar situations under prior administrations. What did they tell you?

Peter Andringa

Yeah. I spoke with a lot of different officials from, you know, the last 20 years of work in the Department of Homeland Security, and they told me that, you know, there’s been a real administration-to-administration shift over how they treat these issues of privacy and surveillance.

The Biden administration in particular, they said, spent a lot of time carefully thinking about what types of data they could and couldn’t purchase. And one official told me that they determined that a lot of stuff was legal, that even then they thought was going to be inappropriate. And a big part of these discussions were actually two particular offices inside of DHS: the Privacy Office and the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. And these offices were constantly pushing and pulling against other parts of the department that were asking for more and more data and for more and more capabilities, and, you know, doing their best to negotiate those trade-offs and to ensure transparency was happening where it needed to.

The big change since this administration has come in, officials told me, is that these departments have really been sort of sidelined. The Department of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties went from over 130 staff to just 22. The privacy office has shrunk somewhat less in size but has shrunk in ambitions. They’ve devolved a lot of authority to sort of local component offices, and what officials told me that means is that there’s less and less oversight over how these technologies are being used. There’s fewer and fewer people internally asking the hard questions about whether a given surveillance tool is really necessary or appropriate for a given use case.

Sonja Hutson

OK, so all this investment in data, do we know what effect that is actually having on immigration enforcement?

Stefania Palma

I think one big topic of debates in this second Trump administration is what specific policy priorities are doing to how law enforcements is rolled out in this country, and I would say a lot of Trump critics, but also sort of former law enforcement officials, have continuously raised concerns around the fact that so many resources across the board are being taken away from other priorities — say, even things like, for example, at sort of the FBI, what happens when you move so much staff to focus on immigration crackdowns when you have, say, agents like the FBI that should be perhaps also, if not more, focused on preventing, say, terrorism attacks. And this is something that . . . this concern has really been growing, I think, in recent months. And there really doesn’t seem to be any signal, essentially, that the administration is choosing to go the other way, because immigration has become such a linchpin of this second presidency for Trump, and it’s, I think, politically too important for him.

Peter Andringa

Yes, Stefania is absolutely right. I spoke with a lot of officials from the Homeland Security Investigations Division of ICE, which is from the old customs enforcement side that was focused on sort of human smuggling and drug smuggling and trafficking and all sorts of cross-border crimes. And some of those officials were fans of the president and actually agreed with his immigration goals. But the thing that they raised concerns to me about was the redirection of resources away from all of the other investigations they were working on. They told me they were really concerned that crimes against children or drug smuggling or weapons would be slipping into the country without someone like them watching.

Sonja Hutson

What is DHS and the White House have to say about all this?

Peter Andringa

So we put these things both to DHS and the White House, and the White House pushed back against the idea that they’re not able to do both. They argue that they can both enforce immigration law and enforce criminal law across the country. White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson told me that narcotics seizures and human smuggling arrests are up significantly, and she described a historically secure border so that the Trump administration is making America safer than ever before.

Sonja Hutson

Stefania, what do you think comes next in this evolution of the Department of Homeland Security?

Stefania Palma

I think it’s interesting to see some of the data the DHS has put out. I think recently they came out and said that for the first year of Trump’s second term, they expect to deport a total of approximately 600,000 people, which is actually definitely below the reportedly talked about 1mn mark. So, it’ll be interesting to see what that does politically. Do they keep doubling down and doubling down, especially as obviously midterm elections are coming up?

And the question of immigration has obviously been a successful one for Trump during the general election of 2024 in a way that I think the Democratic party has found far more testy as something to navigate. However, others argue that the kinds of, say, videos that Peter included in his story, the things that the public sees in terms of the level of aggression, in terms of ICE arrests or just the unprecedented tools and legal tools used to deport individuals, may be shocking the population here in the US in a new and different way, and in turn may be spurring some Democrats to actually stand up and forcefully sort of reject all of this.

Sonja Hutson

And Peter, what about you? What are you looking out for next?

Peter Andringa

So the thing that I’ve been hearing from officials most recently, and what their concerns really laid, is in the expansion of these surveillance efforts beyond just immigration. President Trump raised a memo in September authorising law enforcement across the federal government to investigate what they call, quote, acts of political violence and intimidation, including, quote, civil disorder. And officials inside DHS told me that those sorts of declarations, while they are not themselves laws, have the effect of shaping the behaviour throughout this entire massive department. There are a lot of officials who I spoke to who are very afraid about what could happen next.

Sonja Hutson

Stefania Palma

Thank you.

Sonja Hutson

All right, we are going to take a quick break and when we come back, we’ll do Exit Poll.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

We are back with Exit Poll where we ask an FT journalist one of your questions. This week we have Steff Chávez, the FT’s US defence correspondent. Hi, Steff.

Steff Chávez

Hi, Sonja. Nice to be here.

Sonja Hutson

Steff, we’ve heard from a bunch of listeners in the last couple weeks who had questions about the strikes that the US military is launching on boats that they say are carrying drugs near the coast of Venezuela. One of them is Steven from New Zealand, and he wanted to know this: what legal justification is the US government using for these strikes?

Steff Chávez

So, of course, the legality of the entire boat strikes campaign is being questioned. But in this case in particular, it’s the fact that they hit survivors. After viewing the video of the follow-up strike, which some lawmakers were able to see, Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that it showed the US military attacking shipwrecked sailors. So the DoD’s own Law of War Manual says that shipwrecked people should not be knowingly attacked, fired upon, or unnecessarily interfered with, and that orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal. US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday said that he was briefed after this follow-up strike that the survivors were, quote, folks who could still be in the fight with, quote, access to radios. And that, quote, there was a link-up point of another potential boat; drugs were still there. So he is basically saying that those who, you know, the lawmakers are calling shipwrecked were actually, as he said, still in the fight. That seems to be DoD’s justification, that these survivors were still a threat and were still engaging.

Sonja Hutson

And of course this week, Trump administration officials said that they captured an oil tanker with ties to Venezuela. What’s the justification there?

US officials have said that the tanker was seized because it’s under sanctions for transporting oil from Venezuela and Iran in support of foreign terrorist organisations. But as we’re recording, this just happened, so things are still developing. But Trump said on Wednesday, quote, other things are happening, so you’ll be seeing that later. So this is very much developing, and there are certainly questions about whether this is a new broadside in Trump’s pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro’s regime.

Her husband called her and said federal immigration agents were following them.
Bullies rule by fear and violence, and that is exactly how federal immigration agents have been behaving under the Trump administration's “mass deportation” mandate.","The U.S. Senate's Permanent Committee on Investigations released a report on December 9 titled, “Examining the Trump Administration's Extrajudicial Immigration Detentions of U.S. Citizens.” It contains 22 accounts, from across 10 states, of U.S. citizens detained by Immigration and Customs and Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol from June to November of this year—from across the nation.

The report was released in conjunction with a shadow hearing hosted by House and Senate Democrats.

“Americans should have a hard time recognizing our great nation in these shocking, stomach turning stories of fellow Americans assaulted brutally by agents of the United States government,"" said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal who authored the report and spoke during the hearing on Tuesday.

There are four new accounts included in the report relayed by U.S. Citizens who have never spoken with the media about their kidnappings. Julian Cardenas, Alberto Nila, and Ceasar Saltos were kidnapped in the area of Southern California. Their stories were shared for the first time. L.A. TACO will release a separate article, including these accounts tomorrow.

Of the 22 individuals, 11 of them were detained in the Los Angeles area including the aforementioned three: Cary Lopez Alvarado, Job Garcia, Brian Gavidia, Adrian Andrew Martinez, Javier Ramirez, Rafie Ollah Shouhed, Andrea Velez, Andreina Mejia, and her 15-year-old son.

The report does not include the testimonies of green card holders or visa recipients who have been taken by federal immigration agents. An article by Pro Publica detailed at least 170 instances of U.S. Citizens having been detained by federal immigration agents, which prompted the investigation by Senate Democrats.

L.A. TACO found that there have been at least 15 U.S. citizens detained in at least 96 “Kavanaugh Stops” in Southern California–which have been the result of the Supreme Court’s stay on the temporary restraining order on racial profiling by federal immigration agents in Los Angeles and surrounding counties.

The report describes patterns that investigators found during their interviews: Seven of the 22 individuals interviewed were held for longer than 24 hours; the detention of and reckless treatment of children; the routine use of excessive force; the denial of medical care and basic needs; violent reactions to community observers; denied claims of citizenship; the widespread use of agents using clothes to conceal their identities; causing fear; and agents fabricating assault claims.

L.A TACO has reported on the brutal detainment and initial disappearance of Adrian Andrew Martinez into federal immigration custody in June, and was the first outlet to speak with his family.

It is a term rooted in white supremacy and the ethnic cleansing of anyone who is not white. The DHS X account is home to a slew of anti-immigrant, racist, and xenophobic comments distributed by the federal agency.

DHS has lied to the U.S. public, denying claims that U.S. Citizens are being racially profiled.

It is clear in our reporting here at L.A. TACO, and in this Senate Probe, that U.S Citizens are being detained and their’ civil liberties are being violated, resulting in countless human rights abuses.

The abuse of U.S. citizens, with protected legal status, is another chilling indication that the treatment of people without legal status is significantly much worse. This past year has seen the highest rate of death in detention in decades, with three additional deaths occurring in ICE custody this month in Texas.

“The Trump Administration is seeking to build a nationwide paramilitary force with vast resources that lawlessly detains citizens based on its own whims—an effort which has a number of unfortunate and obvious historical parallels,” states the report.

Children detained by federal immigration agents

“M”, a 6 year-old child with autism, lured and kidnapped by ICE agents (September 16, 2025)

“M” was kidnapped from her family's car by armed ICE agents in Massachusetts. Agents held her on the edge of her family's lawn in an attempt to lure her parents off of their private property. Agents took her to the local police department where she fell ill and was not provided with medical treatment. When she was released she had to be taken to the emergency room for treatment, had to miss school, and now suffers from nightmares.

14-year-old zip-tied and six and eight year-olds held at gunpoint by unidentifiable men (October 19, 2025)

“I’m gonna fucking blow your head off, “ masked agents told Anabel Romero.

Romero told investigators that masked agents threatened to shoot her point-blank after she asked them to identify themselves during a violent encounter–which resulted in her children being ziptied and held at gunpoint. One of the children has special needs.

This occurred during a horse race in Idaho where Anabel Romero was confronted by masked men. Her daughter sustained bruised ribs after the men pulled her out of the truck. She and her children were held separately.

15-year-old with special needs, kidnapped at gunpoint in front of school (August 11, 2025)

“At least you’ll have an exciting story to tell when you go back to school, ” a federal immigration agent told a 15-year-old, after a case of mistaken identity.

While in the parking lot of Arleta High School, Andreina Mejia’s 15-year-old son with special needs was removed at gunpoint from her car and handcuffed by federal immigration agents. Los Angeles police officers told the federal agents to pick up the bullets they left scattered on the floor of the vehicle, and an agent told the police officers to use them to “practice their shooting.”

Cary Lopez Alvarado (June 8, 2025)

“Do you want to get killed?” an agent asked Lopez when she dialed 911 while they were attempting to detain her family members.

Lopez Alvarado was nine months pregnant and sitting in her car in Hawthorne, as part of her daily routine of leaving lunch for her husband and cousin. Her husband called her and said federal immigration agents were following them. She left her vehicle and walked over to where her family members were surrounded by unmarked vehicles and agents. She began to record, told agents they were on private property, and called 9-1-1.

She was shoved into the side of the truck, by federal agents, clutching her belly to protect her baby. She was handcuffed by agents and became dizzy. They were all taken to a location in Commerce.

Cary said that all three of them were taken in the same car to “an isolated place” in the City of Commerce and, one by one, were ordered to step out of the vehicle. An agent asked her, “That baby’s from Mexico, right?”

Officers asked her where she was born. She told them here in Los Angeles, and provided them with her social security and I.D. Agents kept her outside of the vehicle for several hours, where she told them she needed to use the bath room. Agents then told her to squat between their cars, as some agents watched.

They were taken to the LAPD Harbor Community police station in San Pedro, where she was fingerprinted and photographed while undergoing severe stomach pain. She was not released until midnight, when a DHS agent informed her they would press charges against her. She went to the hospital to be treated for her abdominal pain and loss of feeling she was experiencing in some areas of her body.

She gave birth four days later, while her husband and cousin were still incarcerated.

Javier Ramirez (June 12, 2005)

“[J]ust get him, he’s Mexican,” masked agents told Ramirez when masked agents grabbed him on private property.

Ramirez had his I.D. and passport with him inside his pocket, when he was kidnapped from his work place in Montebello, California. He is diabetic and was held for over four days. He passed out in the back of the agents' vehicles due to a combination of violent blows and the refusal of access to his medication. He was denied access to counsel and communication with his family, as well. All charges brought by federal agents were dropped against him.

Andrea Velez (June 24, 2025)

“[My mom is] probably going to wait for me to come home, and I’m never going to come home,"" Velez told senate investigators. “I thought they were kidnapping me.”

Velez was being dropped off at her workplace in Los Angeles, by her family members when she was confronted by masked agents who did not identify themselves. She had her ID in her bag. She was violently arrested and pulled into an unmarked vehicle. In detention she met another U.S. Citizen, Luis Hipolito, a 23-year-old who alleged he had been severely beaten by agents. She was detained for more than two days, and was accused of assaulting a federal agent. Her charges were later dropped.

Job Garcia (June 19, 2025)

“I got another one,” a federal immigration agent, told Garcia as they were detaining him. “None of the agents bothered to check my status,” Garcia told investigators.

Garcia was detained in Hollywood after he began to film an immigration raid at a Home Depot from a distance. He was tackled by five agents and detained. He was taken to Dodger Stadium then taken to a detention facility. Job was moved to Dodger Stadium and then a detention facility, where he was held despite having proved he was a U.S. Citizen.

Brian Gavidia (June 12, 2025)

“They see me hugging him and they embarrassed us. They were laughing and bullying us,” Gavidia told investigators, about the moment when he consoled the brother of one of his co-workers who was the target of agents’ taunting.

Gavidia was detained by DHS agents at the tow yard he works at in Montebello. Agents pushed him against a wall despite him telling them he is a U.S. citizen. Agents responded by taunting him, and looking through his cell phone. His co-worker who was also a citizen was violently taken. The encounter lasted almost an hour. Gavidias’ ID, which agents confiscated during the interaction, was not returned.

Adrian Andrew Martinez (June 17, 2025)

20-year-old Martinez was brutally detained by federal immigration agents while speaking up for an older man who was being kidnapped in parking lot of a Pico-Rivera Walmart, where he worked. He was dragged and choked into the agent's vehicle.

Days into detention, Martinez was accused of assaulting federal agents. He was detained for three days in the Metropolitan Detention Center and was denied access to a phone call. Several charges were dropped, but he is still facing a charge of conspiracy to impede a federal officer.

Martinez was denied access to the $100 his sister had placed on commissary for him. The unused funds have not been refunded back to his family.

Rafie Ollah Shouhed (September, 2025)

“You don’t fuck with ICE. We are here,” agents told Ollah Shouhed while handcuffing him.

“I’m a United States citizen. What are you doing to me?” he replied.

79-year-old Ollah Shouhed was brutally detained by federal immigration agents during a warrantless raid on his small business in Van Nuys.”

He was thrown and held against the ground by three agents. He sustained broken ribs, trauma to his chest, cuts, torn ligaments, and a brain injury. He was denied medical care and was detained for almost twelve hours.

Wilmer Chavarria (July 23, 2025)

“[You] ha[ve] no constitutional rights at a port of entry,” U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers told Chavarria, while detaining him at the airport following a trip to visit family in Nicaragua.

Chavarria, who is a superintendent of the Winooski School District in Vermont, was interrogated by officers for hours in an isolated room, away from his husband–whom he was travelling with.

The customs agent initially told him he had been “flagged,” but no reason was given for the interrogation. He was coerced, pressured, and aggressively threatened into handing over all of his electronics, including passwords to his personal devices and later, to the devices that were school district property, which contained sensitive information about students.

Officers denied him access to a phone call or lawyer. Officers looked through and questioned him about personal messages between him and his husband, releasing him after five hours.

The reports of brutality present in these detentions of U.S. citizens, conducted by agents of the federal government, is the physical manifestation of years of dehumanizing rhetoric directed at immigrants and non-white people by Donald Trump.

Bullies rule by fear and violence, and that is exactly how federal immigration agents have been behaving under the Trump administration's “mass deportation” mandate. The actions taken by federal immigration agents are not mistakes–they suggest the intentional targeting of Americans with ill treatment, detention, and abuse as part of the direct mission of Border Patrol, ICE, and the Department of Homeland Security.

Trump and his immigration agency cronies feel threatened by the American melting pot, and anyone who is not in line with their vision of a White nation.

This pattern of violent civil rights abuses of U.S. Citizens is a blaring alarm bell–just the tip of an egregious iceberg of violations of due process, and often lack of probable cause.

Frankly, this behavior by the federal government is shameful, embarrassing, and unconstitutional: Donald Trump doesn’t make America great, he makes it worse.",https://lede-admin.lataco.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2025/12/Shadow-Hearing-edited.png,N,,2025-12-13 12:56:57.022472

In the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, the attorneys general claim the agency implemented the large fee without proper public notice or comment. They say the high price tag flies in the face of Congress’s goals of helping U.S. employers retain highly skilled workers from other nations.

At a press conference announcing the lawsuit, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the effects of imposing the fee on California employers would be “devastating.”

“California needs more teachers, more nurses, more doctors. There is a shortage,” Bonta said. “These workers fill essential roles that keep the community running.”

The H-1B visa program was established by Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows employers to hire expert workers, often those with advanced degrees, including physicians, nurses, educators and researchers.

The program is designed to help fill U.S. labor shortages in specialized fields. But in a proclamation in September, President Donald Trump imposed a new $100,000 fee for all H-1B petitions.

By sidestepping public processes under the Administrative Procedure Act, Bonta said the Trump administration’s establishment of a new fee was unprecedented and a “direct violation of the law.”

“It was designed to dismantle the program entirely,” he said. “No president can ignore the coequal branch of government and ignore the law.”

The attorneys general also say the new policy grants the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to decide when to exempt the fee. They say that “raises concerns that the enforcement could be applied selectively against employers disfavored by the Trump Administration.”

In a statement, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said Oregon universities depend on the H-1B visa program to fill faculty and research roles.

“Eliminating access to H-1B faculty, researchers and staff would inflict significant institutional harm, depriving students of critical educational opportunities,” he said.

In Vermont, Attorney General Charity Clark said the state relies on hundreds of H-1B visa-holders, especially in health care services.

“Vermont has an aging population, and we need health care workers and other skilled professionals to fill many of our job openings,” Clark said. “While Vermont is focused on recruiting talented professionals and welcoming new neighbors, President Trump is exacerbating the problems with unlawful and exorbitant fees.”

Before the new policy, the fee for an employer could range from $900 to $7,595 — an amount that was already difficult for some employers and institutions to pay per hire, the attorney generals claim.

They say the $100,000 far exceeds the cost to process the petitions and is an insurmountable financial barrier for all but the wealthiest, making it even more difficult to hire for hard-to-fill positions.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The coalition includes the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2021/11/dhs-hq-washington.jpg/w=1300,h=731",N,,2025-12-13 16:57:30.929189

“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” said Joseph Rupnick, chairman of the Tribal Council.
The contract requested the recipient, KPB Services, which is affiliated with Prairie Band LLC, design warehouse structures on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees, according to a public federal contract database.
Before KPB Services signed the contract, the federal government upped the dollar amount.
The Tribal Council fired members of Prairie Band LLC’s leadership Tuesday after Topeka TV station KSNT made news of the contract public the day before.","TOPEKA — The Prairie Band Potawatomi Tribe’s chairman compared immigrant detention to Indian reservations in an online video address Friday, and declared the tribe’s intention to jettison a recently secured contract to design detention centers.

“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” said Joseph Rupnick, chairman of the Tribal Council. “We were placed here because we were treated as prisoners of war. So we must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and trauma once done to our people.”

A company affiliated with the tribe’s business arm signed a year-long, $29.9 million contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Nov. 29. The contract requested the recipient, KPB Services, which is affiliated with Prairie Band LLC, design warehouse structures on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees, according to a public federal contract database. Before KPB Services signed the contract, the federal government upped the dollar amount.

The Tribal Council fired members of Prairie Band LLC’s leadership Tuesday after Topeka TV station KSNT made news of the contract public the day before.

Rupnick, in a nearly 3-minute video address, said the tribe is “working on canceling this contract and fully disassociating the nation from it.”

He said the tribe risks losing future government contract awards in its efforts to extract itself from this one, but he said the tribe’s values must come first.

“I am sick to my stomach and frankly heartbroken that members of our nation put economic development — though it is sorely needed — above our moral obligations to other persecuted people,” Rupnick said.

The Tribe owns Prairie Band LLC, and Rupnick said it was created to secure employment and economic opportunities, “but it is also why we cannot compromise our values and seek to profit off the backs of our brothers and sisters in struggle.”

The second Trump administration has targeted immigrants, sometimes regardless of citizenship status or criminal history, detaining more than 65,000 people as of Nov. 16, according to ICE data analyzed by TRAC, a nonprofit data research project. Most of those people, nearly 48,000 did not have a criminal conviction.

Kansas has three facilities that house detainees and the potential for one more. Authorities at the Chase County jail in Cottonwood Falls, the Finney County jail in Garden City and the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth detain a combined average of 175 people on a given day. CoreCivic, the private prison company, is attempting to open a fourth detention center in a shuttered state prison.

The Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy’s lawsuit argues that the state’s congressional maps are an anti-competitive gerrymander, which violates the constitution.
Independent political strategist Brandon Scholz told NBC News that the panels are “biased.” “Call a spade a spade,” Scholz said.

Julie Zuckerbrod, an attorney representing Democrats in one of the lawsuits, argued to one of the two three-judge panels overseeing these cases that “it’s absolutely possible” for a ruling by March 1, the deadline for when these maps would have to go into effect.

Lawyers from each of the respective cases asked the panels for a March 2027 trial. Dane County Circuit Judge Julie Genovese said the panels will make a ruling or dismiss the cases “when we can decide them.”

Democratic voters filed the first lawsuit, which argues that the current congressional district makeup packs Democrats into two districts, while Democratic-leaning communities are broken up into the other six Republican-leaning districts.

The Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy’s lawsuit argues that the state’s congressional maps are an anti-competitive gerrymander, which violates the constitution. The median margin of victory for candidates in Wisconsin’s eight districts is near 30 percentage points.

“When the outcome is predetermined, it discourages challengers from running, voters from voting, and insulates politicians from their constituents demands,” according to Law Forward’s summary on the lawsuit.

Independent political strategist Brandon Scholz told NBC News that the panels are “biased.”

“Call a spade a spade,” Scholz said. “This is a partisan, political move by what’s supposed to be a nonpartisan court. It really seems like a push to have two partisan panels in place to determine redistricting on a congressional level.”

Wisconsin’s Supreme Court approved of the current district makeup in the state in 2010. The year before, Democrats held five seats. Republicans now hold six seats, with Reps. Gwen Moore (D-Wisc.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.) as the state’s only two Democratic representatives in the House.

Democrats are hopeful that they can unseat Reps. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wisc.) and Bryan Steil (R-Wisc.) in 2026. Kind told Wisconsin Public Radio in September that they both risk losing their seats due to their support for Trump’s agenda.

“They’re just jamming things through … and therefore they own it,” Kind said. “And they’re going to have to own that going into the crucial midterms.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/AP23088676219443.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-13 10:59:06.893104

The lawsuit in federal court in Boston is at least the third to challenge the fee announced by Trump in September, which dramatically raises the cost of obtaining H-1B visas. Currently, employers typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said in a release that Trump lacks the power to impose the fee and that it violates federal law, which allows immigration authorities to collect only fees necessary to cover the cost of administering visa programs.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields. The tech industry, with many companies headquartered in California, is particularly reliant on workers who receive the visas.

Bonta, a Democrat, said the $100,000 fee would create unnecessary financial burdens for providers of vital services such as education and healthcare, exacerbating labor shortages and threatening to cut services.

The states joining California in the lawsuit include New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey and Washington.

The White House, in response to other lawsuits, has said the new fee is a lawful exercise of Trump’s powers and will discourage employers from abusing the H-1B program.

Critics of H-1B visas and other work visas say they are often used to replace American workers with foreign employees who will work for less. But business groups and major companies have maintained that workers on H-1B visas are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobby, and a coalition of unions, employers and religious groups have filed separate lawsuits challenging the fee. A judge in Washington, D.C., is set to hold a hearing in the Chamber’s lawsuit next week.

Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made the $100,000 payment. The administration has said the order does not apply to existing H-1B holders or those who applied before September 21.

Trump in the order invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals that would be detrimental to U.S. interests.

Bonta’s office said on Friday the $100,000 fee far exceeds the cost of processing H-1B petitions, rendering it unlawful. It added the U.S. Constitution bars Trump from unilaterally imposing fees to generate revenue for the United States, a job that is reserved for Congress.

In Abrego Garcia's case, the judge granted withholding of removal to El Salvador because he found Abrego Garcia's life could be in danger there.

Abrego Garcia currently can’t be deported to his home country of El Salvador thanks to a 2019 immigration court order that found he had a “well founded fear” of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past few months, government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.

Abrego Garcia is fighting his deportation in federal court in Maryland, where his attorneys claim the administration is manipulating the immigration system to punish him for successfully challenging his earlier deportation.

Here’s what to know about the latest developments in the case:

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite the earlier court ruling.

When Abrego Garcia was deported in March, he was held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

The Trump administration initially fought efforts to bring him back to the U.S. but eventually complied after the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in. He returned to the U.S. in June, only to face an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was held in a Tennessee jail for more than two months before he was released on Friday, Aug. 22, to await trial in Maryland under home detention.

His freedom lasted a weekend. On the following Monday, he reported to the Baltimore immigration office for a check-in and was immediately taken into immigration custody. Officials announced plans to deport him to a series of African countries, but they were blocked by an order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland.

On Thursday, after months of legal filings and hearings, Xinis ruled that Abrego Garcia should be released immediately. Her ruling hinged on what was likely a procedural error by the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019.

Normally, in a case like this, an immigration judge will first issue an order of removal. Then the judge will essentially freeze that order by issuing a “withholding of removal"" order, according to Memphis immigration attorney Andrew Rankin.

In Abrego Garcia's case, the judge granted withholding of removal to El Salvador because he found Abrego Garcia's life could be in danger there. However, the judge never took the first step of issuing the order of removal. The government argued in Xinis' court that the order of removal could be inferred, but the judge disagreed.

Without a final order of removal, Abrego Garcia can't be deported, Xinis ruled.

The only way to get an order of removal is to go back to immigration court and ask for one, Rankin said. But reopening the immigration case is a gamble because Abrego Garcia's attorneys would likely seek protection from deportation in the form of asylum or some other type of relief.

One wrinkle is that immigration courts are officially part of the executive branch, and the judges there are not generally viewed as being as independent as federal judges.

“There might be independence in some areas, but if the administration wants a certain result, by all accounts it seems they’re going to exert the pressure on the individuals to get that result,” Rankin said. “I hope he gets a fair shake, and two lawyers make arguments — somebody wins, somebody loses — instead of giving it to an immigration judge with a 95% denial rate, where everybody in the world knows how it’s gonna go down.”

Alternatively, the government could appeal Xinis' order to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and try to get her ruling overturned, Rankin said. If the appeals court agreed with the government that the final order of removal was implied, there could be no need to reopen the immigration case.

In compliance with Xinis' order, Abrego Garcia was released from immigration detention in Pennsylvania on Thursday evening and allowed to return home for the first time in months. However, he was also told to report to an immigration officer in Baltimore early the next morning.

Fearing that he would be detained again, his attorneys asked Xinis for a temporary restraining order. Xinis filed that order early Friday morning. It prohibits immigration officials from taking Abrego Garcia back into custody, at least for the time being. A hearing on the issue could happen as early as next week.

Meanwhile, in Tennessee, Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case where he is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling.

Prosecutors claim he accepted money to transport, within the United States, people who were in the country illegally. The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has asked U.S. District Court Judge Waverly Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of “selective or vindictive prosecution.”

Crenshaw earlier found “some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive” and said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.” Crenshaw specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on a Fox News Channel program that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.

The two sides have been sparring over whether senior Justice Department officials, including Blanche, can be required to testify in the case.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a0dc3335-5c32-4393-b13f-32109629f9ae/wirestory_c6f255d11c8ce09be5e67a8df3de2f64_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-13 04:56:25.068179

Mr. Duffy and Mr. Barrs have based their criticism of New York on a federal audit of 200 non-domiciled commercial licenses.
Mr. Duffy has been criticized for focusing his efforts on states led by Democratic governors.
Together, the two states issue over half of the country’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses, he said.
“You don’t just drive in New York if you get a New York commercial driver’s license.","The Trump administration threatened on Friday to withhold tens of millions of dollars in highway funds from New York unless the state rescinded commercial driver’s licenses issued to people not authorized to work in the United States.

New York is the latest state to come into the cross hairs of the Transportation Department as the Trump administration attempts to prevent undocumented immigrant drivers from operating trucks and other large vehicles requiring commercial driver’s licenses. Last month, California agreed to revoke the driving credentials of some 17,000 foreign nationals after coming under similar pressure.

But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took special aim at New York at a news conference on Friday. He called the state “the worst offender” for issuing commercial driver’s licenses to foreign nationals without sufficient proof of their long-term work authorization. He also threatened to pull $73 million in federal highway funding unless officials paused issuing all non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses and learner’s permit and voided the active licenses of any immigrants found to be driving without legal work permits. The state was given 30 days to respond to the administration’s demands.

Derek D. Barrs, the administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, added that if New York failed to act within 30 days, the state could also lose its certification to issue any commercial driver’s licenses.

New York’s commercial driver’s license standards, he charged, represented “a systematically grossly unacceptable deviation from federal safety regulations.”

“When improper licenses are issued, safety is compromised,” he added.

In a statement, Walter McClure, a spokesman for New York’s Department of Motor Vehicles, accused federal transportation officials of “lying about New York State.”

“Here is the truth: Commercial drivers licenses are regulated by the federal government, and New York State DMV has, and will continue to, comply with federal rules,” he said.

“This is just another stunt from Secretary Duffy, and it does nothing to keep our roads safer,” he added.

Mr. Duffy and Mr. Barrs have based their criticism of New York on a federal audit of 200 non-domiciled commercial licenses. They said more than half of those license-holders no longer had proper authorization to work in the United States and cited examples in which they said New York had issued credentials to foreigners who didn’t have proper work authorization at the time of their application.

Using that evidence, they questioned whether New York had verified the immigration status of the approximately 32,000 people holding active non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses holders from the state. They also pointed out that the state regularly issued noncitizen commercial driver’s licenses that were valid for eight years, even if applicants did not have work visas that lasted that long.

“They’re not verifying the legal status of that individual,” Mr. Duffy said, arguing that New York was not routinely checking applicants’ passports or visas to verify their continued work eligibility.

Mr. McClure, the New York D.M.V. spokesman, countered that every commercial driver’s license was “subject to verification of an applicant’s lawful status through federally issued documents reviewed in accordance with federal regulations.”

The Trump administration has been pursuing a variety of initiatives to prevent certain immigrants from procuring commercial driver’s licenses. Earlier this year, Mr. Duffy’s department added a nationwide requirement that truckers meet new English-language proficiency standards. Earlier this month, his department revoked the accreditation of thousands of training centers where he said drivers improperly received their licenses.

The centerpiece of the effort, however, has been the department’s effort to pressure certain states to revoke licenses for noncitizen drivers already on the road, largely by threatening to withhold critical highway funds. The urgency around the effort increased after an August crash in Florida, in which an immigrant holding a California-issued commercial driver’s license and accused of being in the country without authorization killed three people after making an illegal U-turn.

Mr. Duffy has been criticized for focusing his efforts on states led by Democratic governors. But he argued on Friday that the threats to California and New York were just about numbers. Together, the two states issue over half of the country’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses, he said.

“You don’t just drive in New York if you get a New York commercial driver’s license. You drive around the country,” Mr. Duffy said. “These unqualified drivers operate in every single state, so everybody’s at risk,” he added.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/12/multimedia/12trump-news-ny-funds-topart-blzc/12trump-news-ny-funds-topart-blzc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 02:56:54.709133

I believe that danger becomes less scary when it is better understood – so learning all I can about systems in danger is a way to cope.","Last week, we published the results of our Judicial Resilience Project, in which we used scenarios to analyse how authoritarian populists would seek to attack the independent judiciary in Germany. Our study shows that the judiciary in Germany is more vulnerable than often assumed. From numerous international examples and an extensive body of research on “judicial backsliding”, we know that the strategies authoritarian populists employ to pressure, delegitimise, and ultimately capture judicial systems repeat themselves in strikingly similar ways. Few scholars have described these dynamics as profoundly as Kim Lane Scheppele, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Sociology and International Affairs in the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs and the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University. We talked to her about the state of the US judiciary, determining tipping points, and how to cope with the daily darkness of democratic backsliding.

1. Dear Kim, in the United States, courts have been among the most important and active bulwarks against Trump’s executive aggrandisement. At the same time, they have themselves become the target of massive attacks. Adding to this is the fact that the Supreme Court, as a court that has already been packed and politically skewed, has by and large supported Trump’s agenda. How would you assess the state of judicial independence in the United States at the end of 2025?

We have a decidedly mixed picture of judicial independence in the US. So far, the lower courts are mostly holding the line against autocracy, but the Supreme Court is actively pushing consolidation of power in the executive on all questions that come to it. Trump’s executive orders and lawless actions have generated more than 500 lawsuits (not counting all of the individual immigration cases). In nearly 170 of those cases, lower courts have issued injunctions stopping Trump from doing what he proposed – and those injunctions are still holding. But in the 30 or so cases that have gone all the way to the Supreme Court, that Court has lifted the injunctions and let Trump destroy laws, agencies, careers, and norms while the cases are pending. This has resulted in massive destruction of the US government, which, if the plaintiffs win in the end, cannot be easily rebuilt. Those of us who care about democracy shudder every time a new case gets to the Supreme Court, but some of what the lower courts are doing will hold – and I have been impressed that so many of these judges (including judges appointed by Trump in his first term) have been holding the line even when they are threatened by Trump.

2. The judiciary’s experience also shows that Donald Trump does not proceed subtly or gradually. He is confrontational by “flooding the zone”. Violating the law does not restrain him; on the contrary, he considers himself above the law. Some argue that Trump therefore goes beyond what you described as “autocratic legalism”. It has now been nearly a decade since your seminal article: Has the phenomenon evolved over time?

Trump is and is not quite an autocratic legalist. On the “is” side, Trump has signed more than 200 executive orders creating new law and instructing his minions to enforce it. These executive orders are what the lower courts are enjoining and what the Supreme Court is upholding. If the Supreme Court turns more of these executive orders into formal and final law, we will have a new constitution very soon. Textbook autocratic legalism. On the “not quite” side: Trump has unleashed a reign of terror in American cities under the guise of enforcing immigration laws and preventing crime. But these actions are totally lawless as masked federal officers kidnap people off the streets and disappear them into an inhumane detention system. In addition, Trump has also governed by whim in both domestic and foreign policy. So Trump mixes legalistic and terror-inducing strategies of control. Because Americans are standing up to the reign of terror, however, Trump may be prevented from engaging in legal autocratic capture, which he might otherwise have succeeded in accomplishing.

3. A central feature of judicial backsliding is delegitimising the judiciary as elitist, partisan, or too slow. All too often, these narratives gain traction because they contain a grain of truth. Criticism of the judicialisation of liberal democracies is not new, but it has resonated more strongly in recent years. To what extent are courts themselves, at least in part, contributing to the problem?

Trump has been attempting to delegitimize the judiciary by calling lower court judges activist, rogue, and partisan, and his supporters in Congress have threatened impeachment of judges. But it is the Supreme Court – packed for years by extremist Republicans – that is the activist, partisan, and rogue court. Trump, like most autocrats, claims that the people have put him there (though sometimes he says that God did it). But in the land of 50/50 elections, where polling is ubiquitous, and Trump’s popularity sits in the mid-30-percent favourability range, it’s hard to claim supermajority support. That doesn’t stop him, however.

Attacking the judiciary for being anti-democratic is, of course, an old rogue argument. And if by “democratic” you simply mean that the current occupant of the office is elected, then saying judges are anti-democratic makes sense. But if you think about democracy as the potential to change leaders at the next election, then that shifts the debate over how democracy is defended. If courts try to keep pathways open for democratic rotation if the voters want that, then courts defend – rather than undermine – democracy.

4. In 2013, you concluded your commentary on “The Rule of Law and the Frankenstate” with a plea for a “forensic legal analysis”: the systematic use of “what-if questions” to expose the vulnerable points of constitutional orders. With our Judicial Resilience Project, we put forward a methodological framework that allows such institutional stress tests to be carried out prospectively and transparently. We found that working with scenarios and combining comparative, doctrinal, and qualitative analysis is particularly effective. This approach allows us to anticipate authoritarian-populist strategies and thus prepare more effectively. What continues to occupy us, however, is how to determine when a system is beginning to tip. What indicators allow us to pinpoint institutional “points of no return” – including in today’s US judiciary?

It’s wonderful that you are thinking holistically because constitutions are meant to work as a system and not as a checklist. So, looking at the relationships among the parts is precisely the way to go. And using scenarios for institutional stress tests is brilliant!

So how does one tell when a system is beginning to tip from democracy into dictatorship? Most of the autocratic takeovers in recent years have occurred when an elected leader attacks the institutions and rules that prevent him from governing by whim. So, the main point of focus should be on the executive and the pattern of actions that this executive undertakes. One or two actions to evade checks on power may be simply enthusiasm; more are signs of danger.

Pay special attention to constitutional “resonant frequency” points – that is, the point where threats are boosted to the point where they destroy the integrity of the thing threatened. The best historical example comes from Germany in 1933, where the parliament was first dissolved and then a state of emergency declared, when the only check on an abusive emergency declaration was the (now dissolved) parliament. The best modern example is the Hungarian constitution, which permits amendment with a single two-thirds vote of the unicameral parliament in a system where the election law makes gaining a two-thirds majority very possible.

5. Many of us find it taxing to engage daily with the ways in which liberal democracies are currently – and may in future be – under threat. How do you cope with this personally? What motivates you to continue researching, explaining, and warning? And how can we protect ourselves and others from the impact that this unrelenting doom and gloom can have on our emotional state and mental health?

I believe that danger becomes less scary when it is better understood – so learning all I can about systems in danger is a way to cope. Staring danger in the face is itself energizing and generates the energy to keep going. Yes, it is exhausting sometimes, but looming dictatorships often generate better political humour, so I really appreciate and collect political cartoons.

But here’s the best part: Times like this also create tremendous solidarity among those who work together to push back against dictatorship. I’ve made so many great friends fighting autocracy in Europe, and now have new friends in the US who are all in for fighting autocracy here. Some of the best people you’ll ever get to know are the ones who take the current threats as a call to action. For example, I’ve been honoured to get to know those of you on the Judicial Resilience Project!

Even the cover is a statement: two men kissing, sweating, living in and for the moment. But the photo – taken in 2002 by Wolfgang Tillmans in a London club – is misleading. While Douglas Stuart’s latest novel Young Mungo does revolve around homosexual love, its setting could hardly be more removed from a gay party. Readers follow 15-year-old Mungo through 1990s Glasgow, an environment sharply at odds with his empathetic nature: his mother is severely alcoholic, and his brother leads a criminal youth gang. This despair manifests physically in Mungo as a tic: whenever he feels uncomfortable, his face twitches. Beyond these everyday hardships, terrible things happen to Mungo – some scenes are tough to take in. Relief comes only when Mungo encounters someone around whom he no longer feels uneasy, someone who makes his face stop twitching. By the end, one can’t help but despair a little over his story. It left me, at least, with a gentle sadness.

The Week on Verfassungsblog

summarised by EVA MARIA BREDLER

In Germany, we do not abduct people from the streets like KIM LANE SCHEPPELE reports for the US. But a notion of “we” is readily invoked here too, including in debates on migration. Some call for “us” to “finally speak more honestly” about migration and crime. Who exactly is this “we”? CHRISTIAN WALBURG (GER) reconstructs the discourse and offers reassurance: there are gaps, but the picture of a dominant tendency in the discourse to downplay migration and crime does not reflect reality.

States don’t just construct a discursive “we”; they also create a legal one, separating citizens from others – and those who fall through all the cracks become stateless. After months of devastating violence in Gaza, several Western states recognise Palestine, while Germany continues to resist. SENOL BECIROVSKI (GER) explores what this means under residence law for the stateless Palestinian diaspora in Germany, concluding that recognition would be largely symbolic and would not solve their legal problems – it might even make them worse.

Sweden is also narrowing its own “we”. There, a law is planned that could revoke previously granted permanent residence permits for asylum reasons. REBECCA THORBURN STERN (ENG) explains the context of Swedish migration policy and the serious risks the bill could pose for non-citizens.

EU-wide minimum standards are also under pressure in the migration debate. The European Commission has just launched the first Annual Migration Management Cycle, a concrete step towards implementing the New Pact on Migration and Asylum. The pact promises a better balance between solidarity and responsibility than under Dublin III. But HANNAH PÜTTER und SALVATORE NICOLOSI (ENG) already see early signs that the new system could increase mistrust between Member States, restricting both fundamental rights and access to asylum.

Solidarity is also central to the proposed Reparations Loan, which would use frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine. The European Council will discuss it in December. Belgium has been the loudest critic, calling it a disguised confiscation. What’s really at stake? PETER VAN ELSUWEGE (ENG) explains the risks.

For a more open form of confiscation, the German government has now put forward a draft law: whether paralysed airports or spied-on infrastructure, drone sightings are increasing – yet it is unclear who is allowed to shoot them down. FINN PREISS and LAURIDS HEMPEL (GER) analyse the draft and explain why no constitutional amendment is needed.

Another controversial draft comes from the Federal Ministry of Justice: the Criminal Code is to be amended to strengthen protection against so-called knock-out drops. HANS KUDLICH and MUSTAFA TEMMUZ OĞLAKCIOĞLU (GER) see no need: existing law already covers these situations and allows for heavy penalties.

There is, however, an undisputedly urgent legislative need at the EU level in another context. For fifteen years, the EU has seemed powerless as Viktor Orbán, the “predator of press freedom,” systematically undermined the media. Most recently, Swiss media group Ringier sold its entire Hungarian portfolio to Indamedia, a government-aligned group that already controls 18 online publications and platforms. KATI CSERES and ANA-CATERINA CIUSA (GER) are now hopeful: the recently adopted European Media Freedom Act could finally protect media freedom and pluralism effectively.

This week, we have also concluded our two symposia.

In her contribution to “The European Convention on Human Rights at 75: Transnational Perspectives and Global Interaction” (ENG), NICOLA WENZEL looks at the right to a healthy environment and warns that superficial comparisons overlook the ECtHR’s rich case law — and risk losing key nuances in translation. JANNIKA JAHN examines how divergent approaches to climate-related obligations unfold across regional systems, UN bodies, and the ICJ, with particular attention to the contours of the European approach. DANA SCHMALZ argues that those attacking the ECtHR for an over-reaching jurisprudence regarding migrants’ rights misconstrue the actual case law. DANIEL THYM outlines four scenarios for the future development of the case law and the possibilities for transformation. ARNFINN BÅRDSEN argues that moving forward, it is necessary to take into account both the inherent features of the technology and the rights that come under pressure by our use of it, mapping out what a potential approach of the ECtHR could look like. MARIA PILAR LLORENS chimes in, warning that when implementing AI tools, Human Rights Courts must ensure that they do not compromise the very rights they are tasked to protect. VERONIKA FIKFAK and LAURENCE R. HELFER add on to this by predicting that more fundamental changes to the process of international human rights adjudication – including at the ECtHR –may ultimately be required. BAŞAK ÇALI celebrates 75 years of the Convention in a personal voice, as a child of this Convention. Closing the symposium, JÖRG POLAKIEWICZ sees us facing two truths as the ECHR turns 75: first, the extraordinary resilience of that promise; and second, the magnitude of the challenges still before us.

We also closed the debate on “Algorithmic Fairness for Asylum Seekers and Refugees”. BEN HAYES looks at the OHCHR’s forthcoming guidance on human rights-based digital border governance and identifies where such guidance can help, and where a significant shift in current State practice is needed. NATALIE WELFENS shows how automation, outsourcing, and fragmented accountability reshape rights protection in migration governance, showing through a case study that existing regulatory frameworks remain insufficient. NIOVI VAVOULA discusses the results of the symposium in a concluding afterword.

So who is this “we” and whom can it hold? Are we also the algorithms we use? KIM LANE SCHEPPELE has reminded us that constitutions work as a system, not as a checklist. What matters is looking at the relationships between the parts. That seems to me a pretty good answer to that question: we should not forget the space in between all our multiple “wes”.

The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments last week about the 2022 agreement governing how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can arrest immigrants besides those being specifically targeted in an operation. The consent decree has been in the spotlight amid the Trump administration’s Chicago-area immigration crackdown that’s led to more than 4,000 arrests.

WATCH: Federal judge sharply criticizes immigration crackdown tactics in Chicago

Last month, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who found the government violated the agreement, ordered the release of more than 600 immigrants on bond, which the appeals court paused. Roughly 450 remain in custody, attorneys say.

In the 2-1 opinion, the appeals court said Cummings overstepped his authority on the blanket release of the detainees without assessing each case individually. The consent decree “carefully maps out what the district judge can or cannot order” to balance enforcement and public safety, according to the opinion. But the ruling also said the Trump administration wrongly categorized all immigrant arrestees as subject to mandatory detention.

Plaintiffs’ attorneys said they were disheartened by the ruling but glad the court upheld the extension of the agreement, which among other things requires ICE to show documentation for each arrest it makes. Federal judges elsewhere including in Colorado have also ruled to limit warrantless arrests.

Attorneys pushed for a quick decision, saying many are being deported without knowing their options. The hundreds of detainees, mostly from the Chicago area, were arrested from summer through the early weeks of the “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration crackdown in the fall. Attorneys have said they have collected information on hundreds of more people they believe were also improperly arrested.

“We will work tirelessly to ensure that people who were unlawfully arrested will be able to return to their families and communities as soon as possible,” said Keren Zwick with the National Immigrant Justice Center.

A message left Thursday for the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned.

The consent decree, which expired earlier this year, was extended until February. The federal government tried to challenge the extension in court.

The agreement was originally reached between immigrant rights groups and the federal government following a lawsuit over 2018 immigration sweeps. It applies to immigrants arrested in six states covered by the ICE field office in Chicago. Those states are Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Wisconsin.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/12/2025-11-08T211934Z_831840506_RC2HSHAW1ELS_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-IMMIGRATION-CHICAGO-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 02:56:58.802507

Also finds 287(g) agreements do not authorize Minnesota law enforcement to detain individuals solely on the basis of a civil ICE detainer request

December 12, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office issued a formal legal opinion today about 287(g) agreements, which are agreements state and local governments may enter into with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to authorize state or local law enforcement officers to perform certain immigration duties. The opinion finds that Minnesota law does not permit sheriffs to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE unilaterally and that the authority to enter into such agreements rests with county boards of commissioners. The opinion also states that 287(g) agreements do not permit law enforcement agencies to detain individuals solely on the basis of a civil ICE detainer request if state law does not otherwise authorize law enforcement to detain them.

Under State law, the Attorney General’s Office may issue a legal opinion upon the request of a limited number of public officials or bodies. The Attorney General’s Office produced today’s opinion on the request of Ramsey County Attorney John Choi, who asked the Office for an opinion on whether Minnesota sheriffs may enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE, and whether such agreements permit local law enforcement officers to detain persons who would otherwise be released from custody pursuant to civil immigration detainers from ICE.

The opinion first reviews what authority the state grants to sheriffs to sign agreements. State law permits sheriffs to enter into contracts to provide police services to towns and cities but does not grant sheriffs the authority to sign such agreements with the federal government. The fact that lawmakers enacted a detailed statute regarding contracts by sheriffs for providing law enforcement services to cities and towns but did not provide for similar contracts with the federal government, implies that the omission of federal contracts is intentional.

Next, the opinion reviews the Minnesota Joint Exercise of Powers Act (the “Joint Powers Act”), which governs agreements between government entities for the cooperative use of their powers. The Joint Powers Act stipulates that contracting parties may only jointly exercise powers “common to the contracting parties or any similar powers.” Since Minnesota sheriffs lack the authority to enforce immigration law absent a 287(g) agreement, they cannot enter into such agreements due to this commonality requirement.

The opinion then notes that, while sheriffs cannot enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE unilaterally, their county board of commissioners can. Subdivision 8 of the Joint Powers Act creates a limited exception to the commonality requirement for counties whereby a county board of commissioners is allowed to enter into an agreement with any other unit of government to “perform on behalf of that unit any service or function which that unit would be authorized to provide, ”allowing a county board of commissioners to vote to enter into a 287(g) agreement.

The opinion then addresses whether operating under 287(g) agreements permits Minnesota law enforcement to detain individuals for the purposes of immigration enforcement. A February 2025 opinion of the Attorney General’s Office found that Minnesota law prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from holding someone based solely on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be required under state law to be released from custody. The previous opinion, however, did not examine whether the presence of a properly executed 287(g) agreement would allow for state and local law enforcement agencies to extend detention for immigration purposes. Today’s opinion addresses that question and concludes that 287(g) agreements do not give local law enforcement officers any broader authority under state law than they otherwise have; that they do not permit state law enforcement from effecting arrests or detentions that would otherwise not be permitted under state law; and that officers operating under a 287(g) agreement must comply with Minnesota arrest law.",https://www.ag.state.mn.us/_Img/Logo_SM.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 04:56:33.290698

(AP) — A pair of lawsuits seeking to redraw congressional boundary lines that currently favor Republicans in Wisconsin are on track to be resolved after the 2026 midterms, even as attorneys for one case argued Friday in court that there’s still time to enact new maps for the November election.

Court hearings in both cases came the day after Indiana Republicans soundly rejected President Donald Trump’s demand that they redraw congressional lines in that deep red state. Trump is waging a national redistricting battle as he tries to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year’s elections.

WATCH: Indiana Republican explains why he defied Trump and rejected congressional redistricting

An attorney for Democrats who brought one of the Wisconsin challenges argued for the panel to issue a ruling by around March 1, the deadline given by the state elections commission in order to have new maps in place.

“It’s absolutely possible,” Julie Zuckerbrod, an attorney with the liberal Elias Law Group, told a three-judge panel in support of the more aggressive timing.

But Dane County Circuit Judge Julie Genovese pushed back on the pressure to act quickly.

“We’ll decide them when we can decide them,” she said of the pending motions to issue a ruling or dismiss the case without further arguments.

Attorneys for Wisconsin’s six Republican congressmen and other conservative defendants pushed for a schedule that would not result in a trial until March 2027.

“Seeking relief in time for the 2026 election would be unfair,” said Kevin LeRoy, an attorney for the congressmen.

The three-judge panel in that case will first decide early next year whether to dismiss the case or rule in favor of those who brought it without further argument.

Both of the Wisconsin cases are before newly assigned three-judge panels, the first time that process has been used under a 2011 law enacted by Republicans. The dual hearings on Friday afternoon were two hours and two floors apart in the same courthouse, just blocks from the state Capitol.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court last month ordered that the redistricting cases be first heard by the three-judge panel over objections from Republicans.

The three-judge panel hearing the case brought by a bipartisan coalition of business leaders set a potential trial date for April 5, 2027, if the case survives a motion to dismiss.

Any final rulings of those panels on the merits of the cases can be appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.

The Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy argues in its lawsuit that Wisconsin’s congressional maps are unconstitutional because they are an anti-competitive gerrymander. The lawsuit notes that the median margin of victory for candidates in the eight districts since the maps were enacted is close to 30 percentage points.

“In a 50-50 state, it makes no sense that 75% of Wisconsin seats in the House of Representatives are controlled by one party,” Law Forward said in a summary of its lawsuit on its website.

The other case, filed on behalf of Democratic voters, contends the current maps discriminate against Democrats. They do so by packing a substantial number of Democrats into two districts while breaking up other Democratic areas into six Republican-favorable districts.

In 2010, the year before Republicans redrew the congressional maps, Democrats held five seats compared with three for Republicans. Republicans hold six of the state’s eight U.S. House seats, but only two are considered competitive.

The current congressional maps, which were based on the ones drawn in 2010, were approved by the state Supreme Court when it was controlled by conservative judges. The U.S. Supreme Court in March 2022 declined to block them from taking effect.

A top target for Democrats is the western Wisconsin seat held by Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden. He won in 2022 after longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired. Van Orden won reelection in the 3rd District in 2024.

The other seat Democrats are hoping to make more competitive is southeastern Wisconsin’s 1st District, held by Republican Rep. Bryan Steil since 2019. The latest maps made that district more competitive while still favoring Republicans.

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today condemned a gross attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Tullos, Louisiana, after Maximiliano Perez-Perez, a criminal illegal alien, savagely bit the officer’s hand while resisting arrest. He is facing charges for assaulting law enforcement.

Wounds caused from bite attack on ICE officer

During the arrest, Perez-Perez attempted to flee by pushing officers. He used his teeth as a weapon and clamped down on an ICE officers’ hand, breaking the skin and drawing blood.

Perez-Perez entered the United States at an unknown date and time and without being inspected or paroled by an immigration officer.

“This criminal illegal alien is being charged with assault after he savagely bit a law enforcement officer in an attempt to evade arrest. DHS law enforcement is facing a 1,150% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats. This is the reality of what our ICE officers are facing every day as they go to work to simply do their job and enforce the law,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Many of these assaults, including biting and vehicle rammings, are happening as a direct result of sanctuary politicians encouraging illegal aliens to evade arrest.”

This dangerous encouraging of illegal aliens to evade arrest comes after sanctuary politicians held webinars and provided resources and tips for how to openly defy ICE:

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hosted a webinar in February providing tips for illegal aliens to evade arrests at homes, workplaces, or in public.

Dan Goldman posted an online video calling on illegal aliens to make a plan for ICE encounters.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued multilingual flyers and online resources advising illegal aliens on how to evade arrest.

California Governor Gavin Newsom released guides and sanctuary laws advising illegal aliens how to recognize ICE, block entry, and defy arrest.

In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Rep. Omar demanded immediate answers regarding Operation Metro Surge, an ICE deployment to the Twin Cities that has resulted in widespread racial profiling, unlawful arrests of U.S. citizens, excessive force, and violations of constitutional rights.

Rep. Omar’s letter cites multiple documented incidents in which ICE agents detained people who had identified themselves as U.S. citizens, mocked a woman for wearing a hijab, used pepper spray on bystanders, and refused to provide warrants while carrying out arrests near homes, schools, and a university campus. The New York Times also reported that approximately 100 ICE agents were deployed to Minnesota, at significant taxpayer expense.

In a second letter sent to Secretary Noem, Rep. Omar led Members of Congress in demanding a full explanation of the administration’s threat to abruptly terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali nationals in the United States.

Earlier this month, President Trump publicly claimed he would end TPS for Somalis “effective immediately,” and DHS officials echoed these statements despite a longstanding federal law governing TPS designations. Somalia has been designated for TPS since 1991 due to ongoing humanitarian crises. Ending TPS would put lives at risk and tear apart families who have lived, worked, and contributed to our communities for decades.

CBC News reports: “The House [of Commons] only passed four bills this fall sitting — that includes the supplementary estimates, which need to pass every sitting to keep the government operating. [Members of Parliament] quickly got two bills through the third reading shortly after question period on Thursday [December 11]: C-12, the government’s border security bill, and C-4, which primarily would bring the Liberals’ income tax cut officially into law. Both will now head to the Senate. The government was able to pass the ‘Lost Canadians’ legislation last month.”

The Migrant Rights Network opposes C-12, the Strengthening Canada’s Immigration System and Borders Act. They highlighted: “This bill would allow mass deportations, deny refugees protection, and share sensitive info with foreign governments.” They had also noted: “[This bill] threatens migrant and refugee rights and expands government surveillance.”

The Bill allows decisions to be made about ‘national interest’ projects with little public participation, without robust environmental impact assessments, and without the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples.”

Greenpeace Canada has also explained: “Bill C5 (the Building Canada Act) is likely going to result in a new round of grassroots opposition from Indigenous land defenders and environmental activists to resource extraction projects fast-tracked under the new legislation.”

And they noted: “Bill C2 (the Strong Borders Act) grants the federal government new warrant-less surveillance powers that are not restricted to border-related issues, but can be used any time there is even a suspicion that any Act of Parliament might be contravened.”

Greenpeace further highlights: “The history of RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] surveillance and repression of land defenders (particularly but not exclusively Indigenous) suggest that these powers will be misused.”

We are also watching MP Jenny Kwan’s Bill C-233.

The Canadian Press has reported: “Her private member’s bill C-233, which she’s calling the “No More Loopholes Act,” would add new oversight requirements to exports of parts and components, end permit-free access to the United States for military goods and require companies to obtain end-use certificates from foreign governments. …Debate on the bill is expected to resume in the new year, likely in February.”

PBI-Canada has commented that Bill C-233 would complement the Berta Cáceres Human Rights in Honduras Act in the protection of defenders that is backed by the PBI-Honduras accompanied Lenca organization COPINH.

Ilhan Omar, calling her “garbage,” and Somalia, the nation she came from, “barely a country.” These words reflect a continued effort to revive race and origin as tools to divide and dictate policy.

In 2017, Trump’s Muslim Ban targeted multiple Muslim-majority nations, including Somalia, under the guise of “national security.” In 2018, he asked why the United States should accept immigrants from “shithole countries,” instead of “places like Norway.” In 2019, he told four U.S. citizens — women of color in Congress, including Rep. Omar — to “go back” to the countries they came from.

Branding African nations as “shithole countries” and Somalia as “barely a country” perpetuates centuries-old narratives that frame majority-Black nations and Black people as inferior and undesirable. Trump’s threat to “permanently pause migration” would disproportionately target African nations, echoing the racial quotas of the 1920s and reinforcing a hierarchy that places whiteness at the center of American belonging. This is the same ideology that once justified slavery, Jim Crow and immigration laws crafted to keep Black people out of America’s promise.

How the History of American Citizenship is Rooted in Anti-Black Policies

Trump’s recent words are part of a long pattern of messaging. His infamous racist slogan, “Make America Great Again,” is a continuum of the Ku Klux Klan’s “America for Americans,” and President Calvin Coolidge’s declaration that “America must remain American,” which then, as now, is a coded affirmation of racial violence and hierarchy that reflects a vision of “America” rooted in whiteness, Anglo-Saxon heritage and Protestant norms.

While the Naturalization Act of 1790 established the rules for U.S. citizenship, it explicitly limited naturalization to “free white persons,” excluding Black Americans and other non-white individuals. This was a deliberate attempt to block enslaved persons and their descendants from laying claim to the land they were forced to live on and cultivate, fueling systemic discrimination and violence for generations. Seventy-six years later, the 14th Amendment introduced and sanctioned birthright citizenship as a corrective to anti-Black exclusion, finally guaranteeing citizenship to all people born on American soil.

However, Trump continues his futile attempt to rewrite history through a lily-white lens. His anti-immigration agenda seeks to undermine a constitutional principle rooted in racial justice. These efforts reveal how immigration policy has long been entangled with anti-Blackness and structural racism, not only through exclusionary laws, but also through narratives that criminalize Black immigrants and erase their contributions. Institutional racism embedded in immigration laws and enforcement has resulted in persistent inequitable outcomes.

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned Chinese immigrants outright. Later laws, like the Immigration Act of 1917 and the Immigration Act of 1924, went even further, banning immigrants from large parts of Asia and setting quotas that favored Europeans. African immigration was almost impossible because quotas were based on existing U.S. populations, where Africans were barely represented due to earlier anti-Black policies.

How Racial Justice Fueled More Humane and Equitable Immigration Laws

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 removed explicit racial restrictions from immigration law. However, meaningful change only accelerated two years later with Brown v. Board of Education, when the concept of “separate but equal” was legally dismantled. In this instance, collective action challenged entrenched racism and expanded access to rights and opportunities for people of all races, helping spark what would be known as the Civil Rights Movement, which continues to this very moment in history. Fear-driven policies harm everyone, while inclusive policies — such as public education, healthcare access and economic stability — benefit all communities.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 followed the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, dismantling the racist quota system and laying the foundation for modern immigration policy that opened doors to immigrants from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Today, immigrants comprise nearly 14 percent of the U.S. population, compared to 5 percent in 1965. This shift has enriched American culture, fueled economic growth, and reinforced civil rights principles by embedding racial equality into immigration law.

While Trump attempted to disparage Rep. Omar and her racial background, her story embodies long-championed American ideals, demonstrating how resilience, opportunity and inclusion can transform lives. She fled civil war in Somalia, became a U.S. citizen and now serves in Congress. Her presence represents the promise of America: that refugees and immigrants not only contribute to, but are, in fact, the foundational pillars of, democracy and leadership

Why Immigration and Racial Justice are Foundational to Democracy

With the barrage of racialized insults and inflammatory language over the last decade of Trump’s rhetoric, it can be tempting to dismiss them for the sake of our collective sanity. But these words are designed to erode our sense of what is acceptable, making harmful actions more likely. We cannot afford to be complacent.

When language is weaponized to erase racial justice and cement racial hierarchy, the very foundation of justice begins to crack. This fascist rhetoric seeks to resurrect the ghosts of Jim Crow and carve inequality into the bedrock of our nation. But as Rep. Omar’s personal history attests, America’s strength lies in its diversity of all human experiences and backgrounds. The days of this country’s legalized caste system are over.

We no longer dream of an inclusive America. We demand it, we build it, and we will not settle for anything less than justice and inclusion for all.

The entire concept makes the skin prickle in reprehension. Yet here we are. ICE and CBP goons, balaclavas emphasizing the penis-like nature of their heads, have descended on New Orleans. Led by unapologetic Border Patrol boss Gregory Bovino, whose fascist high top haircut and affinity for dark double-breasted trenchcoats cross the line from “unintentionally Nazi-esque” into “Nazi on purpose,” they are all over the streets of America’s Friendliest City, vowing to deport 5,000 (!) people in the name of Purifying America’s Blood or some more publicly acceptable euphemism for that purpose. This is Operation “Catahoula Crunch,” which sounds like an AI-generated name for a Louisiana breakfast cereal. In the first three days of raids, they arrested 38 people, fewer than a third of whom had criminal records. Clearly, the motherfuckers are going to be here for a while. I went to take a look.

This article was originally published on the “how things work”substack. subscribe here for more of Hamilton nolan’s great work!

Friday night, hundreds of drunk kids staggered down Tulane University’s fraternity row, celebrating their football team’s conference championship. Inside a church a few blocks away was more serious business. Fifty or so people filled the pews. Projected on the wall was a slide that read “Solo el pueblo salva al pueblo.” Only the people can save the people. Only we can save us.

This was a training for Ojos, an ICE-watching project aligned with an immigrant support group called Unión Migrante. (Though ICE is only one of the agencies carrying out the raids, their name has become synonymous with this sort of persecution, and they are universally used as shorthand for la migra, the catchall term for immigration police.) As in Los Angeles, and Chicago, and North Carolina, New Orleans has, in a short time, built a remarkably sophisticated region-wide network of citizens ready to film the dirty dogs doing their work. There was an Ojos training like this every single night of the week in different neighborhoods around the city. Here, the regular people learned what they can do in the face of the terror.

The trainers told the crowd how to properly record ICE spottings: date and time, description, exact cross streets. This information can be spread instantly through a network of both citywide and neighborhood-specific group chats that hundreds or perhaps thousands of New Orleanians now participate in. If agents try to arrest someone in Metairie or Algiers or the Mid City or the West Bank, someone will see or hear and this information will in very short order be spread and investigated and verified and then posted online by Unión Migrante, the definitive source that immigrants can use to learn where the danger is today. For an effort that is run completely by volunteers and dependent on the zeal of regular, unpaid citizens, it is a fairly spectacular underground intelligence service.

The training featured an unwieldy role-playing exercise, with 20 people playing roles ranging from teachers to passersby to Ojos watchers, which mirrored the chaos of the actual work. (Those picked to play ICE officers seemed a little unhappy, but they did their duty.) All of us got little Ziploc bags with a whistle the size of a bullet that can be used to alert anyone within several square blocks of a raid in progress. For more than two hours, this earnest group of teachers and tattooed 20-somethings and retirees and musicians and business owners learned how to be cops on the side of righteousness. Then they took their places back in their city and waited for the feds to make their next move.

Once you get into it, the odd similarity between watching cops and being a cop is hard to miss. The primary method that Ojos uses is training enough volunteers that wherever something happens, someone plugged into their network is very likely to be nearby. But this will always mean that the bad thing has already happened once it gets reported. The most useful version of ICE watching would be to be able to track the agents, to monitor them in real time, to serve as an early warning system, to ruin their element of surprise. This is a much trickier proposition.

You could park your car outside the entrance of the Naval Station in Belle Chasse that the agents are using as their headquarters and try to track them when they emerge each morning. But they can be hard to identify, and even harder to follow. They have the assistance of local and state police as well—one Ojos activist was pulled over twice in one day by a Louisiana State Police officer demanding that he stop driving in the vicinity of a convoy of CBP vehicles.

Alternately, you could make an educated guess about where la migra might show up, go there in advance, and drive around hoping to catch them, becoming a funhouse mirror version of a cop patrolling a high crime area. I tried this myself one day. I spent hours driving around Kenner, a working-class New Orleans suburb out by the airport that has so far been the target of more immigration raids than anywhere else in the area. For hours on a rainy Saturday, I circled down Veterans Boulevard and up Williams, stopping at the obvious places where ICE tends to pop up. I went to all three Walmarts in the Kenner area. I went to Lowe’s. I went to Home Depot. I did not see any immigration officers, but I did see Spanish-speaking families out shopping in stores that had translated their signs into Spanish, but had conspicuously not taken any actions to indicate that they disapproved of their customers being kidnapped on their property. Contrast this with small businesses across New Orleans that have posted fliers on their doors declaring that ICE is not welcome there. It makes you think about corporate responsibility, and cowardice, and things of that nature.

Without two-person teams—one to drive, and one to navigate and monitor the chat and alerts and social media in real time—constantly on patrol in each neighborhood hot spot, it takes luck to catch officers in the act. Nor is it easy to know if you are parked right next to one. They tend to roll around in big American-made SUVs. Now go look at a Home Depot parking lot. See any big SUVs there, maybe with a burly guy wearing a baseball cap inside? Yeah. Everywhere!

I found myself peering hard at anyone who fit the profile. I hovered, camera ready, by an oversized white SUV with tinted windows and crash bars parked in front of Walmart, until the doors opened and an elderly Latino couple emerged. In downtown New Orleans, I crept up on a group of a half-dozen brawny white guys with beards, until it became clear that it was a group of gay tourists. Add to this the flood of well-intentioned people sharing rumors online—my friend saw a suspicious car parked outside this hotel, I wonder if they’re staying there?—and it becomes clear that ICE watching is a long game, and an imperfect science. It will require grace from all of us. As a white guy who looks a little bit like I could be a cop, I accept any future sideways looks I get as my tiny sacrifice for the cause.

Considering the challenges, Unión Migrante and Ojos are shockingly effective. Every day they blast out multiple sightings, photos, and videos, all verified and confirmed. Over time, it is likely that this kind of community intelligence will save lives and prevent some families from being torn apart. And, on a much shallower level, it is just satisfying to watch a video of an activist filming agents desperately trying to be inconspicuous in a parked SUV, walking by them and drawling, “I’m with Neighborhood Watch. You guys good? You guys need any help?”

The people of New Orleans are also registering their pissed-off-ness by holding protests against the immigration action on a near-daily basis. I went to one on Saturday night, on the steps of the Hale Boggs federal courthouse on Poydras Street. There were many “CBP OUT OF NEW ORLEANS!” signs and fliers for a teach-in about general strikes and constant honks of support from passing cars. A billboard for Zatarains loomed picturesquely across the street. A couple of right-wing Youtube trolls also attended, prancing around in front of speakers and shouting pro-deportation slogans and aggressively shoving cameras in unwilling people’s faces and generally acting like dickheads. One of these people, a weak-chinned MAGA darling named Nick Sortor, harassed a woman so insistently that a scuffle broke out. In any other setting, he would have gotten his ass kicked, but the security volunteers went out of their way not to do so, just trying to steer him away from people over and over as he cried about being assaulted. All of this while people who were immigrants and who faced very real risks of life-changing government oppression were giving brave and heartfelt speeches just steps away. It really drove home how rude Nazis are. Their own repulsive, racist glee indicts them more effectively than any outside critics ever could.

Before the spotlight descended on New Orleans this month, many had been toiling quietly for years trying to insulate immigrants from the predations of America’s deportation system. One of those people is Angela Davis—not the famous one who wrote Are Prisons Obsolete?, but an attorney who has spent the past decade running Project Ishmael, a nonprofit that gives legal support to immigrant children. In an office above a church off Canal Street, Davis told me that today’s outrages are different only in degree from what has come before.

She has done this work during the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations. Though the work has changed, she said, “Under every single one of those presidents, many, many families are being separated, torn apart, and detained. That has not changed. The immense cruelty of the U.S. immigration system has been consistent.”

Under Biden, at least, her clients with Special Immigrant Juvenile status were able to get “deferred action,” a temporary protection that made it easier for them to work and live here while their applications for lawful permanent residency were processed. In April, the Trump administration ended deferred action and began arresting people, including some of Davis’s clients. Though Project Ishmael’s services are in high demand, it is harder for them to take on new cases now, because every single case requires so much more work than it did when the government was somewhat less hostile.

To have militarized raids layered on top of the bureaucratic hurdles adds an almost surreal level of hardship to New Orleans immigrants’ lives. “People are scared to leave their home,” she says. “We’ve all read Anne Frank, and have very clear images of what it looks like to be in an attic afraid of forces of terror out in your streets. And that is what it is like. Something not too dissimilar.” Davis carries on with her work, though she admits that she has doubts about how faithfully the government will adhere to the rule of law. “There are still wins in courts, and some of them are still enforceable. There are also many things the government just doesn’t follow,” she says.

On my way out, she gave me a copy of the organization’s summer newsletter. In it was a story that a client from Honduras had written in her own words about her experience as an immigrant. She entered the country in 2018, and was imprisoned and separated from her five year old daughter for a month and a half. After being released and reunited, her son joined them here, and she has been dutifully going to all of her immigration appointments for the past seven years. Then, in May of this year, ICE put an ankle monitor on her to track her movements, and began demanding she go to more appointments, making it hard for her to earn enough money to survive. She began living in fear that ICE would track her down and arrest her on the street if she went out.

“If they did that, they could send you away without your children, so it was better for me to leave the United States. I feared for my life returning to Honduras, but I feared being separated from my children again more. I know the United States is about opportunity and I am grateful for my time here, but life is also too stressful and exhausting,” she wrote. She made the decision to risk her life and leave America, rather than risking losing her family. “On our flight back to Honduras, there were five families with me who had deported themselves.”

This, from our current government’s perspective, is a success story. To harass and persecute and terrorize a mother so fiercely that she chooses to bring her children back to an impoverished country where they may be killed is the best possible outcome that Stephen Miller and Gregory Bovino and their nationwide army of masked raiders could hope for. This is what they are about. This is what they accomplish. This is what their legacy will be. This is what they will have to declare at the gates of heaven, or hell.

The most memorable video from the New Orleans immigration sweeps is one taken last week in a residential neighborhood in Kenner, which instantly became famous. It shows federal agents with rifles surrounding a house where men are repairing a roof. As the cops hop out of their cars and approach, one of the roofers snatches the ladder and yanks it up, setting up an hours-long standoff between the agents on the ground and the men working above, unwilling to come down. The men on the roof reportedly got away in the end.

The symbolism in that clip is almost too perfect: hardworking immigrants escaping deportation by pulling up the ladder behind themselves. But I’m pretty sure that the ICE and CBP agents, all children of people who were immigrants at one time or another, are too dumb to see it.",https://www.currentaffairs.org/hubfs/fuck-ice-nola.webp,N,,2025-12-12 23:56:36.499098

According to data from the Deportation Project, between 2024 and until October 2025, the number of ICE arrests in Onondaga County increased from 56 to 161. Erie County saw an increase from 59 to 620 arrests; Albany County went from 20 to 190; and Monroe from 6 to 224 this year.

In Onondaga County, 42 of the 161 people arrested by ICE were from Ecuador, 27 from Guatemala and 17 from Cuba, and over 80% were men. The data shows 114 of those were deemed “other immigration violator” and 47 had pending criminal charges or criminal convictions. Thirty-six of the 114 without criminal charges have been deported to their originating countries.

The New York Immigration Coalition analyzed the data available through the Deportation Project, which collects and posts data from ICE obtained through Freedom of Information requests, and found that people from Central and South America make up 25% of the immigrant population in New York, but account for 74% of ICE arrests.

“For example, Ecuadorians are 4% of non-citizens in New York state but they are 24.9% of ICE arrests,” said Mario Bruzzone, vice president of the NYIC, during a press conference Wednesday.

The data from the Deportation Project doesn’t include arrests by U.S. Border Patrol agents, so Cayuga County is listed as only having eight ICE detainments even though 57 were detained in Cato following the raid, and Oswego County has five. There is data available on the number of arrests by Border Patrol, but it isn’t broken down by county.

There are eight counties that have 287(g) agreements that allow local law enforcement agencies to work with federal agents, according to ICE's website. Broome, Madison, Nassau, Steuben, Otsego and Niagara all have warrant service officer agreements, meaning that local law enforcement officers can execute administrative immigration warrants on people in their jail systems.

Along with the warrant service agreement, Nassau, Steuben and Niagara counties have task force 287(g) agreements that allow local law enforcement to make immigrant arrests during routine police activities. Cattaraugus County and Camden Police Department, a city department in Oneida County, also have this type of agreement in place.

In 2024, Cattaraugus County had zero ICE arrests but from January to October of 2025, they’ve had 10.

Rensselaer County has a jail enforcement model agreement that allows correctional officers in local jails to interrogate people about their immigration status and notify federal agencies.

On Sept. 4, Cayuga County Sheriff’s deputies worked with federal agents to assist with traffic outside of a raid at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners factory in Cato. The county does not have a 287(g) agreement in place, but following the raid, Sheriff Brian Schenck said they have had a relationship with Border Patrol agents since 2009.

“During my entire career, our agency has always been committed to assisting our local, state and federal agencies in conducting criminal investigations, and this case was no exception,” Schenck said in a statement in September.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/UNY-Spec-EmilyKenny-Rally-20251124-001,N,,2025-12-12 19:57:39.433327

Additional stories shared with NIAC include asylum applicants who fear what will happen given the administration’s indefinite pause on asylum claims.
As stated in the Dec. 2 memo, USCIS will provide a list of individuals for review, interview, re-interview, and referral to ICE and other law enforcement agencies within 90 days.
This process will explicitly target individuals from the 19 travel ban countries, including Iran, and even applies to approved green card holders who received their permanent residence since 2021.","The Trump administration is enacting major, discriminatory and open-ended changes to the immigration system.

On November 27, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published a memo announcing a new guidance allowing for negative, country-specific factors to be considered when vetting individuals from the 19 countries targeted in the June travel ban (PP 10949). A few days later, on December 2, USCIS published another memo announcing an indefinite pause on all immigration applications filed by individuals from the travel ban countries. These policy changes are clearly and blatantly based in discrimination on the basis of national origin, and must be halted.

The impact of these harmful, bias-driven policies is already being deeply felt by members of the targeted communities, including Iranians. Application of these new policies will lead to many already-vetted visa holders, along with green card holders, being arbitrarily denied benefits and potentially even arrested and deported by ICE.

Reports have revealed that naturalization interviews and citizenship ceremonies have been abruptly canceled over the last week. Some reports indicated that officers directly asked individuals attending a naturalization ceremony at Faneuil Hall in Boston, MA what country they were from, “and if they said a certain country, they were told to step out of line and that their oath ceremonies were canceled.” This kind of direct targeting is based entirely on national origin, and it is deeply alarming and anti-American.

Likewise, The New York Times detailed how Iranian-born Raouf Vafaei, who has been in the U.S. for eight years, was just days away from being sworn in as a U.S. citizen when he received a four sentence email informing him that his ceremony was canceled. Vafaei described feeling excited for his ceremony, and that his mother even purchased a new dress for the event. However, now it remains unclear when he will reach this key milestone of securing citizenship in the land he is proud to call home. NIAC has likewise received many similar reports from members of the community.

In recent weeks, Iranians who have filed applications for various immigration benefits have also reported receiving Notices of Intent to Deny noting that Iranian heritage is now considered a negative factor. The letters state “USCIS has determined that the positive discretionary factors do not outweigh the country-specific negative discretionary factors USCIS has identified in your request for a change of status.”

NIAC has also heard from Iranians who described living in limbo for years awaiting progress on a visa application only to have their interviews canceled with no indication as to when they will be rescheduled. Additional stories shared with NIAC include asylum applicants who fear what will happen given the administration’s indefinite pause on asylum claims. These changes have left many Iranians in deep uncertainty regarding their futures, putting them at risk of losing job offers, student slots and even putting them at risk of potential arrest and deportation.

In tandem with its recent policy changes, USCIS also announced the creation of a specialized unit dedicated to revisiting past, approved immigration screening and vetting. According to the agency, the unit will “draw on the full spectrum of classified and nonclassified screening and vetting capabilities and provide a more thorough supplemental review of immigration applications and petitions.” Tasked with reviewing both pending applications as well as with re-reviewing approved applications, this unit will turn the recent policy changes into active harm.

Hundreds of thousands of individuals could be put at risk by these recent changes. As stated in the Dec. 2 memo, USCIS will provide a list of individuals for review, interview, re-interview, and referral to ICE and other law enforcement agencies within 90 days. This process will explicitly target individuals from the 19 travel ban countries, including Iran, and even applies to approved green card holders who received their permanent residence since 2021. The memo notes that the re-interview process will be applied to anyone deemed “unable to establish their identity,” which could be interpreted very broadly, given that the June travel ban declared screening and vetting in the targeted countries deficient. It is not clear what will happen to the individuals who are on the forthcoming USCIS-generated list, and if they will be at risk of near-term arrest.",https://niacouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/niac-new-favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-13 01:56:50.074876

The framework rescinds the 2024 CBA between TSA and the American Federation of Government Employees, the agency said.
But in response to longstanding concerns about TSA attrition, then-TSA Administrator David Pekoske in 2022 issued a determination that expanded collective bargaining at the agency to mirror the bargaining rights under Title 5.
TSA and AFGE then negotiated and signed a seven-year collective bargaining agreement last year.
The agreement established a streamlined process for grievance and arbitration, expanded official time, fewer restrictions on sick leave, increased uniform allowances and opportunities for local collective bargaining.","The Department of Homeland Security is again moving to rescind a collective bargaining agreement with Transportation Security Administration employees, despite an ongoing court case over DHS’ prior move to eliminate the TSA union agreement.

In a Dec. 12 press release, TSA announced that a new “labor framework” would be implemented starting Jan. 11, 2026. The framework rescinds the 2024 CBA between TSA and the American Federation of Government Employees, the agency said.

TSA said the decision is based on a Sept. 29 determination by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, “Eliminating Collective Bargaining at TSA Due to its Incompatibility with TSA’s National Security Mission and its Adverse Impact on Resources, Flexibility, Mission Focus, Security Effectiveness, and Traveler Experience.”

TSA said Noem’s determination — which it did not release — “establishes that employees performing security screening functions … have a primary function of national security and shall not engage in collective bargaining or be represented for any purposes by any representative or organization.”

Noem also determined that collective bargaining for TSA officers “is inconsistent with efficient stewardship of taxpayer dollars and impedes the agility required to secure the traveling public,” according to the agency statement.

“Our Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) need to be focused on their mission of keeping travelers safe not wasting countless hours on non-mission critical work,” Adam Stahl, senior official performing the duties of TSA deputy administrator, said in the press release. “Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, we are ridding the agency of wasteful and time-consuming activities that distracted our officers from their crucial work.”

AFGE quickly criticized TSA’s announcement. AFGE represents approximately 47,000 airport screeners under the CBA.

“Merely 30 days ago, Secretary Noem celebrated TSA officers for their dedication during the longest government shutdown in history,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said as part of a statement. “Today, she’s announcing a lump of coal right on time for the holidays: that she’s stripping those same dedicated officers of their union rights.”

AFGE noted that a federal judge earlier this year blocked DHS from dissolving the collective bargaining agreement. The union had brought the lawsuit in response to a previous determination issued by Noem that sought to dissolve the CBA.

In granting the preliminary injunction in June, the judge presiding over the case wrote that Noem’s previous attempt to dissolve the CBA “appears to have been undertaken to punish AFGE and its members because AFGE has chosen to push back against the Trump Administration’s attacks to federal employment in the courts.”

That ongoing case is currently scheduled to go to trial next September.

Kelley said AFGE “will continue to challenge these illegal attacks on our members’ right to belong to a union.” He also urged the Senate to pass the Protect America’s Workforce Act “immediately.”

TSA staff don’t have the same statutory rights as other federal employees under Title 5 of U.S. Code. But in response to longstanding concerns about TSA attrition, then-TSA Administrator David Pekoske in 2022 issued a determination that expanded collective bargaining at the agency to mirror the bargaining rights under Title 5.

TSA and AFGE then negotiated and signed a seven-year collective bargaining agreement last year. The agreement established a streamlined process for grievance and arbitration, expanded official time, fewer restrictions on sick leave, increased uniform allowances and opportunities for local collective bargaining.

In a statement today, AFGE Council 100 President Hydrick Thomas called the decision to revoke the CBA a “slap in the face” to TSA employees

“Prior to having a union contract, many employees endured hostile work environments and workers felt like they didn’t have a voice on the job, which led to severe attrition rates and longer wait times for the traveling public,” Thomas said. “Since having a contract, we’ve seen a more stable workforce, and there has never been another aviation-related attack on our country.”

In its statement, TSA said that agency policy will govern “employment matters previously addressed by the 2024 CBA, and TSA policy will provide for alternative procedures to ensure that employee voices are heard and that legitimate concerns are resolved quickly.”

The IJ found that Cruz-Lopez had failed to meet the statutory standard of ‘exceptional and extremely unusual hardship’ to a qualifying relative—a showing necessary to warrant cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b)(1)(D). Cruz-Lopez appealed the IJ’s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and also moved for termination of the proceedings on the basis that she was served with an allegedly defective Notice to Appear.

“The BIA dismissed the appeal and denied the motion to terminate. Before this court, Cruz-Lopez challenges only the denial of her application for cancellation of removal. For the reasons set forth below, we DENY the petition for review.

“Cruz-Lopez is a citizen of Mexico who unlawfully entered the United States in 1999. She has one child, Eduardo, who is a United States citizen. At the time of the hearing before the IJ in August 2020, Eduardo was 19 years old and worked part-time as a line cook. Eduardo and CruzLopez live with Cruz-Lopez’s sister, as well as the sister’s husband and son. Cruz-Lopez believes that Eduardo would not move with her if she is removed to Mexico.

“During the hearing before the IJ, Cruz-Lopez presented documentary and testimonial evidence in support of her contention that Eduardo will suffer emotional and economic hardship if she is removed. The IJ ultimately found that the alleged hardship did not rise to the level of being exceptional and extremely unusual. Cruz-Lopez timely appealed to the BIA, which agreed with the IJ that Cruz-Lopez had failed to meet the hardship standard. This timely petition for review followed.

“We have not yet decided exactly what level of deference we should give to the BIA’s conclusions on this issue. But we need not resolve that question here because, under any level of deference, Cruz-Lopez cannot establish that Eduardo will suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.

“The primary issue before us is whether the IJ and the BIA properly concluded that Cruz-Lopez failed to establish that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her child, Eduardo. We hold that the IJ and the BIA did not err in so ruling.

While the year is rapidly coming to a close, my Senate Democratic colleagues and I are using every moment we have to deliver solutions to the issues facing our state. From passing legislation on budget transparency and permanently expanding the bipartisan Michigan Reconnect program to holding committee hearings on human trafficking and suicide prevention, we’re laser-focused on getting things done for the people of Michigan.

In the past week, we’ve sent several letters advocating for Michiganders facing deportation and expressing concern about inhumane conditions in ICE facilities across the nation.

Read on to learn more about those actions, the progress we’ve achieved in 2025, and our continued efforts to keep moving Michigan forward in the new year. Also, we hope you can join us tomorrow at my coffee hour in Detroit!

No-Fee PPO Service Bills Pass Senate Unanimously

This week, I was pleased that Senate Bills 611 and 612 passed the Senate unanimously. Sponsored by myself and Senator Ruth Johnson, these bills will make a big difference for victims of stalking and domestic violence who are seeking a Personal Protection Order. These bills now await hearings and a vote in the House. If enacted, Michigan would join 43 states, the District of Columbia, and two territories that already require PPO services to be provided free of charge.

Currently, the cost to serve a PPO can include a service fee plus mileage traveled, which can easily cost almost $100 — an amount that could be especially tough for someone fleeing domestic violence to afford. This legislation would not only make it less financially burdensome for victims but also safer by ensuring the PPO is served by a member of law enforcement rather than a friend or family member of the victim, which is allowed under current law. When someone has gathered the courage to share what has happened to them and secure a PPO, our state should not put up financial barriers to their safety.

Senate Acts to Deliver Relief for Michiganders Facing UIA Benefit Recovery

During the chaos of the pandemic, thousands of Michiganders turned to their government for help, tapping into the unemployment system to put food on the table, pay their bills, and ensure their families could weather a once-in-a-lifetime global health crisis. Since then, the Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) has been attempting to claw back overpayments it mistakenly made to these same individuals — causing stress for many across the state at an already financially tough time.

Let’s be clear: these families did nothing wrong. That’s why, earlier this week, alongside every single Senator, both Democratic and Republican, I voted to pass legislation that would provide a clean slate for these folks by waiving any overpayments the UIA is currently attempting to collect from this pandemic-era timeframe. Senate Bill 700 now heads to the Michigan House, where I’m hopeful they will act quickly, so we can deliver relief to those who need it most.

Expanding Opportunity, Lowering Costs, & Protecting Michigan: Senate Democrats Reflect on Progress From 2025

As we approach the end of 2025 and wrap up our legislative work for the year, I’d like to take a moment to reflect on the progress we’ve delivered for the people of Michigan. Together, my Senate Democratic colleagues and I:

Saved Medicaid in Michigan, protecting access to accessible, affordable health care;

Expanded the widely successful Rx Kids program to improve maternal and infant health outcomes;

Delivered another bipartisan budget that continues the universal free school meals program, implements a long-term road solution, and lowers costs for seniors and families;

Advanced commonsense gun safety policies to keep our communities safe;

Fought back against federal chaos and safeguarded our state from the worst effects of Trump’s disastrous budget plan;

Strengthened protections and benefits for Michigan veterans and their families;

Championed legislation to improve government accountability, tackle racial and ethnic maternal health disparities, lower prescription drug costs, expand transparency in the state budget process, and so much more.

I’m proud of the work we’ve accomplished this year, despite the many obstacles and unprecedented setbacks we faced at both the state and federal levels of government. While we’ll be working in Lansing until the end of the month, I’m already planning ahead for 2026 and looking forward to another productive year advocating for our communities and our state. I also encourage you to stay informed about the legislation moving through the Senate in the coming weeks. Feel free to track the legislation we’re working on here.

Fighting Food Insecurity This Holiday Season and Beyond

Everyone deserves access to quality, nutritious food, full stop — but this year, the demand for food assistance is higher than ever as grocery costs soar and federal Republicans have disrupted Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and restricted eligibility. Approximately 1.5 million Michiganders face food insecurity, including over 402,000 children.

My Senate Democratic colleagues and I have worked hard to ensure that every Michigan family has access to food not only during the holidays, but year-round. From proposing $71 million in relief funding to support food banks and continue SNAP benefits during the federal shutdown to delivering another year of free school meals for every Michigan student, we’ve made significant progress in combating food insecurity here in our state. Learn more about our efforts to tackle food insecurity here, and explore food assistance resources below.

I joined residents and lawmakers at a press conference hosted by the Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments on December 1 to advocate for the shutdown of US Ecology Detroit South due to environmental harm and harm to residents. Neighbors discussed the negative impact the facility has on their bodies and home lives, citing a constant smell and taste of chemicals. The lawmakers who spoke at the press conference included Rep. Tonya Myers Phillips (D-7) and Rep. Donavan McKinny (D-11), both of whom emphasized the right to breathe clean air and quality of life. Rev. Sharon Buttry, community leader of the DHCAHE, called on the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (BSEED) to shut down the hazardous waste treatment plant and not renew its permit. Earlier this year, I submitted public comment to EGLE expressing my strong concern about the facility’s proposed renewal permit and the related odor and air quality violations.

Standing up for Communities

This week, I, along with several other Michigan elected officials, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) urging the immediate release of Ernesto Cuevas Enciso on bond pending his upcoming immigration hearing. Ernesto is the husband of a United States citizen and the father of a one-year-old child. He is a former DACA recipient with legal work authorization and a pending application for legal permanent residency. We are advocating for his release home to his family, not held at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin. Here is a link to the letter.

We also joined a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field directors in Michigan and Texas, urging them to release four Western International High School students and their families: Kerly Mariangel Sosa Rivero and her father, Gleiner Jose Sosa Mujica; Antony Janier Peña Sosa and his mother, Maryeli Antonieta Sosa Marquina; Mor Ba; and Santiago Jesus Zamora Perez and his mother, Evelin Josefina Perez. These young people and their parents arrived in the United States from Venezuela or Senegal, and all have pending asylum cases. The students are all following the immigration process and are not considered a risk to public safety. Here is a link to the letter.

In a letter sent last week, several Michigan legislators and I called on ICE to address the concerning living conditions for people held in custody in its facilities. We would like to ensure that Alee Vang and others receive the proper required medication and are asking ICE to reduce overcrowding, implement emergency improvements to sanitation and nutrition, ensure adequate on-site medical staffing, and increase oversight and transparency.

Other Trump tweaks to the immigration system like a new $100,000 fee for H-1B applicants have already spawned major lawsuits, and if the gold card melts down in a court battle, applicants would face a slim chance of ever getting their money back, Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told Axios.

“The Trump admin says anyone who pays $1 million will be deemed to have ‘exceptional business ability’ and become eligible for an employment-based immigrant visa,” he wrote. “But there's nothing stopping someone from just getting a loan or using parents' money.”

“Of course, nothing exemplifies the Trump ethos more than ‘every rich person is exceptional at business,’” he added, “but that doesn't change the fact that people who are getting this visa will not necessarily meet the legal requirements, and could risk deportation under a future admin.”

The Independent has contacted the White House and State Department for comment.

Following that tragic attack, we have been deeply pained to see how our government has villainized and punished entire groups of people — Afghans, Somalis, refugees, asylum seekers, and all immigrants. The president has unleashed vile, racist attacks on Somalis, “demonizing an entire group of people who came here, fleeing civil war, and created a vibrant community that makes Minnesota and this country better,” as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said.

We’ve seen the administration disparage people from dozens of majority non-white countries as “killers” and “leeches,” vowing to expand their racist travel ban.

We’ve seen people arriving for their citizenship ceremonies pulled out of line and told to go home simply because they came from a country that the president deems to be “of concern.”

We’ve seen the administration halt all asylum cases and implement sweeping new restrictions on immigration from “Third World Countries.” This comes after the administration had already stopped all refugee admissions, with the notable exception of white South Africans.

Sadly, dehumanizing rhetoric and scapegoating is nothing new for this administration. We must not allow this kind of racism and hatred from our government to become normalized or accepted.

Insulting and crass language denies the inherent worth and dignity of all people and has been deployed to justify wanton violence and cruelty both at home and abroad.

We’ve seen the Department of Homeland Security post memes rooted in white nationalism to glorify the terrorizing of our neighbors.

We’ve seen the Secretary of Defense evoke a children’s cartoon to flippantly celebrate the murder of people abroad.

As Phil Klay writes in the New York Times, this violence and cruelty is “wounding” our “national soul.”

“The president inhabits a position of moral leadership,” Klay wrote. “When the president and his officials sell their policies, they’re selling a version of what it means to be an American.”

We must continue to defend a different version of our national values held by a strong majority of Americans – one defined by compassion, respect, and solidarity, not cruelty, racism, and xenophobia.

Health insurance costs to rise as Senate vote fails

Nearly 400,000 H-1B applications were approved in fiscal year 2024, most of them renewals, according to the Pew Research Center.
The lawsuit alleges the DHS illegally implemented the $100,000 fee without authorization from Congress.
The attorneys general H-1B visa lawsuit isn’t the first to challenge the new $100,000 fees in court.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also sued the Department of Homeland Security in October over the $100,000 H-1B visa fee, alleging it exceeded Congress’ authority and illegally bypassed the Immigration and Nationality Act.","A coalition of 20 states sued the Trump administration Friday over its imposition of a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions.

In their 49th lawsuit against the administration this year, the states’ attorneys general, all Democrats, allege the Department of Homeland Security’s new surcharge on temporary worker visas is illegal and exacerbates a nationwide shortage of doctors, nurses, teachers, researchers and other skilled professionals.

“President Trump’s $100,000 fee isn’t just misguided,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference in San Francisco, where he announced the new lawsuit. “It is illegal, and it threatens to worsen already severe shortages across California.”

At issue is the proclamation President Donald Trump signed Sept. 19 ordering the DHS to implement the new fee for any H-1B application filed after Sept. 21. At the time, Trump said the nonimmigrant visa program had “been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.”

The H-1B visa program was created by the Immigration Act of 1990, which allowed U.S. employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for jobs in specialty occupations. Nearly 400,000 H-1B applications were approved in fiscal year 2024, most of them renewals, according to the Pew Research Center. As of 2023, India was the top country of birth for H-1B workers (73%), followed by China (12%), Pew said.

Congress currently caps the number of H-1B visas available at 65,000 a year. H-1B visas usually last for three years and have the potential for a three-year extension, according to the DHS.

Employers who file for the visas had typically paid $900 to $7,500 per visa to cover processing costs, Bonta said. The lawsuit alleges the DHS illegally implemented the $100,000 fee without authorization from Congress.

“This massive fee exceeds the Department of Homeland Security’s authority,” Bonta said. “It ignores Congress’ careful framework for setting visa fees. It undermines the purpose of the H-1B program, and it grants the Secretary of Homeland Security sweeping discretion to apply the fee selectively.”

Bonta said the $100,000 fee had no rational connection to the cost of administering the program and was an unnecessary obstacle intended to shut out the skilled workers American employers need. He said the attorneys general are asking the court to block the fee's implementation.

The Department of Homeland Security hasn’t yet responded to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

Bonta and Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell led the lawsuit, which also includes Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

“Our state universities and colleges employ H-1B personnel to support their research and education missions,” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a statement. “They are incapable of absorbing an additional $100,000 for each H-1B they hire, and that is why we are fighting to defend education and ground-breaking research in Colorado.”

A National Education Association analysis in October found more than 500 K-12 public school districts employed at least 2,300 H-1B visa holders nationwide in the 2025 fiscal year. According to the Learning Policy Institute, nearly 412,000 teaching positions in the U.S. were either unfilled or occupied by teachers who were not fully certified in June.

KFF Health News reported that 4.2% of all H-1B petitions were for medicine and health positions in 2024 fiscal year.

The attorneys general H-1B visa lawsuit isn’t the first to challenge the new $100,000 fees in court. In October, a group of plaintiffs in the case Global Nurse Force et al. v. Trump argued the fee exceeds presidential authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also sued the Department of Homeland Security in October over the $100,000 H-1B visa fee, alleging it exceeded Congress’ authority and illegally bypassed the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The Interior Department said in a statement on Friday that the review of retail items would “ensure our gift shops remain neutral spaces that serve all visitors” and “do not promote specific viewpoints.” The department did not respond to questions about what kinds of items it expected parks to remove or what merchandise parks had flagged as unacceptable, if any.

The Trump administration has used the National Park Service to promote its broader effort of telling a more positive version of American history and de-emphasizing Black history, ordering the removal of anything that “inappropriately disparages Americans past or living,” including some materials related to slavery and Native Americans. The National Park Service will also cut Martin Luther King’s Birthday and Juneteenth, two holidays honoring Black history, from its list of free entrance days next year.

Alan Spears, senior director for cultural resources at the National Parks Conservation Association, called the order a “sham review of gift shop materials” and part of “the administration’s deeply troubling pattern of silencing science and hiding history in our parks.”

In a statement, Mr. Spears said that the association opposed the move because “we, like the majority of Americans, support telling the full American story at our parks.” He added, “That means acknowledging hard truths about slavery, climate change, and other topics that challenge us as a nation.”

Mr. Spears said that the Interior Department had not provided any guidance on how to conduct the merchandise review.

President Trump’s approach to public lands has also been a point of contention among some environmentalists, members of Congress and local businesses that offer guided tours of parks.

Starting on Jan. 1, foreign tourists will have to pay a $100 surcharge to visit the country’s most popular national parks. That’s three to five times the typical entry fee for U.S. residents. On Wednesday, the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit challenging the National Park Service’s plan to emblazon Mr. Trump’s face on some annual passes to national parks.

Jill Savitt, the chief executive of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta, said the civil rights movement and the end of slavery were moments that “make America great” and were essential to telling the full truth of American history.

“When you ban certain kinds of concepts or ideas, you’re not allowing democracy to happen,” she said in an interview. “You’re not allowing that exchange that promotes conversation. You’re saying this is a one-sided conversation.”

It’s unclear how many arrests have been made as a result of the collaboration. But documents obtained by The New York Times show that it led to the arrest of Any Lucía López Belloza, the college student picked up at Boston Logan Airport on Nov. 20 and deported to Honduras two days later. A former ICE official said 75 percent of instances in that official’s region where names were flagged by the program yielded arrests.

ICE has historically avoided interfering with domestic travel. But the partnership between airport security and the immigration agency, which began quietly in March, is the latest way the Trump administration is increasing cooperation and information sharing between federal agencies in service of the president’s goal of carrying out the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history.

“The message to those in the country illegally is clear: The only reason you should be flying is to self-deport home,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.

Airline passengers have long been subject to some federal scrutiny. Airlines typically provide passenger information to T.S.A. after a flight is reserved. That information is compared against national security databases, including the Terrorist Screening Dataset, which includes the names of individuals on a watch list of known or suspected terrorists.

But the T.S.A. previously did not get involved in domestic criminal or immigration matters, said one former agency official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue freely. Among the concerns, the former official said, has been that enforcement activities at airports could distract from airport security and contribute to longer passenger wait times.

“If you have more officers conducting arrests at airports, it puts more strain on the system, delays and complications may annoy and frighten some travelers, and those who are unsure about their status will move away from air travel,” said Claire Trickler-McNulty, a senior ICE official during the Biden administration. “It will continue to reduce the space where people feel safe going about their business.”

The push to ramp up enforcement is pervasive inside the Department of Homeland Security, which houses both ICE and the T.S.A. Earlier this year, Stephen Miller, a top White House official, floated a goal of 3,000 immigration arrests a day and met with top ICE officials about how to increase deportations.

Some former ICE officials said the program would be a huge help to an agency struggling to meet the numbers of deportations sought by the Trump administration.

“The administration has turned routine travel into a force multiplier for removals, potentially identifying thousands who thought they could evade the law simply by boarding a plane,” said Scott Mechkowski, the former deputy head of the ICE office in New York City. “This isn’t about fear; it’s about restoring order and ensuring every American knows their government enforces its laws without apology.”

The airport has an added benefit to authorities of a location where potential targets have been scanned for weapons. And, as in the case of Ms. López, people flagged as part of the program have been able to be apprehended and deported very quickly.

Ms. López, 19, had a previous deportation order. In 2018, according to internal records, her case had been referred to ICE for potential arrest. Despite that, she said she did not know about the order and was able to continue to live in the country without issues. Most recently, she was attending Babson College, where she was studying business as a freshman.

Things changed on Nov. 20, when Ms. López arrived at the Boston Logan Airport on her way to Texas. She went through security with her Honduran passport without incident, she said, and arrived at her gate early enough to grab a cup of coffee.

When it was time to board, however, her boarding pass didn’t work.

The second time it was scanned, she noticed an X on the computer screen in front of the agent, who told her to go to customer service to figure out what was happening, she said.

“Oh, you’re Any,” one of the federal agents waiting for her said, according to Ms. López. Internal records show she was initially detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents.

“He was like, well, you’re going to come with us. You’re going to be filling a bunch of paperwork,” she recalled. “I was like, well, I have to be boarding the plane because I have to leave right now. And he was like, well, I don’t think you’re even going to be on that flight.”

Activists blasted the airport deportation program as one intended to frighten immigrants.

“This is another attempt to terrorize and punish communities and will make people terrified to ever leave their homes for fear of being unjustly detained and disappeared out of the country before they have a chance to contest the detention,” said Robyn Barnard, senior director of refugee advocacy at Human Rights First, an immigrant advocacy organization.

Documents obtained by The New York Times show Ms. López’s arrest involved an ICE office in California that plays a key role in the airport program. The office, called the Pacific Enforcement Response Center, sends tips to immigration officers across the country and requests to local jails to hold immigrants. Documents show the office flagged Ms. López’s flight information to ICE officers in Boston.

The document details how this is part of a collaboration “with Transportation Security Administration to send actionable leads to the field regarding aliens with a final order of removal that appear to have an impending flight scheduled.”

A former senior ICE official with knowledge of the airport program said the California office often sent several tips a day on potential arrestees at airports in the region the official worked in. The former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal law enforcement matters, said ICE officers received the passenger’s flight number and departure time, as well as a photo of the target — sometimes just hours before the plane took off.

The program is particularly effective because it allows ICE to quickly deport those who are arrested, the former official said.

The arrest of Ms. López is not the only one from the program that has led to media attention.

In late October, Marta Brizeyda Renderos Leiva, a woman from El Salvador, was arrested at the airport in Salt Lake City. Ms. Leiva also had a final deportation order. Video of the arrest shows Ms. Leiva yelling as officers pulled her out of the airport.

Internal records obtained by The Times show that Ms. Leiva’s flight information had been tipped off to local officers by the California office as well.

The Trump administration has tried to leverage other databases to track down immigrants it wants to detain or deport, including the I.R.S., which earlier this year agreed to hand over the addresses of migrants to ICE. A federal court blocked the effort in November.

Ms. López’s case drew publicity in part because she had no criminal record. She had been planning to go home and spend Thanksgiving with her family, including going to church and eating Thanksgiving dinner together. It was a surprise trip.

“I was thinking, OK, this is what I’m going to do with them,” she recalled about the plans she had to spend time with her relatives. “This day I’m going to do this. This day I’m going to be with, like, friends, family and stuff like that. That was the only thing that was going through my mind.”

Now, in Honduras, she is trying to figure out a way to transfer colleges. She misses going to church with her family, to a Texas grocery chain and her mother’s cooking, she said.

But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took special aim at New York at a news conference on Friday. He called the state “the worst offender” for issuing commercial driver’s licenses to foreign nationals without sufficient proof of their long-term work authorization. He also threatened to pull $73 million in federal highway funding unless officials paused issuing all non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses and learner’s permit and voided the active licenses of any immigrants found to be driving without legal work permits. The state was given 30 days to respond to the administration’s demands.

Derek D. Barrs, the administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, added that if New York failed to act within 30 days, the state could also lose its certification to issue any commercial driver’s licenses.

New York’s commercial driver’s license standards, he charged, represented “a systematically grossly unacceptable deviation from federal safety regulations.”

“When improper licenses are issued, safety is compromised,” he added.

In a statement, Walter McClure, a spokesman for New York’s Department of Motor Vehicles, accused federal transportation officials of “lying about New York State.”

“Here is the truth: Commercial drivers licenses are regulated by the federal government, and New York State DMV has, and will continue to, comply with federal rules,” he said.

“This is just another stunt from Secretary Duffy, and it does nothing to keep our roads safer,” he added.

Mr. Duffy and Mr. Barrs have based their criticism of New York on a federal audit of 200 non-domiciled commercial licenses. They said more than half of those license-holders no longer had proper authorization to work in the United States and cited examples in which they said New York had issued credentials to foreigners who didn’t have proper work authorization at the time of their application.

Using that evidence, they questioned whether New York had verified the immigration status of the approximately 32,000 people holding active non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses holders from the state. They also pointed out that the state regularly issued noncitizen commercial driver’s licenses that were valid for eight years, even if applicants did not have work visas that lasted that long.

“They’re not verifying the legal status of that individual,” Mr. Duffy said, arguing that New York was not routinely checking applicants’ passports or visas to verify their continued work eligibility.

Mr. McClure, the New York D.M.V. spokesman, countered that every commercial driver’s license was “subject to verification of an applicant’s lawful status through federally issued documents reviewed in accordance with federal regulations.”

The Trump administration has been pursuing a variety of initiatives to prevent certain immigrants from procuring commercial driver’s licenses. Earlier this year, Mr. Duffy’s department added a nationwide requirement that truckers meet new English-language proficiency standards. Earlier this month, his department revoked the accreditation of thousands of training centers where he said drivers improperly received their licenses.

The centerpiece of the effort, however, has been the department’s effort to pressure certain states to revoke licenses for noncitizen drivers already on the road, largely by threatening to withhold critical highway funds. The urgency around the effort increased after an August crash in Florida, in which an immigrant holding a California-issued commercial driver’s license and accused of being in the country without authorization killed three people after making an illegal U-turn.

Mr. Duffy has been criticized for focusing his efforts on states led by Democratic governors. But he argued on Friday that the threats to California and New York were just about numbers. Together, the two states issue over half of the country’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses, he said.

“You don’t just drive in New York if you get a New York commercial driver’s license. You drive around the country,” Mr. Duffy said. “These unqualified drivers operate in every single state, so everybody’s at risk,” he added.

The request was accompanied by a separate request to pause the inquiry from beginning on Monday morning to let the appeals court work.

The Justice Department’s filings were merely the latest flashpoint between the administration and the courts — especially over the contentious subject of President Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda.

The main filing had harsh words for Judge Boasberg’s pending contempt proceeding, calling it “an idiosyncratic and misguided inquiry” that “portends a circus.” It was also remarkably antagonistic to the judge himself, making the highly unusual request that the case be stripped from him altogether because he had “developed too strong a bias to preside over this matter impartially.”

Judge Boasberg fired back within hours in his own forceful ruling, saying that the proceeding should go on.

“This inquiry is not some academic exercise,” he wrote. “Approximately 137 men were spirited out of this country without a hearing and placed in a high-security prison in El Salvador, where many suffered abuse and possible torture, despite this court’s order that they should not be disembarked.”

The Justice Department’s request to the appeals court was not the first time it had sought to involve appellate judges in derailing Judge Boasberg’s contempt investigation.

In April, department lawyers persuaded a three-judge panel of the court to put off the inquiry as it considered the investigation’s viability. But in November, after months of deliberation, the full appeals court permitted Judge Boasberg to move forward.

He wasted no time in ordering testimony from Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer who had informed administration officials about his order on March 15 to stop the flights of immigrants from going to El Salvador and to turn around any planes that were already in the air.

Judge Boasberg said he also wanted to hear from Erez Reuveni, one of Mr. Ensign’s former colleagues who filed an explosive whistle-blower complaint about the case after he was fired by the department in a related proceeding. In his complaint, Mr. Reuveni accused Emil Bove III, who was then in a senior role at the Justice Department, of telling his subordinates in profane language that they might need to consider ignoring court orders demanding that the deportation flights be halted.

Those flights were part of an early effort by the White House to send scores of Venezuelan men accused of being members of the violent street gang Tren de Aragua to a notorious prison in El Salvador under the expansive authority of a wartime law passed more than two centuries ago. The law, known as the Alien Enemies Act, gives the president sweeping powers to detain and deport members of a hostile foreign nation in a time of war or during an invasion of the country.

The question of whether Mr. Trump used the act properly to expel the Venezuelans is now being considered by a different court in Texas and is likely to ultimately make its way to the Supreme Court. The Justice Department’s filing on Friday concerned the narrower question of whether Judge Boasberg acted properly when he ordered Mr. Ensign and Mr. Reuveni to take the stand in Federal District Court in Washington on Monday and Tuesday.

Lawyers for the department have said that their testimony was not needed because both men have “no personal knowledge” about how the decision was made to send the deportation flights to El Salvador.

Moreover, the lawyers said, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has already acknowledged in a sworn statement to Judge Boasberg that she alone made that decision, relying on advice from top Justice Department officials, including Mr. Bove and Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general. Mr. Bove and Mr. Blanche also filed sworn statements to the judge, but lawyers for the Venezuelan men derided them as being “anemic” and said they “raise more questions than they answer.”

From the start of the dispute, the administration has claimed that it never violated Judge Boasberg’s order, arguing that his oral instructions to turn the planes around midair were not reflected in a subsequent written decision.

“While the judge had made some oral statements at an earlier hearing that suggested he wanted the government to ‘turn planes around,’ those statements were inconsistent, tentative and ultimately superseded by a written order that purported to memorialize the decree but said nothing about returning anyone from abroad,” the Justice Department wrote in its filing to the appeals court.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the Venezuelan men, said in a court filing late Thursday night that many questions remained unanswered and that Judge Boasberg had the full authority to demand information from the administration.

The A.C.L.U. lawyers said, for instance, that they wanted to know more about Mr. Bove’s statements suggesting that court orders could be ignored, and about the reaction from administration officials after Mr. Ensign told them about the order that Judge Boasberg ultimately handed down.

In its filing, the administration somewhat nervously expressed concern that having to answer some questions in front of Judge Boasberg would only lead to having to answer more questions.

“The forthcoming hearing has every appearance of an endless fishing expedition,” the Justice Department wrote, “aimed at an ever-widening list of witnesses and prolonged testimony.”

It was still not entirely clear why Admiral Holsey was departing a year into what is typically a three-year job and in the midst of the biggest operation in his 37-year career.

He offered no explanation on Friday at a sun-dappled ceremony flanked by palm trees at his headquarters, near Miami. Admiral Holsey, known as Bull, made no reference to the controversy over the boat strikes in brief remarks, instead urging members of his command to press for a “secure, free and prosperous Western Hemisphere.”

But one current and one former U.S. official, as well as a congressional official, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters, said Admiral Holsey had raised concerns early in the mission about the attacks on the alleged drug boats, which started in September.

At the time, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had expressed frustration that the admiral was not pursuing suspected drug traffickers quickly and aggressively enough. The admiral’s concerns caused him to fall further out of favor with the defense secretary, the officials said. In the end, Mr. Hegseth pushed out Admiral Holsey, the officials said.

While Admiral Holsey has been the highest-ranking military officer overseeing the boat strikes, the decision to carry them out has been driven by the White House and Mr. Hegseth. The strikes themselves have been conducted by the Joint Special Operations Command, with the admiral largely cut out of the decision-making, congressional and defense officials said.

In October, the Southern Command announced it was delegating most of the day-to-day responsibilities of the counterdrug mission to a new task force. Later named Southern Spear, it was led by Lt. Gen. Calvert L. Worth Jr., a Marine Corps general based in Camp Lejeune, N.C.

In the past two weeks, Admiral Holsey’s final days in command have been overshadowed by congressional scrutiny into a follow-on strike that killed two initial survivors of President Trump’s first boat attack on Sept. 2. That additional strike was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who was the head of the Joint Special Operations Command at the time.

On Wednesday, the United States seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a dramatic escalation of Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro, the country’s leader.

Admiral Holsey briefed top lawmakers on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees this week in a virtual classified session, but the legislators said the admiral left unanswered many questions about the strikes and his early retirement.

Lt. Gen. Evan L. Pettus, an Air Force fighter pilot and Admiral Holsey’s deputy, will take over as acting commander until Mr. Trump nominates a permanent successor.

Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who presided over the admiral’s retirement ceremony and has been deeply involved in the boat strikes, also made no mention of that campaign or Admiral Holsey’s unusual departure. He praised the admiral on Friday as “a quiet professional.”

Mr. Hegseth offered no comments on Friday about Admiral Holsey’s retirement. Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary, referred to Mr. Hegseth’s statement on social media from October, when Admiral Holsey announced his early retirement. Mr. Hegseth’s post made no mention of any friction with his four-star commander.

But other current and former officials at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill said Mr. Hegseth’s praise in October masked real policy tensions concerning Venezuela that the admiral and his civilian boss were seeking to paper over.

“Military officers spend their entire careers earning a role as a four-star combat commander,” said James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and the former head of the Southern Command. “To simply depart one year into a three-year assignment without explanation of any kind is beyond unusual. I cannot think of a similar case across my four decades in uniform.”

Since early September, U.S. Special Operations forces have struck at least 22 boats off the coast of Venezuela and in the Eastern Pacific that the White House said were transporting drugs, killing 87 people. American officials have privately made clear that the main goal was to drive Mr. Maduro from power.

A range of specialists in the laws governing the use of force have disputed the Trump administration’s claim that it can lawfully kill people suspected of drug trafficking like enemy troops instead of arresting them for prosecution. As a matter of domestic law, Congress has not authorized any armed conflict.

As a matter of international law, for a nonstate group to qualify as a belligerent in an armed conflict — meaning its members can be targeted for killing based on their status alone, not because of anything they specifically do — it must be an “organized armed group,” with a centralized command structure, and engaging in hostilities.

Admiral Holsey, who is Black, becomes the latest in a line of at least two dozen military leaders, many of them people of color and women, who have left their jobs this year. Most have been fired by Mr. Hegseth or pushed out.

Mr. Hegseth fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., who is Black; the first woman to command the Navy, Adm. Lisa Franchetti; and the U.S. military’s representative to the NATO military committee, Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield. Mr. Hegseth also pushed out Lt. Gen. Jeffrey A. Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency.

Admiral Holsey’s abrupt end to leading one of the military’s highly coveted regional war-fighting commands comes after a Navy career that started with his commissioning through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps, or NROTC, at Morehouse College in Atlanta in 1988.

The admiral, a native of Fort Valley, Ga., worked his way up from commanding helicopter squadrons to leading one of the Navy’s prestigious aircraft carrier strike groups. He served first as the Southern Command’s military deputy before taking command in November 2024.

“No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever — not President Trump, not President Biden, and not anyone else,” the suit states. “And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.”

The White House has maintained that the grounds are exempt from the National Historical Preservation Act, but lawyers for the National Trust for Historic Preservation, an organization chartered by Congress to preserve America’s historic buildings, argue Mr. Trump is violating other sections of U.S. Code.

The suit points to a section of federal law that states, “A building or structure shall not be erected on any reservation, park or public grounds of the federal government in the District of Columbia without express authority of Congress.”

The suit argues that the way Mr. Trump has proceeded with the project has also violated the National Capital Planning Act, law governing the Commission of Fine Arts, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.

The suit argues that Mr. Trump was required to submit plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress before demolishing the East Wing. And it says he must follow the legal process before continuing any work on the property.

Mr. Trump surprised many in October when he abruptly tore down one side of the White House, demolishing the entire East Wing to make way for his 90,000-square-foot ballroom. Mr. Trump has told people working on the project that he does not need to follow permitting, zoning or code requirements because the structure is on White House grounds and he has the final say.

A White House spokesman said in a statement that Mr. Trump had authority to make changes on the property as he saw fit.

“President Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate and beautify the White House — just like all of his predecessors did,” said the spokesman, Davis Ingle.

The suit argues that Mr. Trump’s conduct around the ballroom project is out of step with tradition and even actions he took during his first term, when his administration sought approval for new fencing and a new tennis pavilion.

The National Trust took several steps before filing the suit, including writing a letter to the administration that urged a pause in the demolition of the East Wing until plans for the proposed ballroom went through a public review process.

But the National Trust received no response to its letter.

“It wasn’t step one,” Carol Quillen, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said of the decision to sue. “It was our last option. Construction appears to be ongoing. What is happening now at the White House could foreclose a meaningful review. It could determine in advance of the review what the project footprint is, making the review moot. So we felt we had no choice.”

Democrats provided no context for the images they released, including any email messages that might have accompanied them. They also redacted faces of women in some of the photos, which they said was an effort to protect the identities of any potential victims of Mr. Epstein.

But Democrats argued that it was appropriate to release the photographs ahead of a deadline next Friday for the Justice Department to make public, with significant exceptions, its investigative files about the Epstein case.

Mr. Epstein died by suicide in a federal prison in 2019 while in custody on sex-trafficking charges. Many of the wealthy and famous men who were once in his orbit have faced questions for years about what they knew about his lurid lifestyle and the accusations that he was trafficking girls as young as 14 for sex.

“These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world,” said Representative Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, in a statement. “We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, now.”

A law passed by Congress last month requires the Justice Department to release its files on Mr. Epstein by Dec. 19, though the measure includes several exceptions that could delay or block full disclosure.

The photographs released on Friday were part of a separate trove of information that Mr. Epstein’s estate has turned over to Congress in recent months in response to a subpoena from the oversight panel.

Republicans on the Oversight Committee accused Democrats of selectively releasing the images to fuel a misleading and debunked narrative about Mr. Epstein’s ties to the president. A spokeswoman for the Republicans, who insisted on anonymity because she did not want her name associated with Mr. Epstein, said that nothing in the documents received by the panel showed any wrongdoing.

Most of the images released by Democrats document ties that had already been known. As well as Mr. Clinton and Mr. Trump, they show Mr. Epstein with Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard University economist and former Treasury secretary; the film director Woody Allen; the tech billionaire and philanthropist Bill Gates; and Stephen K. Bannon, the right-wing media personality who has said that he videotaped interviews in Mr. Epstein’s mansion in 2019.

Mr. Bannon and representatives for Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gates, Mr. Summers and Mr. Allen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The selection of images appeared intended at least in part to insulate Democrats from Republicans’ criticism that they have been overly focused on Mr. Epstein’s links to Mr. Trump while ignoring his ties to figures on the left.

The series of photos does include three images of Mr. Trump. One, which was previously public, shows Mr. Epstein and Mr. Trump together at a Victoria’s Secret party in New York City in 1997. Two others depict Mr. Trump with unidentified women, and their locations are not clear. One of them, in black-and-white, shows Mr. Trump standing with six unidentified women wearing plastic leis.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, accused House Democrats of “random redactions” to perpetuate a “Democrat hoax.” Mr. Trump used that phrase earlier this year as he dismissed calls to release the Epstein files, before Congress forced the issue with a law.

Ms. Jackson, pointing to ties between Mr. Epstein and Democratic figures, asserted that “the Trump administration has done more for Epstein’s victims than Democrats ever have by repeatedly calling for transparency, releasing thousands of pages of documents, and calling for further investigations into Epstein’s Democrat friends.”

Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he and Mr. Epstein were once friendly, and both men lived in Manhattan and in Palm Beach, Fla. But he has repeatedly and emphatically denied any knowledge of Mr. Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation, and the two men had a falling-out sometime in the mid-2000s.

In emails previously released by the Oversight Committee, Mr. Epstein cast himself as an insider with potentially damaging information about Mr. Trump. After his death, Mr. Epstein was at the center of theories that he might be running a blackmail operation, but the Justice Department concluded in July that there was no credible evidence that “Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”

Some of the other photos show sex toys. One depicts a satirical “Trump condom” that also appears to be part of the Smithsonian Institution’s collection.

In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said he had spoken by phone with Mr. Anutin, and Cambodia’s leader, Hun Manet. The discussion with Mr. Hun Manet was not immediately confirmed by Cambodian officials, although the government’s spokesman had said they were hoping to talk with him.

Mr. Trump said the two leaders had agreed to return to the terms of the peace agreement that they signed in October. Five days of resumed fighting this week has killed at least 20 people and displaced more than half a million.

“Both Countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America,” Mr. Trump wrote. “It is my Honor to work with Anutin and Hun in resolving what could have evolved into a major War between two otherwise wonderful and prosperous Countries!”

It was unclear if Mr. Trump’s intervention this time would lead to a genuine breakthrough. The decades-long territorial dispute stems from a map drawn by colonial France. Just over six weeks ago, Mr. Anutin and Mr. Hun Manet signed the peace deal in Malaysia, with Mr. Trump in attendance. But the pact was always tenuous, and it unraveled quickly.

Tensions boiled over on Monday, when Thailand launched airstrikes against Cambodia in retaliation for what it said was the killing of one Thai soldier and the wounding of others. Mr. Trump said it was a “roadside bomb” that killed and wounded the Thai troops, describing it as “an accident, but Thailand nevertheless retaliated very strongly.”

For days now, Thailand has carried out air attacks in Cambodia, which has responded with rocket fire.

Mr. Anutin said he told Mr. Trump that Thailand had not violated the peace deal, saying it was necessary for “Thailand to retaliate to protect our nation and our people.” He added, “This is why I had to explain to the president or he might misunderstand and see us as the aggressor.”

Mr. Anutin said he told Mr. Trump to tell Cambodia, “Thailand never wants anything from them, but they have to stop everything first.”

Cambodia has rejected Thailand’s assertions and has said it is collecting evidence against Thailand with the aim of filing a complaint with the International Criminal Court.

Before Mr. Trump’s call, the Thai and Cambodian armies continued their attacks.

Dek Koma, 25, who lives about 10 miles from the site of a clash in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey province, described intense gunfire on Thursday night and shelling that continued well into the night. “The explosions were very strong,” he said. “Before, they didn’t shell much at night.”

Thailand and Cambodia have exchanged fire in years past over their nearly 500-mile-long boundary, large parts of which are undefined. But the scope of the recent fighting has expanded beyond previous clashes.

“I don’t think it would be realistic to hope for breakthroughs at this stage,” said Napon Jatusripitak, director of the Center for Politics and Geopolitics at Thailand Future, a Bangkok-based research institution. The conflict is at a “level that we have not seen in history.”

The number of people displaced in Cambodia and Thailand has now exceeded those displaced in fighting over the summer.

Li Nam, 38, said the Cambodian authorities ordered him to leave his house in Oddar Meanchey province near the border on Thursday night. He had stayed when the fighting broke out on Monday to look after his wooden house, seven pigs, dozens of chickens and grocery store.

On Thursday night, after his village chief told him that his area was a “red zone,” he slept in the fields.

On Thursday night, Mr. Anutin — who only assumed office in September, after agreeing to early elections — dissolved Parliament sooner than expected, setting the stage for elections in January or February.

The previous prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was suspended in July after a leaked call with the Cambodian strongman Hun Sen, father of the current prime minister, over the border dispute in which she appeared to be overly deferential.

The political horse-trading after her ouster all but ensured an election in the first half of 2026, instead of 2027 as originally scheduled.

Now, with new elections imminent, Mr. Anutin, as a caretaker prime minister, is expected to try to capitalize on the nationalist mood around the country to boost his reputation and the standing of his party, Bhumjaithai, which is close to Thailand’s powerful military.

Sun Narin contributed reporting from Banteay Meanchey Province in Cambodia and Kittiphum Sringammuang from Bangkok.

Mr. Trump, who continues to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him, has embarked on a wide-ranging campaign to settle scores related to his effort to overturn the race. On the first day of his second term, he issued a sweeping grant of clemency to nearly all 1,600 people charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

But the president has no power to pardon state crimes. Mr. Trump could not, for example, pardon himself for the 34 felony convictions handed down in a New York trial last year. Because Ms. Peters is in prison for a state offense, Mr. Trump’s announcement on Thursday was primarily symbolic.

“Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers for state crimes in a state court,” Jena Griswold, the Colorado secretary of state, said in a statement on Thursday. “Trump has no constitutional authority to pardon her. His assault is not just on our democracy, but on states’ rights and the American constitution.”

While Mr. Trump’s declaration had little practical effect for Ms. Peters, it was a reminder that the president has used his expansive legal powers to reward and protect his allies, even as his Justice Department has shattered traditional norms of independence by following his orders to pursue criminal cases against perceived enemies.

In just the last few weeks, Mr. Trump pardoned Representative Henry Cuellar, Democrat of Texas, apparently believing that he would defect to the Republican Party. He also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras, who was prosecuted during the first Trump administration for leading a drug-trafficking conspiracy.

In one particularly strange case, Mr. Trump pardoned a real estate developer who had been indicted by his own Justice Department earlier this year.

In many ways, Mr. Trump’s promise to grant clemency to Ms. Peters echoed his announcement last month that he was pardoning his former lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and a wide array of others accused of trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, even though none of them had been accused of federal crimes.

Mr. Trump’s social media post on Thursday about Ms. Peters followed an expansive effort by her allies to persuade him that he needed to help her. Led by the lawyer Peter Ticktin, a longtime friend and ally of Mr. Trump’s, Ms. Peters’ supporters have sought to convince the president that she is an important potential witness in an investigation to prove false claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him.

Over the weekend, Mr. Ticktin sent Mr. Trump a nine-page letter asking him to pardon Ms. Peters, while admitting that the “question of whether a president can pardon for state offenses has never been raised in any court.”

In his letter, Mr. Ticktin cast Ms. Peters as the victim of a cabal of enemies that included Dominion Voting Systems, the voting machine company, and the Venezuelan government, which he claimed had sought to use digital vote counting technology to rig American elections.

Mr. Trump’s announcement was not the first time his administration had tried to help Ms. Peters.

In March, the Justice Department intervened in her efforts to ask a federal judge to release her from prison, saying there were “reasonable concerns” about the length of her state sentence. The department said that a review of her case was needed as part of a broader examination of cases “across the nation for abuses of the criminal justice process.”

On Monday, however, a federal judge in Denver turned down her request to be freed, finding that state courts, not federal courts, should determine her fate.

The same day, in what appeared to be another attempt to pressure Colorado state officials, the Justice Department announced that it was opening a civil investigation into the state’s prison system. Days earlier on social media, Mr. Trump had attacked Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, a Democrat, as a “sleazebag” for failing to release Ms. Peters on his own accord, claiming she had been “unfairly convicted.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/12/multimedia/12trump-news-promo330p-lmgf/12trump-news-promo330p-lmgf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:58:44.835930

Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-Rhode Island, invited Sae Joon Park, a Purple Heart recipient who self-deported earlier this year due to a removal order, to join the House Committee on Homeland Security hearing through a video call on Zoom. During the five minutes he had allotted to question Noem, Magaziner asked the secretary how many military veterans have been deported.

""Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans,"" Noem responded.

Magaziner went on to introduce Park, a U.S. Army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving in Panama in 1989. Park came to the U.S. at the age of 7 from South Korea. In the 1990s, Park had a drug addiction and was arrested for minor drug offenses, Magazine said.

Park, who battled a crack cocaine addiction, was charged with possession of a controlled substance and bail jumping, according to NPR. As a Green Card holder, those charges hurt his chances to become naturalized, the outlet reported.

""Will you join me in thanking Mr. Park for his service to our country?"" Magaziner asked Noem, with a tablet being held next to the congressman’s head that had Park video-called in.

""Sir, I’m grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws and knows that our laws are important and that every one of them needs to be enforced,"" Noem responded.

When asked whether Noem would review Park’s case, the secretary said she ""will absolutely look at his case.""

Throughout the hearing, Democrats chastised Noem and her department’s immigration enforcement efforts, including the secretary’s decision to continue deportation flights to El Salvador despite a court order halting the flights earlier this year. Protestors interrupted her opening remarks, chanting ""Stop ICE raids,"" ""end deportations,"" and ""get ICE off our streets."" Noem, who left the hearing early to attend a FEMA review advisory council meeting that was later canceled, was met with more protestors outside the hearing room.

Noem’s time with the Trump administration has been called into question following a report from MS NOW where a White House official said Noem was on ""very thin ice"" and that she would be replaced as early as January. President Donald Trump on Dec. 10 said that he was ""happy"" with Noem and that she’s ""fantastic.""

""We have a border that's the best border in the history of our country. Why would I be unhappy?"" Trump told reporters during a roundtable with business leaders at the White House.

Noem remained defiant throughout the hearing as Democrats lambasted the secretary as a ""liar"" and Republicans offered her praise for her job.

""America is very happy that, finally, they have a president in the White House that gets up every day to keep them safe,"" Noem said during the hearing.

Several Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, the ranking chairman of the House Homeland Security committee, called on Noem to resign.

When asked by Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Michigan, whether she would resign if she’s not fired, Noem said: ""I will consider your asking me to resign as an endorsement of my work.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/USAT/87720242007-2250628277.jpg?crop=8087,4549,x0,y421&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-12 18:57:55.328031

Reality check: Neither Noem nor Homan are going anywhere, according to administration officials inside and outside the White House.
But by the summer he'd shifted, at least on paper, to be a White House employee, according to public records.
One source close to the White House said that ""Tom's putting his head down.
The big picture: For months, Washington's chattering class has been predicting a shakeup in Trump's White House, partly because of the huge turnover in his first administration.","The acrimony is so deep between President Trump's border czar and his homeland security secretary that the two officials barely speak to or meet with each other, insiders tell Axios.

Why it matters: Tensions reached such a fever pitch last week that the White House was swamped with rumors and news stories claiming that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had lost Trump's favor and was on her way out.

Noem's backers blamed the whisper campaign on supporters of her administration rival, border czar Tom Homan.

Homan's partisans deny any involvement.

Reality check: Neither Noem nor Homan are going anywhere, according to administration officials inside and outside the White House. Trump has shown no signs of wanting a change.

""Kristi's doing a great job,"" Trump, unprompted, recently told an adviser who relayed the conversation to Axios.

""Her and Tom don't get along,"" the president chuckled, the source said. ""But they're doing great.""

The adviser said Trump doesn't mind the conflict: ""Trump is like that. He kind of likes people competing against each other. He thinks it makes the product better.""

Zoom in: The exact cause of the tensions between Noem and Homan isn't clear, but sources say the conflict — months in the making — is a personality clash at the very least.

Supporters of both officials accuse the other of contracting irregularities, which each side denies. Noem's Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has more than $170 billion from Congress to spend on catching, detaining and deporting what the White House hopes will be millions of unauthorized immigrants.

Noem, a former South Dakota governor, has spent millions of department dollars on a controversial campaign-style ad blitz that some insiders believe promotes her as much as the department's mission.

That rankles career immigration officials, many of whom are loyal to Homan, a 30-year immigration-enforcement vet.

Insiders have personally complained to Trump about Noem's management and the role of her top adviser, Trump campaign veteran Corey Lewandowski, who in effect runs DHS, the sources said.

Meanwhile, Homan's appearances on Fox News have led Noem's supporters to cast him as a self-promoter without portfolio.

Two DHS sources said Homan's media hits aren't coordinated with the department's press office and that he sometimes makes policy proclamations that catch officials off guard, irritating Noem's senior staff.

""Tom expected to have more operational control of day to day, and especially on contracts,"" one agency official said.

""It's disappointing that he chooses to go after Secretary Noem when he is unhappy that he does not have 'The Tom Homan Show' to be a part of.""

Homan also has been dogged by allegations of misconduct and conflicts of interest. An MS NOW report in September rapped him for being under FBI investigation in 2024 for allegedly taking a $50,000 cash payoff in a now-closed bribery probe.

The intrigue: When he began working for the administration, Homan filed his personal financial disclosure form with DHS and worked some days out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) headquarters in D.C.

But by the summer he'd shifted, at least on paper, to be a White House employee, according to public records. A White House official said the move was not related to tensions with Noem and was planned all along.

One source close to the White House said that ""Tom's putting his head down. He's like, 'You know, this isn't worth it. I'm going to go do my job that the president has authorized me to do.' And that's what he's doing.""

The big picture: For months, Washington's chattering class has been predicting a shakeup in Trump's White House, partly because of the huge turnover in his first administration. But Trump advisers say he likes his team of loyalists this time and hasn't expressed interest in firing anyone.

""He's happy with his Cabinet,"" said another Trump adviser who is no fan of Noem. ""Do I wish Kristi was gone? Absolutely. But that ain't happening. At least, not that he'll tell me.""

What they're saying: Despite the personality clash, record deportations and aggressive immigration enforcement proceed apace. And Trump is thrilled, even as his immigration crackdown has angered many Americans and appears to be weighing on his poll numbers.

DHS referred requests for comment to the White House.

""President Trump has assembled the most talented and capable Cabinet in American history, which includes Secretary Noem who is doing a great job implementing the president's agenda and making America safe again,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.

""The president's entire immigration enforcement team — which includes Tom Homan and his critical contributions to the border security effort ... is working in lockstep to implement the agenda President Trump was elected to enact.""",https://images.axios.com/Huciq8hvKCDAgR5P8Ydr9I7M9sM=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/12/10/1765401770806.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:57:32.415305

Charges were brought against illegal aliens with past convictions for violent crimes and DWIs, as well as alleged human smugglers and aliens with prior removals.

Francisco Javier Navarro-Ramirez, a Legal Permanent Resident born in Mexico, was arrested near Tornillo and charged with human smuggling. A criminal complaint alleges Navarro-Ramirez was the driver of a vehicle travelling at high speeds with multiple individuals inside. Navarro-Ramirez allegedly did not yield to U.S. Border Patrol emergency lights and was eventually stopped by a tire deflation device deployed by a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper. The complaint alleges that Navarro-Ramirez was quickly apprehended after he attempted to flee on foot, and five illegal aliens were found inside the vehicle.

A Salvadoran national was arrested by USBP agents near Maverick for being illegally present in the U.S. Douglas Alexis Bautista-Arevalo was removed to El Salvador for the second time on Sept. 4 and has been previously convicted for two DWIs. In March, he was convicted for assault causing bodily injury to a family member.

In Austin, Mexican nationals Juan David Barajas-Armas and Noe Mendez-Salazar were each charged with illegal re-entry. Barajas-Armas has two prior removals and has been convicted of three DWIs and obstructing a highway/passageway. Mendez-Salazar has also been removed twice before and has three DWI convictions.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this year’s massive $900 billion military spending bill.

This legislation gives more money to the so-called Department of War than to our Departments of Education, Transportation, and Health and Human Services, combined.

Mr. Speaker, can you ask my Republican colleagues to get serious about helping the American public?

It is certainly poor character to be not support our military service members and their families, and this mammoth bill does not do that.

Certainly, it is poor character to block health care coverage for IVF, despite the fact that IVF is critical for helping active-duty personnel grow their families.

Certainly, it is poor character to ban initiatives associated with Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, even though these cuts will undermine military readiness.

This bill, this mammoth bill, expands the administration’s power to attack immigrants, including for our Haitian neighbors.

The few good things in this legislation do not outweigh the cruelty and the harm that will undoubtedly come if it is signed into law.

The public does not support this bill, and neither do I, and that is why I am a NO vote.

***

A Mexican man visiting family in Arizona for the holidays was detained and kept in immigration detention for almost three days — despite having proper documents and legal authority to be in the country, two of his family members told Phoenix New Times. He has since been released, the family said, though immigration authorities have not returned the documents that allow him to be in the U.S.

On Tuesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 27-year-old Edwar Omar Mezquita Gonzalez in San Tan Valley after Pinal County Sheriff’s deputies stopped the truck his brother was driving. The brother, whose name New Times is withholding at the family’s request, was not detained and has a green card.

ICE acknowledged an email seeking information about Gonzalez’s arrest, but has not responded substantively.

On Tuesday morning, Gonzalez was riding shotgun in his older brother’s white GMC Sierra truck when they drove by a half-dozen police vehicles lining the side of the road. The pair gawked at the police activity as they passed, according to family members, and Gonzalez pulled out his phone to film as ICE agents and sheriff’s deputies detained a landscaper.

According to two family members — the brother’s wife, who asked to be identified by her nickname, Vale; and Sam Cooley, an extended family member and an immigration activist — a Pinal County Sheriff vehicle then pulled out of the line and stopped the brother’s truck. A sheriff’s deputy told the brother he was pulled over for obscured plates and improper window tint, Vale said. While the deputy spoke to the brother, an ICE agent in another vehicle pulled in right behind them.

The ICE agent asked both men to present their documents. The brother presented his green card while Gonzalez presented a temporary travel visa for Mexican citizens. Vale said the ICE agent then claimed that Gonzalez was working in violation of his visa and detained him, though Vale claimed he was obeying the visa’s terms.

“My husband tried to explain to them, ‘He’s my little brother. He’s only here visiting,’” Vale told New Times. “You guys can’t take him. He has all this documentation.”

‘In a work vehicle’

New Times has viewed Gonzalez’s documentation. In August, he applied for and received a Border Crossing Card, which is issued to Mexican nationals with strong ties to Mexico, indicating they plan to return to their home country. The card allows Mexican nationals to make short visits for temporary pleasure or business to the U.S. border zone — which extends from the border to a little north of Tucson — for up to 30 days if they enter by land or sea.

New Times has viewed a photo of the card issued to Gonzalez, who lives and works in Rocky Point (also known as Puerto Peñasco) in Mexico.

If Border Crossing Card holders wish to stay longer and travel further, they must complete the Form I-94 upon entry into the U.S. Gonzalez did that when he entered the country in September, according to an online portal on the Customs and Border Protection website. The form allows Border Crossing Card holders to travel anywhere in the country and stay for up to six months, which would cap Gonzalez’s stay at the end of March. However, if cardholders seek employment during their stay, they may face revocation of the document, deportation and may even be barred from future U.S. entry.

According to Vale, her husband was off that day and he was running errands with Gonzalez while the latter was in town for an extended holiday stay. They had just grabbed coffee and were in San Tan Valley to drop off a broken paint machine before getting breakfast.

However, immigration attorneys not involved in Gonzalez’s case speculated ICE may have claimed he was working due to the circumstances of his arrest. While the brothers insisted Gonzalez wasn’t working, the ICE agent said he was in a “work area in a work vehicle,” Vale said. The brother’s truck is outfitted with ladders on racks above the trunk. While the brother does use it for construction jobs, Vale said, he also uses it to run errands and pick up his kids.

However, being stopped in what is ostensibly a work truck could have made it difficult for Gonzalez to claim he wasn’t working, according to immigration attorney Salvador Macias. “The hardest part is overcoming the allegation that he wasn’t working, considering he was in the truck,” Macias wrote in a text message. Delia Salvatierra, another immigration attorney, noted that “visitors visas are non-immigrant visas, so you have to show non-immigrant intent.”

Gonzalez’s arrest also appears to be an example of Pinal County’s new effort to coordinate with ICE. The Pinal County Sheriff’s Office has had ICE in its jails since 2008 through a 287(g) agreement and the county attorney’s office was recently granted 287(g) authority to conduct limited enforcement of immigration law under the auspices of ICE. The truck’s allegedly obscured plate and allegedly overly tinted windows — which Vale said she doubts were in the state the sheriff deputy claimed — gave the deputy an opening to stop the truck and cleared the way for ICE to ask for documents.

In a statement to New Times, Pinal County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Samuel Salzwedel said agents from Homeland Security Investigations — a division of ICE – “are frequently in San Tan Valley and available to assist deputies when contacted.”

‘He has no information’

Gonzalez’s brother was allowed to leave. Before he did, he wrote his phone number on Gonzalez’s arm.

Gonzalez was transported to ICE’s Phoenix field office, nearly 50 miles away, where he was held until being released late Thursday night. Gonzalez has been able to call his brother multiple times using a payphone in the field office. New Times has attempted to get in touch with Gonzalez, but Vale said the only person he was able to call was his brother. While he was detained, Vale spoke to him through her husband’s phone.

Cooley said Gonzalez was “miserable” in ICE custody. Vale said he also struggled to get information from guards at the field office about the status of his detention and was told that he just had to wait his turn to talk to an immigration officer. Cooley said Gonazlez was ultimately able to speak to one.

While he was detained, Gonzalez’s family tried to speak with ICE employees at the field office but were not given much information. Family members also reached out to the office of Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton, whose constituent services team assisted in the case, according to his spokesperson. It’s not clear if Stanton’s intervention played a role in Gonzalez’s release.

Now that he has been released, Cooley said Gonzalez is strongly considering self-deporting and returning to Mexico, but he is unable to do so without his documents. In addition to keeping Gonzalez’s Border Crossing Card, Cooley said, ICE also confiscated his Mexican voter registration and driver’s license.

Gonzalez has no children, but he takes care of all of the large, tight-knit family around him, Cooley said. In Rocky Point, Gonzalez cares for both of his parent and his grandmother. He also frequently visits his brother, sister-in-law, nieces and nephews in Mesa and also has family in Phoenix and Colorado. He comes up to the Phoenix area multiple times a year from Mexico to celebrate holidays, birthdays and special events, Cooley said.",https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/12/Edwar-Gonzalez.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 16:59:14.289858

The Mexican immigrant was at the USCIS office with his wife for an interview as part of the green card process.
Now in his early 20s, he recently married a U.S. citizen and sought to adjust his immigration status.
“When people go in for a green card interview, it’s because they’ve complied with everything else and they’re at the end of the line.
Her client married a U.S. citizen and was eligible to apply for a green card.","A British mother holding an infant, a Ukrainian refugee, the wife of a Navy veteran, a German man about to celebrate his first wedding anniversary. These are some of the spouses of U.S. citizens who were recently detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at what they thought were going to be routine green card interviews.

There have been several dozen known cases out of San Diego alone, but cases have also been reported in New York City, Cleveland and Utah, according to attorneys and local news reports.

Immigration attorneys told NBC News that this marks an “unprecedented” break in decadeslong practice policy, and that their clients are panicked they could be detained even when they are eligible to become legal permanent residents by law and have no criminal histories.

Jan Joseph Bejar, an immigration attorney in San Diego who recently had a client detained, said if the arrests spread around the country, “It’d be huge. It would be really devastating.”

The detentions are one of the latest tactics in President Donald Trump’s policies targeting legal pathways for immigration and increasing scrutiny of green card applicants.

The Trump administration has said in multiple cases that people were detained because they had fallen out of status by overstaying their visas, but longtime attorneys say this has never been an issue and spouses of U.S. citizens looking to obtain green cards were granted exceptions by Congress. The law says that immediate relatives, such as spouses, of U.S. citizens are eligible for green cards even if they were in unlawful immigration status at the time they filed to become legal permanent residents.

“There was a carve-out that was intended for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, including spouses. This was or is the legal path for them to adjust their status. This is going about doing things ‘the right way,’” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute.

She added that because it can take well over a year to go through the entire process, people “could very easily fall out of status right in the process of waiting for that green card through their marriage.”

The British woman was released almost a week later and her green card approved, according to NBC San Diego. The Navy veteran’s wife was released on bond, according to the outlet, and must now pursue her case in immigration court. The status of the German man and the Ukrainian refugee are currently unclear. All four had fallen out of status because of visa overstays but were still eligible to become green card holders, according to their attorneys.

Attorneys said the exact number of people affected would be difficult to quantify, but all said many spouses of U.S. citizens seeking green cards could fall into the category of overstaying their visas. There are currently at least hundreds of thousands of people who are at some stage of the green card application process, according to United States Citizenship and Immigration Service data.

Once a green card applicant is detained by ICE, their case goes through the immigration court system, where a prosecutor will argue against the applicant receiving legal status, Bejar said. Because of the yearslong backlog that immigration courts are facing, this will extend valid green card applicants’ cases and come at a cost to taxpayers, he said.

USCIS spokesman Matthew J. Tragesser said in a statement to NBC News that apprehensions at its offices “may occur if individuals are identified as having outstanding warrants; being subject to court-issued removal orders; or having committed fraud, crimes, or other violations of immigration law while in the United States.”

“The Trump administration has been abundantly clear: aliens must respect our laws or face the consequences,” he said. “Overstaying a visa is an immigration law violation that can result in deportation.”

ICE said in a statement to NBC San Diego in late November that the agency “is committed to enforcing federal immigration laws through targeted operations that prioritize national security, public safety, and border security.”

“Individuals unlawfully present in the United States, including those out of status at federal sites such as USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal in accordance with U.S. immigration law,” its statement said.

Bejar said he had a client married to a U.S. citizen who was detained at a San Diego USCIS office two days before Thanksgiving.

The Mexican immigrant was at the USCIS office with his wife for an interview as part of the green card process. Bejar said the interview had been going well and the officer said he would approve the first part of the couple’s petition. Then ICE agents came and took his client away.

The attorney said his client was brought from Mexico as a young teenager and his parents had overstayed their visa. Now in his early 20s, he recently married a U.S. citizen and sought to adjust his immigration status. As the immediate relative of a U.S. citizen who does not have a criminal record, the man was still eligible for a green card even if he overstayed his visa, according to his attorney.

“When people go in for a green card interview, it’s because they’ve complied with everything else and they’re at the end of the line. In other words, you’re almost there. You’ve gone through the sacrifices of paying for the government fees, for your legal fees,” Bejar said.

Bejar said he and other attorneys have been going through their cases to warn applicants in the San Diego area, but their options are limited.

“While there’s nothing in particular that says ICE can’t detain them during that time, it’s always been viewed as a waste of resources, because they are eligible for the benefit of a green card,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, the senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “Why would you waste enforcement resources or detention resources on those individuals?”

“Instead of actually picking up violent criminals, like they say they’re doing, they’re picking up people who are following the rules that have been in place for decades,” she said.

Courtney Koski, a senior attorney with the Costas Law Firm in the Cleveland, Ohio, area, said she and other attorneys in the Cleveland area have noticed a change in USCIS agents where they are “finding officers scrutinizing and nitpicking every aspect of the case, looking for reasons to deny.”

Koski said she recently had a client detained at an interview Nov. 24 as part of the spousal petition process, the step before applying for a green card, even though she was eligible for the benefit and had no criminal history.

The Mexican woman had been in the U.S. for 25 years. Koski said her client had a removal order connected to what she called “a government mistake” where a court scheduled an immigration hearing for the client’s family in July 2004 and then “rescheduled their hearing for April of 2004 without sending my client any type of notice whatsoever.”

“This is the reason why my client has a removal order, because the government made a mistake and did not notify her of her hearing date,” she said. NBC News could not independently verify the circumstances related to the hearing date.

Her client married a U.S. citizen and was eligible to apply for a green card. Koski said she planned to file to reopen her client’s case once the spousal petition was approved since the approval could help strengthen their case.

“Under the previous administration, people who were being detained generally were considered a threat to national security or threat to public safety, so someone with no criminal history would not have been expected to be detained in an interview like this,” she said.

Jeremy Lawer, 33, the woman’s husband, said “the interview was going pretty well, and ICE agents came anyway. We were incredibly shocked.”

“She was understandably nervous. But you know, I was like there’s no reason they’re going to deny us. We’ve been living together. We bought a house together,” he said.

Lawer said he feels he and his wife have been caught in the “political football” under the Trump administration.

The same day that his wife was detained, he got a letter saying the spousal petition was approved.

Koski has filed to reopen the case and, in the meantime, her client has been moved around to multiple detention centers.

“From my perspective, this all feels kind of like a setup,” Lawer said. “Like they had always been intending to arrest her that day.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-02/240220-office-of-US-Citizenship-and-Immigration-Services-ew-126p-7182a5.jpg",N,,2025-12-12 21:57:25.846126

Holy Land’s employees, who include immigrants from Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, are also concerned about what to do if they are inadvertently detained.","The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown is disrupting Twin Cities businesses where immigrants buy groceries, get haircuts or find community.

The operation by Immigration & Customs Enforcement has centered on Minnesota’s Somali community, but the fear that it has triggered — of deportation or wrongful detention — has extended to many immigrant communities.

That’s caused staffing challenges and a drop in foot traffic for businesses along Central Avenue in Northeast Minneapolis, which has long been a hub for businesses run by and serving Minnesotans with heritage from South Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

“What’s happening is definitely making people feel unsafe. … They are worried, whether they are documented or not, for themselves and for their families,” said Majdi Wadi, CEO of Holy Land, a large grocer and restaurant offering Middle Eastern and Mediterranean products for almost four decades.

Five blocks south at the Yemeni coffee shop Qahwah House, employee Hassan Al Urduni estimated that business this week was down about 20% compared to last week.

“Obviously we don’t just serve only one nationality here,” Al Urduni said, “but those who really had the place buzzing, who would stay and chat and order coffee after coffee, those were usually immigrants or children of immigrants looking for a taste of the qahwa they used to drink back in their countries or that their mothers would make in their homes in Minnesota,” he said, using the Arabic word for the uniquely thick, sweet, black coffee popular in the Middle East, as well as in East and North Africa.

Other nearby businesses reported similar drops in traffic, including a storefront that helps immigrants send money to relatives overseas, particularly in Latin America, and a barbershop whose owner was grateful for its diverse clientele.

“Thank God, our customers come from all over. We are popular with Black Americans, white Americans, immigrants, all kinds of people,” said Salam Barbershop owner Abdellah El Bal. “So, God willing, things will ease back to normal soon.”

“But one thing which is unusual, is that our Latino friends seem to have completely disappeared from our shop,” El Bal said. “It’s almost like they’ve dropped off the face of the Earth.”

Elsewhere in the city, some businesses, especially in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, have closed down entirely out of fear that they or their employees will be targeted, said state Sen. Doron Clark, DFL-Minneapolis.

Clark’s district includes Northeast Minneapolis and he has been involved in connecting immigrants across the metro area to legal resources as well as members of Minnesota’s congressional delegation, specifically Rep. Ilhan Omar, DFL-5th District, and Sens. Tina Smith, DFL-Minn., and Amy Klobuchar, DFL-Minn.

“My personal cell phone is constantly receiving texts from constituents who want to know what their rights are, what their family’s rights are, how they can help their neighbors,” he said, adding that he is in regular contact with state Rep. Mohamud Noor, DFL-Minneapolis, who represents the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, about how best to help concerned Minnesotans.

Related: How are St. Paul and Minneapolis schools preparing for possible ICE raids?

Clark has fielded calls from many businesses on how to educate employees and was dismayed that owners feel they have to spend time teaching workers about laws that immigration agents should already be following and making clear to those they detain.

“Instead of doing work out in the community, businesses are having to take time away from their core business to educate their legally permitted employees on their rights,” Clark said.

Clark also pointed to non-immigrant businesses stepping up to bring attention to the plight of immigrant-owned businesses, highlighting the efforts of Recovery Bikes to organize a gathering outside of Holy Land last Sunday.

“[Holy Land] has shared that their foot traffic is down as well, and so it was an attempt to get people to gather and shop there,” Clark said.

The specter of a lengthy detention

A common theme was that even those who are not in direct threat of being deported feared being detained for lengthy periods of time, depriving them of needed wages and putting them in potential legal jeopardy.

Wadi of Holy Land, who is also an American citizen, echoed these concerns for himself and his workers. He said he doesn’t carry his passport with him, but after hearing rumors of people being detained for two or three weeks, he is wondering if he should. At the same time, the idea of being forced to carry proof of citizenship feels antithetical to the idea of being in a country where all citizens are treated equally.

“I’m not sure, to be honest, what ICE procedures are to decide who to detain. Is it by your accent or by the look of your skin or by the clothes you’re wearing?” he said.

He highlighted his concerns for his 85-year-old mother, who often walks around the neighborhood. That never used to be a cause for concern, but suddenly, her daily walks fill him with apprehension.

“People fear because they don’t know who will knock on their door tomorrow and if those who knock will follow the rules that we expect in the United States, which we believe is a free country of laws,” Wadi said.

Holy Land’s employees, who include immigrants from Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, are also concerned about what to do if they are inadvertently detained. Wadi has heard stories from them about relatives who went through similar situations in Chicago, another target of the federal government’s immigration crackdown.

To mitigate some of their concerns, Holy Land has held all-staff meetings to explain to employees what their rights are and what to do in case they are harassed or detained.

Holy Land has also gone a step further and hired an immigration law firm that employees and their families can call at any time for legal help or guidance if they run into trouble with immigration authorities.

Wadi repeatedly emphasized that he is not opposed to immigration enforcement in principle. Like many other Americans, according to polls, he does not want undocumented violent criminals to be able to roam the streets.

“But there are many ways that we can implement this procedure without hurting the general public, without making them concerned or worried. It gives the impression that the good and the bad [immigrants] are the same,” he said.

El Bal, of Salam Barbershop, agreed that there was a general sense of foreboding and isolation in immigrant neighborhoods, despite some efforts by non-immigrant Minnesotans to show solidarity.

“It feels like a cloud hanging over all of us, it doesn’t matter if you have papers or not. And of course we’re used to cloudy weather this time of year,” he said, gesturing to the snow falling outside of his empty barbershop.

“But this time it’s not out there, it’s more in here,” he said, pointing to his chest.",https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICE-OUT-rally-120825-es_8-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 18:57:58.943613

One striking retelling of the Christmas story, at Lake Street church in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, features baby Jesus lying in a manger in the snow – but wrapped in the kind of thin, foil blankets given out in emergencies and regularly as bedding to ICE detainees, and with his wrists zip-tied.

The figure of Mary stands nearby just outside the church, wearing a gas mask, which anti-ICE protesters have been wearing to protect against teargas. She is flanked by figures of Roman soldiers, which the Bible depicts as having detained Jesus prior to his execution, but with those in the display now dressed in tactical vests labeled “ICE.”

At another location in Chicago, Urban Village church, the models of Jesus, Mary and Joseph are nowhere to be seen alongside the camels, donkeys, shepherds and wise men bearing gifts in the traditional nativity scene. Instead, there is a sign that reads: “Due to ICE activity in our community the Holy Family is in hiding.”

The displays are extensions of the prominent role taken in recent protests against the aggressive federal immigration enforcement by faith leaders, especially in Chicago and New York.

Similar political statements are also being made at churches in other states. At St Susanna parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, the tiny figure of Christ was removed from its nativity scene. In its place is a hand-painted sign reading: “ICE was here.”

The Catholic church stood defiant despite complaints from leadership of the local archdiocese and of ICE, local media reported.

According to some people behind the displays, portraying the ancient story of Christ’s birth in a contemporary political frame helps bring attention to the Trump administration’s agenda. They say that the holy family’s status as refugees represents the real fears and experiences of families in their communities, including separation from loved ones and the deportation of working family members leading to a loss of income.

Christmas is a time “when we have public art out on the lawn and we get an opportunity to say something”, Michael Woolf, senior minister at Lake Street, said. He said the Baptist congregation created another nativity scene in a previous year showing Jesus lying in rubble. It was, he said, a “plea for peace” in Gaza.

During the first Trump administration in 2018, parishioners at St Susanna erected a display with baby Jesus constrained in a cage, replicating the president’s policy at the time of separating migrant families and locking up children at the US-Mexico border.

Another year, they depicted Jesus’s body floating in water polluted with plastic in a protest to highlight the climate crisis.

St Susanna is part of a multi-church refugee support committee that has worked with refugee families since 2019, helping many find housing, enroll in school, learn English and secure work.

Meanwhile, back at Evanston’s United Methodist church, the figure of Joseph blew down in a storm and was too damaged to be put back up. A sign reads: “Joseph didn’t make it. We hold this space to honor and remember all the victims of immigration enforcement terror.”

Jillian Westerfield, associate minister of Lake Street church of Evanston, said critics either don’t fully understand the message or “find it really challenging to their conscience and are lashing out at the art rather than engaging with what the actual message is”.

As the Trump administration pushes forward with its goal of removing a million people, the presence of a government-owned deportation fleet represents the most physical manifestation yet of that ambition.","The United States government has quietly taken one of the largest logistical steps in years to expand its immigration enforcement capacity. This expansion reflects the policies of the Trump administration, particularly affecting cases of deportation under ICE. According to a detailed report from The Washington Post, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) signed a contract worth roughly US$140 million to acquire six Boeing 737 aircraft that will be used exclusively for ICE deportation flights.

For the first time, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will operate its own dedicated fleet for large-scale removals, a move that signals how far President Donald Trump is willing to go to fulfill his campaign promise of deporting 1 million people during his term.

The aircraft will be operated by ICE Air Operations, the little-known aviation division within the agency responsible for transporting detained migrants both within the United States and to their home countries. ICE Air has long chartered planes from private companies, but a government-owned fleet elevates the scale, permanence, and efficiency of mass deportations.

The purchase of these planes did not emerge from a new congressional debate. The Post reports that the funding came from money previously approved by Congress through the Republican tax reform package. That legislation set aside an estimated US$170 billion for border and immigration-related initiatives, allowing the administration to rapidly expand detention, processing, and removal capacity without significant new scrutiny.

With this investment, the United States is not only increasing the speed of deportations but also reshaping how the core machinery of enforcement operates. The real debate now centers on whether ICE’s expanded power can be checked by meaningful oversight that prevents abuses, discrimination, and the targeting of vulnerable immigrant communities.

A new deportation fleet marks a turning point in US immigration enforcement

The existence of ICE Air Operations is not widely known among the general public, yet it plays a crucial role in the country’s enforcement system. It is essentially the agency’s flight network, responsible for transporting tens of thousands of migrants each year from detention centers to airports across the country and ultimately to their countries of origin.

These flights often resemble logistical military operations. ICE coordinates with foreign governments, local law enforcement, and airport authorities to move groups of migrants through tightly controlled schedules. Until now, the entire system depended on leasing aircraft from commercial contractors. Owning a fleet allows ICE to operate on its own timetable, expand routes, and deploy flights in response to political priorities rather than availability from private companies.

This structural shift signals a major evolution: Deportation flights will no longer be limited by contracting delays or cost fluctuations. It also suggests that the administration intends to normalize large-scale deportations as a permanent feature of federal immigration policy rather than a temporary response to surges in migration.

The decision arrives at a time when Trump has repeatedly emphasized what he calls a national emergency at the southern border. While much of his rhetoric centers on deterrence — through policies involving asylum restrictions, detention expansion, and cross-border enforcement agreements — the purchase of the Boeing 737s moves beyond deterrence and toward long-term operational readiness. The ability to deport large numbers of people quickly is now a built-in capability, not a theoretical talking point.

Inside ICE’s growing authority and the urgent debate over oversight and abuse prevention

Even with existing laws, ICE already holds significant authority over arrests, detentions, and removals. With a dedicated aircraft fleet, that power takes on an added dimension. Deportation logistics become faster and less dependent on external actors, and the agency gains greater control over who is moved, when, and how.

This raises an important question: What safeguards exist to prevent these new tools from becoming instruments of overreach?

ICE’s authority is rooted in the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the agency to apprehend individuals suspected of violating immigration law, place them in administrative detention, and carry out final orders of removal. However, critics argue that these laws give ICE too much discretion, particularly in determining priorities and deciding whom to detain. When this discretion expands alongside operational capacity, the potential for discriminatory practices grows as well.

Civil rights organizations warn that an enlarged deportation system without proper oversight risks encouraging profiling, accelerated removals without due process, and widespread enforcement sweeps in immigrant communities. To mitigate these risks, oversight mechanisms must become more robust. These include congressional investigations, independent inspectors-general, greater transparency in flight data, and stronger limitations on how ICE selects individuals for enforcement actions.

Some lawmakers have also argued that community-based alternatives and legal counseling programs should play a larger role in ensuring that migrants understand their rights before being placed into removal proceedings. Without these protections, the new fleet could intensify fears among immigrant families and reduce cooperation with local authorities, ultimately harming public safety.

The administration has not yet announced whether it plans to update internal guidelines to adapt to ICE’s expanded capabilities. Officials argue that the same rules and standards will apply, but immigration experts stress that the scale of operations requires proactive planning — not reactive assurances — to prevent abuses.

Human Rights First raises alarms as deportations soar under Trump’s agenda

Human Rights First, a leading human rights advocacy organization, has been vocal about the implications of the administration’s deportation strategy. The group reports that deportations under Trump have already increased by 79%, a figure that reflects not only expanded capacity but also a shift in priorities that targets a broader range of migrants, including those with long-standing ties to the United States.

The organization warns that the increase in removal operations is accompanied by rising concerns about due-process violations, including rushed asylum screenings, inadequate access to legal representation, and inconsistent application of protections for people fleeing violence or persecution. Human Rights First argues that a larger deportation fleet could magnify these problems unless proper oversight is built into every stage of the process.

Their research also highlights the psychological and humanitarian consequences of mass deportation, especially on families and mixed-status households. When enforcement actions escalate, children often face the collateral trauma of losing parents or caregivers, even when those family members have no criminal history and pose no public safety risk.

Human Rights First also stresses that the United States has international obligations under refugee and human rights law. The group fears that rapid-turnaround deportation flights could reduce the time available to evaluate asylum claims thoroughly, increasing the likelihood that genuine refugees will be returned to dangerous situations.

Their overall conclusion is clear: Expanding deportation infrastructure without equally expanding legal safeguards, humanitarian processes, and accountability systems puts immigrant communities at greater risk. They argue that enforcement should not outpace protections, and that the government must treat efficiency and human rights as shared priorities, not competing ones.

The acquisition of six Boeing 737s is more than a budget decision; it is a signal of the United States’ evolving immigration posture. As the Trump administration pushes forward with its goal of removing a million people, the presence of a government-owned deportation fleet represents the most physical manifestation yet of that ambition. What happens next will depend on how ICE uses its new authority, how Congress asserts its oversight powers, and how civil society continues to monitor and challenge any abuses that arise.

In the end, the real question is not only how many people the government can deport, but whether the country can uphold fairness, legality, and human dignity while doing so.",https://colombiaone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICE-Agents-Credit-ICE-Public-Domain.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:59:00.097941

“Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans,” Noem responded when questioned by Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-R.I.).

An aide then held up a tablet showing a Zoom connection with Purple Heart recipient Sae Joon Park in South Korea. The congressman argued that Park had “sacrificed more for this country than most people ever have” and asked Noem if she would investigate Park’s case given her discretion as a cabinet member. Noem pledged to “absolutely look at his case.”

Park, reached in Seoul on Thursday night, said he was skeptical that Noem would follow through on her promise, but said that he had “goosebumps” watching the congressional hearing.

“It was amazing. And then I’m getting tons of phone calls from all my friends back home and everywhere else. I’m so very grateful for everything that happened today,” Park, 56, said, noting that friends told him that a clip of his story appeared on ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” show Thursday night.

The late-night host featured footage of Park’s moment in the congressional hearing in his opening monologue.

“Is anyone OK with this? Seriously, all kidding aside, we deported a veteran with a Purple Heart?” Kimmel said, adding that Republicans “claim to care so much about veterans, but they don’t at all.”

Park legally immigrated to the United States when he was 7, grew up in Koreatown and the San Fernando Valley, and joined the Army after graduating from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks in 1988.

The green card holder was deployed to Panama in 1989 as the U.S. tried to depose the nation’s de facto leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega. Park was shot twice and honorably discharged. Suffering PTSD, he self-medicated with illicit drugs, went to prison after jumping bail on drug possession charges, became sober and raised two children in Hawaii.

Earlier this year, when Park checked in for his annual meeting with federal officials to verify his sobriety and employment, he was given the option of being immediately detained and deported, or wearing an ankle monitor for three weeks as he got his affairs in order before leaving the country for a decade.

At the time, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Park had an “extensive criminal history” and had been given a final removal order, with the option to self-deport.

Park chose to leave the country voluntarily. He initially struggled to acclimate in a nation he hasn’t lived in since he was a child, but said Thursday night that his mental state — and his Korean language skills — have improved.

“It hasn’t been easy. Of course, I miss home like crazy,” he said. “I’m doing the best I can. I’m usually a very positive person, so I feel like everything happens for a reason, and I’m just trying to hang in there until hopefully I make it back home.”

Among Park’s top concerns when he left the United States in June was that his mother, who is 86 and struggling with dementia, would pass away while he couldn’t return to the county. But her lack of awareness about his situation has been somewhat of a strange blessing, Park said.

“She really doesn’t know I’m even here. So every time I talk to her, she’s like, ‘Oh, where are you,’ and I tell her, and she’s like, ‘Oh, when are you coming home? Oh, why are you there?’” Park said. “In a weird way, it’s kind of good because she doesn’t have to worry about me all the time. But at the same time, I would love to be next to her while she’s going through this.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cbe1df7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+112/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F77%2Fab%2F2cde4195493ba2214c752aa501ad%2Fla-me-army-veteran-purple-heart-self-deports002.JPG,N,,2025-12-12 15:57:15.245474

After months of legal battles over the closed facility, the private prison company CoreCivic applied for a permit Dec. 8 with the City of Leavenworth to operate the 1,000-bed facility for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a new contract that would pay the company $4.2 million a month.

The Sisters of Charity's Office of Justice, Peace and Integrity of Creation organized a rally and prayer vigil this summer protesting the firm's planned use of the site.

""When you stand in solidarity with people you love, it's hard not to take action,"" said Ashley Hernandez, organizing and policy coordinator for the office. She also emphasized a need for community activism and advocacy against ICE's no-bid contract with CoreCivic.

ICE has used emergency funding to award no-bid contracts, instead of the usual competitive bidding, with CoreCivic and other private prison companies to run immigrant detention centers amid the Trump administration's increased deportation enforcement.

Hernandez told the National Catholic Reporter that the Sisters of Leavenworth are involved in this issue because it conflicts with their beliefs. She said the facility is not good for the community nor safe for the detainees and employees.

""We do things through the lens of Catholic social teaching — human dignity, responsibility and solidarity. None of those are fulfilled by having an ICE detention facility run by a private prison corporation with a long history of abuse and neglect and stripping people of their civil rights and human dignity within their doors.""

The private prison corporation, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America, stopped housing inmates at the facility in 2021.

It was closed by the U.S. Justice Department after reports of understaffing, injuries, lack of local law enforcement access and repeated sewer system problems. The conditions were documented by the American Civil Liberties Union and also by the Justice Department in a 129-page audit report. Correctional officer vacancies reached a high of 23% and closure of some security posts, according to the report.

The City of Leavenworth sought in its petition to the county district court to allow a special use permit. The petition quotes U.S. District Court Judge Julie A. Robinson, in United States vs. Mathew Clark, who wrote of the earlier operation of the facility: ""The only way I could describe it frankly, what's going on at CoreCivic right now, is 'it's an absolute hell hole.'""

The City of Leavenworth filed a court challenge to require a use permit, and on Nov. 24, U.S. District Court Judge Toby Crouse dismissed a federal lawsuit filed by CoreCivic against the city. Hearings are now scheduled to take place in February.

The city's petition stated that CoreCivic was embroiled in multiple widely publicized scandals resulting from its gross mismanagement of the facility and the ensuing rampant abuse, violence and violations of the constitutional rights of its detainees and staff.""

William Rogers, a former correctional officer at the Leavenworth facility, said he had been assaulted seven times at the facility, which he blamed on a lack of staffing.

He told NCR that inmates were to receive an hour of daily outside recreation which was eliminated sometimes for a week when staff wasn't available. Also on hold were requests for supplies and phone calls. ""Our inaction caused them to take action, and I understood it,"" he said of the violence that resulted.

The ACLU of Kansas issued a statement that ""CoreCivic's severe understaffing and profit-driven shortcuts ensured that stabbings, suicides, and homicides occurred with alarming frequency. Weapons, drugs, and other contraband were a common occurrence. In addition to all of the violence, CoreCivic neglected basic human needs in its Leavenworth facility, restricting food, curtailing or cutting off contact with legal counsel and family, limiting medical care and even basic necessities like showers.""

Similarly, migrants in custody are routinely subject to cruelty, neglect and dehumanization, according to a report from Amnesty International, which cited facilities in Florida, Arizona, Texas and Louisiana. Human Rights Watch reports a lack of food and water, unsanitary conditions and medical neglect at the ICE-run Krome Detention Facility in Florida.

Esmie Tseng, communications director of the ACLU of Kansas, told NCR that the opposition to the detention facility in Leavenworth comes from people of a variety of backgrounds who remember CoreCivic's previous failings and do not want it to operate without accountability.

""The Sisters of Charity have been a consistent voice and serve as a conscience for the rest of the community,"" Tseng said. ""They've given a voice to that human element.""

She also emphasized that the people of Leavenworth will not back away from CoreCivic. As she put it: ""The community has not forgotten what they put this city through.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-12/image1%20KENNY%20ICE.jpg?h=bf44842c&itok=t7qSrxzo,N,,2025-12-12 17:57:49.214072

It can continue on this path of extreme cruelty and systemic abuse, or it can uphold human rights and dignity for all people.","Gabriel Garcia-Aviles was a 56-year-old grandfather with a work permit who’d been living in the U.S. for over 30 years. He was a beloved member of his Southern California community.

This fall, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained Garcia-Aviles and sent him to the Adelanto immigration detention center. He died around a week later, with ICE only informing his family that he was in critical condition once he was on his deathbed.

At the hospital, his daughter Mariel found him “unconscious, intubated,” and with “dried blood on his forehead.” He had “a cut on his tongue and blood on his lips” and “broken teeth and bruising on his body,” according to reporting from L.A. Taco. No clear cause of death was given, leaving his family shattered and still searching for answers.

That’s the second death this year at Adelanto.

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old former DACA recipient from Orange County, lived in the U.S. for nearly 35 years. ICE apprehended him while he was working at a car wash and sent him to Adelanto on August 22. He died a month later of an abscess after reportedly being denied lifesaving medical treatment.

ICE didn’t inform his family that he’d been hospitalized. They only learned of Ayala-Uribe’s death the following day after a police visit.

At least 25 people have died in ICE custody since President Trump returned to office, making 2025 the deadliest year for people in ICE custody since 2004. Over 65,000 others remain detained, also the highest number in years. Immigrants with no criminal record remain the largest group in immigration detention. According to ProPublica, ICE has also detained over 170 U.S. citizens this year.

Adelanto, owned and operated by the GEO Group, is among ICE’s sprawling network of mostly private, for-profit detention facilities notorious for human rights abuses. But it’s hardly alone.

From the Krome Detention Center in Florida to the Karnes County detention facility in Texas, people in ICE custody are routinely subjected to abysmal conditions and medical neglect. The detention population has increased by 50 percent this year, which experts have warned could lead to more deaths.

Rights groups have been issuing warnings like these for years.

In 2024, the ACLU and Physicians for Human Rights examined the deaths of 52 people who died in ICE custody between 2017 to 2021 and concluded that 95 percent of those deaths would have been “preventable or possibly preventable” with appropriate medical care. The researchers also found ICE’s oversight and accountability mechanisms “critically flawed.”

These problems have only worsened as immigration arrests have escalated as part of the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda. Recent U.S. Senate investigations uncovered dozens of cases of medical neglect, insufficient or rotten food, foul water, and pregnant women forced to sleep on the floor in ICE detention facilities this year.

Watchdog groups and lawmakers have found that ICE has repeatedly failed to comply with its own protocols, ignored congressional inquiries, and denied members of Congress entry to facilities, even though they have the authority to conduct unannounced oversight visits.

ICE acts increasingly like a rogue agency, refusing to follow U.S. and international law. Yet the “Big Beautiful Bill” Trump signed this year includes $45 billion for ICE to build new prisons housing adults and children, which all but ensures more abuses and preventable deaths. Meanwhile, private prison companies continue to profit.

It doesn’t have to be this way. More oversight would help safeguard civil and human rights. But ultimately Congress must defund and dismantle ICE, end the unnecessary and inhumane system of immigration detention, and create more legal pathways to citizenship, among other reforms.

Legislation recently introduced by U.S. Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Adam Smith would be a step forward. If passed, it would repeal mandatory detention and phase out privatized detention.

As more families are ripped apart, our nation of immigrants stands at a crossroads. It can continue on this path of extreme cruelty and systemic abuse, or it can uphold human rights and dignity for all people.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3933-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 16:59:04.722427

The ruling was issued by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after a three-judge panel — judges Thomas Kirsch, John Lee and Doris Pryor — heard arguments last week from the ACLU and National Immigrant Justice Center, which represent the plaintiffs, and the federal government.

The hearing stemmed from the federal government’s appeal in a legal battle regarding a 2022 consent decree, which bans warrantless civil immigration arrests in Illinois.

In October, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings extended the three-year consent decree through February after he found that ICE arrested 22 people without a warrant.

Then, in November, Cummings ordered the release of 442 people detained by ICE between June and Oct. 7 who had not been deported and were not deemed a public safety threat, according to court records.

Those 442 people are being reviewed as potential members of a class-action lawsuit alleging they were unlawfully detained without a warrant in violation of the 2022 consent decree.

In last week’s hearing before the federal appeals court, Justice Department lawyers argued Cummings lacked the authority to extend the consent decree or order the blanket release of detainees, contending federal law bars class-wide court intervention in immigration detention.

They also claimed many of those detained were “applicants for admission,” a legal term typically used for people stopped at the border or airport while trying to enter the United States illegally, and who are therefore subject to mandatory detention.

The appeals court in its ruling Thursday partially blocked Cummings’ order requiring the release of the 442 people, ruling the judge went too far by ordering releases without individualized determinations. But the appeals court agreed that Cummings was within his rights to extend the consent decree through February.

The ruling also dealt a setback to the Trump administration, rejecting its interpretation of “applicants for admission,” which the government has used to argue detainees are subject to mandatory detention even when they would otherwise be eligible for release.

In a written decision, the judges said immigration law has long drawn a distinction between people seeking to enter the United States and those arrested inside the country, adding that people picked up by ICE in Chicago could not automatically be treated as if they were trying to enter the country.

Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, said his team is taking the decision positively, calling the court’s ruling on “applicants for admission” the most significant part. He noted the 7th Circuit is the first federal appeals court to hear and reject the Trump administration’s reading of immigration law.

The Trump administration’s immigration detention policy has been challenged in at least 362 cases in federal district courts, according to a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. Challengers have prevailed in 350 of those cases.

The appeals court decision does allow detainees to be released on a case-by-case basis if a review confirms they were arrested in violation of the consent decree. Based on preliminary documents previously released by the government to NIJC and the ACLU in 110 cases, 46 were deemed by the plaintiffs and the Department of Justice to be in violation of the consent decree.

“Given the number of instances where the parties have agreed that the rights of the class members were violated, it stands to reason that a significant number of additional violations will be uncovered as plaintiffs receive and analyze the arrest records of the remaining arrestees,” according to the appeals court decision.

Fleming said the NIJC and the ACLU plan to return to district court to “hold feet to the fire” and compel the release of records for people who remain in immigration custody. The groups will use those records to make individual determinations about who should be released based on whether they were subjected to unlawful warrantless arrests, as allowed by the court’s decision.

The Department of Justice declined to comment Friday. It has 14 days to appeal to the Supreme Court.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/03/D139BCF9-BDBB-46BE-819A-6AA468217769.jpeg,N,,2025-12-12 14:57:33.788416

The South Texas charity is part of Catholic Charities USA and is a branch of the Diocese of Brownsville. Its executive director, Sister Norma Pimentel, has become known globally for her advocacy work for migrants.

Pimentel, who founded the migrant shelter in 2014 and has run it since, was considered one of Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People of 2020” and received a medallion of excellence from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in 2023. During Pope Frances’ reign, she was considered the “Pope’s Favorite Nun.”

But as of last month, the organization has been barred from receiving federal funds for six years, according to documents the government shared with Fox News, after the Department of Homeland Security said an investigation found multiple grant violations, such as inconsistent records on migrants.

The audit also found nearly 250 instances in which the nonprofit used federal funds outside of the 45-day window allowed after a migrant is released, according to Fox News.

In a statement, CCRGV said it was using federal funds to help migrants brought to them by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, “individuals who were released by CBP with a document that gave them permission to travel to their points of destination.”

The organization did not respond to a request for comment. It’s unclear how much the charity depends on federal funds to run its operations, but its statement said it “remains committed to serve each person who comes seeking our help with respect and compassion.”

The shelter provides migrants released from federal custody a range of services, such as showers, meals and clothes, serving as a rest stop before they continue to other destinations in the U.S.

“Those on the front lines of our humanitarian outreach know the work we do truly helps restore human dignity,” Pimentel said in the statement. “I take very seriously every single dollar entrusted to us.”

The organization said it’s committed to complying with federal grant requirements and is working to become eligible to receive funding again.

When the charity commemorated its decade of operations last year, Pimentel told Border Report that it has served over 500,000 migrants.

A few months ago, a House investigation — led by U.S. Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, and Rep. Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, also a member of the committee — probed more than 200 organizations they accused of “providing services or support to inadmissible aliens during the Biden-Harris administration’s historic border crisis.”

Four organizations were listed as the investigation’s priority, including Catholic Charities USA.

Allowing DHS to continue to pick DoD’s pockets puts our military readiness at risk.“ Under the Trump administration, the U.S. military has become heavily involved in immigration enforcement.
Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement.
“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer.
The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies.","Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley said today they have joined Senate and House colleagues to release a new report detailing the Trump administration’s diversion of funds and resources from the Department of Defense to the Department of Homeland Security for immigration enforcement, and its impact on readiness and morale of U.S. troops.

“The investigation found that the Department of Defense (DoD) has obligated over $2 billion in support of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and immigration enforcement in 2025, diverting it from the intended use – our national security and military servicemembers,” the lawmakers wrote to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. “This is a baffling waste of military resources considering the appropriation of $170 billion to DHS to fund immigration enforcement earlier this year. We are particularly concerned that DHS may not be reimbursing DoD for these funds. Allowing DHS to continue to pick DoD’s pockets puts our military readiness at risk.“

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. military has become heavily involved in immigration enforcement. The report is the first detailed review of the Pentagon’s spending on immigration, and found that DoD has committed at least $2 billion to support immigration enforcement through mobilizing and deploying troops to U.S. cities and the Southern border, deporting and transporting immigrants on military aircrafts, detaining individuals on U.S. military installations and more.

Despite an unprecedented $170 billion budget allocated to DHS, it’s unclear how much DoD has received in reimbursement for any of its spending on immigration enforcement. Meanwhile, the military is funding these efforts with money allocated for other DoD projects including updates to barracks, maintenance hangers, and military construction projects in the Pacific. Concerningly, the Pentagon has requested an additional $5 billion for further immigration support in its budget request for 2026.

“Diverting the military from its existing missions and thrusting it into immigration enforcement does not make Americans safer. This multi-billion-dollar political stunt is an overt waste of taxpayer resources and undermines national security, military readiness, and resources for our servicemembers,” the lawmakers continued.

The lawmakers’ report found that, in 2025, the Pentagon has committed:

At least $1.3 billion for the deployment of troops and resources to the border;

At least $258 million to support Trump’s orders to deploy troops to Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Memphis, along with plans to reassign 600 Judge Advocates (JAGs) as immigration judges;

At least $420.9 million for detaining immigrants at domestic military installations and overseas bases like Guantánamo and Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti; and

At least $40.3 million for military flights to deport and transport noncitizen detainees.

The report raised concerns that, in addition to the cost of the DoD immigration efforts, it has resulted in “servicemembers…being pulled from their homes, families, and civilian jobs for indefinite periods of time to support legally questionable political stunts,” the lawmakers wrote. The deployments also unnecessarily put our servicemembers in harm's way: in November, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, was killed while her West Virginia National Guard unit was deployed to Washington, D.C, and Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe was critically injured.

The deployment of troops for immigration enforcement has also weakened the military’s ability to respond to emergencies. For example, the 101st Airborne Division — the U.S. Army’s only air assault division — deployed to the border instead of standing ready for national security missions. Additionally, leading into peak fire season, the California National Guard firefighting unit was “understaffed because roughly half its members (were) deployed to Los Angeles.” These deployments may also require units to miss key training exercises necessary to ensure combat readiness, as the Government Accountability Office found occurred during the first Trump administration.

The diversion of DoD funds is having a devastating effect on the military’s ability to improve services for troops and their families. Among the projects impacted by the prioritization of border operations is a $1 billion renovation of military barracks. Secretary Hegseth also diverted funding from elementary schools at Fort Knox and a U.S. military installation in Germany, an ambulatory care center and dental clinic to service Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington, a jet-training facility in Mississippi, and Marine barracks in Japan.

During the first Trump administration, the DoD stopped deploying troops to the border after determining the deployments were hurting military readiness and morale. The border mission appeared to contribute to alcohol and drug abuse among service members, and may have even contributed to a number of tragic suicides among Texas National Guardsmen. The members raised concerns about similar issues arising again, particularly given the lack of clarity around how long deployments will last.

“The Trump administration’s secrecy leaves many questions unanswered. The administration has failed to provide clarity on basic questions about DoD’s role in supporting DHS,” the lawmakers wrote.

The coalition directed follow-up questions to Secretary Hegseth about the number of troops currently supporting immigration enforcement, how long military units will be supporting DHS, and whether DHS will reimburse the military.

Wyden and Merkley have been continuous advocates for government transparency and accountability. In October, both Oregon senators called on the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to probe the cost of the Trump Administration’s brazen decision to deploy National Guard personnel to U.S. cities.

In November, after the Coast Guard announced the 90-mile relocation of a search-and-rescue helicopter from Newport and the possible installation of a new ICE facility, Wyden and Merkley demanded answers from DHS on the changes. After receiving no answer, Wyden called on the Coast Guard to meet ahead of his Lincoln County town hall to explain the helicopter’s departure. In December, Merkley, Wyden and Representative Val Hoyle announced that Admiral Kevin Lunday, Acting Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, committed to keeping the helicopter in Newport.

The report on the diversion of military resources was led by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Representative John Garamendi, D-Calif. In addition to Wyden and Merkley, the report was co-authored by U.S. Senators Cory Booker, D-N.J., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Adam Schiff, D- Calif., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Representatives Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., and Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.

Now, if a person's parole has not expired on Jan. 14, 2026, it will terminate on that date and they should leave before then, DHS said.

""This administration is ending the abuse of humanitarian parole which allowed poorly vetted aliens to circumvent the traditional parole process. Parole was never intended to be used in this way, and DHS is returning parole to a case-by-case basis as intended by Congress. Ending the FRP programs is a necessary return to common-sense policies and a return to America First,"" a statement reads in part.

Since 2016, the ESTA has included an optional question asking travellers to disclose their social media information.
Travellers from non-Visa Waiver Program countries have been required to disclose their social media handles since 2019.
“Even travellers who post publicly on social media typically maintain some expectation of obscurity, if not privacy, online.
And those who use pseudonymous social media handles or email addresses would be directly deprived of their online anonymity,” she said.","The United States is planning to require some visitors to provide their social media history from the past five years, according to US President Donald Trump’s administration.

This requirement will apply to visitors who do not need a visa to enter the US.

Here is a closer look at this proposal:

What is the US planning to do?

The proposal was announced on the Federal Register by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Wednesday. It will enable officials to collect up to five years of social media history from travellers from certain visa-waiver countries before they can enter the country.

The proposal states that this mandatory social media history disclosure is in line with Executive Order 14161, signed by Trump in January 2025.

That order, titled “Protecting the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threats”, required US government agencies to increase their vetting of foreign nationals entering the country.

Who would this affect?

The requirement will apply to travellers using the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) under the US’s Visa Waiver Program.

The Visa Waiver Program permits citizens of 42 countries – including the United Kingdom, Germany, Qatar, Greece, Malta, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Israel and South Korea – to travel to the US for tourism or business purposes for up to 90 days.

At present, the ESTA automatically screens applicants and grants travel approval without requiring an in-person interview at a US embassy or consulate, unlike standard visa applications. Applicants are required to provide a more limited set of information, such as their parents’ names, current email address and details of any past criminal record.

Since 2016, the ESTA has included an optional question asking travellers to disclose their social media information.

How would this work?

Once the proposal comes into effect, visitors will be required to provide CBP with a list of their social media handles or usernames used over the past five years.

The visitors would not have to give CBP their social media log‑in credentials or passwords. They will use this information to review the publicly accessible information on the social media profiles of these visitors.

The new notice also states that travellers will have to provide additional personal information, including all telephone numbers used over the past five years and email addresses used over the previous 10 years.

Authorities also said they plan to add what are described as “high-value data fields” to the ESTA application “when feasible”. These will include metadata from electronically submitted photographs, extensive personal details about applicants’ family members, such as their places of birth and telephone numbers used over the past five years, as well as biometric information, including fingerprints, DNA and iris data.

The announcement did not include information about what the administration will be looking for within social media accounts of visitors or why it is asking for that information.

It is unclear when the proposal will take effect. However, the public now has 60 days to submit comments about the proposed changes before they are finalised, the notice in the Federal Register states.

Why is the US government doing this now?

Travellers from non-Visa Waiver Program countries have been required to disclose their social media handles since 2019. This is an extension of that.

That measure was first introduced by the Trump administration during his first term as president, and was kept in place during President Joe Biden’s tenure.

The CBP and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have been seeking to significantly broaden the existing social media disclosure rules for some time.

“USCIS has proposed to extend the social media disclosure requirement to applicants for other immigration benefits as well – up through naturalisation,” Caroline DeCell, a senior staff attorney and legislative adviser at Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute, told Al Jazeera.

In June this year, the State Department also announced that it now requires all F, M and J visa applicants to make their social media profiles public as part of enhanced screening to identify national security threats.

Most social media platforms allow users to either keep their profiles private or make them public.

Private profiles can only be viewed by people actively added as friends – this includes all posts, photos, videos or other content posted by the profile user. Content posted on public profiles can be viewed by anyone.

This relates to student visas for those enrolled in accredited colleges, or in vocational or technical, non‑academic educational programmes. It also covers exchange visitors participating in approved exchange study programmes.

“A US visa is a privilege, not a right,” the State Department statement from June said.

What are the privacy implications of this?

DeCell said that if the CBP proposal is approved, the privacy implications would be “significant” as it will require disclosure not only of social media handles, but also of all phone numbers used in the past five years and email addresses used in the past 10 years, as well as biometric data.

“Even travellers who post publicly on social media typically maintain some expectation of obscurity, if not privacy, online. And those who use pseudonymous social media handles or email addresses would be directly deprived of their online anonymity,” she said.

DeCell added that if the USCIS proposal to seek this information for all immigration visa and citizenship applicants is also approved, besides the CBP proposal for travellers from visa waiver countries, “then nearly every non-US citizen who seeks to enter or remain in the United States would be subject to indefinite social media surveillance by the US government”.

Under the USCIS proposal, US citizens who petition in support of their relatives’ immigration applications would also be subjected to this “surveillance”.

What are the implications for freedom of speech?

The First Amendment to the US Constitution guarantees the freedom of religion, speech, the press and peaceful assembly.

However, DeCell warned that this expanding system will deter free speech online and many foreigners will be put off from travelling to the US, whether for work or leisure.

“It’s a massive blow to First Amendment freedoms,” she said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/reuters_693bc9b0-1765525936.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-12 17:57:41.183473

Policymakers across the political spectrum have taken important steps to protect Americans from harmful AI through fair, transparent, and responsible AI standards at the state level.
Just yesterday, New York signed two bills into law to protect consumers and boost AI transparency in the film industry.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) is deeply alarmed by President Trump’s Executive Order to sue and investigate state laws which regulate artificial intelligence (AI) and directing federal agencies to withhold federal funding from states with AI laws deemed to be unfavorable.

IATSE agrees with the order’s assertion that the Trump Administration must act with Congress to establish a national framework for AI regulation and the recognition that a federal policy is needed to ensure copyrights are respected. However, preventing states from passing and enforcing AI protection before Congress acts is an invitation for lawlessness that directly threatens IATSE members and their economic livelihoods.

Recent attempts to roll back and ban state AI protections were rejected overwhelmingly by Congress and remain deeply unpopular with the public. Earlier this week, IATSE and the arts, entertainment, and media industry unions applauded the decision by Congress to exclude an AI moratorium from being forced into the National Defense Authorization Act and urged the Administration to reconsider similar attempts to limit the rights of state governments to protect their constituents.

AI has the potential to transform the entertainment industry and many others, but without clear safeguards, it poses serious risks to American workers’ jobs, privacy, and safety. The order and proposed moratorium on state-level policy both threaten to roll back essential worker protections and undermine ongoing bipartisan efforts to ensure AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly.

Policymakers across the political spectrum have taken important steps to protect Americans from harmful AI through fair, transparent, and responsible AI standards at the state level. For example, Colorado’s Algorithmic Discrimination Act addresses bias and discrimination in automated decision-making, while Florida has implemented policies governing AI in Political Advertising, non-consensual deep-fakes, and Automated Decision-Making. Just yesterday, New York signed two bills into law to protect consumers and boost AI transparency in the film industry.

Rather than seeking to eliminate the only safeguards we have, the federal government should learn from these state efforts to develop a strong, comprehensive framework that ensures AI benefits workers and society.

The Executive Order’s approach takes this harm one step further, seeking to punish states that take action and proactively address pitfalls of AI technology and use, leaving workers vulnerable to misuse and displacement.

IATSE urges policymakers to reject any attempt to strip states of their right to protect working people and to ensure that AI regulation at all levels prioritizes fairness, transparency, and accountability.",https://iatse.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IATSE-COMMISSION-ON-ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE.png,N,,2025-12-12 16:58:53.920545

It is not just that the human rights lawyer who wrote a key text on the Human Rights Act 1998 has become, as prime minister, an advocate of the act’s undoing, along with all the consequences for migrant families that will flow from that. It is that Starmer shows through this the complete dearth of ideas available to European social democracy.

Faced with the growth of Hayekian anti-state politics in the 1970s and 1980s, social democratic parties abandoned the idea of ameliorating the worst impacts of capitalism and became little more than a reserve managerial class occasionally allowed to manage. The problem is that they are now entirely devoid of coherent politics.

Europe’s ageing populations and stagflating economies desperately need immigrant labour. Facing a rightwing discourse that is as wrong on immigration as it is on the climate crisis, Starmer and co can’t mount an ideological retort, and instead bleat about “legitimate concerns”, falling into line with Donald Trump’s power play about the “stark prospect of civilisational erasure” (‘Cultivate resistance’: policy paper lays bare Trump support for Europe’s far right, 5 December).

When John F Kennedy was killed, Malcolm X said the chickens were coming home to roost. Starmer’s attack on the European convention on human rights is more like turkeys dressing up to celebrate Christmas.

Keir Starmer and Mette Frederiksen claim to be speaking for all citizens when they say want to amend the ECHR in order to “control our borders” (We must protect our borders to defend our democracies. Here’s how, 9 December). They don’t speak for me, and, I’d argue, a majority of citizens whose voices never get heard in the press or in government policy.

Migrants – whether refugees or “economic migrants” – have made this country better culturally and economically, bringing in new ideas, entrepreneurialism and some wonderful friends and neighbours.

Freedom of movement is a core part of the human experience throughout time, and the ECHR doesn’t just protect refugees, it defends the rights of all of us, so chipping away at it will impoverish our freedoms when we need them more than ever. Who knows when people in the UK might need to flee a natural or human-made disaster?

Starmer’s government is Blue Labour through and through, echoing many bot-inspired Maga talking points from migration to disability because they have little else to offer. It is not the Labour party I know and have voted for.

Let me get this straight. Donald Trump accuses Europe of being weak on immigration (Trump lambasts ‘weak’ and ‘decaying’ Europe and hints at walking away from Ukraine, 9 December), and hours later our leaders write that they want to take tougher action to protect our borders. I don’t think most Europeans want Europe to become Little America. We want to be a continent where human rights matter, and where our politicians, instead of scapegoating our migrant friends and neighbours, tackle the real crises we face: housing, wages, and public service cuts.

To defend our democracies, we need our leaders to address extreme wealth inequalities, not protect our borders from vulnerable people. The rise in popularity of green and truly progressive parties shows that if they are not willing to act for the many, we will replace their politics of fat cats and division with the politics of care and solidarity.

A federal judge freed Kilmar Abrego Garcia from immigration detention yesterday. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in March due to what Immigration and Customs Enforcement called an ""administrative error."" He was eventually brought back and detained in the U.S. A federal judge ruled that the government failed to produce a lawful order for his removal from the U.S. This decision came just as lawmakers were questioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about President Trump's compliance with court orders.

🎧 The White House says it will appeal this decision, according to NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Abrego Garcia's lawyers say the ruling is an extraordinary victory, not only for their client, but also for due process. Democrats invited family members of people who were deported or put in detention to the hearing as examples of the impact of immigration enforcement. Noem said she believes immigrants who entered the U.S. under former President Biden pose the biggest threat to national security. Noem's department is reopening the cases of refugees admitted under the Biden administration and is calling for a review of asylum applications.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the Ukrainian people would need to speak through a referendum for his country to surrender territory, which the U.S. wants Ukraine to do as part of a peace deal with Russia. Zelenskyy and other Europeans are working to offer answers and alternatives to pressure from Trump's bid to end the war.

🎧 Zelenskyy is engaging with the Trump administration's most painful proposals to show that Ukraine is negotiating in good faith, NPR's Joanna Kakissis tells Up First. Giving up territory has been a red line for Ukrainians. Zelenskyy says he is examining the possibility of elections over the next 90 days or a referendum on giving up parts of eastern Ukraine to help end the war. Ukraine has not held elections because the country is under martial law due to the Russian invasion, and the constitution forbids elections during wartime, Kakissis says. Public opinion polls show that most Ukrainians think holding elections now is a terrible idea.

The Indiana Senate voted 31 to 19 yesterday against the congressional redistricting that the president called for to help Republicans win next year's midterm elections. The defeat comes in a state where 40 of the 50 members of the Senate are Republicans. It marks the first time members of Trump's own party voted against his redistricting campaign. The nationwide effort to reshape the midterm elections in the GOP's favor has succeeded in Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina.

🎧 Indiana State Sen. Spencer Deery said redistricting for political gain opposed his conservative values, and he would fight to prevent the federal government from bullying a state. Other state lawmakers said their constituents didn't want the new map. Ben Thorp of the NPR network station WFYI says Republicans still appear to have ""tilted a couple more seats their way than Democrats."" Texas helped the GOP possibly win five more seats; Missouri and North Carolina's efforts created one more seat each. California Democrats have countered by tilting five seats their way. The question now is whether Republicans in other states will follow suit on Trump's wishes for redistricting, Thorp says.

Vijandre’s legal team is also trying to get him released from detention while his immigration case is resolved, filing its latest motion in a habeas corpus case late Monday.
Vijandre’s case highlights the Trump administration’s intensifying approach to characterizing threats to national security and what appears to be a growing number of Daca recipients caught up in its mass deportation plans.
Again, the hearing transcript does not include Vijandre’s posts on Siddiqui, but the judge asks him what they say.
“I never expected anything like that … being accused of ‘glorifying terrorism’; they attacked my religion, my faith.","Ya’akub Vijandre, a Muslim photojournalist, martial arts teacher and first responder who ICE detained in October for posting on social media, told the Guardian that the government is “attacking my faith” and that he was “concerned about the safety” of his family and friends.

Speaking in his first interview from Georgia’s Folkston detention center, the 38-year-old said guards treat detainees “like animals”, yelling at them when they don’t understand English. One guard responded to his request to use the bathroom during a visit to the detention center’s library by telling him, “just piss on yourself”.

The recently expanded facility had a total average population of about 1,650 in early November, according to Trac, an immigration data project at Syracuse University.

Vijandre was picked up by ICE in Arlington, Texas on 7 October applied for asylum on 19 November and had his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) status revoked on 2 December.

His detention and loss of lawful permission to remain in the US are based on social media posts the federal government links to terrorism. Vijandre and his legal defense team assert his posts were constitutionally protected speech that is being targeted due to Vijandre’s Muslim faith.

Vijandre’s legal team is also trying to get him released from detention while his immigration case is resolved, filing its latest motion in a habeas corpus case late Monday. Habeas corpus is a legal tool that gives a detained person the right to seek a judge’s ruling on whether their detention is unlawful.

Vijandre was born in the Philippines with the legal name of Jacob Ira Azurin Vijandre. He has lived in the US for 24 years, holding Daca status half that time – the Obama-era program designed to protect immigrants from deportation who were brought to the US as children. Daca must be renewed every two years; Vijandre’s most recent renewal was valid through May 2026.

Vijandre’s case highlights the Trump administration’s intensifying approach to characterizing threats to national security and what appears to be a growing number of Daca recipients caught up in its mass deportation plans.

Vijandre’s ordeal began when 10 cars pulled up outside his Arlington home on 7 October and detained him at gunpoint, due to social media posts the federal government saw as “glorifying terrorism”.

The posts referred to several political prisoners, as well as Islam. Samantha Hamilton, staff attorney with Asian Americans Advancing Justice and member of his legal team, said Vijandre’s detention is “a pure speech case … [that] cannot be divorced from Islam, with the government characterizing Ya’akub’s nonviolent speech as terrorism”.

Vijandre has been reporting on rallies and community events dealing with Palestinians and Israel, the “war on terror” and related issues for several decades, often posting on Instagram, where he has nearly 9,000 followers.

His legal team is now in its second month of a constitutional challenge to his detention, after an immigration judge ruled on 3 November that she could not release him on bond. In a 10 November amended habeas corpus petition, Vijandre’s legal team revealed details about that immigration court proceeding, including which social media posts the federal government had singled out and why.

During the hearing, the immigration judge asks Vijandre about a post on the Holy Land Foundation, which she says was “convicted of providing material aid and support to a designated terrorist organization called Hamas”.

Federal prosecutors found the Holy Land Foundation guilty of supporting terrorism in 2008, after an attempt to do so in 2007 ended in a mistrial. The five defendants asserted throughout that the foundation supported community projects and Palestinian orphans. They received sentences ranging from 15 to 65 years. Three of the five have been released.

The post on the case is not quoted in the hearing transcript cited in the amended petition, but Vijandre told the judge: “I have said that they have been wrongfully imprisoned, and that’s all I can recall right now, ma’am.” The judge asks: “[A]re you saying they were wrongfully imprisoned for supporting Hamas?” Vijandre responds that his post was drawing attention to “perceived due-process violations in their prosecution”.

She also refers to a post on Aafia Siddiqui, who received an 86-year sentence in 2010 for allegedly shooting at US military officers in Afghanistan. The Guardian reported on her case at the time.

Several human rights campaigns have sought her release in the last decade-plus, pointing to irregularities in her trial. Her lawyers filed a lawsuit last year alleging she has been subject to rape, sexual abuse and battery.

Again, the hearing transcript does not include Vijandre’s posts on Siddiqui, but the judge asks him what they say. His response: they were “highlighting the conditions that Dr Aafia Siddiqui has suffered in FMC Carswell and also in Guantanamo Bay prison and Bagram Air Base, where rape, and the violation of her detainee rights [sic]”.

The judge goes on to state that the federal government alleges he posted something about the Fort Dix Five – a mid-2000s New Jersey case involving an alleged terrorist plot filled with apparent due process issues also reported on by the Guardian. Of the three posts linked to controversial terrorist cases mentioned in the hearing, this one has not been produced by the federal government, and Vijandre said in the hearing he did not recall posting anything on the case.

Then the judge refers to two posts on Islam, including one where Vijandre “liked” a post containing a quote in English and the Shahada in Arabic – a basic pillar of the Muslim faith. The quote: “Islam today is in dire need of truthful, patient men who are inclined to work hard, who find pleasure in toil and find comfort in pain, quietly translating the needs of this stage into action … ” The government asserts that the quote appeared in a magazine linked to Islamic State.

Another religious post reads: “A Warrior of Islam can never be assassinated for DEATH IS OUR VICTORY!! It is the inescapable process for us to meet Allah; what is more victorious than that!!”

The judge questioned Vijandre about the meaning of the phrase “death is our victory”. He explains that the Qur’an “mentions that every soul will taste death, and that God has burdened us with prosperity and adversity, and that it is a test for us, and that this test is to test our gratitude and our patience”.

The judge concluded that she could not make a decision on bond because Vijandre’s posts appeared to run afoul of federal immigration law against “endorsing or espousing terroristic activity or persuad[ing] others to endorse or espouse terroristic activity or support a terrorist organization”.

The Guardian has approached ICE for comment.

Speaking from Folkston detention center, Vijandre said the hearing left him stunned. “I never expected anything like that … being accused of ‘glorifying terrorism’; they attacked my religion, my faith. They boxed me in, cornered me. I’ve seen this in movies … [but] was not expecting my faith to be attacked.”

“This is a rehearsed tactic of Islamophobia,” he added.

In the federal government’s 28 November motion to dismiss Vijandre’s habeas corpus petition, it zeroes in on the post that includes the notion, “death is our victory” as well as the alleged post on the Fort Dix 5. The assistant US attorney asserts that the former demonstrates Vijandre is “endorsing or espousing terroristic activity”, while the latter is evidence he was “soliciting funds for terrorist organizations”.

Hamilton, of Vijandre’s legal team, told the Guardian that not only has the federal government not produced the Fort Dix 5 post, a search through his Instagram account by a friend also produced no such post.

The team’s 8 December motion asserts that “Mr Vijandre’s freedom is critical, but far more is at stake here than one man’s liberty. If Mr Vijandre’s social media posts or photojournalism make him a terrorist, the executive branch’s power to detain individuals within the United States based on speech will know no limits.”

Meanwhile, Vijandre, speaking from Folkston, said he is “concerned about [his family’s] safety … them being accused of what I’m being accused of. With the rise of Islamophobia, ignorant people could use violence against my family.”

He noted that his family history includes a great-grandfather Lorenzo Fabian and grand-uncle Paulino Fabian receiving Congressional Gold Medals posthumously in 2020, for their service during the second world war. Vijandre participated in the medal ceremony with family.

He also shared previously unreported details with the Guardian about his role as part of an emergency team that helped family members of the 67 people killed in the 29 January accident involving a Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines jet in Washington DC – one of the worst air accidents in decades.

A Red Cross-trained first responder, Vijandre was deployed within 24 hours of the accident, and spent the next two weeks assisting one family in particular who were “completely devastated” by losing a loved one.

Amnesty International has released a new report documenting serious human rights violations at two immigration detention centers in Florida known as Alligator Alcatraz and Krome. Based on a September 2025 research mission, the report details inhuman and degrading conditions including overflowing toilets near sleeping areas, constant lighting, insect exposure, lack of privacy with cameras over toilets, denial of medical care, routine shackling, and punishment that Amnesty says can amount to torture. At Alligator Alcatraz, the absence of basic tracking systems has also led to people being held incommunicado, with families and lawyers unable to locate them.

At Krome, which is operated by a private for profit contractor, Amnesty confirmed extreme overcrowding, medical neglect, prolonged solitary confinement, unsanitary conditions, and reports of physical abuse by guards. Four of the six deaths in Florida ICE custody since October 2024 occurred at Krome. Amnesty links these abuses to Florida’s expanded use of mass detention and emergency powers under Governor Ron DeSantis, including hundreds of millions of dollars in no bid contracts for detention while funding for health care, housing, food security, and emergency response was cut. Amnesty is calling for the closure of Alligator Alcatraz, an end to state run immigration detention, and independent investigations into torture and deaths in custody.

The Trump administration might be exaggerating their employment figures, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned Wednesday.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem didn’t deny that the Trump administration was illegally deporting people with ongoing asylum cases.

Noem spiraled out during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday, after Representative Dan Goldman pressed her on the government’s efforts to deport lawful asylum-seekers. There have been mounting reports that asylum cases are being routinely dismissed by immigration judges, and the asylum-seekers are then taken into ICE custody for expedited removal.

The New York Democrat asked Noem whether she agreed that asylum was a lawful pathway to citizenship and that immigrants with ongoing asylum applications were legally in the country. Noem agreed asylum was “a lawful pathway.”

“So, if your department then deports anyone with an ongoing asylum application, you are violating the law, correct?” Goldman asked.

Noem immediately became defensive. “Joe Biden left us with a [inaudible] five billion cases backlogged,” she replied, attempting to dodge the question.

“I’m not asking about Joe Biden, I’m asking you a specific question,” Goldman said. “If your department deports anyone with an ongoing asylum application, you are violating the law, correct?”

But Noem continued to speak monotonously throughout the lawmaker’s repeated requests to answer the question, claiming that the Biden administration had “greatly violated” the asylum law.

“Why are you filibustering? Why can’t you answer the question? It’s a simple question,” Goldman asked, but the secretary continued to rant that the “asylum program was broken under the last administration.”

Clearly, Noem had no intention of openly copping to breaking the law—but Goldman said her artless obfuscation did it for her, since yes was the “obvious answer.”

“If you don’t like the asylum system, you change the asylum law. Bring it to us. We’ll work with you. I think it needs to be changed. But you can’t just decide that you’re not gonna follow the law—and asylum is a law—and deport people with ongoing applications. Unfortunately, that is exactly what’s happening,” Goldman said.

ICE attorneys at immigration hearings are increasingly asking immigration judges to dismiss asylum cases, and the Trump administration has instructed judges to grant quick dismissals. At the same time, the Trump administration has purged dozens of immigration judges and sought to recruit so-called “deportation judges” to help ramp up the government’s soft ethnic cleansing.

Health care bills are going to skyrocket next year after the Senate voted down a bill that would have extended subsidies for the Affordable Care Act on Thursday.

The bill needed 60 votes to pass, but only four Republicans broke with their party and voted to extend the subsidies that millions of Americans rely on: Senators Josh Hawley, Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan, and Susan Collins, resulting in a total of just 51 votes in favor. Every single Democrat in the Senate voted to extend the subsidies, while Montana Senator Steve Daines, a Republican, did not vote.

President Trump said last month that he was against extending the subsidies “because the ‘unaffordable care act’ has been a disaster.” But the real disaster is just beginning.

Health care premiums have already gone up in several states, and lower-income states, including Republican-run states like Mississippi, Tennessee, and South Carolina, stand to suffer the most. Many Americans will likely drop their ACA health care plans, meaning that an estimated four million Americans could be without health care coverage.

Here are the 48 Republican senators who voted to end the subsidies and increase premiums:

Yet another musician has joined the choir of voices refuting the White House’s latest string of ICE advertisements.

SZA torched the Trump administration for using her music in a pro-ICE ad, claiming that the blatant intellectual property theft was really just a transparent bid to rage-bait artists into giving the violent campaign more attention.

“White House rage baiting artists for free promo is PEAK DARK … inhumanity +shock and aw tactics,” SZA wrote on X Wednesday. “Evil n Boring.”

The White House published a Christmas-themed montage of ICE arrests Monday set to SZA’s track “Big Boy,” focusing on the song’s reprise “it’s cuffing season”—which, in the context of the song, refers to falling into short-term relationships during the cold winter months. Not ripping people away from their families and forcing them into modern-day concentration camps.

“WE HEARD IT’S CUFFING SZN,” the White House captioned the post alongside a chain emoji. “Bad news for criminal illegal aliens. Great news for America.”

The 36-year-old R&B singer was responding to a kindred comment by her former manager, Terrence “Punch” Henderson, who said that the White House’s efforts to “provoke artist[s] to respond in order to help spread propaganda and political agendas is nasty business.”

But the platinum record-producing duo aren’t alone in their opinion. The White House has also stolen tracks from Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter for similar purposes, earning the ire of the pop music spectrum in the process.

Last week, Carpenter seemingly won her own standoff with ICE after the White House deleted another brutal arrest montage that stole her song “Juno.”

“This video is evil and disgusting,” Carpenter responded to the White House video in a comment that received 1.8 million likes and more than 163 million views—roughly half of the U.S. population. “Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”

Homeland Security Secretary and MAGA hardliner Kristi Noem got a fact-check to her face during her Thursday morning House hearing when Democratic Representative Seth Magaziner brought in a special guest.

“How many United States military veterans have you deported?” Magaziner asked Noem.

“Sir, we have not deported U.S. citizens or military veterans.”

Little did she know there was one staring right at her.

“Madame Secretary, we are joined on Zoom by a gentleman named Sae Joon Park. He is a United States Army combat veteran who was shot twice while serving our country in Panama in 1989,” Magaziner said. “Like many veterans, he struggled with PTSD and substance abuse after his service.... A purple heart recipient, he has sacrificed more for this country than most people ever have. Earlier this year you deported him to Korea, a country he hasn’t lived in since he was seven years old. Will you join me in thanking Mr. Park for his service to our country?”

Noem initially refused to even acknowledge Park, who was staring blankly on an iPad held up near Magaziner.

“Sir, I’m grateful for every single person that has served our country and follows our laws—”

“Can you please tell Mr. Park why you deported him?” Magaziner asked, talking over Noem. “This man took two bullets for our country. You have broad authority, by the way, as secretary, to issue humanitarian parole, to do deferred action. Will you commit to at least looking at Mr. Park’s case to see if you can help him find a pathway back to this country that he sacrificed so much for?”

“I will absolutely look at his case.”

Magaziner also brought in another veteran whose wife had been deported.

Park was forced to self-deport over the summer due to drug possession charges linked to his military PTSD.

“ I can’t believe that this is happening in America,” he told NPR in an interview before he left. “That blows me away, like a country that I fought for.”

The Trump administration is refusing to face the facts that they are the ones responsible for the suspected national guard shooter’s presence in the country.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was grilled during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Thursday on Rahmanullah Lakanwal’s granted asylum, which was approved in April after she took over as head of the agency.

“You blamed [the shooting of the National Guardsmen] solely on Joe Biden. Who approved the asylum for this same person?” pressed Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson after Noem finally stopped cutting him off for long enough to allow him to ask the question in its entirety.

“Mr. Thompson, this individual that came into the country—,” Noem started deflecting, before Thompson pressed again.

“No. I want to know who approved—” Thompson continued.

But Noem cut him off again. “No, no, no, no. I’m not going to let you—”

When Noem refused to stop talking, Thompson called to reclaim his time. Then the chairman of the committee, Representative Andrew Garbarino, got involved, ordering Noem to stop speaking until Thompson could ask his question again.

“Yes or no, who approved the asylum claim?” asked Thompson, but Noem again blamed the Biden administration.

“I don’t want to file perjury charges against you, but I’m of the opinion that the Trump administration—DHS, your DHS—approved the asylum application,” Thompson said.

It’s been two weeks since the shooting took place. In that time, Noem has repeatedly thwarted attempts to pin her agency for Lakanwal’s asylum, even though that’s actually what happened. Instead, she has nonsensically claimed that the Biden administration’s vetting process for Lakanwal, which began after he entered the U.S. in 2021, had effectively made her powerless to the ultimate decision regarding Lakanwal’s ability to stay in the country.

Prior to the shooting, there were plenty of well-documented reasons to allow Lakanwal into America. He operated as a foreign partner with America’s intelligence services in Afghanistan, and worked with the CIA as a partner in the country for more than a decade before U.S. troops withdrew from the region. Unfortunately, however, Lakanwal struggled with PTSD as a result of the war, his family told CNN.

He allegedly shot two members of West Virginia’s National Guard on the eve of Thanksgiving. U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries. The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, is “slowly healing,” according to his family.

The Trump administration might be exaggerating their employment figures, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned Wednesday.

In a press conference, Powell said that staffers at the Fed think that the government could be overestimating the number of jobs created by 60,000 each month. With published figures stating that the U.S. has added an average of 40,000 jobs each month since April, the true numbers could be closer to a loss of 20,000 jobs a month.

“We think there’s an overstatement in these numbers,” Powell said at the conference, which followed a policy meeting at the central bank.

Much of the issue is how the Department of Labor counts jobs added or subtracted when new businesses are opened or others close shop. The government can’t easily reach out to companies just starting out, or that have gone out of business, so the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a statistical model to guess. In recent years, BLS numbers have overstated job creation, sometimes by hundreds of thousands of jobs a year, resulting in revisions showing less jobs later.

But the Trump administration has not responded well to bad jobs reports. When payroll processor ADP reported that the economy lost nearly 32,000 jobs in November, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick scrambled to blame Democrats and deflect blame from President Trump’s tariffs. Trump himself fired the BLS chief over the summer because he was mad about the negative jobs data the agency produced. It’s not outside of the realm of possibility that Trump would put pressure on the agency to fudge better numbers.

Venezuela has condemned the Trump administration’s Wednesday seizure of an oil tanker, calling it an “act of piracy.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the tanker of illegally sending oil to terrorist groups, justifying the administration’s hostile takeover.

“For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,” she wrote Wednesday on X, along with a video of the seizure. “This seizure, completed off the coast of Venezuela, was conducted safely and securely—and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues.”

The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry offered a very different read of the situation.

“The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela denounces and energetically repudiates what constitutes a brazen robbery and an act of international piracy, publicly announced by the President of the United States … making clear that the policy of aggression against our country responds to a deliberate plan to plunder our energy resources,” they wrote. “Under these circumstances, the true reasons for the prolonged aggression against Venezuela have finally been exposed. It is not migration. It is not drug trafficking. It is not democracy. It is not human rights. It has always been about our natural resources, our oil, our energy, the resources that belong exclusively to the Venezuelan people.”

President Trump seems to have fully embraced the piracy angle.

“What happens to the oil on the ship?” a reporter asked Trump Wednesday afternoon.

“Well we keep it, I guess,” Trump replied, before failing to answer where exactly the oil was originally going.

This is yet another ratcheting up of aggression against the Maduro government—and yet another example of the absolute disregard the Trump administration has for anyone else’s sovereignty but their own.",https://images.newrepublic.com/36c504e2faf37d41f18952d5680965920d9b0891.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-12-12 14:57:07.419976

As terrified congregants fled into the trees or hid inside, agents detained an El Salvadoran church member, deporting him ten days later and leaving behind his wife and adult children.

""It was a normal day,"" recalled Pastor Victor Ramirez. ""We heard the news about ICE, but we said, 'this is a safe place.' We were not doing anything; we are not criminals.""

The November incident was part of a broader enforcement sweep dubbed ""Operation Charlotte's Web,"" which has ignited a firestorm in Charlotte's vibrant immigrant community and raised a profound crisis for faith leaders: Can the government freely pursue immigration enforcement within the walls of a church?

The operation unfolded after a significant policy change. In January, the White House rescinded longstanding ""sensitive locations"" guidelines that had traditionally directed ICE to avoid enforcement at places like churches, schools, and hospitals.

This policy shift has empowered a wave of intensified enforcement actions in cities with large immigrant populations. While operations like Charlotte's are locally named, they reflect a concerted national strategy. ICE arrests in the interior of the U.S. have risen, and arrests at or near sensitive locations, once rare, have become a contentious focal point of fear and legal challenges from advocacy groups.

Federal agents launched Operation Charlotte's Web in November, aiming to target possible criminals in a metro area home to over 300,000 foreign-born residents. Officials reported apprehending upwards of 370 people.

""If we have known murderers and drug dealers, and really bad people – we want to get them out,"" said President Donald Trump during a recent press conference.

However, local pastors and attorneys describe the results as a ""shock and awe"" campaign that has spread fear far beyond its intended targets.

For Pastor Ramirez, the arrest at his church felt like a violation. It happened after a during a service project after a Saturday service, and the man detained and deported shared the message that day.

""I understand that ICE has to find criminals, I understand and agree with that,"" the pastor said, standing outside Casa de Dios. ""He's not a criminal. This is church.""

The impact has rippled far beyond a single arrest. Faith leaders report aggressive tactics that have frightened entire congregations. Many immigrant churches stopped holding services for weeks. According to local reports, some 30,000 children stayed home from school in the wake of the operations.

The dilemma is acutely felt by pastors like Dan Titan of Casa Viva Church on Charlotte's east side, who leads a congregation of about a thousand, mostly Latino immigrants.

""Yeah, I can't lie. There are people without some papers, of course,"" Pastor Titan acknowledged. ""We are the church. We are the body of Christ. We are Christian, and we need to obey the law. We are not against the law. But within there's different ways to do the law, you know.""

He went on to confirm the pervasive fear: ""They were scared. That's for sure… There's still people just in their homes.""

Confrontations like these are shifting from sanctuaries and public spaces into the courtroom. Attorney Anna Cushman of Tedesco Legal, who works with detainees, argues that in church-site detentions, the operations threaten a fundamental right.

""I first think about the Constitution, protecting the free exercise of religion,"" Cushman said. ""There's not an exception there that says you get to exercise your religion, so long as you don't get in the way of immigration enforcement. There is no exception there.""

For Cushman, a Christian, the issue is also a matter of faith. ""What's going on is that we are not welcoming the stranger. We are not treating the least of these as if they are Jesus,"" she said. ""We are called to this kind of radical hospitality.""

As the operation took root, a coordinated network of citizens sprang up in opposition. Non-profits, local churches, and neighbors organized protests, blew whistles to warn of approaching agents, and handed out ""Know Your Rights"" flyers. Volunteers delivered food to families too afraid to leave their homes.

""We don't need ICE coming into Charlotte disrupting our city, creating fear in our city and work space,"" said Niecy Brown of the North Carolina AFL-CIO at a press briefing.

Charlotte City Council Member-elect JD Mazuera Arias held a similar disposition: ""This is not about public safety. It is not about finding criminals. It's about fear, quotas, and it's about control.""

The rallying cry has been organized around a central message: that loving your neighbor isn't just the right thing to do—it's holy.

ICE declined CBN News' request for an interview. In a statement, the agency said its actions in Charlotte were ""lawful and targeted threats to public safety.""

As the legal and political battles continue, the human and spiritual cost remains forefront for leaders like Pastor Ramirez. In a final plea to Washington, he asked for compassion.

""We pray for {President Trump},"" Ramirez said. ""All we ask for is some mercy because people who attend our church… they're not criminals. We serve a purpose – a purpose of the Lord. That's why we are here.""

The nation is left to navigate the intersection of faith, law, and community, where the principle of sanctuary now hinges on judicial interpretation and political will.",https://cbn.com/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/bca1420icechurchcharlotte02_hdv.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 12:57:59.141180

Not long after the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington, DC, Elora Mukherjee found herself contacting her clients with bad news. Mukherjee, the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, needed to tell several asylum seekers that their applications had been put on hold—indefinitely.

Many of them had been “eagerly waiting for years to have an interview” in their cases, Mukherjee said. They hoped to finally be allowed to stay in the United States and freed from the fear of deportation, she said. But this pause “shattered” their “sense of safety and hope.”

In response to the attack—in which an Afghan immigrant has been charged with killing US Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and wounding Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe—the Trump administration moved fast, stopping the issuance of visas and asylum for nationals of Afghanistan. Then, it went a step further: indefinitely halting all asylum decisions, regardless of nationality, “pending a comprehensive review.” The Trump administration also paused the processing of immigration benefits for people from 19 countries targeted by the June travel ban.

The sweeping change in policy, legal experts and advocates say, is disproportionate. It punishes the collective for the wrongdoings of one troubled individual. The blanket restrictions are also likely to have a far broader impact beyond the groups and countries singled out by the White House. “These actions are basically shutting down the legal immigration system,” Shev Dalal-Dheini, government relations director at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said during a briefing with reporters.

“These are not narrow, targeted shifts,” AILA’s executive director Ben Johnson said, adding that the “ripple effects” of these actions would be felt by millions of people and entire communities across the country. “These policies don’t just disrupt paperwork,” he said, “they derail lives.”

In the aftermath of the shooting, immigration lawyers have reported naturalization ceremonies and green card interviews getting canceled. Cases in which the applicant had already been interviewed, and sometimes approved, have also been paused.

Even immigrants who hold a passport from a non-banned nation—say a dual citizen of Iran and Canada—are impacted if their country of birth is one of the 19 placed on the travel ban. The list at the moment includes Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan. But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has also indicated it might grow to more than 30 nations.

The abrupt changes have sewn fear and put families in limbo. They have also increased the odds that people who were pursuing legal status—and had been previously vetted—might now end up in the crosshairs of immigration enforcement.

Mukherjee said she has urged her clients to take every possible precaution. But it’s a Catch-22. Complying with immigration enforcement requirements risks arrest at check-in; not complying could make you a target for not following the rules.

Last week, one of her clients, an Afghan asylum seeker, showed up to immigration court in New York City for a required routine appointment only to be separated from his lawyer, taken into custody, and sent to a detention center in New Jersey.

“It’s shocking that he was arrested and detained when he was doing exactly what he was supposed to do,” Mukherjee said, explaining that the man had been paroled into the United States and had no criminal history. Writing in a recent New York Times op-ed, Mukherjee described how asylum seekers she works with and who fear persecution in their countries of origin are “gripped with terror,” unsure of whether they’ll be allowed to stay in the United States.

“Unfortunately, if you’re from Iran, Venezuela, or Afghanistan and you’ve gone through the process, now you’re put on hold, your citizenship interview is canceled…because some guy decided to do something illegal and unconscionable—shooting other people,” said Minneapolis-based attorney Paschal Nwokocha. “A big segment of our immigrant population is now having to pay because of the sin of one person.”

Prior to the shooting, the Trump administration had already ordered a review of Biden-era grants of refugee status. Now, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency in charge of visas and other immigration benefits, has announced it will conduct a “full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.”

Immigration lawyers warn that revisiting hundreds of thousands of approved cases will burden the agency and slow down the processing of all applications, leading to even bigger backlogs, longer wait times, and potential gaps in benefits that could jeopardize people’s employment. (In many instances these are people who have been thoroughly vetted multiple times over the years.)

It also means that already-limited resources are being moved away from the adjudication and investigation of cases of actual fraud or that pose potential threat.

“There’s a larger plan at work here,” Johnson said. “This is about throwing sand in the gears of the entire immigration system in order to end immigration.”

The day after the D.C. shooting, USCIS also announced “additional national security measures,” including a new guidance that instructs officers to consider “country-specific factors as significant negative factors” when considering cases of people from the 19 countries on the travel ban. These arbitrary assessments on the basis of nationality, immigration experts say, could lead to more denials and leave little room for judicial review because the courts have given the government large deference when it comes to discretionary decisions by an immigration agency.

Another unintended consequence of the changes might be a chilling effect that discourages immigrants from coming forward to engage with the legal system, pushing them into the shadows.

“All of my clients deeply believe in the promise of America and fled to this country after suffering severe harm and fearing for their lives and the lives of their children,” Mukherjee said. “America should not close its doors and turn its back to bona fide asylum seekers who should be protected under both domestic and international law.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP_Naturalization_12112025.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-12-12 15:57:18.931505

But the appeals court on Wednesday ruled that SB 17 doesn't apply to Wang at all.

On Thursday, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit against Senate Bill 17, a new law that restricts people with citizenship, permanent residence or political ties to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea from acquiring most types of real estate in Texas, including farmland, homes and commercial property.

Supporters say the measure is a safeguard against national security threats repeatedly highlighted in the federal government's annual threat assessment.

The plaintiff in the case, Peng Wang, is a Chinese citizen who's lived in Texas for 16 years on a student visa. Wang argued that the law discriminated against him and others like him, making it harder to rent long term or eventually buy a home.

But the appeals court on Wednesday ruled that SB 17 doesn't apply to Wang at all. To fall under the law, someone must be domiciled in a designated country, meaning that country is their permanent home. The judges noted that Wang considers Texas his home, plans to stay after school and has ""no real plans to return to China.""

""Wang is asking this court to find that his true, fixed, and permanent home and place to which he intends to return is an unknown place somewhere in China at which he has never lived and to which he has no intention to ever return,"" the ruling read. ""We refuse the invitation.""

Because Wang didn't meet those requirements, the court refused to move forward on the bigger constitutional questions, leaving SB 17 fully in effect.

Justin Sadowsky, legal director at the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance and Wang's attorney, said he was disappointed in the decision, but believed future legal challenges would be taken against what he described as a ""blatantly discriminatory law.""

JB Pritzker signed a bill limiting federal immigration enforcement into law Tuesday morning, over a month after House Bill 1312 passed the state legislature on Oct. 31. Dubbed the Safety and Liberation Together Act, it restricts federal immigration enforcement near state courthouses and allows individuals to pursue litigation over civil immigration enforcement actions.

In the wake of Operation Midway Blitz, the SALT Act is Democratic Illinois lawmakers’ response to increased federal immigration enforcement in Chicago and its suburbs. The last several months have seen the arrests of thousands, largely without criminal records, according to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement published by the Deportation Data Project.

Under the legislation’s provisions, people taken into custody can sue for civil damages, including statutory damages of $10,000. Apart from state courthouses, it also strengthens immigration protection and privacy policies for places like hospitals, universities and day care centers.

“Together we’re sending a message to Donald Trump, to Kristi Noem, to Gregory Bovino and anyone else seeking to terrorize our people,” Pritzker said at a Tuesday morning news conference. “Your divisiveness and your brutality are not welcome here.”

Damages for those seeking legal remedies may increase based on the defendant’s conduct, including factors such as facial coverings, body cameras, crowd control measures — including the use of tear gas — and vehicles with a non-Illinois license plate or no license plate at all.

In a written statement to The Daily, State Sen. Mike Simmons (D-Chicago) described these locations as places where “people’s safety is of the utmost importance” and described ICE agents’ actions in Chicago and its suburbs as “sickening” and demonstrating a “reckless disregard for the law and violence.”

In Springfield, the bill cleared the Senate with a 40-18 vote and the House with a 75-32 vote, supported by Democratic lawmakers including Simmons, State Rep. Hoan Huynh (D-Chicago) and State Sen. Laura Fine (D-Glenview).

According to Simmons, his support for the bill was a reaction to fears that his constituents have shared with him and his experience seeing ICE agents “throw” a reporter to the ground in Lincoln Square and people “abducted” from Rogers Park.

Many of his constituents still will not leave their homes without passports, Simmons wrote, and some fear going to school, work or grocery shopping.

“Even since this bill passed last month, that fear is still real for many of the families I represent, and we need a real reckoning with the damage and trauma ICE has left behind,” Simmons wrote.

Pritzker lauded the “hundreds of everyday Illinoisans” who have taken up rapid-response responsibilities and “answered the call of neighbors in need.” He added that the state’s rapid responder system is “nation-leading” and people in other cities are following Illinois’ example.

Fine wrote in a statement to The Daily that since ICE began “raiding” neighborhoods earlier this year, she could tell from her conversations with constituents that they were willing to do everything in their power to protect and provide for their neighbors.

Immigrants in the 9th District aren’t just “numbers on an ICE spreadsheet,” Fine emphasized. Some are parents taking their kids to daycare and families trying to put food on the table; others, students on community college campuses, she wrote.

“My district made it unmistakably clear that they wanted their state government to step up, and HB 1312 is the direct result of those conversations,” Fine wrote.

However, the bill has faced backlash from Republicans, including State Sen. John Curran (R-Lemont), who argued in the chamber that it would get “set aside” by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights Executive Director Lawrence Benito said in a Tuesday news release that Illinois residents have “stepped up to look out for their neighbors” and demanded “real protections.”

U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Evanston) wrote in a statement to The Daily that Pritzker was doing “exactly what a leader should do in the face of a wannabe dictator’s cruel policies.” The new law will assuage fears about going to court or seeking medical care and basic services, regardless of immigration status, she added.

Schakowsky shared that she’s heard from families across the 9th District who are “afraid to even step outside” after ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents “terrorized” their communities.

“Everyone, regardless of their immigration status, deserves to live with dignity and without fear,” Schakowsky wrote.

Mayor Daniel Biss thanked the legislation’s advocates and applauded Pritzker for signing it into law in a statement to The Daily.

He highlighted the strengthening of data protections and prohibiting courthouse arrests as terms that hold ICE accountable.

“These state protections bolster the actions we’ve taken in Evanston to help keep people safe,” Biss wrote. “While the amount of federal activity has decreased in recent weeks, I urge all residents to remain vigilant and look out for our neighbors as ICE has been spotted in the Chicagoland area in recent weeks.”

In early October, Fernando Gomez Ruiz was eating at a food truck in Los Angeles when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents grabbed him. The 61-year-old was taken from the city where he had lived for 22 years. He was brought to California City Detention Facility, where he says he was denied insulin. Soon, his blood sugar spiked. An ulcer spread across his foot. It’s still there today; he tries to clean the oozing blood as best he can with dirty, bloody gauze. But because of the way the facility restricts legal calls, he hasn’t been able to fully explain any of this to his lawyer. This denial of one of the most basic rights in America, the ability to speak with an attorney, has became an instrument of the ICE detention system itself.

Attorney-client privilege is the oldest privilege in American law. “It is a sacrosanct privilege,” said Eunice Cho, senior attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project. “For people in government custody, it is quite important to be able to speak with attorneys in a privileged, confidential manner.”

ICE insists its system protects attorney-client privilege. Every detention facility is supposed to follow ICE standards that promise private meeting rooms, unmonitored legal calls, and secure legal mail. But the record inside tells a different story.

In the past year, class-action lawsuits from California to New York to Florida have asked federal courts to intervene because ICE facilities monitored legal calls, copied privileged mail, and denied access to attorneys. Taken together, these filings depict a system where confidential communication with an attorney is structurally impossible.

Earlier this month, Gomez Ruiz and six others sued California City Detention Facility for denying access to counsel, among other violations. Their case lays bare a broader pattern that starts the moment someone is detained. Attorneys often cannot find their people for days because ICE’s Online Detainee Locator System is delayed and sometimes does not list them at all. Families are left calling hospitals trying to learn where their loved one is. Once someone is found, confidential communication is almost impossible.

Attorneys describe weekslong delays for legal calls. When virtual calls do occur, they are capped at one hour, which means detainees may wait another week or two before speaking to counsel again. Tablets, which allow people in California’s state prisons to make calls from their cells, are only allowed in dayrooms. And in many ICE facilities, the tablets that are intended to be used with legal representatives are monitored and recorded. Even in-person “confidential” conversations take place under guard surveillance in crowded rooms where the sound carries.

Marisol Dominguez-Ruiz, one of Fernando’s lawyers from the ACLU, is used to sitting in the same room as her clients without barriers. But at California City, she was forced to bend forward to talk with Fernando through a small sliver between the glass. “You’re kind of crouched down and yelling to make sure that each other hears,” she said. “It doesn’t sound to me like it’s a confidential kind of conversation.”

Immigrants in ICE custody are trapped in a paradox. They have no Sixth Amendment right to an attorney—that applies only to criminal defendants. But an attorney is often their only “contact with the outside world,” and only hope of reaching their family members, as a federal judge underscored in 2019. In that case, the court held that the government cannot make it harder for an immigrant detainee to exercise their right to counsel, and that doing so could violate their First Amendment right to communicate with the outside world. The stakes are clear: Without a lawyer, people are twice as likely to be deported, according to a study earlier this year from the American Immigration Council.

“Arguably immigrants in civil detention should have at least as good if not better access to their attorneys than people in criminal custody,” said Emma Winger, deputy legal director at the American Immigration Council.

Because they are civil detainees in immigration court, there is no mechanism for courts to rapidly intervene when their rights collapse. In a criminal case, if a jail interferes with attorney-client conversations, you can go straight to federal court and get a judge to stop it. Immigration law works the opposite way. People must wait until they lose their case, then file an appeal, and then and only then ask a federal court to review what happened. “Any claims that come out of someone’s deportation proceedings can only be raised on a petition for review of their removal order,” said Winger. “It makes it more difficult to quickly prevent ongoing abuses in the deportation process by bringing a lawsuit in federal court.”

What exists is a system that treats people worse than criminal punishment while it uses its civil label to evade the constitutional limits that govern punishment. That’s nothing new. ICE has been warned about attorney access violations for more than two decades. A 2006 report by DHS found that detainees in multiple ICE facilities had to make legal calls from dayrooms or offices without privacy panels where staff could overhear them, and that some facilities delayed or denied requests for attorney calls for more than two weeks. Six years later, the American Immigration Council found that ICE restricts access to attorneys and that agents were telling people they aren’t entitled to one. Most recently, in 2022, the ACLU’s No Fighting Chance report found that at least 58 (out of 199 at the time) ICE facilities block attorney calls, provide no private space for meetings, and create delays that cause attorneys to miss critical deadlines.

What’s new is the scale: The Trump administration has demanded more than 1 million deportations. To reach that quota, “ICE wants people to self-deport,” said Amy Godshall, an ACLU of Florida attorney. Without a lawyer, people may feel they have little hope of contesting their case and may want to escape the horrifying conditions of detention at all costs, even if that means leaving the country.

At facilities like Broadview in Illinois, detainees say officers have been asking them to sign ICE Form I-210—a “voluntary departure” order—that is completed by officers themselves. “People are signing these life-altering documents without the benefit of talking to counsel,” said Cho.

More than a series of isolated violations, this is a structural design. Civil detention erases the attorney-client privilege at the core of due process and then uses that void to pressure people into signing their own deportation orders. The machinery works because people are made to disappear before they ever get to speak.",https://compote.slate.com/images/e0ccfddb-251f-4479-9083-b704e5160a9a.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2025-12-12 12:58:20.737898

That’s why we have serious concerns about Bill C-9.
But Bill C-9, without amendment, will not do that.","The CLC condemns all forms of hate, discrimination, and harassment. We will continue to fight for the rights that make Canada a free and democratic country.

This is why we, alongside civil liberties organizations, oppose the current version of Bill C-9, the Combatting Hate Act.

The version of the Bill being debated in the House of Commons has the potential to infringe on our hard fought-for rights of freedom of expression and freedom of association with little to no oversight.

Parliament should not pass this Bill without considerable amendment. As drafted, the Bill threatens labour rights, fundamental freedoms, the right to protest, and public accountability.

With Bill C-9, the federal government proposes to create three new offenses: a hate crime offense, an offense of willfully promoting hatred against an identifiable group, and an intimidation offense.

Canada already has criminal offences in place to combat hate like mischief, intimidation, and harassment. Police currently have the “ancillary powers” to create exclusion zones for protests, which has the potential to limit freedom of expression and our right to peaceful protest. Three Canadian cities (Toronto, Vaughn, and Ottawa) have created bubble zone bylaws, aimed to protect identifiable groups from hate and harassment when accessing health care (abortion clinics), and attending school and places of worship.

More mirroring legislation and additional powers given to law enforcement is not necessary.

We need to protect the fundamental rights that allow Canadians to participate fully in our society and to voice dissent without fear. In today’s political climate, defending these core freedoms is more important than ever.

This legislation comes at a moment when we are witnessing alarming rights violations in the United States. The National Guard is being deployed to cities to target and deport immigrants under the guise of combating crime. The U.S. Department of Justice and ICE have arrested, charged, and prosecuted protesters for speaking out against immigration raids and for participating in Palestinian solidarity demonstrations. The Trump administration continues to single out vulnerable communities — including trans people and immigrants — while actively eroding core First Amendment rights.

We cannot allow fundamental rights to be weakened or undermined in Canada. We must ensure that every person here can participate fully in society and speak out without fear.

We have already witnessed these trends in American governance creep across the border. Since Trump’s inauguration, we have experienced a significant and frightening tariff war, pressure to concede to US demands, and a push to increase border security and crack down on migrants and refugees.

That’s why we have serious concerns about Bill C-9. Without amendment, it will undermine core democratic rights and expand state powers in ways that put workers and marginalized communities at risk.

Bill C-9 makes it easier for the state to prosecute people by expanding discretionary police powers and removing the requirement for the Attorney General’s consent. Without amendment, it will lower the bar for criminal charges and give law enforcement wide authority with little oversight.

This opens the door to the criminalization of peaceful protest and collective action. Without amendment, it will disproportionately impact Indigenous, Black, and racialized communities.

For workers, the threat is clear. The Charter protects the right to strike — yet without amendment, Bill C-9 will erode this right, making certain legal job actions a criminal offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. This is a direct attack on organized labour and freedom of association.

The Bill’s broad and vague language compounds these risks. Without amendment, it will grant sweeping powers without accountability, putting free expression, peaceful assembly, and democratic participation in danger.

We all want to stop hate crimes and keep people safe in their communities. But Bill C-9, without amendment, will not do that. Instead, it will weaken the very freedoms that keep people safe — the right to speak out, to organize, and to participate fully in society.

We pushed back hard against U.S. tariffs. We must bring that same resolve to opposing legislation that, without amendment, will chip away at our rights here at home.",https://canadianlabour.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Parliament.Statement.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:56:59.706148
