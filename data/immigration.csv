Holding a rosary, the priest quietly says a prayer. The priest is the Rev. Scott Santarosa, and he’s accompanying the man to his immigration hearing.

The man, whom the Monitor is not naming at the request of his lawyer, has resided in the country with the permission of the U.S. government for 20 years. Then, this spring, the Trump administration reopened his case and set an August court date. Father Santarosa is here both as moral support and to bear witness. The man’s family is afraid that he might be taken into detention after his hearing.

Several yards away, half a dozen volunteers wait to pray with the Jesuit priest before beginning their morning shift as witnesses in court. The volunteers are with FAITH – a coalition that includes San Diego’s Catholic Diocese, a mosque, and an interfaith group – which organizes a daily presence in immigration court.

Why We Wrote This

The idea of sanctuary has long been embraced by communities of faith. Religious leaders and volunteers are finding new ways to apply the concept, including by being present with immigrants at courthouse hearings.

Since early August, FAITH – Faithful Accompaniment in Trust & Hope – has organized priests, imams, and other leaders, as well as about 100 community members, to sit in courtrooms and accompany people who request their presence for hearings. Similar efforts are happening around the United States. Earlier this summer, clergy from the San Diego Diocese, led by Bishop Michael Pham, attended immigration court after a Mass dedicated to World Refugee Day.

Father Santarosa and others interviewed say this work is central to their faith, relating to the Hebrew and Christian injunction to “Welcome the stranger” and to follow the golden rule, to love one’s neighbor as oneself.

“Loving thy neighbor is the basis of all my beliefs,” says volunteer Brittany Lostetter. “That’s why I’m here.”

Not all Christians agree with that view. For a lot of evangelical and Protestant congregations, says Gina Pérez, a professor at Oberlin College in Ohio, following the rule of law is integral to what it means to be a faithful Christian. People who come from those denominations that emphasize law and authority as privileged values may support current immigration enforcement because “It’s been framed in such a way that these are people who’ve broken the law,” she says.

That may or may not be the case. Immigration court is actually not part of the U.S. judiciary. Instead, it is a bureaucratic system that exists under the executive branch. Immigration judges do have legal training, but the people appearing before them may or may not have been charged with any crimes. Instead, the questions are, say, whether an asylum claim is allowed to proceed. In the U.S., overstaying a visa is a civil infraction, while entering the country illegally is a misdemeanor for a first offense.

The presence of clergy and volunteers is important, says Father Santarosa. On this day, he and a bishop are accompanying people who specifically requested their help. The remaining volunteers fan out across the hallway or sit in courtrooms when there’s space.

“We’re wanting to be a prayerful, peaceful presence,” says the priest, reminding volunteers not to react if law enforcement is difficult when they enter the building or stand inside, a posture he says is not uncommon, although the public is allowed to be present.

In January, when the Department of Homeland Security announced it would no longer recognize churches as “protected areas,” religious leaders objected. Providing sanctuary to vulnerable people is an ancient tradition in many faiths, and several of the lawsuits filed were on the grounds that the government violated the right to practice that aspect of faith.

Our Lady of Guadalupe parish, led by Father Santarosa, is a plaintiff in a suit challenging the Trump administration’s reversal of a directive barring immigration enforcement at sensitive locations such as churches, schools, and hospitals. That directive had been in place during several previous administrations, including President Donald Trump’s first term.

Such measures are necessary, says the Trump administration, which has been critical of illegal immigration levels under the president’s predecessor and has responded with increased enforcement.

The number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. reached a record high of 14 million in 2023, according to new estimates released this month by the Pew Research Center, relying on U.S. census data. During the first six months of the Trump administration, Pew estimates, the number of immigrants residing in the U.S. dropped for the first time in 50 years, by more than 1 million.

No arrests at churches have been the result of targeted enforcement, says Todd Lyons, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in an interview with the Monitor. “If a foot chase happens for two blocks and they run into a church, we’re going to follow them into a church,” he says. But “There is no plan to go target anyone at a church, a school, or hospitals.”

Roots of a movement

The Sanctuary Movement in the U.S. coalesced in the 1980s, at a time when asylum was denied to Central and South Americans facing war and dire conditions in their home countries. Churches, particularly along the southern border of the U.S., mobilized as shelters. Over the decades, the effort has taken different forms. During President Trump’s first administration, many houses of worship designated themselves as sanctuary congregations.

The actions that faith communities today are taking all fall within an expanding idea of sanctuary, says Dr. Pérez, author of a recent book on the subject.

“There’s a recognition that there are other kinds of work and organizing and advocacy, and that can and should be done to provide that sense of safety and protection to vulnerable people, whether they’re migrants or not,” she says.

Centuries ago, sanctuary was the “privileging of particular kinds of places as places of refuge and safety, where people would turn to appeal to the authority of the Divine, of God, over the power of the state,” says Dr. Pérez.

In its earlier iterations, sanctuary was, in fact, for the guilty.

“The collar is super powerful”

At the San Diego courthouse, Ms. Lostetter and other volunteers line up against the wall near the courtrooms. A handful of agents stand at the end of the hall, some wearing sweatshirts or vests imprinted with “ICE” or “Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” All have face coverings. One counts the number of volunteers, and soon, more agents arrive, about a dozen total. They divide into two groups, moving to stand on either side of the volunteers.

During their shifts, FAITH volunteers look for ways to comfort people. For instance, one mother tried to shield her young children from seeing the masked agents outside the courtroom as they left their hearing. Volunteers stepped in to chat with the children, giving the mother a moment to regroup.

When it is the man’s turn to appear, there is a reprieve. Even though his lawyer expected him to be taken into custody, he is allowed to leave with his family.

While there is a perception that people appearing in immigration court must have committed a crime of some sort, most of her clients have never been arrested, says his lawyer, Crystal Felix.

“The narrative is that these folks are criminals, but a priest next to them fights that false narrative,” she says. She started asking faith leaders to accompany her clients in May.

“The collar is super powerful, and it impacts how ICE agents behave,” says Ms. Felix, adding that it also seems to have an effect on the trial attorneys and judges. As a Catholic herself, she finds priests bring a peaceful and calming presence.

“Pursuing my faith”

In addition to participating in FAITH, Our Lady of Guadalupe, which Father Santarosa says is known as an immigrant parish, is looking for ways to support its own congregants.

“In this atmosphere, just being a person of faith is a resistance,” the priest says. “I’m resisting the fear being put on me just by pursuing my faith.”

Though some parishioners have stayed away out of fear, he’s noticed many returning. While people might have friends or family shop for them, they realize they can’t have someone else attend Mass for them. “I know I need this now more than ever,” his congregants have told him.

At the end of the court day, he says he’ll think back on the man he accompanied, who was grateful for his presence, and the smile on his mother’s face when she saw the priest.

“Did we do anything to change the outcome? Probably not,” he says. “But they felt our support.”",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/08/0814%20FWITNESS%20father%20Santarosa%20LEDE.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-08-30 06:56:37.436383

The handful who entered the lion’s den were met with boos, jeers and tense confrontations.

President Donald Trump and the Republicans may have full control of Washington, but protesters spared neither political party. At 25 town halls across the country that were viewed or attended by NBC News this summer, voters pressured Democrats to deploy more aggressive tactics as they battle Trump and took them to task over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

Meanwhile, Republicans faced hostile crowds over their support for Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” his nationwide immigration crackdown and Trump’s deployment of federal forces to Washington, D.C., in what he has called an effort to crack down on crime.

The hostile tone is not a huge surprise, given that town halls tend to attract fired-up activists who want nothing more than to turn up the heat on their elected officials. But these public events provide a snapshot of our nation’s white-hot politics in the first quarter of Trump’s tumultuous second term.

Trump immigration moves flare up

“Alligator Alcatraz,” masked agents carrying out ICE raids, third-country deportations: Anger at Trump’s immigration blitz was palpable at town halls across the country, in districts represented by both Democrats and Republicans.

It was the central focus of questions at Wisconsin GOP Rep. Bryan Steil’s town hall in late July, as attendees lambasted the congressman’s efforts to blame former President Joe Biden’s policies for the country’s immigration problems.

“What I see happening to our immigrant population embarrasses me, and you have not raised a voice to complain about it,” one attendee told Steil. “Where do I see your leadership? I see no leadership. I see following Trump 100% of the time.”

The biggest crowd reactions of the night came in response to Steil’s introductory remarks celebrating border security, which then prompted an attendee to shout, “We are all immigrants.”

In Virginia in late July, frustrations surrounding the Trump administration’s handling of immigration pulled focus away from Social Security and Medicaid at Democratic Rep. Jennifer McClellan’s town hall geared toward senior citizens.

While McClellan directed attendees to keep their questions geared toward senior issues, the audience asked more questions about immigration than any other subject, expressing concerns about deportations and immigration raids. Among the only times McClellan drew applause where when she condemned the Trump administration’s handling of deportations and its use of “Alligator Alcatraz,” a migrant detention center in Florida that a federal judge has ordered closed.

“I hope that when we enforce our immigration policy — whether it’s who we detain, who we deport — that we do so consistent with American values of due process and compassion,” McClellan said.

Following the town hall in North Chesterfield, McClellan told NBC News she had expected immigration to be a recurring topic because of recent ICE activity in her district.

“There’s been so much ICE activity here in Chesterfield County that’s impacted people of all ages,” McClellan said, adding that “people of all walks of life have … reached out and said they’re concerned about it.”

Democrats’ focus on GOP Medicaid cuts seems to be working

A month after Trump signed his sweeping “big, beautiful bill” into law, its nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, and health care more broadly, dominated some GOP town halls — a sign that Democrats’ early messaging on the legislation is having its desired effect.

Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said his office had been inundated with calls about the cuts in the bill he voted for, so he decided to address the issue head-on during a town hall in Lincoln on Aug. 4.

“Medicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid, Medicaid — that was the No. 1 issue,” Flood, the chairman of Republicans’ Main Street Caucus, told NBC News.

He said he spent a good deal of his event trying to explain to people on Medicare — which provides health care for seniors, while Medicaid is for low-income people — that their coverage would not be cut under the GOP legislation. “It didn’t touch Medicare,” he told attendees.

The law imposes new 80-hour-per-month work requirements for able-bodied adults, ages 19 to 64, who receive Medicaid benefits.

“They’ve got the bejesus scared out of them,” Flood said in a phone interview, referring to what he described as an audience of mostly seniors. “They think that they’re going to lose their health care, you know? And that’s not the case.”

Flood conceded to the audience at the University of Nebraska that the Trump bill wasn’t perfect but argued it cut taxes, would “provide certainty” for Americans and “protects Medicaid” by shoring up the program. Responding to other questions, Flood said one way to bring down the cost of health insurance was to “not have as many people on Medicaid.” He also told the crowd the country “can’t afford” Medicare for All.

Some replied by chanting “Yes, you can!” while others booed and jeered Flood.

Across the country in another college town, Chico, California, Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa was also getting an earful about the Medicaid cuts in Trump’s big bill. LaMalfa responded by echoing GOP leaders, who have insisted the tax and spending cuts act doesn’t cut Medicaid but simply “reforms” it.

“There’s not cuts for Medicaid,” LaMalfa said, sparking an emotional reaction from the crowd.

The new work requirements and other changes are projected to cut nearly $1 trillion in federal Medicaid spending over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

One attendee named Cecilia, who said she was a constituent from Chico, stayed with the Medicaid topic and came prepared with statistics. “How do you justify voting yes on the big, ugly bill,” she said, using a Democratic nickname for the Trump bill, “knowing that 43% of your constituents — the highest of any California congressional district — received Medicaid and other government assistance?”

LaMalfa, who represents a safe GOP district and held five town halls over the summer recess, replied that changes to the Trump law could be made in the future. That would be an uphill fight, however, given how difficult it was for Republicans to pass the Trump legislation on a party-line basis.

“OK, so this bill is not going to be the be all, end all. … It’s not the end of the discussion. It’s not the end of the legislation,” LaMalfa said.

“That’s bulls---!” one attendee shot back.

Democrats feel the heat on the party’s direction after Trump’s win

Democratic lawmakers were also pressed about the direction of their party at several town halls. Attendees asked how Democrats will combat Trump’s agenda and turn the party’s trajectory around following the 2024 presidential election loss.

“There’s no one running to save us,” Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., said of the Democratic Party to a crowd in Steamboat Springs. “There is no panacea. There’s no master plan. It is about doing the work, developing and building coalitions.”

At several town halls, fellow Colorado Democrat and gubernatorial candidate Sen. Michael Bennet said that the Democratic Party “should have never lost” the 2024 presidential election and called Trump’s victory “catastrophic.”

Bennet added that Democrats must run on more than just opposition to Trump.

“He’s not doing anything, basically, that he didn’t promise to do when he was running for office, which is part of the problem, when he built a majority coalition to get elected president and we couldn’t stop it. Knowing what we know about it sitting in this room … we have to ask ourselves, ‘Why are we not able to build a governing coalition to beat them either time?’” Bennet said.

In Michigan, before an audience of mostly white seniors in a Republican district represented by Rep. Bill Huizenga, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., warned that young people are “disillusioned” and feel “left out” of Democratic politics. She emphasized that Democrats want to see a “new generation of leaders,” pointing to Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor in New York City.

“[Democrats] are willing to take someone new, or that they may not know a ton about, rather than the kind of warmed-over leftovers, right? And so, I think, to me, that signal couldn’t be sent any clearer,” she said.

A Dem town hall is shut down over Gaza crisis

The political handling of the ongoing war in Gaza continues to haunt Democrats, as constituents across the country continuously interrupted town halls to voice their anger at U.S. politicians for not doing more — and in one case, shut down the town hall.

Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., canceled his town hall after nine pro-Palestinian protesters “took over the stage, shouting and disrupting” the ongoing event, according to the Renton Police Department. Smith posted on X that the behavior displayed by the protesters was “unacceptable,” calling it a “coordinated” effort “to shut down public dialogue” and alleging that one of his staff was “was physically assaulted during the chaos.”

Three protesters at Smith’s event were later arrested on trespassing charges, police said.

A day later in Rhode Island, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., held a joint, two-hour town hall where they faced consistent disruptions and questions about their stances on Israel and Gaza.

In July, Reed voted in favor of a resolution introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to prohibit the sale of certain assault rifles to Israel, but he voted against a second Sanders resolution that applied to bomb sales, which attendees reminded Reed of — through shouts of “but not bombs” when the Rhode Island senator highlighted his vote.

Magaziner didn’t say how he would vote if a bill banning arms to Israel reached the House floor. Instead, he told the heated audience that he would “judge it through the lens of, how do we end the atrocities? What is the most effective way to do that?” — an answer that did not seem to satisfy the crowd.

Rep. Steven Cohen, D-Tenn., criticized Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a Memphis town hall, mentioning that he did not attend Netanyahu’s addresses to Congress in 2015 or 2024, and adding he has “no respect” for the Israeli leader.

However, Cohen faced boos when he declined to say outright that there is a genocide in Gaza, instead saying the situation “has some aspects of a genocide.”

“There is a definition of genocide,” Cohen said. “Whether all the aspects are met. I do not know.”

Despite her staunchly progressive and pro-Palestinian record, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., still faced shouts of “shame” and “you are wrong” for not denouncing defensive aid for Israel during her Seattle town hall in early August.

Physical clashes but no major security breach

The June assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman put lawmakers in both parties on edge. Security was top of mind for many lawmakers who opted to hold town halls.

At their August events, they faced a barrage of boos and heckles, and were shouted down; Flood said he was greeted with middle fingers. But for the most part, the protests were peaceful.

But there was one major clash between protesters and security at the end of a town hall hosted by freshman Rep. Wesley Bell, D-Mo., who sparred with pro-Palestinian attendees throughout the two-hour event over his support for Israel.

“I’m a Missouri congressman, and the ‘M’ doesn’t stand for the Middle East,” said Bell, who ousted progressive Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., in a primary last year.

As the St. Louis town hall ended, officials tried to clear the room, but some refused to leave. Video posted on social media shows police and private security personnel hired by Bell shoving protesters to the ground and grabbing one by the neck and hair.

The St. Louis Police Department said on X that “many” of the officers involved were not members of its department, so it couldn’t discuss tactics. The department said it was not aware of any arrests. Asked about the altercation, a Bell spokesperson sent NBC News a statement that did not mention it explicitly: “Despite the efforts of the protestors, he found it gratifying to engage with his constituents on the most pressing issues in their lives, and he will not shy away from holding more town halls in the future.”

Before holding a series of town halls in Oklahoma, GOP Rep. Josh Brecheen warned on X that anyone disrupting his events would be asked to leave or removed by law enforcement.

Flood, the Nebraska Republican, takes a different approach. He said he follows security guidance from the House sergeant at arms whenever he hosts public events and that he coordinated with University of Nebraska police, who sent several officers to the town hall. But he told officers that he didn’t want people removed from the town hall if they were expressing their opinion.

“People are literally screaming, flipping me off. They are jumping up and down. They are standing with their back to me,” Flood recounted. “None of those folks get asked to leave.”

GOP Rep. Barry Moore, who is running for the Senate in Alabama, was also heckled and shouted down during his Wednesday town hall in Daphne. Things got really tense 40 minutes into the event, after Moore said noncitizens are not protected by “due process.”

“False! Lies! … Shame! Shame!” attendees shouted at him.

Without saying another word, Moore withdrew to the back of the room, then slipped out a back door.

“Bye, Felicia!” a man yelled at Moore.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250805-Mike-Flood-1-aa-256-70853d.jpg",N,,2025-08-30 07:57:18.412160

After the shooting, First Lady Melania Trump called for more preemptive interventions to stop potential shooters.","The month before a shooter opened fire on children gathered in a Minnesota church this week, the Trump administration cut funding in the state for efforts to identify potential mass shooters and head off their violence.

The grants were ended as part of $18.5 million in cuts to a Homeland Security program that the Trump administration decried as partisan and unsuccessful — but which some experts and lawmakers say bolsters work to spot early warning signs of mass shooters like Robin Westman, who died of self-inflicted wounds after killing two children and wounding 18 others at a Catholic Mass on Wednesday.

“The capacity to combat domestic terrorism is eroding,” said Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It seems like the eye has been taken off the ball in terms of domestic terrorism prevention in this country – that terrorism is not that major a concern.”

Even Westman—in journal writings—questioned not being identified as a potential threat by authorities.

“Should be harder for people like me to carry out these attacks,” Westman wrote at one point. Another time the shooter thought some purchases would draw suspicion. “I have been showing signs for a while, I need to be stopped! I don’t want to abandon my plan, but I really want to be stopped for the sake of my family.”

The scuttled grants, which were run by the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3), an arm of DHS, had funded local programs at the Minnesota Department of Public Safety and Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office to assess and manage mass violence threats.

In July, DHS pulled the funds to the two local agencies, which totaled about $800,000. A letter from DHS shared with CNN alleged the money had gone to “openly partisan and political organizations.”

On Friday, a DHS spokesperson defended that decision, saying in a statement that “the grant program previously administered by CP3 was nothing more than a slush fund for left-wing ideologies, and did next to nothing to combat actual threats in our communities.”

But some lawmakers say that argument is baseless and that yanking the grants has left the state less equipped to prevent tragedies like this week’s attack at Annunciation Catholic School.

The cancelation of that grant “limits our state law enforcement from access to vital federal counterterrorism partners and resources and leaves Minnesota communities more vulnerable to violent attacks,” said Democratic Rep. Betty McCollum, one of six Democratic lawmakers who sent a letter to DHS earlier this month imploring the agency to reinstate the grant to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

That letter referenced the shooting of state lawmakers in June and cited violence directed at religious organizations and threats to schools. “Never in our worst nightmares could we have imagined another tragedy occurring so soon,” McCollum said on Friday.

It’s impossible to say whether any programs could have prevented Wednesday’s shooting. But authorities have been examining lengthy journals left behind by Westman, some of which raise questions about whether red flags could have prevented the shooter from obtaining the guns used in the attack.

According to the journals, Westman had recently broken up with a long-term partner, bought three firearms in one month, began frequenting gun ranges, and quit a job at a local marijuana dispensary.

Westman wrote, “I have dropped a few warning signs to a few people. Nothing crazy, but if I did something, they would say it was obvious in hindsight.”

The programs administered by CP3 were aimed at bolstering local communities in recognizing those kinds of signs – though there has long been criticism of their efficacy. When the Biden administration announced the initiative in 2021, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union criticized such programs as “ineffective, discriminatory and harmful to Muslims and communities of color.”

Still, law enforcement agencies and other groups have shown high demand for funding through the program. A DHS report last year stated 178 organizations applied for what added up to more than five times the available funding. The report touted various incidents where the programs have been useful, such as a sheriff’s office responding to online threats of mass violence and charging an individual, a neo-Nazi being encouraged to access mental health services and a hospital referring a troubled student to a support clinic.

The grant for Minnesota’s Department of Public Safety specifically references school shooters, stating that the funds would help create a statewide threat assessment and management team and focus on “persons of concern, potential active shooters, school shootings/threats, stalking, and workplace violence.”

For Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, the roughly $100,000 grant was meant to be used to “establish a multidisciplinary team” to “engage more actively with mental health professionals, school officials, social workers, and probation officers.”

Those programs could potentially have had an impact on identifying Westman, some experts and officials said.

“This event in Minneapolis was 100% preventable. This was exactly the kind of event we could have stopped,” said a former DHS employee, who asked not to be named out of fear of their deferred resignation being impacted.

Jill Oliveira, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, said the grant was awarded for behavioral threat assessment and management staff and training, and that because of the cut, the department “made adjustments to free up other resources to cover costs.”

When DHS announced the sweeping cuts to CP3 programs in July, it called the grants “wasteful” and intended to “to push woke, partisan agendas and silencing dissent.”

Asked about the cuts, DHS alleged that “many of these grants went to organizations that celebrated, and encouraged transgenderism in our children.”

It’s unclear what specific programs DHS was referring to, though the July announcement mentioned a grant that had been awarded to a nonprofit focused on LGBTQ issues.

Not all CP3 grants appear to have been canceled. Asked about two grants awarded to the sheriff’s office in Palm Beach County, Florida – where Mar-a-Lago is located – a sheriff’s office spokesperson said the grants are active.

After the shooting, First Lady Melania Trump called for more preemptive interventions to stop potential shooters.

“To prevent future tragedies, it is crucial we look into behavioral threat assessments across all levels of society—beginning in our homes, extending through school districts and of course, social media platforms,” she posted on X. “Being aware of these warning signs and acting quickly can save lives and make American communities safer.”

(KOIN) — After Customs and Border Patrol arrested two firefighters who were working on the Bear Gulch Fire in Washington, immigration attorneys say they can’t find their client.

As KOIN 6 News first reported, two Oregon-based government contractors lost their contracts after an investigation by the Bureau of Land Management. Customs and Border Patrol confirmed that they assisted with the investigation on Thursday, and as a result, two firefighters were detained and charged with illegal entry.

Officials said the suspects were taken to a Customs and Border Patrol facility in Bellingham, Washington, but Innovation Law Lab attorneys have been unable to find one of them.

In a statement shared late Thursday, Innovation Law Lab Attorney Rodrigo Fernandez-Ortega said, “Although we have been searching for him since yesterday afternoon, CBP has concealed his whereabouts—our client has not been able to make contact with his lawyer or family, the ICE detainee locator has never been updated, and our attempts to use the DHS’s systems to locate him failed.”

A spokesperson for the Innovation Law Lab also confirmed the person is an Oregon resident.

The two Oregon-based companies that hired the firefighters, Table Rock Forestry Inc. and ASI Arden Solutions Inc., did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

On Friday morning, a spokesperson from the U.S. Department of the Interior said in an email:

A three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status for Venezuelans while the case proceeded through court.

An email to the Department of Homeland Security for comment was not immediately returned.

The 9th Circuit judges found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior extension of temporary protected status because the governing statute written by Congress does not permit it. Then-President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration had extended temporary protected status for people from Venezuela.

“In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,” Judge Kim Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, wrote for tbe panel. The other two judges on the panel were also nominated by Democratic presidents.

US District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that President Donald Trump’s Republican administration overstepped its authority in terminating the protections and were motivated by racial animus in doing so. Chen ordered a freeze on the terminations, but the Supreme Court reversed him without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.

It is unclear what effect Friday’s ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans in the group of 600,000 whose protections expired in April. Their lawyers say some have already been fired from jobs, detained in immigration jails, separated from their US citizen children and even deported. Protections for the remaining 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire Sept. 10.

Temporary protected status, or TPS, allows the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country.

In ending the protections, Noem said that conditions in Venezuela had improved and that it was not in the US national interest to allow migrants from there to stay on for what is a temporary program.

Millions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. Their country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.

Attorneys for the US government argued the Homeland Security secretary’s clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program were not subject to judicial review. They also denied that Noem’s actions were motivated by racial animus.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/05d9bae109757780bf4dc077d6e865c7,N,,2025-08-30 03:56:53.468704

And the impact of more aggressive tactics by federal law enforcement officers may not be limited to D.C.’s immigrant communities.","It was a seemingly innocuous sign written in Spanish and taped to the side of a bus shelter in Mt. Pleasant in mid-August.

“Today D.C. police announced that they will start to cooperate with ICE,” it read. “They have already detained one person. Treat the police as if they were ICE agents! Don’t speak with them, don’t answer their questions, and keep your distance!”

Whether or not many people saw the sign is unknown, but the sentiment seems to be spreading. Immigrants, attorneys, and advocates in D.C. say that as federal immigration enforcement has dramatically ramped up in the city this month, creeping suspicions that MPD officers are cooperating with the efforts are making residents think twice about calling local police to report crimes they’ve witnessed – or been victims of.

“Sincerely, people don’t even want to call the police,” one Latina resident told The 51st, asking that her name not be published over concerns of her own status. “That has changed a lot.”

That, say attorneys and advocates, not only puts immigrant residents at risk – especially those who may be facing situations of domestic violence – but could also imperil the very public safety that President Trump said justified his federal surge of officers into the city this month. Residents may be less willing to come forward when they’ve witnessed a crime, or appear in court to testify once prosecutors pursue charges.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way. D.C. long held itself up as a sanctuary city, where police wouldn’t ask about immigration status and would limit cooperation on federal immigration enforcement. But with Trump’s surge – and some acquiescence from local leaders – that now seems to be changing.

“For years, we have been telling our clients to report their crimes and to get the immigration relief they are eligible for when cooperating,” says Sandra Benavente, the advocacy manager for Ayuda, a legal and social services organization that works with immigrants who have been victims of crime. “This all upends those 50 years of work.”

A primer on ‘sanctuary’ cities

While the fight over so-called sanctuary jurisdictions – which Trump vehemently opposes – is somewhat recent, the debate over how and when local police should cooperate with immigration enforcement isn’t.

It dates back almost 15 years, when one of the early iterations was an Obama-era program known as Secure Communities, which shared fingerprints taken by local police departments with the Department of Homeland Security – which could then act to detain someone for possible deportation.

While some city officials believed it was a valuable information-sharing tool that could help deport violent offenders, there were also concerns that arrests for minor offenses could trigger an immigration check – thus discouraging immigrants from reporting crimes they witnessed or had been victims of. “In the case of domestic violence, or if it is a minor misdemeanor case, there is a concern people will not come forward and report it,” said Cathy Lanier, then the chief of D.C.’s police department. (Roughly 15% of D.C.’s residents are foreign-born, with longstanding populations from El Salvador and Ethiopia. In 2019, an estimated 21,000 residents were undocumented.)

Then-mayor Vincent Gray spoke out against the Secure Communities program, saying that D.C. was “not going to go about being an immigration agency for the federal government.” In 2011, he signed an executive order forbidding police from inquiring about immigration status, reinforcing related orders by his predecessors. The following year, the D.C. Council passed legislation limiting the city’s cooperation with detainer requests – when federal immigration authorities asked local agencies to hold someone beyond when they should be released from custody. (The council bill mandated that only those charged with “dangerous” offenses be held, and only for an additional 24 hours.)

“We want people who are victims to report crime, and we want witnesses to report crime,” said Councilmember Phil Mendelson at the time.

That sentiment was shared by the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which in 2017 stated that “enforcement of routine civil immigration by police would undermine the trust and cooperation with immigrant communities which are essential elements of community oriented policing.”

The debate sprung back up in 2019 – during the tail end of the first Trump administration – when the council passed a bill strengthening the current law limiting cooperation on detainer requests. (The bill added a requirement for a warrant from a judge for any D.C. agency to comply with a request that some be held so they could be picked up by ICE.) Mayor Muriel Bowser – who had called D.C. a “proud sanctuary city” and provided grants to organizations offering legal assistance to immigrants – signed the bill into law.

Similar “sanctuary city” measures were enacted in liberal cities and jurisdictions across the country, from Arlington County to the state of California.

Trump puts on pressure, and D.C. relents

When Trump took office in January, he immediately started threatening sanctuary jurisdictions across the country. D.C. didn’t escape notice, with House Republicans marshaling a bill that would repeal the city’s sanctuary law.

Bowser, though, beat them to the punch: At the end of May, she quietly inserted a provision into her proposed budget that would have done the same. And she wanted to make sure the White House was aware: The day after her budget was unveiled, one of her senior aides emailed Orville Greene, chairman of a White House task force on D.C., a link to the proposed repeal. “Can you share the reasoning behind the change?” he quickly responded.

Bowser herself had been back and forth on whether D.C. was actually a sanctuary city. Earlier this year, she said it was “misleading to suggest to anyone that if you are violating immigration laws, that this is a place where you can violate immigration laws.” But in a letter she sent to Greene in April responding to a number of questions about D.C. policies and practices, Bowser defended how the city approached immigration.

“MPD has a critical job to make the District of Columbia safe for everyone,” she wrote. “MPD’s policy for more than two decades has been to not ask individuals about immigration status. As law enforcement, MPD knows that when there are groups who hesitate to report crime to the police, they often become targets for serious crime. Allowing that to flourish makes everyone in the city less safe.”

Ultimately, Bowser’s proposed repeal fell flat in the council. But the issue roared back to life this month, when Trump announced his federal surge in D.C., vowing to crack down on crime. Proponents of restricting immigration said that violent crime in the city was linked to illegal immigration (despite data showing that immigrants are not more likely to commit crimes), and questions immediately arose about whether and how MPD officers would be tasked with assisting in immigration enforcement.

An answer quickly came from D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith in mid-August, when she issued a narrow order saying that while the city’s sanctuary law remained in effect, officers could now assist with immigration checks of people not in custody. In practice, this became most evident with traffic checkpoints that MPD started setting up in the city – where local officers would check for traffic violations while ICE agents were free to check on immigration status. Furious immigration advocates called the order a “betrayal.”

The legal status of the city’s overall sanctuary law remains in question. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued her own order requiring local cooperation on immigration enforcement regardless of the city’s law, but the city has asked a federal judge to clarify whether she can actually do that.

“The Trump administration can compel MPD to comply with requests for police services for federal purposes, but that does not mean the law is suspended,” says Julie Mao, the deputy director of Just Futures Law. “What we have here is a police force and federal agents that are operating on the ground and behaving as if it was, and that is very scary.”

Fear has increased

The legal uncertainties – and residents seeing MPD seemingly working with ICE and other federal agents – have left many immigrant residents in fear, says the Latina resident who spoke to The 51st.

“One now sees a police vehicle, and people hide. And that didn’t happen before. Before the police spoke with our children, they would talk to them about becoming police officers, and today if the kids see the police, they – just like their parents – will run and hide. And even the kids who aren’t at risk because they were born here, but they are scared to be left alone. They are scared their parents will be taken away,” she said.

Attorneys and advocates say the impact on public safety could be very real: Immigrants will be less likely to report crimes they witness, and even when they are victims of crimes themselves. This hesitation to call police is especially dangerous for immigrants experiencing domestic abuse, says Katie Parkinson, the social services manager for the Tahirih Justice Center, which works with survivors of violence and domestic abuse.

“Immigrant survivors and victims of crime will be less likely to call police for help, and many migrants are staying behind closed doors for fear of what will happen to them. For those victims and survivors who are experiencing ongoing abuse, their lives are literally at risk and it’s already so dangerous to come out to report what’s happening, especially in those types of situations,” she says. “It’s putting survivors in such extreme danger on top of what they’re already having to experience in their day-to-day lives.”

Parkinson says what has happened in Virginia – where Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an order mandating increased cooperation in immigration enforcement – could be a hint of what might come to pass in D.C. “One of my clients wanted to file for a protective order in Virginia. She was just too afraid to go to the courthouse. She wasn’t going to an ICE check-in, just the general district court. She was afraid to be anywhere near the courthouse,” she says.

The fear to report crimes to police because of possible cooperation with ICE could even imperil undocumented immigrants’ ability to gain legal status. Under existing immigration law, there are two visas – the T and U visas – that allow undocumented victims of crime or human trafficking to apply for legal status if they cooperate with police. But advocates say immigrants are now questioning whether to report crimes, even when doing so would legally allow them to legalize their status.

“We have evidence of our clients expressing fear over whether to submit their U visa certification, whether to report their crime or not,” says Benavente from Ayuda. “If folks aren’t willing to start the process and report the crime, many people across the DMV will lose access to a legal pathway that protects them from deportation.”

‘There is some work to do’

There’s little question that Bowser and D.C. officials have been put in a difficult situation. In trying to protect the city’s broader ability to govern itself, they have tried to hand Trump symbolic wins they thought would dissuade him and congressional Republicans from using their broad powers more aggressively in D.C. And no matter how much the city’s elected officials might protest, there’s nothing they can do to stop ICE from operating in the city.

Bowser has criticized the use of masks by ICE agents, has said that she would rather federal agents only focus on violent crime, and on Thursday made her strongest statements to date when she said that “what has not worked during this period of time is ICE terrorizing communities, especially with masks and especially not having enough information on where people are.”

Immigrant advocates, though, still fault her for proposing the repeal of the city’s sanctuary law. And there has been recognition within the city’s leadership that their initial fear that aggressive immigration enforcement could damage MPD’s relations with immigrant communities is coming to pass.

“Clearly there is some hesitation with some of our community members,” said Chief Smith earlier this week. “We know there is some work to do once the surge ends. We need to make sure we are in our communities again.”

At the same time, Bowser called into question how significant the break in trust might be, saying that there’s been no decrease in calls for police service. Maybe not, says Mao, but the impact could be felt later. “For prosecutions to happen, you need witnesses,” she says.

And the impact of more aggressive tactics by federal law enforcement officers may not be limited to D.C.’s immigrant communities. “Within 11 days, that trust is gone,” said defense attorney Andrew Clarke during a meeting Thursday hosted by Ward 7 Councilmember Wendell Felder, referring more broadly to how many residents may now view MPD.

That sentiment was shared earlier this week during a virtual meeting where Cesar, who is a U.S. citizen, shared his experience of being detained by a number of federal officers working with MPD, as he was driving his work vehicle to a job site. “I don’t know after this who in D.C. is feeling safe,” he told the crowd. (He did not share his last name due to privacy concerns.)

“The fact is, especially lately, when any police department announces its cooperation with immigration authorities, that gives community members the impression that no interaction with local police is safe,” says Parkinson. “And that includes reporting crimes or seeking help.”",https://51st.news/content/images/size/w1200/2025/08/IMG_6160.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 04:57:29.324331

This trend is reflected in figures from the Deportation Data Project, which indicate that from late January to late June of this year, 49% of the 109,000 arrests occurred inside prisons, while 44% took place in communities. These numbers would seem to prove the Trump Administration right when it claims to be going mostly after “criminal immigrants” to make the country a safer place, but records show that most of the foreigners serving a sentence committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations, immigration violations, and other non-violent charges.

To operate inside prisons, the federal agency must follow a protocol that involves sending prison officials a request to detain undocumented inmates. Only when these requests are accepted can agents go to the prison facilities to arrest them again. The main problem the government faces in implementing this strategy—which guarantees quick and low-cost detentions—is sanctuary city policies. In many of them, foreigners are released before ICE officials can take them, which has intensified the struggle between Washington and local authorities in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. Border czar Tom Homan consequently announced an increased ICE presence in these jurisdictions.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons also resents the fact that the jail detention plan cannot be advanced due to local laws protecting immigrants. “If sanctuary cities would change their policies and turn these violent criminal aliens over to us, into our custody, instead of releasing them into the public, we would not have to go out into the communities and do this,” he said in June, referring directly to what happens in his hometown of Boston, where police are not allowed to check the immigration status of detained immigrants. “It really shocks me that officials all over Massachusetts would rather release sex offenders, fentanyl dealers. drug dealers, human traffickers, child rapists back into the neighborhoods.,” he added, despite evidence to the contrary.

ICE tactics by state

A CNN analysis of an ICE report confirms that the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant enforcement arm arrests more immigrants in Republican states than in Democratic states, but not in the same way. In states that voted for President Trump, ICE agents tend to arrest more immigrants directly in prisons and jails; while in blue states, they carry out more mass raids and workplace ambushes.

Statistics through the end of May indicate that 59% of arrests in Republican states took place in prisons, and that 41% of those arrested had criminal records for minor offenses. Meanwhile, in Democratic states, 70% of arrests took place in public spaces, and only 36% of foreigners had a criminal record.

This reality demonstrates how immigrants face truly diverse tactics depending on where they live. For example, in New York, where state and local policies limit police cooperation with ICE, only 4% of immigrants sought by the federal agency were arrested in jails; but in Mississippi, a state that has not enacted any immigration enforcement laws, 87% of undocumented foreigners in detention were handed over to ICE.

The arrest machine continues to seek to increase its capacity to try to achieve the goal of one million deportees by the end of 2025. A growing number of local and state police forces, primarily in Republican states, continue to sign up to collaborate with ICE in the effort to capture a greater number of illegal immigrants. The recently passed “Big and Beautiful” tax law will also give the government billions of dollars in extra money to boost its immigration agenda, but the figures indicate that sanctuary cities remain the major stumbling block to the Republican president’s plans.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/V2AIFWQEPFGTJET6URQIYDK64A.jpg?auth=80c1267430a5c34f04f02bd73e490d5d0c8c9abe28772903a1b69902311e0a13&width=1200,N,,2025-08-30 04:57:33.581983

About 14,000 migrants en route to the US have returned to South America in what has been described as an unprecedented surge in reverse migration, according to a report Friday.

From January to July, southbound migration saw a dramatic rise, as outlined in a report by the governments of Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica.

The trilateral mission, supported by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, monitored key migration routes and checkpoints across the three countries between July 21 and Aug. 1.

“The mission allowed us to verify that transit restrictions in the Darien jungle, along with stricter immigration policies in the United States, led to a 97% reduction in irregular northbound migration between January and August 2025,” it said.

It is in stark contrast to the more than 260,000 migrants who made the crossing during the same period in 2024.

The migrants who returned during the period were primarily Venezuelan nationals, accounting for 97% of the documented southward flow, with most heading to neighboring Colombia.

Based on 182 testimonies collected from returnees, the report revealed that 49% of those interviewed said they returned because it was impossible to enter the US, while 46% cited fears of detention and deportation as their main reason for turning back.

The study also shed light on the violence that is prevalent along migration routes in the region. Armed robbery, extortion and sexual violence, particularly against women and young girls, were identified as the most common crimes committed against migrants.

According to the report, 86.8% of migrants either experienced violence directly or witnessed abuses along the paths.

The reverse migration is unfolding amid a suspension of international humanitarian aid, leaving vulnerable populations without the protection that is historically offered by local humanitarian organizations.

""When your name becomes associated with terror and you refuse to speak, you are complicit,"" said Jurado. ""Home Depot has chosen power and profit over the working people who sustain it.""

UPDATE: A spokesperson for Home Depot responded:

""We aren’t notified that ICE activities are going to happen, and in many cases, we don't know that arrests have taken place until after they're over,"" Home Depot spokesperson Sarah McDonald. ""We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.""

Plans emerged last week to replace the former Macy’s building on Colorado Boulevard with a 128,266-square-foot Home Depot, complete with truck and equipment rentals, trailer and shed displays, and a garden center.

The company is in the early stages of the entitlement process on the property, McDonald said.

Federal immigration officers have been conducting sweeping raids on Home Depots throughout Los Angeles since June, including in Cypress Park and Westlake.

Jurado noted in her statement that ICE agents conducted their fourth warrantless raid on the Westlake location just yesterday. Eight people were arrested near the CARECEN Day Labor Center next to the hardware superstore, according to ABC7.

On Aug. 27, the Port Angeles Border Patrol Station provided assistance to the Bureau of Land Management on the Olympic Peninsula. BLM, working alongside U.S. Forest Service, requested assistance from the U.S. Border Patrol as work contracts with two firms were terminated. Contracts with Table Rock Forestry Inc. and ASI Arden Solutions Inc. were terminated following the conclusion of a criminal investigation by BLM.

Due to the remote location of the work site, BLM requested USBP assistance verifying the identities of all personnel present. The work crews, totaling 44 individuals, required identity verification to ensure that the individuals on-site matched the contractor rosters.

USBP agents supported BLM rangers in verifying the identities of the contracted personnel. Several discrepancies were identified, and two individuals were found to be present in the United States illegally, one with a previous order of removal. The two individuals were arrested and transported to the Bellingham Station on charges of illegal entry and 8 US Code 1326 - Reentry of removed aliens. Forty-two individuals were released from the scene and escorted off Federal lands.

While it will almost certainly be appealed, Friday's order is a major setback for the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, including its campaign to arrest asylum-seekers at immigration courthouses across the U.S. — an operation that has relied on the expansion of expedited removal.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb paused a January directive that had expanded the expedited removal policy — long limited to border areas and recent arrivals — to anywhere in the country and to those who arrived in the past two years.

Expedited removal allows federal immigration officials to quickly deport certain migrants, without allowing them to see an immigration judge, unless they claim asylum and pass an interview with a U.S. asylum officer. Before President Trump took office for a second time, the fast-track deportations only applied to unauthorized migrants apprehended within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.

Cobb said the pro-immigrant advocates who challenged the legality of the nationwide expansion of expedited removal had made a ""strong showing"" that the effort ""violates the due process rights of those it affects.""

TRUMP'S 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS COULD HIT A SNAG IN COURT TODAY. HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW

Revenue from tariffs totaled $142 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before. Congress has the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But, in recent decades, lawmakers have ceded authority to the president, The Associated Press reported.

At issue was the legality of Trump’s attempt to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — a 1977 emergency law — to enact the steep import fees and impose additional tariffs on certain trading partners.

The Trump administration argued that courts approved President Richard Nixon’s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis that arose from the chaos that followed his decision to end a policy linking the U.S. dollar to the price of gold, according to the AP.

Trump used the IEEPA law to enact the tariffs during his April 2 ""Liberation Day"" event.

While these firms have seen short-term stock gains due to increased funding and contracts, long-term regulatory risks and legal challenges loom large, complicating their financial trajectories.

Short-Term Gains Amid Political Alignment

The OBBBA allocated $45 billion for immigration detention and $32 billion for enforcement operations, with 90% of ICE funding directed to private contractors [2]. This surge has driven revenue growth for GEO Group and CoreCivic, whose shares rose 73% and 56%, respectively, since the November 2024 election [1]. The companies have reopened idle facilities and secured new contracts, capitalizing on the administration’s emphasis on expanded detention capacity and expedited removal processes [3]. However, these gains are tied to political contributions from the companies and their executives to Trump’s campaign, raising ethical concerns about policy capture [3].

Legal Challenges and Judicial Uncertainty

Recent Supreme Court rulings have introduced legal ambiguities that could undermine enforcement strategies. In Riley v. Bondi, the Court reshaped procedural timelines for removal orders, requiring noncitizens to appeal before their cases are finalized—a move critics argue restricts due process [2]. Additionally, the Court’s rejection of nationwide injunctions in the birthright citizenship case has limited judicial checks on policies like the indefinite refugee ban, which faces scrutiny in Pacito v. Trump [4]. These rulings create a patchwork of legal outcomes, forcing companies to navigate inconsistent enforcement standards across jurisdictions [5].

Long-Term Regulatory Risks

The OBBBA’s $170.7 billion funding over four years for ICE expansion includes provisions for racial profiling via 287(g) programs and extreme vetting measures [2]. While this boosts short-term demand for detention services, it also invites lawsuits over civil rights violations and potential congressional rollbacks. For example, the 311% increase in detention funding by 2029 could strain infrastructure and oversight, leading to overcrowding and public backlash [2]. Employers reliant on immigrant labor also face heightened I-9 audit risks, with penalties reaching $28,000 per unauthorized worker [6].

Investor Implications

For investors, the interplay of political alignment and legal fragility presents a dual-edged sword. Short-term gains are evident, but long-term risks include policy reversals, judicial interventions, and reputational damage from ethical controversies. Companies must balance profit with preparedness for regulatory shifts, such as potential congressional reforms or Supreme Court decisions that could curtail enforcement budgets [5].

Conclusion

Trump’s 2025 immigration agenda has delivered immediate financial benefits to enforcement contractors, but the sector remains exposed to regulatory and legal uncertainties. As courts and Congress continue to challenge the administration’s policies, investors must weigh the allure of rapid growth against the potential for systemic disruptions. The path forward demands not only political agility but also robust compliance frameworks to navigate an increasingly contested landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 01:56:59.934014

Meanwhile, a government attorney said Judge Theresa Scala does not have bond jurisdiction in this case because Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry, who was taken into ICE custody last week during a naturalization appointment in Tukwila, has a previous order of removal.

Chaudhry entered the U.S. on a tourist visa and later became a legal permanent resident through marriage to a U.S. citizen. The government has since sought to rescind his green card, claiming that he failed to disclose a prior conviction on his paperwork and misrepresented his citizenship status when applying for a position at the Yakima Police Department.

Bond is typically determined by a few factors, starting with whether the judge has jurisdiction over a person’s case. If a person is eligible for a bond, a judge will evaluate factors such as whether the person is a flight risk or a danger to the community.

This question of jurisdiction has become the subject of multiple lawsuits, including one aimed at a recent Trump administration policy change that seeks to deny bond hearings to detainees who entered the country without permission.

RELATED: Immigrants in the US illegally fight the Trump administration's new no-bail policy

It’s unlikely that this policy is at play in Chaudhry’s case because he’s had legal status in the U.S. since he arrived 25 years ago. During the hearing, a government attorney was unable to access one of Chaudhry’s ongoing court cases because the documents are “locked and restricted.”

The Chaudhrys and their family and friends say much of this is a result of a United States Citizenship and Immigration Service entering his application under what’s called the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program or CARRP. Chaudhry is originally from Pakistan.

Sponsored

The list reportedly targets people from Muslim-majority countries, people who speak other languages, and people with advanced degrees, all based on frequently vague associations with people on a separate U.S. terrorism watchlist. People who are targeted by CARRP face a delayed naturalization process under what’s called ""extreme vetting,” sometimes becoming undocumented and eligible for deportation.

The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled earlier this year that the federal government’s use of the program was “arbitrary and capricious,” and violated federal laws.

RELATED: Under Trump’s ICE, people without criminal history increasingly targeted in WA

Chaudhry’s family said he chose to represent himself during the bond hearing, although he’s been in contact with several attorneys since his detention.

He told Judge Scala that he hasn’t been able to contact the ICE officials managing his case or retrieve documents that were taken from him during his arrest, including his children's birth certificates and his military papers. Detainees are provided access to a phone, where they can call to talk to their deportation officer.

“I don’t know my deportation officer,” he said, “Nobody picked up the phone, I call it every day.”

Muhammed Chaudhry served in the National Guard as a mental health specialist in the early 2000s. While he served in the National Guard, his team was later deployed under Operation Iraqi Freedom but he stayed in the states to continue his work and was deployed to different parts of the country, he told Scala. Chaudhry continued to serve in the military until he was medically retired in 2005 after an injury.

Last week, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service enacted new policies to increase scrutiny of people in the naturalization process. The new policies include increased scrutiny of anything officials deem “anti-American,” including what officials consider anti-Semitic views, or who are supportive of terrorist organizations. The Chaundrys were vocal about what’s commonly referred to as Israel’s genocide and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, especially in the Gaza strip.

Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office.","A federal appeals court said Friday that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on dozens of countries earlier this year are not legally permissible.

The ruling will not immediately block the tariffs, but it marks a significant blow to Mr. Trump's signature trade strategy.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a lower court decision that found many of Mr. Trump's tariffs on foreign goods exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws. However, the appellate judges vacated the lower court's injunction blocking the tariffs altogether, directing the court to reevaluate whether universal relief is appropriate.

The ruling applies to a series of April executive orders that imposed 10% baseline tariffs on virtually every country and higher ""reciprocal"" tariffs on dozens of trading partners. It also applies to a separate set of tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China to pressure those three countries to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and unauthorized immigration.

The court's ruling will not take effect until October to give the Trump administration a chance to ask the Supreme Court to take up the case.

Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post on Friday, calling the appeals court ""Highly Partisan"" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.

""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" he wrote.

Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed to appeal the ruling, which she said ""undermines the United States on the world stage"" and is ""interfering with the President's vital and constitutionally central role in foreign policy.""

Friday's ruling came as part of a monthslong legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses. Mr. Trump has legally justified his sweeping import taxes by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during national emergencies. The law does not explicitly mention tariffs.

The appeals court said the provision of IEEPA that mentions regulating imports does not give the president the right to impose unlimited tariffs. It called the right to levy tariffs ""a core Congressional power,"" and noted that past presidents have typically used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not tariffs.

""It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,"" the court wrote late Friday afternoon. ""The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.""

A lower court, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or USCIT, issued a similar ruling that found the tariffs illegal in May and ordered Mr. Trump's import duties to be frozen. That ruling was stayed by the appeals court so it could review the case.

While the appellate court affirmed USCIT's ruling on the merits of the tariffs, it said the lower court needs to take a second look at whether a universal injunction freezing the tariffs across the board is appropriate. It pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling in a birthright citizenship case earlier this year that limited the use of universal injunctions.

Tariffs have been a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy since he returned to office. He unveiled massive ""reciprocal"" tariffs against dozens of trading partners on ""Liberation Day"" in early April, before quickly halting most of those duties to give his administration time to negotiate new trade agreements. Earlier this month, he unveiled a new slate of tariffs against more than 60 countries, in some cases striking deals with certain trading partners that lowered their tariff rates — but still left them with higher duties than before ""Liberation Day.""

Mr. Trump argues that steeper tariffs are necessary to correct what he views as unfair trade practices and revive American manufacturing. He has also used tariffs to pressure China on fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, Brazil on its prosecution of a Trump-aligned former president, and India on its trade relationship with Russia.

But critics — and many economists — warn that the tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices. Some of Mr. Trump's early trade moves rattled financial markets, though major stock indices have rebounded since April's ""Liberation Day"" dive.

Critics also argue that the tariffs exceed Mr. Trump's legal authority. Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs rely on legal theories that have long been championed by conservative judges. Those include the ""major questions doctrine,"" which holds that Congress needs to give a federal agency clear authorization to decide issues of major political or economic significance.

The case was filed by the Colorado Attorney General’s Office after Mesa County Deputy Andrew Zwinck allegedly shared details of a traffic stop in a group message that included members of Homeland Security Investigations, leading to the detention of Caroline Dias-Goncalves on June 5.

Dias-Goncalves, 19, has no criminal record and was attending the University of Utah on a merit scholarship. In Colorado, local and state law enforcement and peace officers are prevented from aiding federal law enforcement officers with civil immigration efforts, which is what Dias-Goncalves’ arrest would fall under.

“Based on our findings, the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office should not have had any role in the chain of events leading to Miss Dias-Goncalves’s detention, and I regret that this occurred,” Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell shared in July. “I apologize to Miss Dias-Goncalves.”

Court records show that on Thursday, Aug. 28, a joint stipulation of dismissal without prejudice was filed in the case. The court record says that on Aug. 22, Zwinck filed a declaration that said he is resigning from the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office as of Tuesday, Sept. 2.

The court record says that “as of that date, he will no longer be employed in any Colorado state or political subdivision law enforcement position.” The record also says that the state statute the lawsuit was filed regarding will no longer apply to Zwinck at that point, since he would no longer be a state agency or political subdivision employee.

On Aug. 5, the Mesa County Board of County Commissioners filed a lawsuit against Gov. Jared Polis and Weiser about the ongoing litigation against Zwinck. According to court records accessed Friday evening, that case is still active and a scheduling conference is set for Oct. 7 in Colorado District Court.

“The filing of this complaint is intended to seek legal clarity regarding the role and responsibilities of local law enforcement under current state law, Senate Bill 25-276, and to protect Mesa County’s legal and financial interests,” the board said in a statement.

The board also said that they believe the matter could have and should have been resolved through cooperation, “rather than being turned into political theater.”",https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/06/c4561a01-9433-4bf7-9635-dc15af584d51.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 01:57:37.213471

The plan would also put military officers who have little or no experience with immigration law into roles adjudicating the fates of migrants.
It eliminated a requirement that such judges have substantial experience in immigration law, or that they must already be serving as administrative law judges at other agencies.
That means the largest service, the U.S. Army, would contribute the most military lawyers.
“JAGs are not routinely trained in immigration law, and I believe it would take significant training for them to become competent immigration judges.”","The Trump administration is considering a plan to send about 600 military lawyers to work temporarily as immigration judges, as the White House pushes to increase the rate of deportations, according to more than half a dozen current and former officials.

Moving the lawyers to the Justice Department would bolster the capacity of the immigration system to process a backlog, and insert the military into yet another aspect of domestic life.

As of July, there were nearly 3.8 million pending immigration cases, according to the Justice Department. The plan would also put military officers who have little or no experience with immigration law into roles adjudicating the fates of migrants.

No final decision has been made, and many details remain unclear, according to the current and former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive subject. But, they said, the plan has been under development for several weeks, and its basic outlines have started to circulate among the services.

President Trump has increasingly turned to the military to advance his domestic policy priorities. He has deployed troops to the streets of Los Angeles to protect immigration agents from protesters, and to the nation’s capital as part of a broader surge of federal agents assigned to crack down on crime.

Pentagon and Justice Department spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment. But the White House said in a statement that the administration was “looking at a variety of options to help resolve the significant backlog of immigration cases, including hiring additional immigration judges.”

The statement added: “This should be a priority that everyone — including those waiting for adjudication — can rally around.”

Rear Adm. Donald J. Guter, a retired Navy Judge Advocate General and former president and dean of South Texas College of Law, said that he and other retired military colleagues were aware of the proposal. He criticized it as overreach and raised the possibility of retribution against judge advocates general whose decisions do not align with the administration’s desired outcomes.

“If true, it would be another unprecedented action, and unwise,” Admiral Guter wrote in an email. “It’s another authoritarian step toward militarizing civilian functions, compromises the statutory role of JAGs, reduces readiness and is a specialized area in which the JAGs have no training or experience.”

Unlike courts in the judicial branch, where the Senate confirms judges to life tenure to ensure their independence, immigration courts are part of the executive branch. They are run by the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. Still, while immigration judges are department employees, they are supposed to act as neutral arbiters.

Notably, on Thursday, the Justice Department published a rule change on the website of the Federal Register relaxing criteria for who can serve as a temporary immigration judge. It eliminated a requirement that such judges have substantial experience in immigration law, or that they must already be serving as administrative law judges at other agencies.

The department may designate “any lawyer” as a temporary immigration judge for six months — a period that can be renewed indefinitely. The administration’s description of the change promoted the increased “flexibility,” while rejecting critics who raised doubts about whether it would increase the risk of biased judges.

The planning for temporarily bolstering the ranks of immigration judges with military lawyers appears to be centered in the office of the Pentagon general counsel, Earl G. Matthews, whom the Senate confirmed at the end of July, the people briefed on the matter said.

The idea is to pull military lawyers from the Judge Advocate General, or JAG, corps of every service, sourced from active-duty, reserves and the National Guard, roughly in proportion to the size of the available members of each branch, the people said. That means the largest service, the U.S. Army, would contribute the most military lawyers.

But many details remain unclear. They include how much training in immigration law the judge advocates general would receive; how long the assignments would last; whom the lawyers would report to; whether they would be sent to immigration centers or would handle hearings through video teleconferencing; which budget would pay for the effort; and what would happen to the work the lawyers are doing now.

Shortly after taking office, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired the top JAG officers of the Army and Air Force. The position at the Navy was already vacant. Mr. Hegseth has long made clear his hostility toward military lawyers.

He has insulted them as “jagoffs,” and has blamed them for what he saw as unduly restrictive rules of engagement on the battlefield. He also questioned whether it made sense to obey the Geneva Conventions, a core ethos of JAG lawyers.

The retired Maj. Gen. Charles J. Dunlap Jr. of the Air Force, who was a deputy Judge Advocate General, expressed concern about the disconnect between military lawyer training and immigration law.

“While JAGs do have experience in various administrative hearings, I doubt many have ever even seen an immigration court session,” he said. “JAGs are not routinely trained in immigration law, and I believe it would take significant training for them to become competent immigration judges.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/29/multimedia/29dc-military-fbgq/29dc-military-fbgq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 21:56:49.048996

""Congress can choose to vote to rescind or continue the funds—it doesn't matter,"" the White House said in a statement to Politico.
Alternatively, the White House could ask Congress to amend the ICA to allow pocket rescissions.
Currently, the law does not permit that, which means the White House is once again flouting federal law in its pursuit of greater executive power.","President Donald Trump's decision to cancel nearly $5 billion in federal aid without congressional authorization appears to be a straightforward violation of federal law.

The White House announced Friday morning that Trump would nix $4.9 billion in foreign aid by simply refusing to spend the money. The so-called ""pocket rescission"" would include $3.2 billion from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and about $1.7 billion from various State Department programs that distribute funds to international organizations and peacekeeping efforts, according to The New York Post, which first reported on the maneuver.

While that spending might be wasteful or foolish, the president does not have the authority to refuse to spend money that has been appropriated by Congress—though the Trump administration seems eager to challenge that limitation on executive power.

""Congress can choose to vote to rescind or continue the funds—it doesn't matter,"" the White House said in a statement to Politico. ""This approach is rare but not unprecedented.""

Of course, something can be rare and not unprecedented while still being unlawful.

The laws that govern the federal budget process—most importantly, the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA)—allow presidents to make rescission requests to Congress. Trump did that earlier this year, and lawmakers followed through by cutting $9 billion in previously approved spending. The law also allows the executive branch to freeze funding for up to 45 days while Congress considers such a request.

Ross Vought, the director of the White House budget office, has argued that the executive branch can use that 45-day window to do exactly what Trump is now attempting: cancel any spending during the final 45 days of the fiscal year, which ends on September 30. ""By withholding the cash for that full timeframe—regardless of action by Congress—the White House would treat the funding as expired when the current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30,"" Politico explained earlier this year.

Vought is wrong about that.

""The President has no unilateral authority to impound funds,"" the Government Accountability Office (GAO) concluded in 2018 when it was asked by the House Budget Committee to examine the question of pocket rescissions. ""We conclude that the ICA does not permit the impoundment of funds through their date of expiration. The plain language of the ICA permits only the temporary withholding of budget authority and provides that unless Congress rescinds the amounts at issue, they must be made available for obligation.""

Indeed, if the president were allowed to cancel any federal spending within the final 45 days of the fiscal year, then he could effectively cancel any federal spending at any time—by delaying the release of funds until the end of the year, then canceling them.

Tempting as that might sound to anyone who wants to see the government spend less money, the administration must follow the legal processes for budgets and rescissions. Congress holds the power of the purse in our system of government, and further eroding congressional responsibility for spending decisions will not end well.

Republicans in Congress have been openly critical of the White House's talk about implementing pocket rescissions. Now that the Trump administration has taken this step, the responses from Republican lawmakers will be telling.

""This is an apparent attempt to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval,"" Sen. Susan Collins (R–Maine) said in a statement to The Hill on Friday. ""Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.""

She's right. If the Trump administration wants to cut spending—which is, again, a laudable goal—then it should work through the budget and rescissions process to accomplish those goals with congressional approval.

Vought has argued that the ICA is unconstitutional, so the Trump administration could also try to get the law overturned in court (which may be the ultimate goal of Friday's maneuver, if it sparks a legal challenge). Alternatively, the White House could ask Congress to amend the ICA to allow pocket rescissions.

Colorado's Attorney General accused Zwinck of breaking state law by helping ICE detain Caroline Dias Goncalves, who Zwinck pulled over on the highway.

Goncalves, a 19-year-old university student, was headed to Denver on June 5 when Zwinck pulled her over on Interstate 70 outside of Loma for driving too close to a semi-truck, according to the agency. The sheriff's office said the traffic stop lasted less than 20 minutes, and Dias Goncalves was released with a warning.

As Dias Goncalves continued with her trip and exited the highway, ICE agents stopped, arrested and transported her to the detention facility in Aurora. She was born in Brazil and brought to the United States when she was 7 years old. She has been living in Utah for 12 years and has a pending asylum case.

Zwinck submitted his resignation with the Mesa County Sheriff's Office on August 20. He wrote that his last day of work will be September 1.

Zwinck said he will not work at any Colorado state or local law enforcement department, but did not tell the judge that he's quitting law enforcement.

""As of September 1, 2025, I will no longer be employed by any Colorado state or local law enforcement agency, or political subdivision,"" Zwinck said in a court document dated Aug. 22.

The former secretary of Labor, 67, previously served in Congress and the statehouse before becoming a county supervisor.

Solis’ campaign launch included endorsements from five sitting members of Congress, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and civil rights leader Dolores Huerta, among others.

The heavyweight list speaks to the legislator’s deep backing in local Democratic politics. It also doubles as a warning to other potential candidates about the establishment firepower behind Solis’ nascent campaign, despite the seat she’s angling for not actually existing yet.

Solis would run in the redrawn 38th District, which is currently represented by Rep. Linda Sánchez (D-Whittier). Should the maps pass, Sánchez is likely planning to run in the redrawn 41st District, which will include her home of Whittier, leaving the new 38th District without an incumbent candidate. Both districts will be heavily Democratic.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s push to redraw California’s district maps to favor Democrats will be decided by voters in a Nov. 4 special election — a decision that could potentially determine the balance of power in the Congress in 2026. The plan punches back at President Trump’s drive for more GOP House seats in Texas and other states.

The Times reported this month that Solis was lining up support for a potential candidacy even before the new maps were finalized. At least one California lawmaker told The Times that Solis referred to the district as “my seat” when asking for backing — a reference to the seat she once held, even though the new district doesn’t yet exist.

Unlike I-9 forms, which are federally required for every employer, E-Verify is mandated on a state-by-state basis, otherwise it is voluntary.
If there’s a photo in the E-Verify system, manual photo matching by the employer helps.
But he doesn’t plan on making any changes since the warning about “reckless reliance” on E-Verify.
Walker said McLaughlin’s description of “reckless reliance” on E-Verify should give employers pause.","Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin accused Old Orchard Beach, Maine, of “reckless reliance” on the E-Verify program when it hired Jamaica national Jon Luke Evans, who was later detained and agreed to leave the country earlier this month.

But it’s the government’s own program. And experts say there’s not a whole lot more employers can do in terms of vetting.

“I think employers are between a rock and a hard place,” said Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor at the University of North Florida. “Even an employer who is trying to comply with the law can have difficulty doing it.”

What is E-Verify?

Before 1986, it was essentially legal for employers to hire people regardless of their immigration status. Then came the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which involved a large-scale immigrant legalization program that was paired with a requirement that employers no longer hire people who weren’t legally authorized to work in the U.S.

Employers then had to fill out a form called an I-9, which required workers to present documents showing that they were authorized to work. But it was difficult to verify if the documents were valid. As part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, the E-Verify system was established to help verify those documents.

Unlike I-9 forms, which are federally required for every employer, E-Verify is mandated on a state-by-state basis, otherwise it is voluntary. According to an Equifax tally, about 23 states require E-Verify for at least some public and/or private employers.

Zavodny said the system is generally accurate in terms of matching documents, but there are flaws. For example, if an employee’s right to work is revoked after it has already been verified — perhaps if their visa expires — it doesn’t automatically notify the employer.

A lack of biometrics also hinders the process. If there’s a photo in the E-Verify system, manual photo matching by the employer helps. But a lot of times, there’s no photo in the system.

And the system is not without critics. A 2021 review of E-Verify by the Office of the Inspector General concluded that until U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services addresses the system’s shortcomings, “it cannot ensure the system provides accurate employment eligibility results.”

Trump pushed for more E-Verify use

The federal government’s disagreement with Old Orchard Beach over E-Verify’s reliability came despite pushes by President Donald Trump and his allies to bring the system into wider use. Project 2025, the blueprint for Trump’s second term, calls for it to be mandatory.

Use of the system isn’t widespread. About a fifth of U.S. employers use it, though some huge businesses do, including Walmart, Starbucks and Home Depot.

Language calling for mandatory nationwide E-Verify was dropped from budget proposals during the first Trump administration. The system has also faced criticism from some employers.

An Omaha, Nebraska, food packaging company owner said a raid of his business by immigration officials this year came despite his use of E-Verify for employees. Glenn Valley Foods owner Gary Rohwer said in June that the business “did everything we could possibly do” to hire eligible workers.

Rohwer didn’t respond to requests for comment this month. Old Orchard Beach officials declined to comment on the town’s recent troubles. DHS officials also didn’t respond.

Others say they’ve had good experiences with the system. Kyle Sobko, CEO of SonderCare, a Calgary, Alberta-based company that makes hospital beds for the home, has a staff of 50, including 20 in the U.S.

He uses E-Verify and said he hasn’t had any problems.

“We trust the system for its reliability and integration with our hiring process,” he said.

Sobko said the situation in Old Orchard Beach raises some concerns about the system’s limitations. But he doesn’t plan on making any changes since the warning about “reckless reliance” on E-Verify.

Experts say reliance is not reckless

Despite the system’s flaws, characterization of E-Verify use as “reckless” is an “outrageous” claim, said Kathleen Campbell Walker, a Texas attorney who is a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Walker described the process as “not a get out of jail free card” for prospective employees, but as one that has evolved over the years and become more robust in its ability to provide accurate background checks.

Walker said McLaughlin’s description of “reckless reliance” on E-Verify should give employers pause.

“The whole idea is that I’m supposed to rely on E-Verify to show my good faith and to have a more secure workforce,” she said. “Not that reliance upon it is somehow irresponsible.”

Advocates for the rights of immigrants have said instances in which employees clear the E-Verify system but end up arrested by immigration officials anyway point to a broken immigration system.

“We have an immigration system that is not functioning to the extent that a federal system would both clear someone to work and at the same time, they could somehow get onto ICE’s radar,” said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Going beyond E-Verify can be risky

Small businesses are in a tough spot since they don’t necessarily have the resources or motivation to do more than what is required to verify employment eligibility status.

“Businesses should not be in the business of being the paperwork investigator for the federal government,” said Frank Knapp Jr., president & CEO of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce. “The federal government ought to be doing that.”

Knapp has pushed back on his state’s mandate for E-Verify because he said it puts too much of the onus on small business owners.

“It’s an extra layer of administration just to do the E-Verify for small businesses, and the federal government is saying, oh, you do this because you want to verify that somebody is in this country legally,” he said. “But now their own administration is saying, ‘Oh, no, no. That’s not enough.’”

James M. Cooney, a labor and employment law expert in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations in New Jersey, said it can be tricky to go beyond the basics of what’s required to verify identification without running the risk of a discrimination charge.

“If an employer tries to do more than what is permitted under the I-9 and E-Verify, that will very often be seen as illegal discrimination,” he said. “And so that really puts employers at a tough spot.”

The administration of Trump’s Democratic presidential predecessor Joe Biden had extended TPS for people from Venezuela.
“For decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program,” the email read.

It is unclear what effect Friday’s ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans in the group of 600,000 whose protections expired in April.","A federal appeals court on Friday blocked Donald Trump’s plans to end protections for 600,000 people from Venezuela who have had permission to live and work in the US, saying that plaintiffs are likely to win their claim that the president’s administration’s actions were unlawful.

A three-judge panel of the ninth US circuit court of appeals unanimously upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status for Venezuelans while TPS holders challenge actions by the Republican president’s administration in court.

The ninth circuit judges found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that homeland security secretary Kristi Noem had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior extension of TPS because the governing statute written by Congress does not permit it. The administration of Trump’s Democratic presidential predecessor Joe Biden had extended TPS for people from Venezuela.

“In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,” judge Kim Wardlaw, who was nominated by president Bill Clinton, a Democrat, wrote for the panel. The other two judges on the panel were also nominated by Democratic presidents.

In an email, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) condemned the decision as more obstruction from “unelected activist” judges.

“For decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program,” the email read. “While this injunction delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, secretary Noem will use every legal option at the department’s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans.”

Congress authorized TPS as part of the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows the DHS secretary to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country. The terms are for six, 12 and 18 months.

The appellate judges said the guaranteed time limitations were critical so people could gain employment, find long-term housing and build stability without fear of shifting political winds.

But in ending the protections soon after Trump took office, Noem said conditions in Venezuela had improved and it was not in the US national interest to allow migrants from there to stay on for what is a temporary program. It’s part of a broader move by Trump’s administration to reduce the number of immigrants who are in the country either without legal documentation or through legal temporary programs.

US district judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration had overstepped its authority in terminating the protections. Chen postponed the terminations, but the US supreme court reversed him without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.

It is unclear what effect Friday’s ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans in the group of 600,000 whose protections expired in April. Their lawyers say some have already been fired from jobs, detained in immigration jails, separated from their US citizen children and even deported.

Protections for the remaining 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire 10 Sept.

“What is really significant now is that the second court unanimously recognized that the trial court got it right,” said Emi MacLean, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California representing plaintiffs.

She added that while the decision might not benefit immediately those people who have already lost their status or are about to lose their status, Friday’s ruling “should provide a path for the administration’s illegal actions related to Venezuela and TPS to finally be undone”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3492fecb2af572aa75a65616d2c9a9a2a0b79404/509_0_5259_4207/master/5259.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd85d0ce1aa23defd1ae379854ee49c1",N,,2025-08-29 17:56:47.056714

“The Ninth Circuit has made it clear that the Trump administration can’t just eliminate TPS because they disagree with it.","A federal appeals court on Friday unanimously upheld a judge’s ruling that postpones the termination of deportation protections under Temporary Protected Status for over half-a-million Venezuelans while litigation is ongoing.

In a 52-page decision, a three-judge panel from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that the Department of Homeland Security lacked statutory authority to end a TPS extension before it runs out. It found such action violated the explicit timelines Congress wrote under the 1990 legislation that created TPS.

“We hold that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the vacatur of a prior extension of TPS is not permitted by the governing statutory framework,” the Court stated. “In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics.”

The decision is the latest development in a fierce legal battle over the fate of over 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status, which shields them from deportation to their homeland in turmoil and grants them the ability to work.

The Biden administration granted the protections, arguing that Venezuela was plunged in a deep humanitarian crisis and economic collapse exacerbated by the repressive rule of leader Nicolás Maduro. But in February, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem moved to end one of the two Biden-era designations for Venezuela. The Trump administration claimed conditions had improved so much the designation was no longer necessary — despite ample evidence to the contrary.

Since then, Venezuelan TPS holders and advocacy groups have sued the Trump administration over the decision. In March, district Judge Edward Chen issued a preliminary order to restore the protections for both designations through at least October 2026 — a decision that Friday’s ruling from the Ninth Circuit upheld after the Trump administration appealed it.

The Trump administration also went to the Supreme Court asking the nation’s top judges to intervene in an emergency order. In May, the Supreme Court ruled that Homeland Security had the authority to end TPS but did not rule on the merits of the San Francisco case or shut down ongoing court challenges. That same month, Chen granted an emergency motion protecting 5,000 Venezuelans after the Supreme Court decision that allowed the Trump administration to deport some Venezuelans with TPS while legal challenges continue.

The appeals court ruled they did not find any clear error in Chen’s factual findings, nor an abuse of discretion in its weighing of the balance of equities. “We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting preliminary relief.”

The Ninth Circuit agreed with the plaintiffs that under the TPS statute, Congress granted the Homeland Security Secretary only three specific powers: to designate, extend or terminate TPS. The court found that the secretary is not authorized to cancel an ongoing TPS extension before its scheduled end. It also noted that in the 35-year history of TPS, the government had never previously attempted to vacate a prior extension midterm, highlighting the unprecedented nature of the action.

The Court rejected the government’s argument that the TPS law didn’t apply because then- Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’s extension hadn’t taken effect yet. The Court said that was factually wrong — the extension did take effect when Mayorkas extended the TPS for Venezuelans and the re-registration period began on Jan. 17, 2025, as published in the Federal Register. TPS holders had already started applying to renew their status, something the Supreme Court itself acknowledged in its stay order.

“Thus if the Secretary wished to end TPS status for Venezuelans, she is statutorily required to follow the procedures for termination that Congress enacted,” the Court ruled.

One of the seven Venezuelans plaintiffs, Cecilia Gonzalez, the only plaintiff from Florida, celebrated the appellate court’s decision.

“This is a victory for the TPS community. We’re here because our country is in crisis — this is exactly why TPS was created,” said Gonzalez. “The Ninth Circuit has made it clear that the Trump administration can’t just eliminate TPS because they disagree with it. We will continue to fight for our rights under the law.”",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/nkz6xc/picture299654004/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_8DAV_TPS_VENEZUELA,N,,2025-08-29 18:57:15.497141

Lewis AdamsBBC News, Essex

A temporary injunction that blocked asylum seekers being housed at an Essex hotel has been overturned at the Court of Appeal.

Lawyers for The Bell Hotel in Epping and the government challenged a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave the site by 12 September.

Overturning the injunction, Lord Justice Bean said the High Court ruling was ""seriously flawed in principle"".

Epping Forest District Council, which obtained the initial injunction, says it will not rule out taking its case against the use of the Bell to the Supreme Court.

Three arrests were made after protesters gathered outside the hotel on Friday evening.

The Home Office has braced itself for a wave of legal challenges from other councils over the use of hotels in their areas, fearing Epping's victory would set a precedent.

But Lord Justice Bean said the High Court ruling by Mr Justice Eyre failed to consider the challenges of relocating the migrants.

""The judge's approach ignores the obvious consequence that the closure of one site means capacity needs to be identified elsewhere in the system,"" he said, reading the ruling made by him and two other Court of Appeal judges.

A full High Court hearing to decide on a permanent injunction for the Bell is expected in mid-October.

Reacting to the latest ruling, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said it ""puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of the British people"".

About 100 protesters gathered outside the Bell after the judgement and were moved by the police to a pen across the road.

A BBC reporter observed an asylum seeker being heckled.

Essex Police say three men were arrested - one on suspicion of violent disorder, one on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and one on suspicion of drink driving after a car was driven on the wrong side of the road towards a police cordon. All three remain in custody.

Other protests took place at hotels elsewhere, including in Cheshunt in Hertfordshire.

Thousands of people have attended anti-immigration protests and counter-demonstrations outside The Bell Hotel since July.

It followed an asylum seeker housed there being arrested and subsequently charged with several offences including the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl.

Hadush Kebatu, who is from Ethiopia, denies the offences and has been on trial.

The protests acted as a trigger for the council to apply for an injunction, its legal team said in court.

Lord Justice Bean said this was ""worrying"", adding: ""If an outbreak of protest enhances a case, this runs the risk of acting as an impetus for further protests - some of which may be disorderly - around asylum accommodation.

""There is a risk of encouraging further lawlessness.""

Police say 28 arrests have been made in connection with disorder outside the hotel, with 16 people charged.

Lord Justice Bean said Mr Justice Eyre ""made a number of errors"" when imposing the injunction on 19 August.

Criticism was also levelled at the High Court judge's refusal to allow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's 11th-hour attempt to dismiss the council's case.

That would have given him more insight into the challenge of relocating the asylum seekers, Lord Justice Bean added.

At the High Court, Epping Forest District Council claimed that the Bell owner Somani Hotels breached planning rules by turning the site into asylum accommodation.

""The battle is not over and we will continue the fight,"" a spokesperson said earlier.

""It is nothing less than the people of Epping would expect and deserve.""

Neil Hudson, the Tory MP for Epping Forest, said the judgement was a ""dreadful decision"".

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed the government had used European human rights legislation ""against the people of Epping"" and that migrants had ""more rights than the British people under Starmer"".

While European human rights law was mentioned by the government in its written arguments, it was not a major part of its argument, nor the Court of Appeal's decision according to a summary of the ruling.

Steve Smith, chief executive of refugee charity Care4Calais, said the ruling ""made it clear that violent protest, and in many cases overt racism, is not a fast-track route for the far right to attack the rights of people seeking sanctuary in this country"".

Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman, Lisa Smart, told the BBC that Labour should be ""speeding up asylum processing to bring down the backlog and end hotel use once and for all"".

Border Security and Asylum Minister Dame Angela Eagle said the government ""will stop using hotels, which aren't a sustainable solution, by the end of this Parliament.

""This judgement assists us by allowing us to do that in a planned and orderly fashion"".

She added: ""We all want the same thing, which is to get out of asylum hotels"".

This means that their TPS status remains in effect for now while the court proceedings continue.

A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit supported the lower court’s decision, which extended the temporary protected status for Venezuelans during the legal proceedings, not allowing the administration to terminate it before the proceedings are completed.

An email request to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security seeking comments remained unanswered at the time of publication.

The Ninth Circuit judges concluded that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claim that the Department of Homeland Security lacked the authority to rescind or cancel the previous extension of TPS, because the law enacted by Congress does not grant such authority. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has extended TPS for Venezuelans as part of its migrant-support policy.

“During the passage of the TPS law, Congress designed a temporary-status system that was predictable, reliable, and insulated from election-related politics.”

– Judge Kim Wardlaw

The essence of the decision and its implications

There may not be an exact figure yet of how many of the more than 350,000 Venezuelans in the total group of 600,000 whose protection expired in April are affected. According to immigration-rights advocates, some have already lost their jobs, may be in immigration detention facilities, or are separated from their families, and also face deportation.

Protection for the remaining roughly 250,000 Venezuelans is set to end on September 10. TPS grants the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to provide legal immigration status to people fleeing armed conflict, natural disasters, or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that make it difficult to safely return to their homeland.

In response to the ruling, U.S. government officials argue that the Secretary of Homeland Security’s authority regarding TPS is not subject to judicial review, and dispute Nom’s reasoning on discrimination. Government lawyers emphasize that the situation in Venezuela has improved, and leaving migrants without protection does not align with the United States’ national interests.

In the context of the ongoing crisis in Venezuela, characterized by political instability, high unemployment, and mass outflows, many people view TPS as an important protection. Experts stress that developments will depend on further court proceedings and the administration’s stance on legislative authority in immigration policy.",https://mezha.net/eng/kd_image_generate/us-court-halts-end-of-tps-for-600-000-venezuelans-amid-legal-battle/252044.jpg?ver=0.0.4,N,,2025-08-29 17:57:20.964738

Today, the Ninth Circuit of Appeals affirmed a March 31 district court order that had postponed the Department of Homeland Security’s vacatur and termination actions against the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation. However, the Ninth Circuit decision does not have the effect of reinstating the TPS designation because a May U.S. Supreme Court emergency order has stayed the original district court order for the duration of the full appeals process challenging the order, including further appeals to the Supreme Court.

The March 31 district court order remains stayed – and the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation remains expired – unless and until the disposition of any further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The government is expected to appeal the Ninth Circuit decision in a timely manner. The Ninth Circuit case is National TPS Alliance v. Noem, 9th Cir., Case No. 25-2120.

Background

On January 17, 2025, then-DHS Secretary Mayorkas extended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuela for 18 months, from April 3, 2025 to October 2, 2026. Secretary Mayorkas’s extension applied to two prior designations of TPS for Venezuela – one issued in 2021 and a second issued in 2023.

On January 28, new DHS Secretary Noem announced that she was vacating Secretary Mayorkas’s extension. The vacatur meant that TPS for Venezuela would revert to its prior expiration dates of April 2, 2025 (for the 2023 designation) and September 10, 2025 (for the 2021 designation), while Secretary Noem decided whether to extend protections in her own right. Shortly thereafter, the Secretary made the decision not to further extend the 2023 designation. She specified April 7, 2025 as the date that TPS benefits granted under the 2023 designation would expire. As to the 2021 designation, the Secretary announced that she would decide by July 2025 whether to extend benefits or allow them to lapse. (As of August 29, no decision has been communicated to the public regarding the 2021 designation.)

Secretary Noem’s TPS vacatur and termination were challenged in several lawsuits, including the instant case, National TPS Alliance v. Noem, Case No. 3:25-cv-01766 (N.D. Ca., filed Feb. 19, 2025). On March 31, the National TPS Alliance court granted plaintiffs’ motion to stay the vacatur of the prior extension and the termination of the 2023 designation. The government appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and sought an emergency stay of the district court order from the U.S. Supreme Court nearly simultaneously. The Supreme Court ruled first in May by granting the emergency stay and permitting DHS to move forward with the designation termination until all appeals challenging the district court order have reached the Court (while permitting a limited number of TPS-related documentation to remain valid). The Ninth Circuit has ruled on the government appeal today, and having ruled in favor of plaintiffs by affirming the March 31 district court decision, the government is expected to appeal the Ninth Circuit decision to the Supreme Court.

2021 Venezuela TPS designation remains valid for now

TPS remains valid for current beneficiaries of the 2021 Venezuela TPS designation through at least September 10, 2025. If DHS decides to terminate the designation, the termination cannot take effect earlier than 60 days after the termination notice is published (and not earlier than September 10).

What’s next

The government is expected to appeal the Ninth Circuit decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the meantime, the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation remains expired as of early April. The designation would only be reinstated in the event that the U.S. Supreme Court either affirms the Ninth Circuit decision or declines to consider the government's appeal.

When he began vomiting and having seizures in the early hours of Feb. 18, Krome staff waited nearly four hours before calling for emergency medical care.
Delays in receiving medical care at Krome were common, according to interviews and a Human Rights Watch report.
One man spent a week asking for medical care for a cough, the HRW report said.
A transgender detainee who became friends with Gomes fell and lost her teeth without receiving care, Smock said.","As overcrowding at Florida’s largest immigrant detention center ballooned this year, the emergency calls flooded in.

“I got a gentleman here, new arrival detainee, he’s complaining of chest pains.”

“We have a detainee having a seizure.”

“We got a new arrival detainee here that’s complaining of lightheadedness.”

Krome Processing Center’s average daily population has climbed from less than 600 at the start of the Trump administration to 900 in July according to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement – and that’s likely a significant undercount. In April, Krome’s population reached three times its capacity with more 1,800 detainees, according to data gathering organization Transitional Records Action Clearinghouse, which obtained additional public records from ICE to provide a fuller picture beyond the average population data ICE regularly publishes.

As Krome burst at the seams with new detainees, emergency calls have risen faster than the detainee population.

From January to July, 911 calls made from the detention center doubled compared to the same time period the year before, according to records released from the Miami-Dade Sheriff’s Office. More than 170 calls were made this year until July 15, compared to 86 in the same time period the year before. This year, about half of the calls have been related to a sick or injured person, compared to just 25% of the calls last year. Other common reasons for the calls were an arrest or investigation.

That tracks with a similar trend at ICE’s Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, where 911 calls are also on track to double from last year, according to data obtained and analyzed by The Tributary last month.

But at Krome, Florida’s largest detention center, the problems are particularly acute: Interviews with lawyers and detainees’ relatives, 911 call logs and recordings, and ICE’s own records show that overcrowding and medical neglect have run rampant at Krome since Trump took office. The detention center has also been the deadliest this year, with at least three deaths.

As the Trump administration has ramped up its deportation machine and Gov. Ron DeSantis has wielded the full force of the state’s law enforcement to help, no ICE detention center has exceeded its capacity more than Miami’s Krome, according to a report by TRAC.

“It is absolutely horrendous,” said Chelsea Nowel, a Tampa-based immigration lawyer with multiple clients who have been detained at Krome. “It’s not something that I’ve ever experienced before in practicing detained immigration for almost 10 years.”

Ramped up enforcement

Since President Donald Trump took office, immigration enforcement has intensified, targeting immigrants at their workplace, courthouses, and immigration check-ins. With Gov. Ron DeSantis as an eager partner, Florida’s immigrant communities have borne the brunt of ramped up ICE activity.

With most Florida law enforcement agencies required to collaborate with ICE, a routine traffic stop now can lead to detention without so much as a citation — let alone a criminal arrest. Changes to mandatory detention have also meant that immigrants without a criminal record and with ties to their community who may have been released on bond under past administrations are now spending months in ICE detention. More than half of the people detained at Krome have no criminal record, according to the latest ICE statistics on the detained population.

“What we’re seeing is how politicians across the political spectrum have sold us that immigration is a public safety issue, but it’s not,” said Florida-based senior organizer for the Detention Watch Network Nery Lopez. “In reality, we’re seeing that people are being incarcerated, being detained and deported and having no due process.”

As the largest detention center in the state, Krome has been the site of many of these detentions and the population quickly surged.

Within a month of Trump’s inauguration, 44-year-old Ukrainian immigrant Maksym Chernyak died in custody after being transferred to the hospital after having a seizure. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner determined the cause of death as a stroke. In August, his family filed a wrongful death complaint under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Overcrowding only increased at Krome in the following months. In April, Democratic lawmakers in Florida called the conditions at Krome “alarming” and demanded more oversight. In June, detainees used their bodies to spell out SOS to protest the conditions and prolonged detention.

Even ICE has noted overcrowding at Krome. In the latest ICE inspection conducted from April 29 to May 1, the agency documented 14 instances when the facility failed to comply with national detention standards, compared to 6 during the last inspection in September 2024. Most of the issues were related to the holding rooms or medical care.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Ron Smock, who often visited his friend Vangelis Ricardo Dos Anjos Gomes, a Brazilian immigrant who was detained at Krome from October 2024 to April 2025, watched as more and more people crowded the facilities during his visits. In the spring, he saw detainees eating and sleeping in a room meant for lawyer visits.

The overcrowding climbed steadily until June, which saw the largest 911 call volume since January 2024 with 53 calls. That same month, 75-year-old Isidro Perez died in ICE custody after reporting chest pains and being transferred to the hospital, according to ICE. The medical examiner has not yet released an autopsy or report on his death.

A 36-year-old Cuban immigrant, whose wife spoke to The Tributary on condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation, got to Krome in June after being detained at an ICE check-in in Tampa. By then, according to the immigrant’s wife, the intake process was so overwhelmed that detainees were forced to sleep on the floor for days and weeks at a time.

“He was there for a whole week in horrible conditions, where you couldn’t shower and had the same clothes on all week, with a toilet in the same room where you were,” the immigrant’s wife said in an interview. “The capacity was supposedly for 25 people, but there were up to 60 people there.”

Mich González, a lawyer for Sanctuary of the South who represents clients in Krome, said the overcrowding has created inhumane conditions.

“People were held in processing for over a week and in processing, you don’t get regular access to meals, bathroom, potable water. You have to ask to go to the bathroom,” González said.

“There’s no beds. You have to sleep on the floor. People were so cold, they were sticking cardboard in the vents and trying to hold them in place with plastic forks.”

At least four 911 calls regarding medical emergencies mentioned that the person was a new arrival who had not yet been booked into Krome, stuck instead in a limbo in which the facility’s medical staff were not yet authorized to attend to them.

“I have a detainee over here that’s complaining of chest pains,” one caller said on May 24. “Nurse staff told me to call 911 because they can’t see him because he’s not all the way booked in yet.”

In its latest inspection report, ICE documented that at least two out of six holding rooms at Krome exceeded the 25-person capacity and three exceeded the 12-hour wait time in the holding room. It also documented a failure of all the holding rooms to document detainees held there, meal times, and security concerns. Krome staff also failed to provide proper mental and medical health screenings upon arrival, the report found.

When Rep. Carlos Gimenez visited, the 36-year-old Cuban immigrant said ICE staffers took steps to get the facility more in regular order: All the men were moved out of the intake center, he later told his wife.

Gimenez told media after his visit that he did not witness any overcrowding or detainees sleeping on the floor and that the medical care was adequate.

“It’s not the Ritz, but I can tell you that there’s nothing going on in there that would be cause for alarm,” Gimenez told the media after his visit.

The office of Rep. Gimenez did not respond to a request for further comment.

Issues with medical care

Once inside Krome, overcrowding persisted and detainees reported having to request a medical appointment but waiting days to receive care, according to lawyers, relatives, a wrongful death complaint and a report by Human Rights Watch.

Smock said that Gomes, the Brazilian friend he’d regularly visited at Krome, relayed that there were 120 people in his pod, which was only supposed to hold 60 people. He spent two months in solitary confinement, which he preferred to the overcrowding and abuse he endured with the general population.

“When solitary is a better option, that shows how horrible things are,” Smock said.

The 911 calls reflect a general deterioration of the conditions at Krome and the issues with medical care, which is provided by ICE Health Service Corps. They document head injuries, chest pains, stroke symptoms, and multiple seizures.

The wife of Maksym Chernyak, the Ukrainian man who died in February, alleges that he sought medical treatment multiple times but was denied care, according to a wrongful death complaint shared with the Tributary.

Chernyak reported feeling sick and was seen by doctors on Feb. 9. Despite complaining of the same symptoms, he waited 6 days for another medical visit. His blood pressure rose by this second visit, but nothing was done, the complaint alleges. When he began vomiting and having seizures in the early hours of Feb. 18, Krome staff waited nearly four hours before calling for emergency medical care.

Smock also reported that Gomes experienced long wait times for critical medical care. It took a week to see a doctor after he fell in the courtyard and scraped his leg, which became infected with flesh-eating bacteria, Smock said.

“They kept refusing him to get treated. They finally sent him to the hospital and the hospital filed notice about how bad his condition was. He was only hours away from having his legs amputated,” Smock said.

Injuries inside Krome were common for Gomes because he was repeatedly targeted and attacked by other detainees and guards for being gay, according to Smock.

Gomes was indicted in March on two charges of forcibly assaulting a federal officer, a case that Smock believes is retaliation for filing a complaint with DHS after guards forcibly restrained and beat Gomes.

Delays in receiving medical care at Krome were common, according to interviews and a Human Rights Watch report.

One man spent a week asking for medical care for a cough, the HRW report said. He only received treatment when he showed his bloody tissue. Another waited three weeks for treatment for flu-like symptoms. A nurse wrote off his issues as marijuana withdrawal symptoms.

Another complained of abdominal pain, according to the report. An officer said that did not warrant a medical emergency. The in-house doctor said it was probably just gas. When he was finally taken to the hospital, the doctor said he had arrived just in time before his intestines ruptured from a strangulated abdominal wall hernia.

A transgender detainee who became friends with Gomes fell and lost her teeth without receiving care, Smock said. A Guatemalan woman told Smock that her husband had been attacked and fell and started having seizures, even though he was only in his 30s. The 911 calls report multiple seizures of inmates in their 30s.

All these issues could be avoided, or at least mitigated, if the government used its discretion to release people with serious health issues, family responsibilities and no criminal record as was customary in the past, according to Nowel, the Tampa immigration attorney. But instead detention only seems to be increasing.

Why It Matters

The city's WorldFest, an annual Labor Day weekend festival on the Belvedere, includes a naturalization ceremony at the Muhammad Ali Center that organizers say will begin at 1 p.m. on the sixth floor. The festival and ceremony are expected to draw large crowds.

Since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, several cultural events around the country have been canceled or scaled back because of concerns over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity.

What To Know

""I don't want to be an alarmist here, but isn't this just the type of event that Trump's publicity-seeking Department of Homeland Security would target to instill as much fear as possible in the immigrant community?"" Joseph Gerth, a columnist at the Louisville Courier-Journal, wrote in an op-ed.

ICE has not confirmed any planned enforcement actions tied to WorldFest. A spokesperson previously told local media that the agency would not disclose whether it had spoken with festival organizers and cautioned that ""Raising speculation about such matters only creates unnecessary fear.""

One Facebook user, Tom Recktenwald, wrote: ""I wonder how many ICE agents will be patrolling the WorldFest on the Belvedere this weekend.""

Meanwhile, some performers and community groups said they will go ahead with scheduled appearances and activities. Louisville Public Media reported that members of the Latin band Yapa! will be performing at WorldFest, saying they aim to uplift immigrant audiences.

The debate over whether to hold public cultural events while enforcement activity is highly visible has played out in other U.S. cities this summer, where some organizers chose to cancel or limit festivals to avoid exposing vulnerable community members.

What People Are Saying

An ICE spokesperson told Louisville Public Media: ""ICE continues to work closely with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies as part of its daily mission, and law-abiding individuals have no reason for concern.""

Joseph Gerth, a columnist at the Louisville Courier-Journal, in an op-ed: ""Can you imagine the spectacle of Trump's masked Hispanic-hunters descending on the parade of nations and ripping mothers away from their screaming children because—though they came here legally as children three decades ago—their parents forgot to turn in some form in 1997.""

The teenager, a US citizen with disabilities, was in a vehicle with his mother outside Arleta high school in Los Angeles on 11 August when masked immigration agents surrounded them and pulled them from the vehicle. They said the boy was a suspect in a crime, and handcuffed him for several minutes until they realized had the wrong person, the Los Angeles Times reported.

His mother told NBC4 that the agent told her son they had confused him with someone else, but to “look at the bright side: you’re gonna have an exciting story to tell your friends when you go back to school.”

“What’s exciting about getting guns pointed at you?” she said.

The claim, filed by the Carrillo law firm on behalf of the boy and his mother, alleges that Ice and Border Patrol agents had no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to detain the boy, and caused him physical injury and emotional distress. He is traumatized and depressed, his mother said to media.

The agents “racially profiled [the teen] while he was merely sitting his car waiting for his family member,” the claim states. It also alleges the agents left live bullet rounds on the scene in an act of “clear negligence”.

The incident drew widespread outrage across Los Angeles, and fueled fears around the activities of immigration agents, particularly around city schools. Days earlier, authorities arrested an 18-year-old as he was walking his dog, shortly before he was set to start his senior year of high school.

The Los Angeles Unified school district has moved to adopt new strategies to protect students and “ensure that schools remain safe, supportive spaces for all children and families – regardless of immigration status”.

Alberto M Carvalho, the LAUSD superintendent, has said the incident involving the 15-year-old was “unacceptable”. Immigration enforcement around schools “disrupts learning and creates anxiety that can last far beyond the school day”, Carvalho said in a statement earlier this month.

In response to the 15-year-old’s detainment, Congresswoman Luz Rivas condemned the administration’s “continued use of violent tactics to terrorize our students and families”.

The claim was filed against the US Department of Homeland Security, US Customs and Border Protection, US Border Patrol, and United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Department of Homeland Security said allegations that agents targeted the high school were false and that agents were conducting a “targeted operation on [a] criminal illegal alien”.

“What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the US – NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity. America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists–truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities,” the statement said.

Their incompetence put the American people at risk,” Noem said in a statement.

Yes, but it’s a huge flaw.” “DHS was able to identify and finally get the bad actor,” the rep said.

The ousted employees include FEMA Chief Information Officer Charles Armstrong, Chief Information Security Officer Gregory Edwards and 22 other IT workers at the agency, reps told The Post.

“FEMA’s career IT leadership failed on every level. Their incompetence put the American people at risk,” Noem said in a statement.

“When DHS stepped in to fix the problem, entrenched bureaucrats worked to prevent us from solving the problem and downplayed just how bad this breach was.”

Noem stated that the agency’s network was accessed by “a threat actor” after ordering a cybersecurity review at FEMA.

“Are we lucky,” a FEMA spokesperson added, “no actual American citizens were impacted? Yes, but it’s a huge flaw.”

“DHS was able to identify and finally get the bad actor,” the rep said. “But they turned off their credentials and then, somehow, the FEMA IT team turned their credentials back on.”

It’s unclear whether the threat came from a foreign actor, though the Department of Homeland Security was one of several agencies using Microsoft software to be targeted by Chinese state-linked actors last month.

“As of this writing, Microsoft has observed two named Chinese nation-state actors, Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon exploiting these vulnerabilities targeting internet-facing SharePoint servers,” the company wrote in a July 23 blog post.

The Beijing-sponsored hackers also breached SharePoint software used by the National Nuclear Security Administration, which is responsible for maintaining and modernizing the nation’s stockpile of nuclear weapons.

FEMA spent nearly half-a-billion dollars on IT and cybersecurity in fiscal year 2025.

DHS spokespeople said that the IT team “lied to officials about the scope and scale of the cyber vulnerabilities” and “avoided scheduled inspections.”

FEMA also was not using multi-factor authentication and ignoring other “critical vulnerabilities.”

“These deep-state individuals were more interested in covering up their failures than in protecting the Homeland and American citizens’ personal data, so I terminated them immediately,” Noem added. “The American people deserve results from their government.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/110301770.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-08-29 19:57:13.117848

Organize your family, your apartment building, your block, and join the fight against ICE raids and join the fight against U.S. wars.” Samantha Nieves attended her first Chicano Moratorium commemoration event in 2020.","It’s been more than five decades since the Chicano Moratorium of 1970, when nearly 30,000 people marched through the streets of East Los Angeles in one of the largest Mexican American anti-war demonstrations in U.S. history.

Though a crackdown by Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies led to chaos, injuries and three deaths, including journalist Ruben Salazar, it became a pivotal moment in the Chicano civil rights movement.

Today, that legacy continues to shape activism in Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles, including ongoing efforts to resist immigration enforcement and police brutality and fight for environmental justice. This month, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors formally recognized the Moratorium’s significance by approving a motion to strengthen protections for journalists covering protests.

We asked three voices connected to this multigenerational movement to reflect on what the Moratorium means today: Chris Zepeda-Millan, associate professor of public policy and Chicana/o and Central American Studies at UCLA; Carlos Montes, a longtime organizer who marched in the original Chicano Moratorium; and Samantha Nieves, a student researcher and artist whose work focuses on community engagement in East L.A.

Here’s what they had to say.

Chris Zepeda-Millan first heard about the Chicano Movement as a child during a summer program at Wabash Park in Boyle Heights. “An old man came to speak to us about these events and about the importance of taking pride in our community and in being Mexican,” he said.

Years later, he found out that the man was the famous teacher Sal Castro, one of the leaders of the 1968 East L.A. student walkouts.

“The Chicano Moratorium was part of the broader Chicano Movement. During this time, Boyle Heights-based labor organizers Bert Corona and Chole Alatorre created the template for organizing the undocumented—including against raids—and trained cadres of Chicano activists in the belief that migrant rights were human rights…So in many respects, Chicanos and Mexican immigrants in Boyle Heights can be credited for laying the foundation for the modern-day national immigrant rights movement, and that’s something we should be proud of.”

Zepeda-Millan sees today’s youth continuing that same fight and urges them to see their place in history.

“Today’s activists in Boyle Heights and the broader East L.A. area are carrying on that legacy of fighting to protect and expand the rights of all members of our community, regardless of their citizenship status,” he said.

“Decades from now, your grandchildren will read about the horrific times we’re living in and ask what you did when the most powerful man in the world–the president of the United States — attacked our community and tore apart our families? My message for youngsters in Boyle Heights is that at this moment, you have the ability to shape how history will remember you and how you will answer that question.”

As a young student, Carlos Montes remembers his friends from Roosevelt and Garfield high schools were being drafted and sent to Vietnam. Around the same time, he also learned that Chicanos were dying at a high rate in the war. “When I turned 18 years old, the vice principal called me into the office to sign me up for the U.S. Selective Service System, which I thought was unjust,” he said.

He eventually became a co-founder of the Brown Berets and marched in the original Chicano Moratorium.

Today, Montes continues to organize, connecting the past struggles to current fights against immigration enforcement.

“The struggle for immigrant rights, for legalization for all, to stop the deportation, stop ICE is all part of our struggle for equality and self-determination,” he said.

“This is what I call intensification of national oppression against the Chicano nation. They realize that we’re a powerful force that, in the long run, we’re going to challenge the U.S. government for economic and political power in the Southwest… The moratorium is a way to organize our people, educate our people, and bring in a new generation of activists to the streets of East L.A.”

To young people taking action today, Montes has a clear message:

“Continue to stand up. Fight back. Organize your family, your apartment building, your block, and join the fight against ICE raids and join the fight against U.S. wars.”

Samantha Nieves attended her first Chicano Moratorium commemoration event in 2020.

Learning about the death of journalist Ruben Salazar — and how he was assassinated on the same East L.A. street she grew up on — left a lasting impact on her. “As a Chicana raised in East Los Angeles, this event hinted to me that the energy of unrest and violence has long persisted in our community,” she said.

For Nieves, who has documented her community as a contributor at Boyle Heights Beat and throught her work in art spaces throughout Los Angeles, the legacy of the Chicano Moratorium continues to inform activism among artists and community members like herself.

“Then and now, we utilize symbols and colors of visual culture that open the path for discourse on current issues. Today, we see many silk-screened posters of ‘Trucha con ICE’ with a phone number to Boyle Heights rapid response, along with messages meant to uplift local youth to feel empowered,” she said. “Today, organizations continue to call out the unjust killings of community members with the awareness of local history.”

Looking ahead, Nieves believes community knowledge and connection are essential to continuing the movement’s legacy.

“Be open to learning from our elders, neighbors, and each other. Take advantage of local resources that support your growth in cultural and local knowledge. Challenge yourself to innovate and take up space that you deserve to be in.”",https://boyleheightsbeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2963-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 17:57:07.118393

We reached out to Portland Mayor Keith Wilson’s team to get the city perspective on this announcement. His team sent us a statement reading:

Portland stands firm in protecting our sanctuary city status. Our City employees, including the Portland Police Bureau, will not use their time or resources to assist in Federal immigration enforcement action unless required by federal courts. As such, our sanctuary city status does not violate federal law.

The federal government can lawfully operate in Portland, meaning ICE is allowed to enforce immigration law inside Portland and the city cannot interfere with their operations.

We cannot, however, confuse legality with morality.

We are disgusted by the callous inhumanity and rhetoric displayed by ICE leadership. As your Mayor, I denounce these tactics.

Portland has come together to write a new chapter. Crime rates are falling, new economic opportunity is everywhere, and our immigrant community is at the heart of our shared story. The masked and armed federal officers roaming the streets in unmarked vans touted by “Border Czar” Tom Homan are chilling symbols of fear and oppression, not the freedom, liberty, or opportunity we cherish.

We’ve reached out to ICE to learn more about what increased operations really means since Homan didn’t provide specifics.

We sat down with Randall Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence, and he told us what this could mean.

“I think what we're looking at in terms of expanding operations is more immigration raids,"" he said. ""For the most part, the immigration raids that have been coming out of the Portland office have been in surrounding areas, like down in Woodburn and Hillsboro and sort of not in the city proper, but we know from the Los Angeles model that a real crackdown includes the urban population that might be undocumented, including people going to immigration hearings, people working as laborers and people's yards.”

We reached out to the Portland Police Bureau, and they referred us to a statement from Chief Bob Day earlier this year in which he said Portland police do not engage in immigration enforcement, and that they don’t have the legal authority to do so.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported nearly 200,000 people so far since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, a Homeland Security spokesperson told Fox News Digital, putting the agency on track to record its highest number of removals in a decade.

The spokesperson said Friday that ICE removed 199,600 individuals from the U.S. between January and Aug. 27, 2025. In the first three months of this ongoing fiscal year, between the beginning of October 2024 and the end of December 2024 – which were former President Biden's final months in office – ICE said it deported 71,405 people.

The combined figure puts ICE at around 271,000 deportations during the federal Fiscal Year 2025, which ends Sept. 30.

ICE removed 271,484 individuals during the previous fiscal year, which was the highest figure since FY2014 under former President Barack Obama, when there were 315,943 deportations.

""Of the 271,484 individuals removed, 237 were known or suspected terrorists, a 70.5% increase compared to fiscal year 2023, and eight were human rights violators for an increase of 33.3% compared to fiscal year 2023,"" ICE also said that year.

They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of ""cause"" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.","Washington — A federal judge on Friday heard arguments over a bid by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to remain in her post despite President Trump's efforts to remove her because of allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.

The two-hour-long hearing before U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb marked the first in-person showdown between Justice Department lawyers and Cook's legal team in the wake of her lawsuit, filed Thursday, challenging Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her from the Fed's Board of Governors.

Cook's lawyers have asked the district court to issue a temporary restraining order finding Mr. Trump's purported termination of her to be unlawful and declaring that she remains a member of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors.

Cobb, appointed by former President Joe Biden, did not issue a decision from the bench. Instead, she noted that the case raises ""important questions that may be of first impression"" as it relates to the president's firing of a Fed governor. She repeatedly pointed to the ""unique functions"" of the central bank and the importance ""of this being an independent body that it is not supposed to be responsive to any type of political pressure.""

Cook was appointed to the post by Biden in May 2022 and reappointed to a full 14-year term set to end in January 2038. She alleges in her lawsuit that Mr. Trump's move violates the Federal Reserve Act, which states that the president can only remove a member of the central bank's Board of Governors ""for cause.""

In his letter informing Cook that he was terminating her from the Fed Board of Governors earlier this week, Mr. Trump wrote that he had ""sufficient cause"" to remove her from the position. The president cited as grounds for her firing a letter Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging that Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.

Pulte, appointed to the post by Mr. Trump, accused Cook of claiming two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her principal residence on mortgage documents in 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.

Cook's lawyers said in court papers that she may have ""erred"" in filling out the form for her private mortgage, but noted that the alleged action took place before she assumed office as a Fed governor.

""None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,"" they wrote. ""And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.""

In a statement released through the Fed last week, Cook said, ""I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.""

Abbe Lowell, who argued on Cook's behalf before the court, said her firing rests solely on Pulte's assertion that she may have committed wrongdoing. He said Cook did not receive any notice of the allegations against her or a chance to respond to them, which violated her due process rights. Only 30 minutes elapsed between the time Pulte shared on social media the letter to Bondi alleging Cook engaged in mortgage fraud and Mr. Trump, in his own social media post, said she needed to resign, he said.

""This allegation of fraud has become the weapon of choice"" for the Trump administration in removing officials, Lowell said, adding that ""cause for the president means she won't go along with an interest rate drop.""

Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is ""unprecedented and illegal,"" and, if allowed to stand, would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history. Her attorneys said that while the ""for cause"" standard is not defined in the Federal Reserve Act, other laws shielding members of independent agencies from being fired without cause require a finding of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.

""The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,"" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.

They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of ""cause"" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.

Cobb repeatedly pressed Lowell about incorporating the removal protections included in other laws — inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office — into the Federal Reserve Act when that law limits the grounds for removal by the president to ""cause."" She also asked Lowell to provide the ""best authority"" that supports the court articulating a framework for determining that an official's past conduct can constitute cause for termination.

Cook's lawsuit names Mr. Trump, the Board of Governors and Fed Chair Jerome Powell as defendants. In a court filing ahead of the hearing, a lawyer for the central bank said it does not intend to offer arguments about Cook's effort to block her removal and reiterated that it would follow any court orders.

Justice Department lawyers defended Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook, writing in a separate filing that ""making facially contradictory statements in financial documents — whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not — is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.""

They argued that federal courts cannot second guess the president's judgment about what constitutes ""cause,"" so Mr. Trump's effort to remove Cook is a matter of his discretion and not subject to judicial review. But the Justice Department added that if some judicial review of Cook's removal is appropriate, it would have to be highly deferential to avoid intruding on the president's constitutional authority over principal officers.

""Meanwhile, the President has a strong interest in exercising his statutory authority to remove a federal officer for cause, and the public has a strong interest in stable governance at the Federal Reserve — a stability that would be undercut by the type of pingpong injunctions and stays that have characterized other litigation,"" Justice Department lawyers wrote.

In questions to Yaakov Roth, principal deputy assistant attorney general, Cobb asked whether the president would have broad discretion to determine what constitutes ""cause,"" given the nature of the Fed Board, and said she was ""uncomfortable"" with the idea that a president could explicitly express a desire to appoint a majority of governors and instruct his administration to ""go dig in"" and find reasons to remove sitting members.

""What if the stated cause is demonstrably false?"" she asked Roth. ""That's still not anything that anyone can do anything about?""

Roth said he was not aware of any statements Mr. Trump had made about Cook before Pulte raised the accusations against her and said there was no indication that Cook's removal is for any reason other than the allegations about her mortgage applications. He also noted that Cook has yet to offer any explanation for the representations on the documents.

Cobb, though, also said she had a ""strong reaction"" to the suggestion that Pulte's social media post satisfied due-process protections entitling Cook to receive notice of the accusations and an opportunity to respond.

As to the timing of the alleged misconduct — Cook entered into the mortgage agreements in 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed Board — Cobb said that if Cook's removal were reviewable, ""it feels weird that an administration could go back and second guess the determinations of prior administrations and Congress in their advice and consent role.""

Roth said ""cause"" requires a reason beyond mere policy disagreements that bears on a person's ability and fitness to do the job.

Cook is the latest Democratic appointee targeted for removal by the president as Mr. Trump seeks to stretch the bounds of executive authority. Since he returned to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has moved to oust members of various independent agencies tapped by his predecessor, including officials at the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Labor Relations Authority, among others.

Many of his attempted firings have sparked legal battles, and the Supreme Court in some of those cases has allowed the removals to take effect while litigation continues. But in one of those challenges, brought by terminated members of the NLRB and MSPB, the high court suggested that the Fed is different from those other agencies.

Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 234 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Aug. 22 through 28.

Among the new cases, Mexican national Joel Guerrero-Sanchez was arrested in Medina County on Wednesday and charged with alien smuggling. Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) conducted a traffic stop on a tractor-trailer allegedly driven by Guerrero-Sanchez along I-35. The criminal complaint alleges that a search of the tractor and trailer revealed two illegal aliens hidden in a compartment inside the sleeper cab. If convicted, Guerrero-Sanchez faces up to 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.

A Mexican national was taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody on Aug. 22 after being arrested in San Antonio for evading arrest with previous conviction. Juan Moreno Lopez faces an illegal re-entry charge after being previously removed from the U.S. four times in addition to four voluntary returns to Mexico. His extensive criminal record began with a burglary in 1988 and includes multiple convictions for evading arrest in San Antonio and Williamson County.

In Midland, Mexican national Orlando Everado Aguirre-Barra was federally charged with illegal re-entry. He was initially arrested by DPS on July 25 and had been previously removed from the United States in 2019 following a conviction for illegal re-entry. Aguirre-Barra was also convicted in Phoenix, Arizona in 2014 for criminal trespass and possession of a controlled substance, and in 2015 for burglary.

Samuel Josias Ruiz-Diaz, also a Mexican national, was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in Del Rio. He’s charged with being an alien illegally present in the U.S., having been previously removed to Mexico in April. In 2022, Ruiz-Diaz was convicted for two separate DWI charges in Minnesota.

Also in Del Rio, a Fijian national in the U.S. on an immigration visa was arrested on an alien smuggling conspiracy charge. Viliame Fonolahi Ralulu was pulled over on Highway 277 south of Brackettville when U.S. Border Patrol agents allegedly observed a subject in the back seat look up then duck down in an attempt to conceal themselves. During an immigration inspection, two passengers were allegedly discovered in the back seat and determined to be illegally present in the U.S.

A Mexican national with a violent criminal record was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol and charged with illegal re-entry in El Paso. Frederico Bedolla-Bedolla has been removed from the U.S. four times and has been convicted in Arizona for two disorderly conduct charges for fighting and assault causing fear of physical injury, as well as domestic violence.

Justin Ross Meunier, a U.S. citizen with multiple felony convictions, was arrested for allegedly transporting three illegal aliens near the Tornillo Port of Entry. A criminal complaint alleges that U.S. Border Patrol agents observed Meunier’s vehicle stop near an orchard before three individuals emerged from hiding and boarded the vehicle. The agents approached and Meunier allegedly yelled in Spanish for the suspected aliens to get out and run. Meunier has been convicted for alien smuggling twice before, leading to 18 months of probation in 2019 and 21 months in prison in 2021.

U.S. Border Patrol agents also arrested Francisco Vidales-Aldaba for alien smuggling near the Bridge of the Americas Port of Entry. An agent allegedly observed two individuals, appearing wet and muddy, exit a residence and flag down a vehicle, which they boarded. Vidales-Aldaba was identified as the driver, and all three individuals were found to be illegal aliens. A criminal complaint alleges that Vidales-Aldaba had been a foot guide to five illegal aliens on Aug. 23 and had smuggled in four to five illegal aliens at a time on 15 occasions between 2022 and 2024. Immigration records indicate he’s been granted 15 voluntary departures through El Paso, the last being on Dec. 11, 2023.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ICE ERO), U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

Trump cancels $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign funding

Donald Trump said he would not be spending $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid, in a letter to Republican house speaker Mike Johnson.

The rare move, known as a “pocket rescission”, is a request to Congress for the president to not spend appropriated funds towards the end of the fiscal year –which ends on 30 September. Normally, the law stipulates that funding can be paused for 45 days while congress considers such a request. But a pocket rescission means that lawmakers don’t have enough time to act before the funds expire. This would be the first time a president has used the provision in 50 years.

It’s already attracted ire from several legislators. Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who chairs the appropriations committee called the president’s actions a “clear violation of the law”.

Meanwhile, Democrats decried Trump’s actions. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the ranking member of the finance committee, said the president is a “wannabe king is defunding support that prevents hunger and sickness worldwide”, while congressman Joaquin Castro of Texas said the decision to scrap billions in foreign funding was “wrong and illegal”, and urged his Republican colleagues to “say hell no”.

Miller calls RFK Jr a 'crown jewel' of Trump administration

When speaking about the ongoing turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Miller says, without evidence, that the agency lacked “credibility” and was staffed by “partisan” bureaucrats who weren’t “at all concerned about public health, and weren’t actually very knowledgable about public health.”

He goes on to defend health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is facing staunch criticism in the wake of firing CDC director Susan Monarez, and the resignation of several senior public health experts at the agency.

“Secretary Kennedy has been a crown jewel of this administration who’s working tirelessly to improve public health for all Americans, and again, to deal with the drivers of the chronic health crisis in this country,” Miller said.

White House adviser says immigration enforcement is a priority in 'sanctuary cities'

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, just spoke with reporters at the White House. He said that the administration will be “prioritizing enforcement in these sanctuary jurisdictions as a matter of public safety and national security”, when asked about upcoming immigration raids in so-called “sanctuary cities”, which are predominantly run by Democratic officials.

Miller alleged that these cities do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), even when an immigrant commits a crime, saying they don’t comply with detainers issued by Ice. However, the American Immigration Council notes that sanctuary cities do not “shield immigrants from deportation or prosecution for criminal activities”.

Amid CDC turmoil, RFK Jr peddles dubious health claims

Maya Yang

In a week of chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has continued to make questionable medical and health claims – and has been slammed for them by experts and lawmakers alike.

After the deadly mass school shooting in Minneapolis this week where two children were killed and 17 others injured, Kennedy suggested that psychiatric drugs may be contributing to the rise in gun violence across the country.

During an appearance on Fox & Friends, the host Brian Kilmeade asked Kennedy if the health department was investigating whether medications used to treat gender dysphoria might be linked to school shootings.

According to court documents reviewed by the Guardian, the 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, had changed their birth name from Robert to Robin because they identified as a woman.

In response to Kilmeade’s question, Kennedy, without acknowledging the prevalence and easy accessibility of firearms across the US – said that his department was “launching studies on the potential contribution of some of the SSRI [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors] drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be contributing to violence”.

This week, Kennedy also suggested that he could identify “mitochondrial challenges” in children at airports just by looking at them.

Speaking at an event in Texas alongside the state’s governor, Greg Abbott, Kennedy claimed: “I’m looking at kids as I walk through the airports today, as I walk down the street, and I see these kids that are just overburdened with mitochondrial challenges, with inflammation. You can tell from their faces, from their body movements, and from their lack of social connection. And I know that that’s not how our children are supposed to look.”

In response, Ashish Jha, former White House Covid-19 response coordinator under the Biden administration, said: “I’m sorry but what?”

“This is wacky, flat-earth, voodoo stuff, people. This is not normal,” Jha added on X.

Trump administration plans immigration surge in Boston – report

The administration is planning to ramp up immigration enforcement in Boston, Politico is reporting, citing a current and former administration official.

According to the official, the latest plans are subject to change, but would involve an increase in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) personnel in the city.

Boston mayor Michelle Wu, a Democrat, has pushed back against the Trump administration, and said the city would “not back down” from engaging in “sanctuary city policies” outlined by the justice department, including limiting city police from helping Ice agents make arrests.

Last week, acting Ice director Todd Lyons also said the increase in immigration enforcement was coming. “Sanctuary does not mean safer streets. It means more criminal aliens out and about the neighborhood. But 100%, you will see a larger Ice presence,” Lyons said in a radio interview.

Meanwhile, border czar Tom Homan said this week that immigration raids across several Democratic-led cities would take place after Labor Day.

Here's a recap of the day so far

At a hearing in Lisa Cook’s lawsuit, which challenges Donald Trump’s attempts to remove the governor from the Federal Reserve board, her lawyers said that her firing does “irreparable harm” as she’s a Senate-confirmed official who took an oath to carry out her role independently. They asked judge Jia Cobb to allow Cook to remain in her role as the litigation plays out. Cobb didn’t issue a ruling at the hearing. She will have to weigh whether the president had “cause” to terminate Cook, given the broad discretion he has under the Federal Reserve Act.

Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has signed a new redistricting bill that will redraw the state’s congressional map to heavily favor Republicans. Abbott signed today the highly controversial bill which prompted state Democrats to stage a weeks-long walkout earlier this month. The new districting plans will remove Democratic-majority districts in several major cities including Houston, Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.

Donald Trump has revoked Secret Service protection for the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, a senior White House official confirmed to the Guardian. Under federal law, former vice-presidents are entitled to receive Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office. However, Trump’s new directive cancels an undisclosed extension signed by then president Joe Biden before leaving office, according to CNN.

Attorney general Pam Bondi said that federal law enforcement had made 86 arrests in Washington DC on Thursday. It brings the total tally of arrests made by federal officers to 1,369, according to the White House.

US air force offers military funeral honors to slain January 6 rioter

The US air force has said it is offering military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, a supporter of Donald Trump who was shot and killed by a police officer during the 6 January 2021, attack on the US Capitol.

Babbitt, 35, a US air force veteran who lived in California, was fatally shot in the shoulder while she tried to enter a room near the House of Representatives during the riot.

“After reviewing the circumstances of [senior airman] Babbitt’s death, the Air Force has offered Military Funeral Honors to [senior airman] Babbitt’s family,” the air force said in a statement seen by Reuters.

The funeral honors would mark the latest gesture of support from Trump’s administration toward those who stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to block Congress from certifying his 2020 election loss. Trump has repeatedly made false claims that his 2020 loss to Joe Biden was due to voter fraud.

He and his supporters have sought to portray Babbitt as a martyr who was unjustly killed as she attempted to climb through a broken window of a barricaded door leading to the speaker’s lobby, a few feet from where members of Congress were waiting to be evacuated to safety during the attack.

An internal investigation by the US Capitol Police cleared the officer who shot Babbitt of wrongdoing in 2021 and said he would not face internal discipline. More than 1,500 people were criminally charged for participating in the riot. Trump pardoned nearly all of them, and released those who had been imprisoned.

Pentagon to restore Confederate general portrait at West Point library

Marina Dunbar

A controversial portrait of General Robert E Lee, which shows an enslaved man holding the Confederate leader’s horse, is being returned to the library at West Point, according to Pentagon officials who spoke with the New York Times.

The nearly 20ft canvas, which had hung in the US military academy since 1952, was removed following a 2020 law that ordered Confederate names and tributes to be stripped from military installations.

That same law established a commission to rename bases and review monuments. By 2022, the commission directed West Point to clear away all items that “commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy”. Shortly after, the Lee portrait was taken down and placed in storage.

Exactly how the painting is being reinstalled without countering the legislation remains uncertain. The measure was passed in the wake of nationwide demonstrations after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police.

Both Donald Trump and the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have pushed for the restoration of Confederate symbols that were removed in recent years. Hegseth, in particular, has pressed for reinstating a Confederate memorial at Arlington national cemetery that Congress recommended removing. In an August social media post, he wrote that the statue “never should have been taken down by woke lemmings”.

Hegseth moved to reinstate Confederate general names at army bases such as Fort Bragg and Fort Lee earlier this summer, but did so in a way that attempted to stay within the boundaries of the 2020 law. The new names honored different soldiers, none of whom had fought for the Confederacy, yet the names were the same as those of the original Confederate honorees.

In response to Abbott’s signing of the gerrymandered map pushed by Trump into law, Texas Democratic party chairman Kendall Scudder issued this statement:

With a stroke of the pen, Greg Abbott and the Republicans have effectively surrendered Texas to Washington, DC. They love to boast about how “Texas Tough” they are, but when Donald Trump made one call, they bent over backwards to prioritize his politics over Texans. Honestly, it’s pathetic.

I am proud of the Texas Democrats in the House and Senate who chose to fight, whether by a constitutionally protected quorum break, questioning these mapmakers, trying to pass amendments, or even attempting to filibuster.

This isn’t over – we’ll see these clowns in court. We aren’t done fighting against these racially discriminatory maps, and fully expect the letter of the law to prevail over these sycophantic Republican politicians who think the rules don’t apply to them.

Texas governor signs new redistricting bill, setting up loss of Democratic seats in US House

Maya Yang

Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has signed a new redistricting bill that will redraw the state’s congressional map to heavily favor Republicans.

Abbott signed today the highly controversial bill which prompted state Democrats to stage a weeks-long walkout earlier this month.

In a video on X, Abbott can be seen signing the bill and says it “creates the one big, beautiful map that ensures fairer representation in the United States Congress for Texas”.

Abbott’s signing comes after the Texas house of representatives approved the new map – which is set to create as many as five additional Republican congressional districts – on an 88-52 party-line vote. The state senate then approved the bill early on Saturday.

After the house’s approval, Donald Trump took to Truth Social and wrote: “Big WIN for the Great State of Texas!!! Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself.”

“Texas never lets us down. Florida, Indiana, and others are looking to do the same thing,” he added.

The bill’s passage follows Trump’s request for the state to draw new congressional maps. Currently, 25 of Texas’s 38 districts have Republican majorities. The new redistricting will bring the Republican-favored districts to 30.

The new districting plans will remove Democratic-majority districts in several major cities including Houston, Austin and the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.

US denies and revokes visas to Palestinian officials ahead of UN general assembly

The US is denying and revoking visas from members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority ahead of the United Nations general assembly meeting in September, the US state department has said in a statement.

The restrictions mean that Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas would likely not be able to travel to New York to deliver an address to the annual gathering, as he typically does, Reuters reports.

It follows the imposition of US sanctions on Palestinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organization in July, even as other western powers have moved toward recognition of Palestinian statehood.

In a statement, the state department said that “it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace”.

Officials with the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, reject that they have undermined peace prospects, Reuters reports.

Under the 1947 UN “headquarters agreement” the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. But Washington has said it can deny visas for security, terrorism and foreign policy reasons.

The state department said that the Palestinian Authority’s mission to the UN would not be included in the restrictions. It did not elaborate.

US Republican senator Joni Ernst of Iowa won't seek re-election in 2026 – report

CBS News is reporting that Republican senator Joni Ernst of Iowa plans to reveal next week that she won’t seek reelection in 2026.

Ernst, 55, who has served in the Senate since 2015, plans to make the announcement on Thursday, CBS reported citing multiple sources familiar with the matter.

Per CBS’s report:

Some Iowa Democrats have already jumped into the race, including state Sen. Zach Wahls, state Rep. Josh Turek, and Des Moines School Board chairwoman Jackie Norris.

Ernst has been evasive about whether she would run for a third term in 2026, but in public remarks earlier this month, predicted continued GOP control of Iowa.

“Every day we get a new Democratic member of the House or Senate that decides to run for this Senate seat — bring it on,” she said at a meeting of the Westside Conservative Club. “Bring it on, folks. Because I tell you, at the end of the day, Iowa is going to be red.”

White House officials had hoped Ernst would run again, instead of joining other Republicans who are leaving the Senate, including North Carolina’s Thom Tillis, Alabama’s Tommy Tuberville and Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell.

In a rebuttal, Abbe Lowell, Cook’s lawyer, offers a stern indictment of Trump’s basis for “cause”.

“Any reason is now cause,” Lowell says. “That could possibly mean the president decides it was cause because Governor Cook decides to attend to a meeting in a pant suit instead of a dress, and he didn’t think that has enough respect for the institution. That’s cause.”

Trump’s lawyer is citing case precedent now when it comes the question of Cook’s firing doing “irreparable harm”.

“The harm of having a somebody in office who was wrongfully there outweighs the harm of somebody being wrongfully removed from office,” he says.

The lawyer for the administration is going back-and-forth with Judge Cobb now, arguing that Cook has, in fact, had the opportunity to respond to Bill Pulte’s allegations.

“No response, no intent, no letter saying: ‘hey, I disagree with this’,” Trump’s lawyers say.

We’re now hearing from Trump’s lawyers. The justice department says that it doesn’t “see the argument that for a very senior financial regulatory official making contradictory representations on financial documents with no explanation” isn’t grounds for removal.

Fired fed governor's lawyer argues that her removal does 'irreparable harm'

Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, is arguing that her firing does “irreparable harm”. He says that Cook ultimately took an oath before Congress, and what she’s being “deprived of” is more than a paycheck, but the ability “to satisfy the oath” she took and “not to be removed from anything but cause”.

He added that while this lawsuit works its way through the court, the “status quo” should stay in place:

She [Cook] should not be taken out of her office. She shouldn’t be disconnected to her electronics. She should be able to participate in the meeting. She should do all the things that she did a week ago before all this started, because that is the status quo.

New Trump rule to ban VA abortions for veterans even in cases of rape and incest

Aaron Glantz

Doctors at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) would be barred from performing abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, under new rules proposed by the Trump administration.

The draft regulations, which also forbid providers from counseling female veterans about terminating a pregnancy, have generated nearly 20,000 comments in the federal register from conservative activists, abortion rights supporters and female veterans, many of them survivors of sexual assault.

“I am a veteran, a mother, and my abortion saved my life,” wrote Mary Dodson-Otten, a 41-year-old nurse and air force veteran who lives outside Atlanta, Georgia.

Dodson-Otten told the Guardian she ended a pregnancy in her 20s after she got pregnant by an abusive boyfriend who was a fellow service member. Without the abortion, she said, “I don’t think I would have survived, whether it would have been him hurting me or me hurting me.”

The rule proposed by the Trump administration has an exception that allows abortions to take place “when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term”. But abortion rights advocates said the exception was too limited.

“Women are going to die,” predicted Caitlin Russell, a former US army captain who served two tours in Afghanistan and studies female veterans’ health at the University of Pennsylvania.

Farm workers report they are being “hunted like animals.” And more than 530,000 immigrants have had their work permits terminated, including hundreds of thousands of people who work on farms, in hotels and restaurants, and in food processing facilities. Adding to the increasingly hostile environment, the government recently announced they will cut access to basic healthcare provided by federally funded clinics to undocumented people.

New research from UC Merced reveals that noncitizens are doing their best to stay at home out of fear of raids from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and deportation threats. California alone has seen more than a 3 percent dip in the state’s workforce as a result—comparable only to drops seen during the first year of the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic.

In some cases, the consequences are already clear. Michele Corigliano, the Executive Director of the Salt Lake Area Restaurant Association states that policy decisions have “messed up our industry.” And a Florida farmer says the government is “killing farming.”

A report from the American Immigration Council states, “Stories around the country already suggest that chilling effects are not only making immigrants themselves afraid to participate in public life, but affecting the institutions with which they interact.” But, the say, “It will take longer than six months to fully understand the impact of this chaos on American communities.”

The food system will grind to a halt without our immigrant neighbors and friends. But at the same time, we cannot reduce immigrants to being valuable only for their labor. People are people, wherever they were born and wherever they live.

On Friday, a three-judge panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s ruling, which kept in place Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans. The status will remain in place as the legal challenges proceed through the courts.

Before leaving office, the Biden administration had extended TPS for about 600,000 Venezuelans through October 2026.

The Trump administration has sought to end the extension, meaning that the status would expire for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, who were initially granted protection in 2023, in April of this year, and for approximately 250,000 Venezuelans, who were initially granted the status in 2021, by September.

That would leave those affected unable to legally work and vulnerable to deportation.

US District Judge Edward Chen had previously ruled in March that plaintiffs challenging the end of the protection were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration overstepped its authority.

Lawyers for affected Venezuelans had argued the administration had been motivated by racial animus.

At the time, Chen ordered a freeze on the termination. However, the Supreme Court reversed the ruling in an emergency appeal, temporarily allowing the administration to move forward in cancelling the status.

TPS targeted

Congress created Temporary Protected Status as part of the Immigration Act of 1990.

It allows the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to grant legal immigration status to individuals fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disasters, or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to their home country.

The Trump administration has increasingly targeted TPS recipients in its hardline approach to immigration, moving to terminate the programme for citizens of Haiti, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Honduras and Nicaragua.

While the administration has the authority to choose not to renew TPS, several courts have ruled against efforts to change already designated timelines.

In Friday’s ruling, the judges wrote: “In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25128650243074-1756489178.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-29 14:57:17.023307

“Today’s announcement of the administration’s plan to advance an unlawful ‘pocket rescission’ package is further proof President Trump and congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and ‘going it alone’ this fall,” Schumer said in a statement.
“As the country stares down next month’s government funding deadline on September 30th, it is clear that neither President Trump nor congressional Republicans have any plan to avoid a painful and entirely unnecessary shutdown,” he said.
“Speaker Johnson and Leader Thune have repeatedly refused to meet with Democrats to discuss a bipartisan path forward.
At the same time, President Trump has now okayed an unlawful gambit to circumvent the Congress all together with a so-called ‘pocket-rescission’ package,” Schumer said.","Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) blasted a White House budget office for advancing proposal to rescind $4.9 billion in funding allocated to the State Department and the dismantled U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), calling it “unlawful” and a rejection of bipartisanship.

The Democratic leader warned it also takes Washington a step closer to a government shutdown as it signals President Trump and congressional Republicans are “going it alone” into the Sept. 30 funding deadline.

“Today’s announcement of the administration’s plan to advance an unlawful ‘pocket rescission’ package is further proof President Trump and congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and ‘going it alone’ this fall,” Schumer said in a statement.

“As the country stares down next month’s government funding deadline on September 30th, it is clear that neither President Trump nor congressional Republicans have any plan to avoid a painful and entirely unnecessary shutdown,” he said.

Trump sent late Thursday to Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) a request to claw back the funding.

Congress will have 45 days to process the request once it returns to work next week after the August recess, a clock that begins ticking down once lawmakers resume the session.

Trump’s proposal is known as a “pocket rescission” because there are fewer than 45 days until the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, at which point the Office of Management and Budget will be able to return the congressionally appropriated funds identified by the rescissions request back to the Treasury Department.

The tactic has not been used in nearly 50 years.

Schumer criticized Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) for not agreeing to sit down with him and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) to initiate a “four corners” negotiation to find a government funding deal before Sept. 30.

The intention of the administration to rescind nearly $5 billion in funding Congress has already approved before the end of the fiscal year has angered Democrats, even though the move was expected, and will complicate the negotiations to avoid a shutdown.

“Speaker Johnson and Leader Thune have repeatedly refused to meet with Democrats to discuss a bipartisan path forward. At the same time, President Trump has now okayed an unlawful gambit to circumvent the Congress all together with a so-called ‘pocket-rescission’ package,” Schumer said.

The New York Democrat said “it doesn’t have to be this way” and urged “reasonable Republicans” not to “go along with the madness.”

“Republicans don’t have to be a rubber stamp for this carnage,” he said. “Democrats stand ready to work with anyone to help American families, lower health care costs and secure our communities. But if Republicans are insistent on going it alone, Democrats won’t be party to their destruction.”

The move has also seen some pushback from Republicans.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) said the timing of the administration’s rescissions request is “an apparent attempt to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval” and questioned its legality.

“GAO has concluded that this type of rescission is unlawful and not permitted by the Impoundment Control Act,” she said in a statement, referring to the Government Accountability Office.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/schumerchuck_072925gn06_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-29 19:56:48.659980

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., slammed the Trump administration after receiving disturbing reports from whistleblowers that the Office of Refugee

Resettlement (ORR) has finalized plans to deport nearly 700 Guatemalan children in government custody, who are awaiting reunification with family members or placement with sponsors.

These plans from the Trump administration are its latest attempt to disappear vulnerable unaccompanied children, violating ORR’s mandate to prioritize the welfare of children in their care.

“This move threatens to separate children from their families, lawyers, and support systems, to thrust them back into the very conditions they are seeking refuge from, and to disappear vulnerable children beyond the reach of American law and oversight,” Wyden highlighted in a letter to ORR Interim Director Angie Salazar.

Unaccompanied children often flee from abuse and violence in their home countries before arriving alone at America’s borders. ORR has the legal responsibility to ensure that these children are cared for and reunify them with their family in a timely manner. However, the second Trump administration has quickly turned ORR into an immigration enforcement arm that repeatedly uses unaccompanied children as bait to draw out undocumented family members for detainment. The escalation of attacks on unaccompanied children have led to serious harm, including prolonged separation from their families and even an increase in hopelessness and suicidal thoughts.

“The Administration’s decision to forcibly remove children from this country is outrageous and would undoubtedly result in serious violations of human rights, American law, and our shared responsibility to safeguard the welfare of these extremely vulnerable children. The world watched in horror as the first Trump administration ripped children from their families and held them in inhumane conditions. It appears this administration is eager to go even farther,” Wyden continued.

In February, Wyden demanded ORR to stop improper information sharing with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that would undermine the care of unaccompanied children and risk prolonged detention of children and family separation.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

President Trump yesterday cancelled former Vice-President Kamala Harris’ Secret Service protection, according to a copy of a letter seen by CNN. As a former vice president, Harris was entitled to six months of protection after leaving office under federal law. According to several sources, former President Biden extended this protection for an additional year in a secret directive that Trump has now revoked. Edward-Isaac Dovere reports.

The White House yesterday tapped one of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s top deputies, Jim O’Neill, to be the acting head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sources say. O’Neill is currently a HHS Deputy Secretary, and will continue in the role while serving as the interim CDC head, the sources added. He was a frequent critic of the CDC during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dan Diamond reports for the Washington Post.

Trump yesterday signed an executive order expanding his effort to strip union protections from federal employees. Trump’s new order directs NASA, the National Weather Service and the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Office of the Commissioner for Patents, and units of the Bureau of Reclamation to end their collective bargaining agreements. Chris Cameron reports for the New York Times.

The Defense Department will no longer allow Chinese nationals to work as coders on the Pentagon’s cloud systems, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Wednesday, citing “unacceptable risks” to national security. Ashleigh Fields reports for the Hill.

The Education Department wants Denver’s public school system to convert its all-gender restroom facilities into “sex-designated multi-stall restrooms” to resolve a civil rights investigation and avoid sanctions, according to a statement released by the department yesterday. Juan Perez Jr. reports for POLITICO.

The Defense Department is restoring a portrait of Gen. Robert E. Lee to the U.S. Military Academy library, officials say. The painting includes a slave guiding the Confederate general’s horse. It is unclear how the Pentagon plans to restore the portrait without violating an order from a congressionally-mandated commission for West Point to remove displays that “commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy.” Greg Jaffe reports for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS

The United States will not participate in the U.N.’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism or submit its report on the human rights situation in the United States when it is due in November, a State Department official told Reuters. According to the official, the move is a consequence of Trump’s February executive order directing the State Department to disengage from the U.N. Human Rights Council. A spokesperson for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said the organization regrets the U.S. decision. Andrew R.C. Marshall and Olivia Le Poidevin report.

The United States and Panama yesterday presented a draft proposal seeking the U.N. Security Council’s authorization for a new “Gang Suppression Force” to help tackle gang violence in Haiti. It was not clear from the draft whether the force would supplement the existing, Kenya-led Multinational Security Support force in the island country, or what states would help finance the deployment and contribute troops. Frances Robles reports for the New York Times.

The U.S. tariff exemption for package shipments valued under $800 ended today, with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection now collecting normal duty rates on all global parcel imports. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro yesterday claimed that the removal of the de minimis exception will “save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics and other dangerous prohibited items, and add up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues.” David Lawder and Andrea Shalal report for Reuters.

The European Commission yesterday proposed removing duties on imported U.S. industrial goods in a bid to pave the way for a reduction in U.S. tariffs on European cars. Philip Blenkinsop reports for Reuters.

The Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network yesterday issued a new advisory warning U.S. banks to monitor their operations for attempts by Mexican drug cartels to use Chinese money-laundering networks to hide their profits. Daniel Flatley reports for Bloomberg News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

European defense ministers will meet in Copenhagen to discuss the war in Ukraine today, following a Russian attack on Kyiv that killed 23 people and significantly damaged a EU diplomatic compound and the British Council’s offices. Both the EU and the United Kingdom summoned their respective Russian ambassadors in response to the strikes. The U.N. Security Council has also scheduled an emergency meeting on airstrikes against Ukraine for this afternoon at the request of Ukraine, the United Kingdom, France, Slovenia, Denmark, and Greece. Sam McNeil reports for AP News; Filip Timotija reports for the Hill.

The Trump administration yesterday announced it had approved a proposed $825 million sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) missiles to Ukraine. A source said that if the sale is concluded as expected, the missiles could be delivered later this year. The move appears to be the Trump administration’s first major arms sale of new weapons to Kyiv. Jennifer Hansler reports for CNN.

Ukraine and Russia are “perhaps … not ready to end [the war] themselves,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday while commenting on Russia’s strike on Kyiv. Leavitt said that Trump was “not happy” but “not surprised” by Russia’s attack, and noted that Ukraine launched effective assaults on Russia’s oil industry in recent weeks. Sam McNeil reports for AP News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Asked about Moscow’s deadly strike on Kyiv, a Kremlin spokesperson yesterday said that Russia remains interested in pursuing peace talks on Ukraine, but Moscow’s “the special military operation continues” and Kyiv “also continues strikes on Russian infrastructure.” Dmitry Antonov reports for Reuters.

Surveillance drones operated by Russia or its proxies are flying over routes used by the United States and Ukraine’s other allies to ferry military supplies through eastern Germany, according to U.S. and other Western officials. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius yesterday said that Berlin’s attempts to stop the drones are a “constant technical cat-and-mouse game” and that Germany is doing “everything [it] can” to counter the flights. A Kremlin spokesperson dismissed the report as “likely” fake news. Julian E. Barnes and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

European leaders are considering creating a buffer zone between the Russian and Ukrainian frontlines as part of a ceasefire or peace deal, European diplomats suggest. Moscow has previously embraced the idea of a buffer zone, and it is not clear Kyiv would accept the plan, as it would likely come with territorial concessions. The United States does not appear to be involved in the buffer zone discussions. Paul McLeary and Jack Detsch report for POLITICO.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

Hundreds of staffers working at the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, on Wednesday wrote to him asking to take a “clear and public” position describing the Gaza war as a genocide, according to a letter seen by Reuters. In the letter, the staff say they consider that the legal criteria for genocide have been met in the Israel-Hamas war. A U.N. spokesperson said that Türk has the full support of the U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres and that “labelling of an event as a genocide is up to a competent legal authority.” Emma Farge reports.

The British government has barred Israeli officials from participating in the United Kingdom’s biggest defense trade show due to the Israeli government’s decision to further escalate its military operation in Gaza, a government spokesperson confirmed today. Israeli defense companies will still be able to attend the event. Reuters reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Israeli forces killed at least 16 Palestinians across Gaza yesterday, according to local medics. Separately, an International Committee of the Red Cross spokesperson said that 31 patients, most with gunshot wounds, were admitted to the Red Cross Field Hospital in south Gaza’s Rafah. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

The “little bit more food” that is coming into Gaza is “not nearly enough to do what we need to do” in order to prevent widespread starvation, the World Food Programme’s Executive Director, Cindy McCain, told Reuters. Separately, McCain said that she has “personally met mothers and children who were starving in Gaza” and spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about increasing the flow of aid. Olivia Le Poidevin reports; Sam Mednick and Samy Magdy report for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

The Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Andrew Ferguson, has written to Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc., warning the tech giant not to filter or suppress emails sent over Gmail with “partisan effects,” Axios reports. Congressional Republicans in May called on the FTC to investigate whether Google’s spam filters are “unfairly” putting some of their emails in recipients’ spam folders. A Google spokesperson said the company’s filters apply equally to all senders, “regardless of political ideology.” Hans Nichols reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Kilmar Ábrego García’s attorneys yesterday asked a federal judge for an order that would restrain Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem from publicly attacking him, citing the impact of their statements on Ábrego García’s right to a fair trial. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

The Homeland Security Department is considering restricting the duration of foreign journalists’ U.S. visas to eight months, according to a proposed rule published in the Federal Register yesterday. Foreign journalists can currently stay for the length of their temporary activity or assignment in the United States. Laura Kelly and Rebecca Beitsch report for the Hill.

Seven migrants deported from the United States arrived in Rwanda this month, a Rwandan government spokesperson said yesterday. Under a deal struck with the Trump administration, the African state agreed to take in 250 deportees. Lucy Fleming reports for BBC News.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A federal judge yesterday rejected Saudi Arabia’s attempt to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the families of 9/11 victims that alleges Saudi government agents provided “an essential support network” for the hijackers. The judge ruled that although the doctrine of sovereign immunity would ordinarily prevent a foreign government from being sued in U.S. courts, the lawsuit could still proceed due to a carveout law Congress passed in 2016 to enable suits related to the attack. He also found that plaintiffs made a plausible case that high-ranking Saudi officials working in the United States provided assistance to hijackers in connection with their official duties. Mattathias Schwartz reports for the New York Times.

In the first case of its kind, a federal judge yesterday authorized the refund of a $2,200 restitution payment made by a Jan. 6 rioter pardoned by Trump. In authorizing the transfer, the judge wrote that “sometimes a judge is called upon to do what the law requires, even if it may seem at odds with what justice or one’s initial instincts might warrant.” Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

The Republican chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Bill Cassidy (R-LA), yesterday called on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to indefinitely postpone its next meeting in light of the “serious allegations” that have been made “about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed.” Alexander Bolton reports for the Hill.

The FBI yesterday said that it had arrested a Tennessee woman on charges of threatening to kill Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). Nate Rau reports for Axios.

FEDERALIZATION OF DOMESTIC POLICING

In a joint letter published yesterday, 19 Democratic governors described Trump’s “threats and efforts” to deploy National Guard troops without the request and consent of state governors as an “ineffective” and “alarming abuse of power.” Gregory Svirnovskiy reports for POLITICO.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

The U.N. Security Council yesterday unanimously voted to end the deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon at the end of next year. Lebanese officials last year called for the force to remain in the territory, saying the country’s cash-strapped army does not have the resources to patrol the full area on its own. Edith M. Lederer reports for AP News.

The Rapid Support Forces paramilitary yesterday shelled the besieged el-Fasher city in Sudan’s Darfur region, killing at least 24 people and wounding 55 others, the Sudan Doctors Network medical group said. Samy Magdy reports for AP News.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge yesterday blocked the Trump administration from firing Mike Abramowitz, the Voice of America’s director, without the approval of the International Broadcasting Advisory Board. The judge ruled that the Senior Advisor for the U.S. Agency for Global Media, Kari Lake, cannot unilaterally fire Abramowitz, as “the applicable statutory requirements could not be clearer” and require the bipartisan board to approve the termination in a majority vote. Shortly after taking office. Trump dismissed six of the seven members of the board, designed to check political influence on federally funded newsrooms, and has not named their replacements. David Folkenflik reports for NPR.

A full federal appeals court yesterday revised its earlier decision that a group of nonprofits could not challenge the Trump administration’s decision to freeze billions of dollars in Congressionally-approved foreign aid, ruling that the plaintiffs can continue challenging the move in a lower court for a subset of their claims. Zach Montague reports for the New York Times.

The Federal Reserve governor whom Trump tried to fire this week, Lisa Cook, yesterday filed a lawsuit challenging the dismissal. The legal challenge asks the court to rule that removal of a board member “for cause” cannot include “an unsubstantiated allegation” of the sort Trump leveled against her. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration plans to surge officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown in its latest move to expand the federal law enforcement presence in major Democratic-run cities, according to two U.S. officials.

The operation in the country’s third-largest city is expected to last about 30 days and could start as early as Sept. 5, a Department of Homeland Security official told The Associated Press on Friday. Another U.S. official said the timing for what could be a sustained immigration enforcement effort resembling this summer’s operations in Los Angeles is awaiting final approval.

Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal government immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and the state at odds with Trump’s administration as it tries to carry out his mass deportation agenda.

The Trump administration asked the military this week for use of the Naval Station Great Lakes, north of Chicago, to support immigration enforcement.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and other federal agencies would take part in the planned Chicago operation, according to the federal officials who spoke to The Associated Press. Unlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, it’s is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration instead of being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime.

The Republican administration is likely to face resistance to any operation from the region’s top Democratic officials, as it has in California from Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, like Newsom, has been trading barbs with Trump and his allies.

Pritzker said this week that Chicago doesn’t want military intervention to fight crime. On Friday, the Democrat noted that ICE is a civilian law enforcement agency and can legally operate in the city, “but we don’t appreciate when they mistreat our residents, many of whom have been here for decades.”

“We now have a president and a federal government that’s going after them, hunting people down and disappearing them off the streets,” Pritzker said after a school visit in the city’s south suburbs. “Men with masks are grabbing people off the streets and taking them away. That’s just shameful.”

The Department of Homeland Security said this week that it has made 5,000 immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area since launching a sustained crackdown in the nation’s second-largest metropolitan area June 6. Authorities are undeterred by a temporary court order prohibiting racial profiling in Los Angeles, which the administration has challenged before the Supreme Court.

“Make no mistake: If you are here illegally, we will find you, arrest you and send you back. This is just the beginning,” Secretary Kristi Noem said when announcing the arrest milestone in Los Angeles.

The Los Angeles operation has been marked by large, lightning-quick shows of force by heavily armed, masked agents in unmarked cars and civilian dress, often at Home Depots and car washes. The Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles said this week that 15% of Mexican citizens arrested so far work in construction followed by car washes at 13%, based on hundreds of interviews it has conducted.

Americans need to decide when “humanity first” should be the most relevant principle to guide US policy.","The Washington Post reports that the US government is requiring organizations receiving federal funding, including from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), not to “operate any program that benefits illegal immigrants” in the aftermath of disasters.

But the foundational principle of human rights is that everyone, regardless of race, religion, nationality, or legal status, is entitled, by virtue of their shared humanity, to be treated according to the same basic precepts. This moral code is especially critical during crises when “us versus them” instincts often prevail.

The practical implications of these new contract requirements are still unclear, but they raise alarming questions. Will the Red Cross and the Salvation Army have to check documents before providing food and shelter to disaster-displaced people? Out of fear that they will lose their jobs and their organizations their funding, will humanitarian workers avoid the darker-skinned person who asks for help in a foreign language?

In the aftermath of the Holocaust and World War II, the nations of the world, including the United States, agreed to a Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognized “the inherent dignity and … the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family.”

At issue is a core values question: Is there any universal humanitarian principle that takes precedence over the raw animus toward undocumented people that now seems to be a bedrock principle of US government policy?

My work centers on refugees worldwide, whose own governments have persecuted them or otherwise failed in the core obligation to protect them. They seek asylum based not on their claim to citizenship but rather on their claim to a common humanity. Governments have recognized their obligation not to return them to places where their lives or freedom would be threatened, a universal principle that has saved countless lives.

President Trump formally submitted a rescission request to Congress Thursday evening, asking lawmakers to claw back $4.9 billion in funding authorized for the U.S. Agency for International Development. Due to the timing of the request and the intricacies of federal appropriations law, the Office of Management and Budget said on Friday the request essentially amounted to Trump unilaterally canceling the funding.

The announcement drew quick rebukes from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who said the moves were illegal and circumventing the standard process for revoking funds. Trump earlier this year signed into law a measure to rescind more than $9 billion in spending on foreign aid and public broadcasting.

The White House previously told lawmakers it was considering employing “pocket rescissions,” a strategy that enables spending to expire before agencies can allocate it. The approach provides an avenue to circumvent Congress in the withholding of funds.

The 1974 Impoundment Control Act allows the president to propose rescinding funding previously approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to consider the request and OMB can direct agencies not to spend the funding proposed for rescission for the entire 45-day period, regardless of when Congress acts.

Agencies must spend most of the appropriations they receive by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. By issuing a rescission proposal in late-August, the funding will be frozen until it expires. OMB under Trump, and while Vought was deputy director, began the process for a similar effort toward the end of fiscal years 2018 and 2019, but decided not to pursue it.

No administration has executed a pocket rescission in about 50 years.

In 2018, the Government Accountability Office, which adjudicates the lawfulness of impoundments, found the ICA’s legislative history, Supreme Court precedent and the constitutional framework of the legislative and executive branches “provide no basis to construe the ICA as a mechanism by which the president may, in effect, unilaterally shorten the availability of budget authority by transmitting rescission proposals shortly before amounts are due to expire.”

GAO has already cited the Trump administration for numerous violations of the impoundment law, saying it has illegally withheld funds from the departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, Transportation and others.

Lawmakers quickly pushed back on Trump’s latest efforts, though actually stopping it would require legislative action or intervention in federal court.

“GAO has concluded that this type of rescission is unlawful and not permitted by the Impoundment Control Act,” said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. “Article I of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the responsibility for the power of the purse. Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law.”

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the spending panel, called on her colleagues to reject Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought’s “end run around Congress.”

“Russ Vought would like us all to believe that making this rescissions request just weeks away from the end of the fiscal year provides some sort of get-out-of-jail free card for this administration to simply not spend investments Congress has made,” Murray said. “It emphatically does not. Legal experts have made clear this scheme is illegal and so have my Republican colleagues.”

State Department Secretary Marco Rubio announced on Friday that Vought would oversee the “closeout” of USAID. Rubio has led the agency on an acting basis, though it has essentially ceased to exist after the administration laid off virtually its entire staff.

With current funding for all of government set to expire at the end of September, lawmakers are facing a tight timeline to avoid a shutdown. The House and Senate remain significantly divided on funding levels for fiscal 2026 and Democratic leaders this week implored their Republican counterparts to meet with them to discuss a path forward.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the pocket rescission announcement made it clear that Trump and congressional Republicans are “hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship” ahead of the government funding deadline.

“As the country stares down next month’s government funding deadline on Sept. 30, it is clear neither President Trump nor Congressional Republicans have any plan to avoid a painful and entirely unnecessary shutdown,” Schumer said. “It doesn’t have to be this way. Reasonable Republicans don’t have to go along with this madness.”

Passing any funding measure for fiscal 2026 will require Democratic support in the Senate. Schumer suggested, however, that if Republicans insist on “going it alone,” Democrats “won’t be party to their destruction.”",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2025/08/29/082925_Getty_GovExec_PocketRescission/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:56:53.940271

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss.
Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails.
At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18.
A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn’t partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.","WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump’s administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation’s largest immigration detention complex, it didn’t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.

Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.

The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in West Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.

The secretive — and brisk — contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government’s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president’s pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.

A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. “Private facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.

“The lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,” he said.

Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company’s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it’s unclear whether he might have partners.

Army declines to release contract

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined for three weeks to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees. After this story was published Thursday, the department’s spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, issued a statement that said “under President Trump’s leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.”

She said the Fort Bliss facility “will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals.”

Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.

The camp has drawn comparisons to “Alligator Alcatraz,” a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.

The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida’s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.

At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.

Three white tents, each about 810 feet (250 meters) long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by The Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.

Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Detention Watch, said the use of military bases hearkens back to World War II, when Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Army camps including Fort Bliss. She said military facilities are especially prone to abuse and neglect because families and loved ones have difficulty accessing them.

“Conditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,” Ghandehari said. “But when there’s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.”

Company will be responsible for security

A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.

The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it’s classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.

Though Trump’s administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities. For a firm to compete for such contracts, at least 51% of it must be owned by people belonging to a federally designated disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.

One of the losing bidders, Texas-based Gemini Tech Services, filed a protest challenging the award and the Army’s rushed construction timeline with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’ independent oversight arm that resolves such disputes.

Gemini alleges Acquisition Logistics lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work, according to a person familiar with the complaint who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Acquisition Logistics’ past jobs include repairing small boats for the Air Force, providing information technology support to the Defense Department and building temporary offices to aid with immigration enforcement, federal records show.

Gemini and its lawyer didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.

A ruling by the GAO on whether to sustain, dismiss or require corrective action is not expected before November. A legal appeal is also pending with a U.S. federal court in Washington.

On Thursday, White House border czar Tom Homan confirmed that the U.S. Naval Station Great Lakes, located near the Illinois-Wisconsin border, would be used as a hub for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers ahead of a planned Chicago operation. Homan said federal agencies would also target New York City, Portland and other Democrat-led cities after Labor Day.

Homan said “a large contingent” of ICE officers would be sent to Chicago, but would not confirm how many.

“We’re not going to tell you how many resources we’re sending to the city,” Homan said. “We don’t want the bad guys to know what we’re sending.”

Homan’s comments came after a NewsNation source with knowledge of the operation said Wednesday that Customs and Border Protection officials have begun planning for U.S. Border Patrol staff and agents to be sent to Chicago, along with ICE officers, for the operation.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told NewsNation this week that an ICE elite tactical unit, known as a “strike team,” will be sent to Chicago “soon,” but did not provide a specific timeline for the deployment.

The source said Noem’s comments signaled Chicago was the latest Democrat-led city where DHS would focus immigration enforcement efforts and that the agency had “tipped its hand.”

In a statement provided to NewsNation about the ICE spike team’s deployment to Chicago, a senior DHS official said, “President Trump has been clear: we are going to make our streets and cities safe again. Across the country, DHS law enforcement is arresting and removing the worst of the worst, including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists who have terrorized American communities.

“Under Secretary Noem, ICE and CBP are working overtime to deliver on the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe again.”

What plans for federal immigration enforcement are being made?

The NewsNation source said CBP has been working with Border Patrol staff on planning for the Chicago operation and has inquired to the Department of Defense and the Illinois National Guard about using their facilities.

In addition, the source said a U.S. Postal Service warehouse is being considered for housing staff members and equipment.

Illinois National Guard Lt. Col. Bradford Leighton told NewsNation this week the National Guard had not received any orders regarding any upcoming federal operation. Leighton said the majority of National Guard armories in Illinois are state-owned and that he was not aware of any communications between the National Guard and federal immigration agencies.

The Chicago Sun-Times reported earlier this week that DHS, ICE and CBP officers and agents would be housed at the Naval Station Great Lakes between Sept. 2 and Sept. 30, according to an internal email obtained by the newspaper.

Navy Capt. Stephen Yargosz wrote to his leadership team that the operations were similar to those that took place in Los Angeles this summer, confirming information a source told NewsNation. The published report also said the Navy captain’s email indicated the operation was focused on downtown Chicago, and that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth would need to sign off on a request for assistance.

National Guard troops could also be stationed at the Naval base during the operation, officials said in the email.

The Washington Post reported recently that the Pentagon has been planning a military deployment to Chicago for weeks, targeting September for an operation that would crack down on homelessness, crime and undocumented immigrants. The plan could be used as a blueprint for other major cities, the report indicated.

NewsNation’s source said internal discussions also involve placing federal immigration officers at Chicago’s major airports to provide support to federal Transportation Security Administration agents.

The source said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have been briefed on the operation. Spokespersons for Pritzker and Johnson did not return messages seeking comment from NewsNation.

Alderman Byron Sigcho-Lopez told NewsNation on Wednesday that he had not received any official information from Johnson’s office.

A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the operation Wednesday, telling NewsNation that officials would not “get ahead” of any potential immigration enforcement operations. Homan has previously referred to Chicago as “Ground Zero,” and the city was among the first immigration enforcement targets for the administration shortly after Trump took office.

During a two-day enforcement operation in Chicago in late January, ICE made more than 1,300 migrant arrests.

On Thursday, Homan said, “Chicago has a crime problem, and that’s why President Trump is thinking about it.”

Why is Chicago a top priority for the Trump administration?

Chicago and other Democratic-led cities have remained a target of the Trump administration due to their so-called “sanctuary” policies, which prevent state and local police from cooperating with ICE officers conducting immigration enforcement operations.

Noem appeared in suburban Chicago earlier this month to highlight recent arrests of migrant criminals in the greater Chicago area. She targeted Pritzker and Johnson, saying they were ignoring the law and referred to both elected officials as “obstructionists.”

“They’re deciding that dangerous criminals that are murderers, rapists, money launderers, have committed assaults, and that are trafficking children are more important than the families who live in the communities here,” Noem said at the event.

In recent days, President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago to address what he called “embarrassing” crime numbers. Trump said that he would send troops if he were asked to do so by Pritzker, who, along with Mayor Johnson, has been vocal in his opposition to federal troops being sent in to patrol Chicago’s streets.

“Governor Pritzker had 6 murders in Chicago this weekend. 20 people were shot. But he doesn’t want to ask me for help. Can this be possible? The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing. STAY TUNED!!! President DJT,” Trump wrote on social media Thursday.

In response, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said in a prepared statement: “As Illinois leaders and Chicagoans have made clear, we have not asked for or consented to President Trump bringing in the military to ‘save’ our city,” Durbin said. “And now he reportedly wants to further abuse his power, waste government resources, and undermine military readiness by using Naval Station Great Lakes as a center of his operation in Illinois. May I remind the President that deploying the military to Chicago, and derailing critical operations at Naval Station Great Lakes, would be both unhelpful and illegal.”

Chicago, along with cities such as Seattle, Philadelphia, New York and the northern Virginia/Washington, D.C., corridor, had been targeted for the possible deployment of ICE tactical teams. In June, five Democratic-led cities were identified as potential sites for federal immigration operations in the wake of anti-ICE rallies in Los Angeles.

What is an ICE strike team that is being sent to Chicago?

Trump previously sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles to assist with enforcement surrounding large anti-ICE rallies in which ICE officers were targeted by protesters. The team Noem referenced as a strike team in the agency’s plans for Chicago is an ICE Special Response Team.

Eight SRTs are deployed nationwide by ICE that are “trained to serve high-risk warrants under hazardous conditions, escort dangerous criminal aliens who have been ordered deported and assist local law enforcement agencies during critical incidents,” according to ICE.

The tactical units use BearCat tracked vehicles, long guns and tactical vests, typically in operations considered high risk. The elite special response teams are part of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which are charged with “upholding America’s immigration laws and within and beyond our borders through efficient enforcement and removal operations,” ICE said.

Federal officers within ICE SRTs undergo intense training and are used specifically in high-risk arrest situations and crowd control tactics, similar to Border Patrol’s BORTAC unit.

The team would be part of a larger DHS operation in Chicago, the NewsNation source said, as the Trump administration continues to target Democratic-led cities. City, state and federal elected officials who spoke at a news conference this week in Chicago argued Trump’s plans have nothing to do with law enforcement, but instead are political theater aimed at his rivals.

DHS officials said in a social media post Tuesday that the agency made its 5,000th criminal migrant arrest. The agency said the enforcement effort had taken “criminal illegal aliens, gang members, child predators and murderers” off the streets.

“This is just the beginning,” officials wrote in the post, which thanked CBP, Border Patrol and ICE for their efforts.

TRUMP FIRED FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK OVER ALLEGED MORTGAGE FRAUD: WHAT DID SHE DO?
The legal dispute comes amid the Trump administration's efforts to pressure the Fed into cutting interest rates.","President Donald Trump on Friday requested that a federal judge deny a request by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to prevent the president from firing her, as the court proceedings in the lawsuit to block her removal play out.

Trump on Monday moved to fire Cook over mortgage fraud allegations raised by the president's ally, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, which centered on Cook claiming primary residence status on two mortgages obtained on homes in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta in the span of two weeks in 2021. Pulte sent his criminal referrals to the Justice Department, though Cook has not been charged with a crime.

Cook filed suit on Thursday, arguing that the president hadn't met the standard of a removal for cause and requesting a restraining order to allow her to remain on the Federal Reserve.

The Trump administration's court filing argues that Pulte's criminal referral satisfied the ""for cause"" threshold needed to remove a Fed governor from their role, regardless of whether Cook's actions meet the standard of criminal mortgage fraud.

FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR LISA COOK SUES TRUMP

""Under any standard, making facially contradictory statements in financial documents – whether a criminal burden of proof could be sustained or not – is more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office,"" the Trump administration's filing stated.

The Federal Reserve and Chair Jerome Powell were also named as defendants in Cook's lawsuit, though that is only to ensure Cook can obtain legal relief and remain in her role as a Fed governor if she prevails in her legal case against the removal effort.

The Fed's filing explains that while the central bank has the authority to litigate independently under the Federal Reserve Act and will be present at Friday's hearing, ""it does not intend to offer arguments concerning Governor Cook's motion.""

""At this time, the Board merely expresses (1) its interest in a prompt ruling by this Court to remove the existing cloud of uncertainty; and (2) its intent to follow any order this Court issues,"" the Fed's filing explained.

COOK'S LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP SETS UP A POTENTIAL SUPREME COURT CLASH

Cook's lawsuit counters the Trump administration's claims that she could be removed following the referral, saying that federal laws covering the removal of officials at other agencies define negligence, malfeasance or inefficiency while in office as the standard of a ""for cause"" removal.

""There is no conceivable interpretation of ‘for cause’ removal protection that would allow the President to fire Governor Cook, either for his true motive or the pretextual one he has invented,"" Cook said in the motion seeking a temporary restraining order.

Such orders cannot generally be appealed, but if U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb grants the restraining order, it would likely be a longer-term injunction that could be reviewed by an appeals court. Cobb said she would set an expedited briefing schedule in the case during Friday's hearing.

TRUMP FIRED FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK OVER ALLEGED MORTGAGE FRAUD: WHAT DID SHE DO?

The case is likely to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, where a conservative majority has tentatively allowed Trump to fire officials from other agencies despite laws shielding them from removal – though a ruling in May distinguished the Federal Reserve from those agencies through its unique structure and ""distinct historical tradition.""

The legal dispute comes amid the Trump administration's efforts to pressure the Fed into cutting interest rates. If Cook is removed, it would allow Trump to name his fourth pick to the Fed's seven-member board of governors, all of whom serve on the Federal Open Market Committee that makes monetary policy decisions.

Trump has repeatedly criticized Fed Chair Powell, who he appointed to the role in 2017, for not cutting interest rates and allegedly mishandling an expensive renovation project.

The letter was posted Friday morning on the X account of the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Trump’s move rests on a tool not used in nearly 50 years, known as a pocket rescission: A president submits a request to Congress to not spend approved funds toward the end of the fiscal year so that Congress can’t act on the request in the 45-day timeframe, and the money goes unspent as a result. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.

Such a move, if standardized by the White House, could effectively bypass Congress on key spending choices and potentially wrest some control over spending from the House and the Senate.

Here’s the latest:

UN says US withholding over $1 billion will make finances challenging

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the United Nations will follow up with U.S. authorities to get more details on Friday’s White House announcement.

Trump said in a letter he would not be spending $4.9 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress including $520 million for the U.N. regular budget and other U.N. agencies and $838 million for international peacekeeping.

“What can I tell you?,” Dujarric said. “This is going to make our budget situation, our liquidity situation that much more challenging.”

Appeals court blocks Trump administration from ending legal protections for 600,000 Venezuelans

A federal appeals court on Friday blocked the Trump administration’s plans to end protections for 600,000 people from Venezuela who have had permission to live and work in the United States.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status for Venezuelans while the case proceeded through court.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration overstepped its authority in terminating the protections and were motivated by racial animus in doing so. Chen ordered a freeze on the terminations, but the Supreme Court reversed him without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.

It is unclear what effect Friday’s ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. Protections for another group of 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire Sept. 10.

Texas governor signs new voting maps pushed by Trump to gain five GOP seats in Congress in 2026

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday signed into law a new congressional voting map designed to help Republicans gain more seats in the 2026 midterm elections, delivering a win for President Donald Trump and his desire to hold onto a slim GOP majority in the U.S. House.

The Texas map drafted in rare mid-decade redistricting prompted fierce protests from Democrats and sparked a gerrymandering tug-of-war for voters in states across the country.

Before Texas lawmakers passed their new map, California had passed a bill that will ask voters to approve new Democratic-leaning districts to counter any Republican gains in Texas.

The incumbent president’s party usually loses congressional seats in the midterm election. On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing districts puts Democrats within three seats of a majority.

Trump is planning to send officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, AP sources say

The Trump administration is planning to send officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown in its latest move to expand federal law enforcement presence in major Democratic-run cities.

That’s according to two U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because plans have not been made public.

A Homeland Security Department official says operations in the nation’s third-largest city are expected to last about 30 days and may start as early as Sept. 5. Another U.S. official said timing for what could be a sustained operation resembling Los Angeles is awaiting final approval.

The Trump administration asked the military this week for use of the Naval Station Great Lakes, north of Chicago, to support immigration enforcement.

Republican chair of Senate appropriations committee criticizes Trump’s funding move

Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, says in a carefully-worded statement that its an “attempt to undermine the law” for President Donald Trump’s to cancel roughly $5 billion in foreign aid that was already approved by lawmakers.

“Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law,” Collins, a Maine Republican, said.

She has been pushing for Congress to work through a series of annual appropriations bills — something it has not done successfully for years. But as Trump seeks to dominate the federal government, Collins, a moderate Republican, has found herself increasingly at odds with the president.

“Instead of this attempt to undermine the law, the appropriate way is to identify ways to reduce excessive spending through the bipartisan, annual appropriations process,” she said.

Dems say government funding negotiations face setback after Trump cancels foreign aid

President Donald Trump’s move to cancel nearly $5 billion in foreign aid without congressional approval is enraging Democrats, setting up a clash over funding ahead of a potential government shutdown at the end of September.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who was essential to preventing a government shutdown in March, said in a statement that Trump’s move was a sign that Republicans would not work across the aisle to pass another funding package in the coming weeks.

Republicans control both chambers of Congress, but will need votes from some Democrats to meet the Senate’s 60-vote threshold.

“Today’s announcement of the administration’s plan to advance an unlawful ‘pocket rescission’ package is further proof President Trump and congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and ‘going it alone’ this fall,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement.

Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries have been calling on Republican leaders to meet with them to discuss a funding package, but say they have so far refused.

Palestinian UN ambassador says the Palestinians will respond to US revocation of visas of Palestinian officials

Riyad Mansour told U.N. reporters that he had just learned about Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s decision to revoke visas of a number of Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization officials ahead of next month’s annual gathering of world leaders at the UN General Assembly.

“We will see exactly what it means and how it applies to any of our delegation, and we will respond accordingly,” he said.

Mansour said Palestinian President Mahmoud is leading the delegation to the high-level meetings and is expected to address the General Assembly – as he has done for many years – and to attend a high-level meeting on the afternoon of Sept. 22 on a two-state solution co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia.

The State Department said Palestinian representatives assigned to the Palestinian Authority mission at the United Nations, which is led by Mansour, will be granted waivers so they can continue their New York-based operations.

Trump’s ‘pocket rescission’ is a rarely used flex on Congress. Here’s why some say its illegal

Trump’s budget office is telling Congress it won’t spend funding for nearly $5 billion in foreign aid projects that had already been approved by lawmakers, just weeks before the end of the fiscal year.

It’s a flex on Congress’s authority that hasn’t been used in nearly 50 years, in part because it’s so legally dubious. Here’s why.

Usually, funding rescissions from the White House have to be approved by Congress, but because this rescission request was made so close to the end of the fiscal year, Congress doesn’t have time to act within the 45-day window it’s given under law to either accept or reject the request.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office, which acts as a watchdog for Congress, has already weighed in to say that such a move — called a “pocket rescission” — is illegal. Essentially, it allows a president to subvert Congress’ constitutional power over government funds.

But the White House went ahead and did it anyways, setting up a clash with lawmakers as they try to work out a funding package in the coming weeks.

Here’s what the White House is withholding funds for

The White House is targeting nearly $5 billion in funds, using a maneuver known as a pocket rescission that essentially defies the will of Congress. Here’s the programs affected:

$3.2 billion for development assistance grants, which included programs like food security research, a fund meant to counter Chinese influence abroad, initiatives meant to spur businesses to engage in climate solutions

$520 million for the UN regular budget, and other organizations such the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization

$838 million for contributions to international peacekeeping operations

$322 million for the Democracy Fund, which is meant to encourage democracy and inclusiveness in other nations

Zelenskyy seeks talks with Trump and European leaders on slow progress of peace efforts with Russia

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that Ukrainian officials want to meet with President Trump and European leaders next week to discuss recent developments in efforts to end the three-year war with Russia.

The proposed meetings appeared designed to add momentum to the push for peace, as Zelenskyy expressed frustration with what he called Russia’s lack of constructive engagement in the process while it continues to launch devastating aerial attacks on civilian areas.

Trump has bristled at Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s stalling on an U.S. proposal for direct peace talks with Zelenskyy and said a week ago he expected to decide on next steps in two weeks if direct talks aren’t scheduled.

Trump complained last month that Putin “ talks nice and then he bombs everybody.” But he’s also chided Ukraine’s attacks, and a major missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight from Wednesday to Thursday that killed at least 23 people drew no public condemnation from the Trump administration.

US revokes visas of Palestinian officials ahead of UN General Assembly

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has revoked the visas of a number of Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation Organization officials ahead of next month’s UN General Assembly session at which the two groups had been previously represented.

In a statement, the State Department said Friday that Rubio had also ordered that some new Palestinian official visa applications be denied. The statement didn’t specify how many visas had been revoked or how many applications had been denied.

“It is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,” the department said. “Before the PLO and PA can be considered partners for peace, they must consistently repudiate terrorism — including the October 7 massacre — and end incitement to terrorism in education, as required by U.S. law and as promised by the PLO.”

Palestinian representatives assigned to the Palestinian Authority mission at the United Nations will be granted waivers so they can continue their New York-based operations, it added.

Vought takes reins of USAID from Rubio

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is relinquishing one of his several Trump administration jobs to Russell Vought, who’s taking on another post.

Rubio posted on social media Friday that the Office of Management and Budget director would take over the U.S. Agency for International Development “to oversee the closeout of an agency that long ago went off the rails.”

Vought replied on social media, “Happy to help! Let’s go!”

Rubio joked during this week’s cabinet meeting that the coming Labor Day holiday would be very meaningful to him “as someone with four jobs.” In addition to serving as chief U.S. diplomat and heading up USAID, Rubio has been serving as acting national security adviser and leading the National Archives and Records Administration.

RFK Jr. sends email to CDC employees amid leadership turmoil at the agency

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sent the message to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees Thursday night, amid an exodus of leaders at the Atlanta-based agency.

The White House this week moved to dismiss CDC Director Susan Monarez after she was in the job less that a month, and three top CDC officials resigned in protest. In the email Thursday night, Kennedy said he was committed to working with CDC employees. He said HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill will also serve as Acting CDC Director.

Kennedy also said he and President Trump “are aligned on the commonsense vision for the CDC,” which Kennedy described as a focus on infectious diseases and those spread through the air or contact with contaminated surfaces.

He also noted the planned launch of a Biothreat Radar Detection System, which would expand the advanced molecular detection work performed by the CDC center focused on emerging infectious diseases. That center’s director, Dr. Daniel Jernigan, was one of the CDC officials who resigned this week.

Trump has repeatedly cut off security for figures who’ve fallen out of his favor

The president has ended Secret Service protection for his onetime national security adviser John Bolton and members of Biden’s family, including the former president’s adult children.

The decision to strip Harris of protection is certain to raise alarms among security experts who view continuity of protection as essential in a polarized climate. The run-up to the 2024 election was particularly charged, with Trump facing two assassination attempts. The Secret Service played a crucial role in protecting the now-president.

Harris’ Secret Service protection officially ends Monday

A senior Trump administration official said an executive memorandum was issued Thursday to the Department of Homeland Security ending Harris’ security detail and security services.

Those had been extended from six to 18 months by the Biden administration, so they would have ended in July 2026, but now they’ll be terminated Monday.

The move to drop Harris’ Secret Service protection comes as the former vice president is about to embark on a book tour for her memoir, titled “107 Days.” The book is scheduled to be released next month.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer calls on Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Schumer says Kennedy’s tenure leading the Department of Health and Human Services has been marked by chaos.

“RFK Jr.’s stubborn, pigheaded, and conspiracy-based attacks on proven science are going to make many more people sick and cause more deaths,” Schumer, a New York Democrat said in a statement. “Americans are in greater danger every day Robert Kennedy Jr. remains as HHS Secretary.”

Senate Democrats uniformly opposed Kennedy’s confirmation in February, but criticism of how he’s handled the job has only increased since the Trump administration moved to fire Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Kennedy is scheduled to appear before a Senate panel next week.

Trump uses ‘pocket rescission’ to block $4.9B in foreign aid

The president said in a Thursday letter to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson that he would not be spending $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.

The letter was posted Friday morning on the X account of the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Trump is using what’s known as a “pocket rescission” in which a president submits a request to Congress to not spend approved funds toward the end of the fiscal year, so that Congress can not act on the request in time and the money goes unspent as a result. September is the final month in the government’s fiscal calendar.

Trump revokes Secret Service protection for former VP Harris, AP sources say

President Trump has revoked Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris. That’s according to a senior White House official.

Former vice presidents typically get federal government protection for six months after leaving office, while ex-presidents do so for life. But another person familiar with the matter says then-President Joe Biden quietly signed a directive that had extended protection for Harris beyond the traditional six months.

The people insisted on anonymity Friday to discuss a matter not made public.

Fed governor Cook to seek court order blocking her firing by Trump

A case that could provide the Trump administration with new and expansive power over the traditionally independent Federal Reserve will get its first court hearing Friday.

Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has requested an emergency injunction to block President Donald Trump’s attempt to fire her over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud when she purchased a home and condo in 2021. She was appointed to the Fed’s board by former president Joe Biden in 2022.

If her firing is allowed to stand, it would likely erode the Fed’s longstanding independence from day-to-day politics. No president has ever fired a Fed governor in the agency’s 112-year history. Economists broadly support Fed independence because it makes it easier for the central bank to take unpopular steps such as raising interest rates to combat inflation.

Hector has a developmental disability, knows only minimal Spanish and struggles to speak his native language, K’iche’, due to complications from two childhood operations for a cleft palate and cleft lip.

Those barriers did not dissuade immigration agents from arresting Hector on Aug. 12 during a raid of his apartment in Oakland. Hector, now detained at the Northwest ICE Detention Center in Tacoma, is unable to understand his own legal proceedings and is isolated from the few people who know how to communicate with him, said Abby Sullivan Engen, a California attorney who spoke to Hector two days after his arrest during a phone call with an interpreter.

“He’s incredibly scared,” Sullivan Engen said. “He said, ‘My heart hurts.’ ”

ICE typically used to release some detainees like Hector from custody because of their disabilities or medical conditions, immigrants’ rights advocates say. But Hector’s case, they say, reflects a growing concern that ICE — to meet the Trump administration’s reported goal of at least 3,000 arrests of undocumented immigrants per day — is detaining people that detention centers’ staff lack the expertise or resources to care for.

“People are arrested and instead of looking at their individual circumstance, they’re just counted as another number,” said Matt Adams, a spokesperson for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. “ICE is no longer using common sense in making determinations about who should be locked up.”

In an email Monday, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Hector was arrested during what it called a “targeted DEA operation,” but did not elaborate further.

It’s unclear why ICE officers knocked on Hector’s door, or if someone gave them permission to come inside, said Sullivan Engen, who is also the co-director of Centro Legal de la Raza, an Oakland-based immigrants’ rights organization. She said Hector and his five housemates lived near, but were not associated with, the people federal agents were targeting that day.

Hector was raised in a rural, impoverished village outside of the U.S. with almost no access to medical care, and his developmental disorder — undiagnosed for years — prevented him from learning how to walk, chew and talk until years after most children, his cousin, Elian, and Sullivan Engen said.

Sullivan Engen declined to provide Hector’s full name or country of origin because his developmental disability prevents him from consenting to release them.

But Elian said Hector grew up isolated from and bullied by other children, most of whom had never seen someone with scars from a cleft palate or cleft lip. He struggled to hear and pronounce words, and with no written form of K’iche’ or exposure to sign language, communicating with him was almost impossible.

Hector eventually learned to talk, mostly in K’iche’ and some Spanish, but his speaking and listening ability remain limited. Already extremely anxious around people outside his family, Hector kept to himself, likely to avoid straining to hear people or needing to repeat himself to be understood, Elian said.

Hector’s life changed when he came to the United States as an unaccompanied teenager and moved into a home in Oakland with five people who became his friends and surrogate caretakers, said Elian, who lives in Oakland but not in Hector’s home. Elian and Sullivan Engen declined to say how Hector came to Oakland or found his home there.

Hector was working up to seven hours per day at a local restaurant with support from his manager, and his family outside the U.S. relied heavily on his earnings, Sullivan Engen said. When he wasn’t at work, he was inside his apartment, where he felt safest, Elian said.

But on Aug. 12, Hector awoke to the sounds of ICE officers pushing their way into his home, Elian said.

ICE officers transported Hector and at least two of his housemates to the agency’s field office in San Francisco. While his housemates were immediately transferred to the Tacoma detention center, ICE officers held Hector in San Francisco for more than a day, likely because “they understood that Tacoma might not be equipped to take care of him,” but weren’t sure where else to send him, Sullivan Engen said.

Representatives for ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not agree to interviews.

In an email Monday, the Department of Homeland Security said Hector “freely admitted to being” an undocumented immigrant and that he “claimed to not have any medical conditions.”

The agency did not say whether a K’iche’ or Spanish interpreter was present during Hector’s arrest to help him understand and answer officers’ questions about his birthplace, citizenship status or medical condition.

“Behind the wall”

According to the Department of Homeland Security, all detainees undergo a medical, dental and mental health screening within 12 hours of arriving at an ICE detention center and a “full health assessment” within two weeks. They also have access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.

Detainees with disabilities can also request a “reasonable accommodation” from ICE, such as a sign language interpreter, according to the agency’s website.

“Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention facilities are false,” the DHS email said.

Immigrants rights advocates who have researched and documented ongoing concerns at the Tacoma detention center and elsewhere disagreed. A federal judge in California in July ordered ICE officials to provide a sign language interpreter to a deaf detainee, saying the man had a right to understand his own case and communicate, according to a report by nonprofit outlet CalMatters.

Though more people are now staying “locked up,” the agency doesn’t appear to be increasing staffing or resources to keep up with the growing number and needs of detainees, Adams said.

Detention centers across the U.S. are getting crowded, including in Tacoma, which saw its number of detainees nearly double from about 800 early this year to reaching its 1,575-bed capacity in June, according to Adams.

“Everyone is suffering down there, but especially someone in (Hector’s) position who is going to be particularly unable to fend for themselves,” Adams said. “They’re bearing the brunt more than others.”

Issues like poor food and hygiene and overuse of solitary confinement “have only continued to deteriorate” this year, said Phil Neff, a University of Washington Center for Human Rights researcher who has been studying conditions at the Tacoma facility for nearly a decade.

Prisons, jails and detention centers are designed to “routinize and flatten out” what everybody is getting and doing — the “complete opposite approach” needed to care for people with disabilities, who often require individualized medical or mental health treatment, said Rachael Seevers, an attorney for Disability Rights Washington.

Detainees who struggle to understand or follow the rules because of a mental health disorder or cognitive disability are also more likely to be placed in solitary confinement, according to Neff and Seevers.

Sullivan Engen said she did not know whether Hector has been placed in solitary confinement, but a UW analysis found that Tacoma’s detention center holds people longer, on average, in solitary confinement than any other ICE facility in the U.S., and frequently those who are mentally ill.

Advocating for people who cannot advocate for themselves is made more difficult because so few outsiders are allowed “behind the wall” to talk to detainees and witness their living conditions, Seevers said.

“There are still prison walls between people and the community,” she said. “That, in and of itself, is a barrier to people getting effective care.”

Last Tuesday, an attorney in Tacoma delivered paperwork to the immigration courthouse located inside the ICE facility, documenting Hector’s disabilities and identifying a family member who agreed to take him in should he be released, Sullivan Engen said.

Washington immigration attorneys working on Hector’s case also submitted a request that he be assessed for competency, in the hopes that he won’t be forced to represent himself, according to Sullivan Engen. Immigration judges are not required to provide attorneys for immigrants except under specific circumstances, including if the defendant is found to be mentally incompetent.

During a Monday immigration court hearing, Hector told a judge his best language was K’iche’. The judge scheduled another hearing for Sept. 24, likely because they must request an interpreter, Sullivan Engen said. It does not appear the judge or ICE officials discussed the competency assessment request or documentation of Hector’s disabilities, she said.

For Elian, being separated for weeks from Hector with no way to soothe his cousin’s fears has left him feeling helpless and heartbroken.

“He needs to be with someone who understands him and understands his disabilities,” Elian said. “They’re arresting innocent people that they shouldn’t. Why not look for specific people? Why do they get innocent people that don’t deserve it?”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08222025_ICE_102246.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-29 13:57:10.382191

The 15-page notification, sent to Congress on Thursday night and reviewed by The New York Times, is the administration’s first effort to push through what is known as a “pocket rescission.” It is an effort to unilaterally claw back money that has already been appropriated by waiting so late in the fiscal year to make the request that lawmakers do not have time to reject it before the funding expires.

The fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, before the 45-day period in which Congress is required to consider a rescission request from the White House. Republicans could bring the matter to a vote sooner, but party leaders have shown little appetite for resisting the president’s spending demands and asserting their own prerogatives.

The move, the latest chapter in an intensive fight between Mr. Trump and Congress over spending powers, drew swift condemnation from the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, who called it illegal.

“Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement on Friday.

“Given that this package was sent to Congress very close to the end of the fiscal year when the funds are scheduled to expire, this is an apparent attempt to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval,” Ms. Collins said.

The maneuver could further complicate lawmakers’ attempts to cobble together a bipartisan funding package to ensure the government does not shut down on Oct. 1. Any spending compromise must win Democratic support in the Senate to pass, and Democrats have said they would be loath to lend their votes to such a package if the White House continued unilaterally cutting congressionally approved funding.

The request largely targets accounts funding the United States’ contributions to the United Nations and soft power programs run by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has already largely been dismantled by the Trump administration.

The single biggest clawback would be a $445 million cut to U.S. funding of peacekeeping operations abroad, including through the United Nations. The request also proposes a $132-million rescission of the $140 million approved by Congress for the Democracy Fund at the State Department. The White House’s proposed budget released earlier this year suggested eliminating that program entirely.

Like the rescissions package sent to Congress that Republicans approved earlier this year, the White House did not single out specific programs for cuts.

The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan oversight body that reports to Capitol Hill, ruled during the first Trump administration that pocket rescissions are illegal. But Russell T. Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, has made the case that the executive branch has broad discretion to use them.

The proposal also infuriated Democrats. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking member on the appropriations panel, said that lawmakers could not “accept this absurd, illegal ploy to steal their constitutional power to determine how taxpayer dollars get spent.”

And Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, suggested that the request was “further proof President Trump and Congressional Republicans are hellbent on rejecting bipartisanship and ‘going it alone’ this fall.”

“Republicans don’t have to be a rubber stamp for this carnage,” Mr. Schumer said. “Democrats stand ready to work with anyone to help American families, lower health care costs and secure our communities. But if Republicans are insistent on going it alone, Democrats won’t be party to their destruction.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/29/multimedia/29trump-news-foreign-aid-topart-zgft/29trump-news-foreign-aid-topart-zgft-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 12:59:55.724994

Not so fast, says the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. In a recent decision, the court made it clear: simply purchasing a game doesn’t unlock the door to a VPPA claim. Without a controlling U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit precedent, the court looked to other jurisdictions and held that plaintiffs must do more than just allege a game purchase—they need to show the game actually contains “cut scenes” or other prerecorded video content to even get in the game. In Garcia v. Bandai Namco Entertainment America Inc., the court hit pause on a plaintiff’s VPPA claim, finding no allegations of any qualifying video content.[1] At the same time, the court stopped short of deciding whether simply alleging the presence of cut scenes in purchased video games would meet the VPPA’s requirements in this jurisdiction, leaving that issue for another day.

Meanwhile, in Pileggi v. Washington Newspaper Publishing Company LLC, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit weighed in on who counts as a VPPA “consumer,” adding fuel to a growing circuit split.[2] The court held that only those who actually consume the specific video materials at issue—not just general subscribers or users—can bring a claim. For more on these pivotal rulings and what they mean for publishers and platforms, read on.

Bandai: Familiar VPPA Video Game Allegations

The general allegations are familiar: the plaintiff alleges that they purchased video games on the defendant’s website, on which the defendant had installed the Meta Pixel to create targeted advertising. Id. at *1–2. Without consent, the defendant shared the plaintiff’s identity along with the titles of video games he viewed and purchased. Id.

The Court’s Analysis

The court found that “Plaintiff fails to allege that the video games Defendant specifically sells, let alone the video game that Plaintiff pre-ordered, contain cut scenes or other prerecorded content.” Id. at *9. In other words, the plaintiff’s complaint—asserting that selling games makes the defendant a video tape service provider because games are “video materials”—was not enough.

Given the lack of Ninth Circuit precedent, the court relied on guidance from other jurisdictions, specifically Aldana v. GameStop, Inc.[3] (U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit) and Mendoza v. Caesars Ent., Inc. (U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey).[4] Those cases suggest plaintiffs must allege the presence of “cut scenes”—defined in Aldana as “video clips within a video game that move the narrative of the game forward”[5]—or comparable prerecorded video content to potentially bring video games within the VPPA’s scope. The logic goes that because these clips are like short video clips buried within an interactive game: the game might not make a provider a video tape service provider, but the cut scene within the game just might. The law remains unsettled in the Ninth Circuit as to whether such an allegation would, by itself, be sufficient for a claim. Id. at *7.

The plaintiff here did not allege that the games included cut scenes, nor did they supply functional evidence to support such a claim (a broken link to a YouTube video was cited in their opposition, which was too late and ineffective). On this basis, the court dismissed the VPPA claim, signaling that mere game purchase allegations do not satisfy the VPPA’s requirements.

Separately, the court held that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged two other VPPA elements: that the defendant (1) disclosed the plaintiff’s personally identifiable information and (2) did so without consent. Id. at 9–13.

The issue of what constitutes personally identifiable information—particularly in cases involving Meta Pixel—remains subject to a broader circuit split, discussed further in our Law360 midyear recap here.

Takeaway

This decision provides important clarity on VPPA liability for video game publishers. Plaintiffs cannot merely allege they procured video games but must instead assert that the specific video games on which they base their claims “contain cut scenes or other prerecorded content.” Id. at *9.

The plaintiff has already sought to remedy these deficiencies by filing an amended complaint that delves much more deeply into “cut scenes” allegedly present within the defendant’s games. Time will tell whether their fixes will be enough.

Pileggi: Deepening the “Cut Scene” Circuit Split

Separately, the D.C. Circuit added to the circuit split regarding VPPA’s definition of “consumer” in Pileggi v. Washington Newspaper Publishing Company LLC, No. 24-7022, 2025 WL 2319550 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 12, 2025). The court agreed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit: a plaintiff must be a consumer of the specific video materials at issue, rather than a general subscriber or user. Id. at *8. A plaintiff alleging subscription to an email newsletter and separate video viewing did not satisfy the VPPA’s consumer threshold.

The D.C. Circuit’s stance aligns with the Sixth, diverging from the Second Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

The Department of Homeland Security likely violated its legal authority by terminating Temporary Protected Status early for those immigrants, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled Friday, affirming a lower court order staying the move by DHS.

The decision comes after the US Supreme Court in May granted an emergency request from DHS allowing it to go ahead with removing TPS protections for the Venezuelan Americans while litigation continues moves forward.

“There are now two comprehensive decisions carefully explaining why the Venezuela vacatur is illegal, but neither has any effect because of the two paragraph unreasoned SCOTUS order,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, a UCLA Law professor and counsel for plaintiffs.

Hundreds of thousands of migrants’ legal status in the US remains in limbo as multiple federal courts weigh the legality of Trump administration efforts to revoke temporary humanitarian status such as TPS and parole for groups from a swath of countries.

The TPS program, which was enacted in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990, allows immigrants from designated countries to stay in the US with legal work authorization for up to 18 months when circumstances such as armed conflict or political instability make it unsafe to return home. DHS is required to make an objective review of conditions on the ground in a given country at least 60 days before its designation expires before deciding to renew or end protections.

The National TPS Alliance sued DHS in February, arguing Secretary Kristi Noem’s cancellation of a TPS extension granted by the Biden administration and subsequent termination of protections for those covered by a 2023 designation violated the Administrative Procedure Act because she did not have authority to annul previously issued protections. The plaintiffs also argued the termination decision was also arbitrary and capricious because it didn’t go through the proper review process and that it was motivated by unconstitutional racial animus.

The Ninth Circuit found plaintiffs were likely to succeed with claims that Noem lacked authority to vacate prior extensions and therefore didn’t need to consider additional claims. Congress has provided an explicit procedure for terminating a TPS designation that doesn’t allow for removing a designation “midstream,” Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw wrote for the panel.

“Thus, if the Secretary wished to end TPS status for Venezuelans, she is statutorily required to follow the procedures for termination that Congress enacted,” wrote Wardlaw, a Bill Clinton appointee.

The Ninth Circuit panel that heard the case last month also included Joe Biden appointees Salvador Mendoza Jr. and Anthony Johnstone.

The panel found that a nationwide postponement of the termination was the only remedy that provided complete relief to plaintiffs, who faced potential deportation, family separation, and loss of jobs as a result.

A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that the TPS program had been exploited as a “de facto amnesty program.” Secretary Noem “will use every legal option at the Department’s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans,” the spokesperson said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump has moved to unilaterally cancel $4.9 billion in federal funding authorized by Congress, escalating the fight over who controls the nation's spending.

In a letter posted online late Thursday, Trump told House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson that he plans to withhold funding for 15 international programs.

The U.S. Constitution grants funding power to Congress, which every year has to pass legislation to fund government operations.

The White House must secure Congress' approval if it does not want to spend that money. Congress did this in July when it canceled $9 billion in foreign aid and public media funding.

The latest move -- known as a ""pocket rescission"" - bypasses Congress entirely.

Trump budget director Russell Vought has argued that Trump can withhold funds for 45 days, which would run out the clock until it expires at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. The White House said the tactic was last used in 1977.

According to a court document filed on Friday, the money at issue was earmarked for foreign aid, United Nations peacekeeping operations, and democracy-promotion efforts overseas. Most of that had been handled by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which Trump's administration has largely dismantled.

Democrats say the administration had frozen more than $425 billion in funding overall.

Most Republican lawmakers have said they support spending cuts in any form even if it erodes Congress' authority.

But Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who oversees spending legislation as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the action is illegal.

“Instead of this attempt to undermine the law, the appropriate way is to identify ways to reduce excessive spending through the bipartisan, annual appropriations process,"" she said in a statement.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is aiming to force a government shutdown at the end of September by indicating that he is willing to ignore any spending laws passed by Congress.

""Republicans don’t have to be a rubber stamp for this carnage,"" Schumer said in a statement.

Those rescissions clawed back funding for public broadcasting and foreign aid.
In February, the administration said it would eliminate almost all of USAID’s foreign aid contracts and $60bn in overall assistance abroad.
The Trump administration on Wednesday appealed to the supreme court to stop lower court decisions that have preserved foreign aid, including for global health and HIV and Aids programs, that Trump has tried to freeze.","Donald Trump has told the House speaker, Mike Johnson, that he won’t be spending $4.9bn in congressionally approved foreign aid, in effect cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Trump, who sent a letter to Johnson on Thursday, is using what is known as a “pocket rescission” – when a president submits a request to Congress to not spend approved funds toward the end of the fiscal year, so that the legislature cannot act on the request in the 45-day timeframe and the money goes unspent as a result. It’s the first time in nearly 50 years a president has used one. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.

The letter was posted on Friday morning on the X account of the White House office of management and budget. It said the funding would be cut from the state department and the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, an early target of Trump’s efforts to cut foreign aid.

The last pocket rescission was in 1977 by then president Jimmy Carter, and the Trump administration argues that it is a legally permissible tool. But such a move, if standardized by the White House, could in effect bypass Congress on key spending choices and potentially wrest some control over spending from the House and the Senate.

The 1974 Impoundment Control Act gives the president the authority to propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Congress can vote on pulling back the funds or sustaining them, but by proposing the rescission so close to 30 September the White House ensures that the money will not be spent and the funding lapses.

Trump had previously sought to get congressional backing for rescissions and succeeded in doing so in July when the House and the Senate approved $9bn worth of cuts. Those rescissions clawed back funding for public broadcasting and foreign aid.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs.

In February, the administration said it would eliminate almost all of USAID’s foreign aid contracts and $60bn in overall assistance abroad. USAID has since been dismantled, and its few remaining programs have been placed under state department control.

The Trump administration on Wednesday appealed to the supreme court to stop lower court decisions that have preserved foreign aid, including for global health and HIV and Aids programs, that Trump has tried to freeze.

The New York Post first reported the pocket rescission.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f9bea4a2b3a36eb2b48e2d447fee5b1ea7b7aad/546_0_3334_2668/master/3334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54a822ada5e9bae0a9f93bbfcce3e721",N,,2025-08-29 12:59:59.761912

Federal budget cuts to essential services threaten to worsen long-standing inequities for Latinx Californians, underscoring the urgent need for state leaders to protect communities through stronger investments and fairer tax policies.

Access to affordable health care, child care, housing, and food is necessary for all Californians to thrive. However, congressional members — with the support of all California Republican representatives — and the Trump administration have passed a federal budget that includes deep and harmful cuts to programs that provide health coverage, nutrition assistance, and other essential services. The significant cuts represent one of the largest transfers of wealth in the history of the United States, which helps fund huge tax giveaways for the wealthy and provide an unprecedented increase in funding for immigration enforcement.

These cuts are harmful for millions of Californians with low incomes who are already struggling to secure basic needs. Still, these proposals are especially devastating for Latinx Californians, who are the largest racial and ethnic group in the state, yet continuously face significant disparities in areas such as health care access, earnings, rent burden, and access to child care due to historic ongoing racism and discrimination.

Latinx Californians Are Essential to California

It would not be an exaggeration to say that there is no California without Latinx Californians, who make up the largest share — 40% — of racial and ethnic groups in California and also comprise more than half of young Californians. As the population of Latinx Californians increases, so does their visibility and representation across all aspects of everyday life. Though they work across all industries, Latinx Californians are disproportionately concentrated in industries that are notorious for low wages, limited workplace protections, lack of employer-provided benefits such as health insurance, and safety risks, including construction, agriculture, retail trade, and other services (e.g., janitorial services). Latinx workers in these industries experience low pay and significant power imbalances that contribute to a high need for programs to support basic needs — many that have been significantly cut.

Key Terms

What Are the Major Cuts That Will Impact Latinx Californians?

Latinx Californians have propelled California into being the fourth-largest economy in the world, yet many struggle to afford basic needs. The recently passed federal budget includes trillions in cuts to vital programs that support the health and well-being of millions of Latinx Californians. Programs like health care and food assistance help close decades of inequities that Latinx Californians have faced, but they are now facing severe funding cuts. At the same time, increased immigration enforcement actions that often target Latinx communities instill fear and threaten their safety and livelihoods.

Cuts to Medi-Cal and Other Health Care Programs Will Worsen Existing Disparities for Latinx Californians

Over 1 in 3 Latinx Californians (33.9%) are covered by Medi-Cal — California’s Medicaid program — and this number is even higher for Latinas (42.1%). That means millions of Latinx people in the state rely on Medi-Cal for their health care. However, the federal budget act includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade, which will result in California losing between $112 and $187 billion in health care funding.

At the state level, policymakers made significant cuts to Medi-Cal that reversed decades of progress toward affordable and accessible health care for all Californians. This includes freezing Medi-Cal enrollment for undocumented Californians, who are majority Latinx, re-instituting an asset limit test that will lead to substantial coverage losses, and implementing a monthly premium for undocumented Californians and certain other groups of immigrants with low incomes who qualify for Medi-Cal. This unprecedented Medi-Cal premium is a cost that will not apply to any other Medi-Cal members, meaning certain immigrants will have to pay to access health care that is free for other Medi-Cal recipients.

Federal actions may result in 1 million Latinx Californians losing their health insurance. These cuts, along with new burdensome red tape, will harm the health and well-being of millions of Californians, forcing them to make impossible choices between their health care and economic security.

Harmful provisions in the state budget targeting immigrants will only increase health inequities. Health care coverage is already an area where Latinx Californians face large disparities. Approximately 14% of Latinas and 19% of Latinos do not have health insurance, which are both the highest rates in the state for their respective gender.

Latinx Californians’ Ability to Afford Food and Other Necessities is Under Threat

Access to affordable food is critical for living healthy lives. Over 1 in 4, or 27% of, Latinx Californians receive food assistance through CalFresh, and almost 1 in 3, or 30%, of Latinas receive this assistance. Additionally, over half — or 55% — of Latinas participate in WIC, which helps ensure young children are healthy. Recent federal budget cuts slashed billions of dollars in funding for SNAP, resulting in CalFresh losing between $1.7 billion and $3.7 billion annually in federal funding, and will impose burdensome requirements on recipients of food assistance. Funding for WIC will be decided during the federal appropriations process and it is not yet certain whether the program will be funded at current levels.

New time limit expansions, cost-shifts to the state, cuts in benefit levels, and restrictions on some immigrants’ eligibility for CalFresh will all directly harm the ability of many Latinx Californians to feed themselves and their families. At least 2 in 5 Latinas and Latinos (42% and 41% respectively) are currently not able to afford enough food, and that is with CalFresh food assistance programs at their previous funding levels. With the state set to lose out on billions of dollars in funding for food assistance programs, Latinx Californians will face even steeper disparities in their ability to afford food for themselves and their families.

Only 72% of Latinas receive adequate prenatal care, so the federal appropriations process will be critical in ensuring WIC’s funding is preserved. Maintaining funding levels for WIC is crucial in helping to combat the disparities Latinas face in accessing adequate prenatal care.

Access to Affordable Child Care is Critical For Latinx Families

Child care is critical for both parents and children in California so that children can grow and learn and parents can stay employed or continue their education to support themselves and their families. However, the high cost of this care threatens to push families, especially those headed by Latinas, deeper into poverty. A Latina single mom in California with an infant and school-age childspends over 70% of her income on child care without access to a state-subsidized program or Head Start — more than any other racial or ethnic group. A recent notice from the Department of Health and Human Services restricts certain immigrants’ eligibility to access Head Start.

Restricting access to Head Start will take away an effective and affordable child care program for many Latinx Californians. Latinx children are disproportionately eligible for subsidized child care; therefore, when the supply of affordable child care is reduced (which will happen with restrictions on who is eligible for Head Start), Latinx families are more likely to be burdened. The additional restrictions may also lead to a chilling effect, which can discourage qualified immigrants from enrolling due to distrust in government agencies that may not be able to protect their personal information. This could make it even harder for some Latinx Californians to afford sending their children to child care.

A Key Federal Program To Help Latinx Californians Afford College is Under Threat

All people in California — including Latinx Californians — should be able to afford higher public education and access career pathways so they can achieve economic security. Unfortunately, this is not the reality for the large majority of Latinx Californians.Only 17% of Latinas, and just 14% of Latinos, have at least a Bachelor’s degree, which are the lowest percentages in the state, respectively. Research in 2021 found that despite comprising nearly 55% of students in K-12 education, Latinx students constituted only 43% of public higher education students. In addition, Latinx students graduate on-time at disproportionately lower levels across different institutions, ranging from 18% to 36% in California State Universities (CSU) and 51% to 53% in University of California (UC) institutions, which results in higher expenses due to the longer amount of time that students have to spend in order to graduate.

For Latinx Californians who are able to attend college, Pell Grants play a crucial role in helping them attend college. These grants supported 40% of Latinx Californians, or over 400,000 students, in attending college across the University of California, California State University, and California Community College systems. However, President Trump has proposed significant cuts to higher education funding, which include reducing the maximum federal Pell Grant award, and his administration is actively dismantling the Department of Education.

Threats to higher education and Pell Grants could make it impossible for hundreds of thousands of Latinx Californians to afford going to college. Pell Grants provide an average financial aid award of about $4,500 per year, which means that with in-state tuition at a California State University institution currently at $6,084 per year, Pell Grants cover almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition. These grants are awarded mainly to families with an annual income of less than $20,000, meaning they provide significant aid in helping students attend college. With higher education already being unaffordable for the vast majority of Latinx Californians, decreases in the financial aid that is available threatens the ability of Latinx Californians to access higher education.

Latinas Face Severe Housing Cost Burdens

Everyone needs an affordable and stable place to call home. While housing hardship is felt by renters across all races and ethnicities in California,Black and Latinx renters are especially likely to struggle to afford to pay rent. More than half (54%) of Latinas are rent burdened, and 27% are severely rent burdened. Federal housing programs support 920,437 people across the state, but are still unable to meet the growing demand from Californians at risk of losing their homes.

Additional federal threats to affordable housing and homelessness programs loom as the appropriations process gets underway. Proposed decreases to Housing and Urban Development funding could mean cuts to already underfunded programs for rental assistance, affordable housing, and community development.

Any cuts to federal housing programs would further jeopardize the stability of housing for Latinas, who already face severe housing insecurity. Racial inequities in housing compound with other racial inequities Latinx Californians face in the state, which have resulted in rent comprising over 50% of the median annual earnings of Latinas in the state. Inequities Latinx renters face in the state harm their ability to maintain health, work, and dignified living conditions.

Latinx Californians Face Threats To Their Safety With Increased Immigration Enforcement

At the same time that all of these critical programs that help Latinx Californians survive are being cut, Latinx communities are coming under assault from unprecedented increases in immigration detention and enforcement. The federal budget act includes over $170 billion in unrestricted funding for immigration enforcement, with detrimental effects on families, communities, and the state’s entire economy. This reign of terror has already resulted in workforce reductions and has targeted Latinx immigrants and citizens alike.

Restrictive and harsh immigration policies negatively impact how immigrants interact with public services and institutions through a “chilling effect,” result in negative health and financial outcomes, and harm key industries like housing, farming and food production, and caregiving.

Racial profiling tactics are increasingly putting Latinx Californians in the crosshairs as they are targeted with more frequent and intense immigration enforcement operations, violating their human and civil rights.

This unprecedented increase in enforcement also negatively impacts US-born workers: immigrants generate jobs for US-born workers directly as entrepreneurs and indirectly, as research has shown that for every 13 foreign-born workers who leave the labor force because of direct removals and the chilling effect of deportations, 10 US-born workers lose their jobs.

California’s state leaders cannot stand by as the pain of these harmful federal policy choices radiates out across the state. State policymakers should commit to doing all they can to protect vulnerable Californians and ensure access to basic supports like health care and food assistance. This includes adopting common-sense reforms to the tax code, particularly corporate taxes, to raise the revenue needed to protect all Californians and vulnerable communities from deepening hardship.

Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israeli forces in Gaza recovered the body of Ilan Weiss, a 55-year-old Israeli abducted by Hamas in October 2023. Forty-nine hostages remain in Gaza, at least 27 of whom are deceased, according to Israel. On Thursday, Israel’s far-right Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich called for the annexation of the Gaza Strip if Hamas refuses to disarm. Hamas condemned his threat as an “official call to exterminate” Palestinians.

Israeli forces have arrested at least nine Palestinians in raids across the occupied West Bank. Among those detained is a school principal and the head of a village council. Separately, two Palestinians were shot and wounded by Israeli troops during a raid on Nablus, and a Palestinian man was shot in the feet by Israeli settlers east of Nablus. The continuing West Bank violence came as Israeli and Palestinian protesters gathered in Beit Jala for a weekly vigil, demanding an end to Israel’s assault on Gaza.

Combatants for Peace protester: “We’re here, Israelis and Palestinians from Combatants for Peace, in a joint vigil mourning the children of Gaza, thousands of children that have been killed.

Two Lebanese soldiers were killed and two others were injured Thursday when an Israeli drone exploded in south Lebanon. This comes as Israel attacks Lebanon almost on a daily basis despite reaching a ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah in November. Meanwhile, the U.N.

This comes as the U.S. has been pushing for Hezbollah to disarm. Lebanon will reportedly present a plan this Sunday to encourage Hezbollah to surrender its weapons, after which Israel is expected to offer its counterproposal to withdraw from Lebanon.

In Minneapolis, family members have identified the two students killed Wednesday when a shooter fired over 100 rounds through the window of a church at the Annunciation Catholic School, as children and other worshipers gathered for the first Mass of the new school year. Eight-year-old Fletcher Merkel loved his family, friends and “any sport he was allowed to play.” And 10-year-old Harper Moyski was described as a “bright, joyful, and deeply loved 10-year-old” who adored her big sister. Fifteen other children and three adults were wounded in the attack.

On Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was looking into psychiatric medications as a cause of mass shootings. He repeated the unsubstantiated claim in a Fox News interview.

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: “We’re launching studies on the potential contribution of some of the SSRI drugs and some of the other psychiatric drugs that might be contributing to violence.”

Kennedy’s comments drew backlash from Democratic lawmakers. Minnesota Senator Tina Smith wrote on social media, “I dare you to go to Annunciation School and tell our grieving community, in effect, guns don’t kill kids, antidepressants do. Just shut up. Stop peddling bullshit. You should be fired.” On Thursday, elected officials gathered at Minneapolis City Hall to demand immediate action on gun control. This is Congressmember Ilhan Omar.

Rep. Ilhan Omar: “This is something that is simple, a simple ban to make sure people who should not have access to these weapons do not get them and then cause harm and trauma for generations to come in our communities. It is a simple ask.”

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Thursday his top deputy, Jim O’Neill, will serve as the acting head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after the White House abruptly fired CDC Director Susan Monarez less than a month after she was confirmed by the Senate. Monarez is challenging her dismissal. O’Neill is a biotech investor who has worked for the far-right billionaire Peter Thiel and has previously served as a speechwriter in the George W. Bush administration. He has no formal training in medicine. The New York Times is reporting that the Trump administration fired Monarez after she declined to fire agency leaders or to accept all recommendations from a vaccine advisory panel stacked by RFK Jr. with anti-vaccine activists. Meanwhile, staff at CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta staged a mass walkout Thursday to support senior officials who stepped down in protest of RFK Jr.'s actions.

President Trump’s so-called border czar Tom Homan warned Thursday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement will “ramp up” immigration raids in Los Angeles and other sanctuary cities. Homan’s threat came as the White House said it was seeking to use Naval Station Great Lakes, a U.S. military base on the outskirts of Chicago, as a staging ground for the Department of Homeland Security to carry out immigration raids.

Meanwhile, the government of Rwanda said Thursday it had accepted seven immigrants from the United States as part of a third-party deportation deal. The Trump administration is also seeking to deport people to South Sudan and Eswatini even though they have no connection to those countries.

In Florida, officials are reportedly emptying an immigration detention camp in an Everglades swamp dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” by Republicans, after a federal judge ordered much of the facility to be closed over environmental violations.

The U.S. Air Force is offering full military honors to Ashli Babbitt, the January 6 rioter who was shot by officers as she stormed the U.S. Capitol four years ago to protest President Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election. This comes as a federal judge offered a refund to another January 6 rioter, Yvonne St Cyr, who was ordered to pay $2,200 in restitution and fines. She had her felony conviction dropped by Trump in a blanket pardon of January 6 rioters.

Republican lawmakers in Texas have advanced a bill to expand abortion restrictions. On Thursday evening, the Texas House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of House Bill 7, which allows private citizens to sue anyone who manufactures, distributes, mails or provides abortion medication to or from Texas. Plaintiffs winning their lawsuits would receive a cash bounty of at least $100,000. The bill now heads to Texas’s Republican-controlled Senate. In a statement, the ACLU of Texas said the legislation would “fuel fear among manufacturers and providers nationwide, while encouraging neighbors to police one another’s reproductive lives, further isolating pregnant Texans, and punishing the people who care for them.”

The Reverend Al Sharpton led hundreds of demonstrators for the “March on Wall Street” Thursday to protest President Trump’s assault on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and his attempts to control Democratic-led cities led by Black mayors.

And when they find out things have gone wrong, there must be action plans – including compensation for affected migrant workers.","The tariff wars between the US and its trade partners have rarely been out of the news since the US president, Donald Trump, revealed his plans for sweeping “liberation day” levies back in April. The uncertainty that followed for businesses worldwide has now morphed into a battle over global supply chains, as the US and China seek dominance over resources and manufacturing.

At the same time, the subject of migration has been high on many countries’ news agendas. In the US especially, there has been growing anger over federal immigration raids and controversial deportations to “third countries”.

Yet it appears that many policymakers and economists aren’t joining the dots. Tariffs are reshaping migration patterns and, as a result, raising the risk of human rights abuses to workers across global supply chains. This is captured by risk-management platform EiQ, which gathers supply chain intelligence to help businesses reach their environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals.

Its data is drawn from 30,000 onsite audits annually across more than 100 geographies (countries and provinces). When taken alongside our research on migrant labour, it raises serious welfare concerns.

The US is playing a key role in the shift of global supply chains through “Made in America”, one of its initiatives to bolster the US manufacturing sector. While some American companies are responding by reshoring certain functions to the US, most are taking a different approach. Rather than bringing production to US soil, they are reconfiguring their supply chains in a bid to avoid the highest tariffs or to open up new markets.

One strategy is “China +1” – in which companies maintain some manufacturing presence in China but expand this to alternative locations such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico.

As a result, new global supply chain corridors are forming rapidly. While south-east Asia continues to rise as a manufacturing hub, Latin America is experiencing a surge in global supply chain investments as companies look to minimise their tariffs. For example, Mexico’s proximity to the US, low labour costs and lower tariffs than those imposed on goods made in China will appeal to many businesses.

Not only American but also Chinese firms are accelerating their foreign direct investment (FDI) across the region – most notably in Mexico. Yet these shifts in supply chains are not without consequences.

The surge in investment in Mexico is fuelling demand for labour, but Mexico’s domestic workforce is not unlimited. As a result, the tariff wars are accelerating Mexico’s demographic transition from a country of emigration to one where immigration is on the rise.

This is part of a broader phenomenon known as “replacement migration”, in which labour migration follows a cascade pattern. Workers from middle-income countries migrate to high-income economies, while companies in these middle-income countries fill labour shortages by recruiting migrants from poorer nations. This means much of today’s migration flows from lower to middle-income economies – “one level up” on the development ladder.

The human cost

One of the consequences of this growing global mobility of labour is the rise of “human supply chains”: the systems and practices that multinationals use to manage migrant workers within global supply chains. The implications are profound.

Labour migration relies on complex transnational recruitment networks. In most migrant-receiving countries, visa programmes require companies to hire workers while they are still in their country of origin (Nepali workers recruited to Malaysian factories, for example). Yet few multinationals manage recruitment in-house. Instead, up to 80% of legal, international lower-skilled hires are arranged by labour agencies.

This growing reliance on agencies is increasing workers’ exposure to risk. Migrant recruitment agencies often operate by charging workers for job placements – essentially selling jobs to those seeking employment abroad. Beyond the high upfront fees, many intermediaries have been linked to corruption, including passport confiscation and replacing promised contracts with poorer terms and lower wages upon arrival.

EiQ has uncovered more than 850 major or critical violations, including unlawful salary deductions and recruitment fees that were not reimbursed. According to its CEO, Kevin Franklin: “There are no longer any ‘safe’ or ‘easy’, cost-effective options for supply chain sourcing. We have entered an era of intense and nuanced trade-offs.”

Moving operations from China to India, for instance, increases exposure to the risk of forced and child labour. Likewise, shifting production to Bangladesh raises serious health and safety concerns. And migrant workers in Mexico face heightened risks relating to labour rights, workplace safety and wages – all of which have worsened over the past year.

Even the US has moved from a medium to a high-risk category for all workers, according to EiQ. The Trump government’s Made in America push has driven up demand for labour, but the US workforce is both insufficient and costly, and mass deportations of migrants are only worsening the shortages.

Tighter immigration policies contribute to an atmosphere of fear, discouraging migrant workers from reporting abuse or seeking legal support. And with fewer workers available, those who stay face greater vulnerability. EiQ audits have uncovered forced overtime, serious injuries, hospitalisations and even amputations after people have been injured at work.

Around the world in 2025, more than 45% of geographies slipped down the humane treatment index which EiQ compiles.

As global trade evolves rapidly, businesses must rely on evidence-based insights to navigate this complex landscape. They should map risk, use AI to help them assess trade-offs when they move into new regions, and engage with and train their suppliers. And when they find out things have gone wrong, there must be action plans – including compensation for affected migrant workers.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/687754/original/file-20250827-56-lvr0wu.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C356%2C4240%2C2120&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-29 13:00:59.391251

The Trump administration on Wednesday appealed to the Supreme Court to stop lower court decisions that have preserved foreign aid, including for global health and HIV and AIDS programs, that Trump has tried to freeze.","President Trump has told House Speaker Mike Johnson that he won’t be spending $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

Trump, who sent a letter to Johnson, R-La., on Thursday, is using what’s known as a pocket rescission — when a president submits a request to Congress to not spend approved funds toward the end of the fiscal year, so that Congress cannot act on the request in the 45-day timeframe and the money goes unspent as a result. It’s the first time in nearly 50 years a president has used one. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.

The letter was posted Friday morning on the X account of the White House Office of Management and Budget. It said the funding would be cut from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, an early target of Trump’s efforts to cut foreign aid.

The last pocket rescission was in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter, and the Trump administration argues that it’s a legally permissible tool. But such a move, if standardized by the White House, could effectively bypass Congress on key spending choices and potentially wrest some control over spending from the House and the Senate.

The 1974 Impoundment Control Act gives the president the authority to propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Congress can vote on pulling back the funds or sustaining them, but by proposing the rescission so close to Sept. 30 the White House ensures that the money won’t be spent and the funding lapses.

Trump had previously sought to get congressional backing for rescissions and succeeded in doing so in July when the House and the Senate approved $9 billion worth of cuts. Those rescissions clawed back funding for public broadcasting and foreign aid.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as foreign populations lose access to food supplies and development programs.

In February, the administration said it would eliminate almost all of USAID’s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall assistance abroad. USAID has since been dismantled, and its few remaining programs have been placed under State Department control.

The Trump administration on Wednesday appealed to the Supreme Court to stop lower court decisions that have preserved foreign aid, including for global health and HIV and AIDS programs, that Trump has tried to freeze.

Denver-based immigration lawyer Hans Meyer sees Durango as one community of many nationally that has found itself responding to a “fight it didn’t ask for” in relation to immigration rights and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity.

“We’re seeing this sort of whole scale, just bulldozing (of) people’s rights, whether it’s in the car, or in the home, or in the workplace,” he said during the immigration rights training he led at the Durango Public Library on Tuesday evening. “We’re not dealing with law enforcement – we’re dealing with the JV squad that’s trying to cheat, and lie, and cajole their way into every nook and cranny of our lives.”

Dozens of community members, local business owners and employees, along with members of local and statewide immigrant rights groups, gathered for the event.

Meyer covered key constitutional rights in relation to ICE activity, such as the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and 14th amendments; employer and employee best practices when responding to ICE activity in businesses; key components of private versus public spaces; and the legal borders of administrative versus judicial warrants.

The event occurred during an especially contentious time for the Four Corners surrounding ICE activity and discussions of immigrant rights.

Earlier this month, immigration officers smashed the front windows of a man’s car during an arrest in a Safeway parking lot in Aztec.

In June, two people were reportedly detained near Bayfield by ICE during a traffic stop, according to Compañeros: Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.

Further reports of stakeouts outside mobile home parks and a Durango workplace raid have only added to a sense of anger, distrust and fear toward ICE agents throughout the immigrant community.

The well-occupied room included people of all ages and backgrounds. Much of the talk and training shifted into open conversations between attendees and Meyer about their fears, uncertainties and worries surrounding recent ICE activity, both nationwide and throughout the Four Corners.

“How do we protect our kids and neighbors, and help keep them in schools?” one attendee asked Meyer.

“How do we get our local law enforcement, City Council and those in positions of power in on the cause?” wondered another.

“How do we leverage our own privilege?” inquired a third.

“And how do we protect ourselves?” a fourth wanted to know.

Meyer provided responses to the questions he could, and turned the microphone over to the immigrant rights advocates who helped organize the event in response to those he did not have answers for.

Event organizers sourced Meyers for the training. He told The Durango Herald he was happy to respond to a community he feels has led the way in Colorado in standing up for civil and constitutional rights.

“There’s fantastic organizing going on in this community – this community is super engaged,” he said. “People care about their neighbors and their friends, and they’re willing to turn that into action, and pass the policies that will protect people, including immigrants.”

Beatriz Garcia, Western Slope organizer for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, also spoke to the crowd, asking the community for support in responding to what the group feels are violations of civil and human rights by ICE.

“The idea here is that we plant some seeds,” she told the room. “Whether you do your part (by) volunteering, donating, talking to people, voting for people who actually represent and support immigrant rights, to actually speak(ing) and testify(ing) in public spaces where politicians are (listening) – all the actions that you do will matter. Like right now, it’s the fact that you’re here.”

Garcia encouraged the crowd to reach out to local representatives and city leaders with their concerns and frustrations, describing herself as “one little piece of sand,” and support from the community being what could create “a beach” of action.

“We’re talking about everyone’s constitutional rights, everyone’s civil rights,” she said. “We’re talking about racial justice, about equity in our community, and all that has been targeted in this town. We’re not going to wait until (the) federal government (does) something for us.”

Pushback against recent ICE activity in the region is not only coming from the immigrant community.

“I’m here because I care about using my privilege,” said community member Grace Morledge of why she attended the training on Tuesday.

For Meyer, a decision must be made by the community in response to the “assault thrust upon it by the federal government.”

“ICE is terrorizing people in this local community, (and) Durango and people who live here have to answer the question, ‘What do we do?’” Meyer told the Herald. “’Do we do nothing, or do we stand up and fight to defend the people of this community against what we know to be large scale unconstitutional immigration enforcement operations that violate people’s constitutional rights?’”

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago, said Wednesday.

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Although details of the administration’s plans for Chicago are scarce, city leaders said Thursday that they are preparing for multiple possible scenarios, from troops assisting in immigration arrests to patrolling in the streets.

“We don’t want to raise any fears,” Police Superintendent Larry Snelling told reporters. “We don’t want to create any speculation around what’s going on.”

Chicago leaders want more communication

City leaders said Thursday that the White House hadn’t contacted them about its plans, and a spokesman for the Illinois National Guard said the base hadn’t received requests regarding a Chicago mobilization.

Mogle, the base spokesman, said no decisions had been made on the request, and that the base hadn’t received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

DHS did not confirm whether it had asked to use the base. But it said in a statement Thursday that it was working to make “our streets and cities safe again.”

Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have pushed back against a possible mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn’t want or need the military’s help. They are planning to sue.

City leaders said workers were circulating know-your-rights cards in neighborhoods with heavy immigrant populations, which offer tips on what to do in case of an encounter with an immigration agent. Other workers were checking in on Chicago’s homeless encampments and providing information about shelters since Trump has pushed to move homeless people far from Washington.

Snelling asked for more communication on plans involving law enforcement.

“To make sure that we’re not stoking fears through neighborhoods and we don’t have people running scared and it doesn’t create chaos on our streets, we’re willing to have those conversations,” Snelling said.

Many Chicagoans are on edge about the rumored deployment. Former President Barack Obama, who is from Chicago, weighed in Thursday, posting on X: “The erosion of basic principles like due process and the expanding use of our military on domestic soil puts the liberties of all Americans at risk, and should concern Democrats and Republicans alike.”

Former President Joe Biden’s transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, a former U.S. Naval Reserve intelligence officer who trained at Great Lakes, said in a post on X that he never imagined the station could be used “for surveillance and enforcement activity on American soil. Our military was not set up to cater to the whims of a would-be American dictator.”

The politics of a deployment

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen and said there is no emergency in Chicago requiring military intervention. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

Speaking to reporters Thursday, he suggested that it’s a political ploy, not a law enforcement strategy, that Trump will pull out during next year’s elections.

“This is a part of his plan to do something really nefarious, which is to interfere with elections in 2026,” Pritzker said. “He wants to have troops on the ground to stop people from voting, to intimidate people from going to the voting booth.”

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago’s long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump’s second inauguration.

Pritzker and Trump, who has zeroed-in on Democrat-led cities, have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network.

In recent days, the administration has been pointing out recent shootings in the city, including at Thursday’s White House press briefing when press secretary Karoline Leavitt listed crime statistics.

“This is JB Pritzker’s legacy, by the way,” she said.

Crime in Chicago

Violent crime has dropped significantly in Chicago in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem in parts of the city.

Chicago had a homicide rate of 21.7 per 100,000 residents in 2024, according to analysis of federal data by the Rochester Institute of Technology. Seven other major U.S. cities — St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Indianapolis and Richmond, Virginia — had higher rates than Chicago.

Still, Chicago reported 573 homicides in 2024, the most of any U.S. city that year. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of this year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by more than 22% compared with the first half of 2024.

In Illinois there are roughly 10,000 members of the Illinois Army National Guard and 3,000 Air National Guard. They routinely mobilize at armories around the state, including nearly a dozen in Chicago and its suburbs. But they are state-owed property and if the federal government mobilizes the Guard without the governor’s blessing, the armories aren’t available for use.

In doing so, the Justice Department told the court it should be “highly deferential” to the president and his interpretation of what qualifies as sufficient cause to remove a government official. The lawyers attacked Ms. Cook for what they described as a noteworthy refusal to address nature of the allegations against her. The term “for cause” is broadly meant to refer to gross malfeasance or a dereliction of duty, but it is a vague term that is subject to interpretation.

Mr. Trump's lawyers said the president’s rationale provided “more than sufficient ground for removing a senior financial regulator from office.”

The response from Mr. Trump’s lawyers came after Ms. Cook filed a lawsuit on Thursday against the president over his attempt to remove her from her position as a member of the Fed’s powerful Board of Governors. As a governor, Ms. Cook casts a vote at every meeting on interest rates as well as other major policy decisions. She also sued the board and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, to prevent them from executing on Mr. Trump’s order to remove her.

Her lawyers argued that Mr. Trump’s actions were “unprecedented and illegal” and were part of a broader campaign to pressure the Fed to lower interest rates. They also acknowledged the stakes of the case, warning that if the president were allowed to proceed with her removal, the independence of the institution would be jeopardized.

Ahead of Friday’s hearing, the Fed weighed in as well, saying that it would not offer arguments to support Ms. Cook’s lawsuit. Instead, the central bank said in a filing it sought a “prompt ruling” in the case and would follow the court’s orders.

But in a statement earlier this week, a spokesperson at the central bank spoke positively about the protections laid out in the Federal Reserve Act that seek to insulate the institution from political interference.

“Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis and the long-term interests of the American people,” the person said.

Ms. Cook finds herself in that position because of President Trump’s decision on Monday to seek her ouster, and her own decision on Thursday to file a lawsuit challenging her attempted dismissal. Those two actions set the stage for a landmark legal battle, one that is bound for the Supreme Court, over the president’s explicit attempts to take control of the central bank.

“Governor Cook has been thrust into a role she did not seek and doubtless would prefer to shed — suddenly being cast in a larger-than-life struggle to defend an institution that has helped foster the economic and financial success of the U.S. over the post-World War II period,” said David Wilcox, who is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and a former leader of the Fed’s research and statistics division.

On Friday, a federal judge in Washington will hold the first hearing in the case, which will focus on Ms. Cook’s request for a temporary restraining order. If the court grants the order, it will allow her to continue serving on the Fed’s board while she contests her firing.

Ms. Cook was not expected to be in this position. Mr. Trump has made no secret of his desire for lower interest rates, or of his anger at central bank officials for refusing to deliver them. But for months Mr. Trump had focused his ire on Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, repeatedly threatening to fire him and, at one point, even waving around a letter that purported to do so.

Then, last week, Mr. Trump turned his attention to Ms. Cook after an administration official accused her of mortgage fraud tied to her purchase of two homes in 2021, before she joined the Fed. She has not been charged with any crime.

Ms. Cook, who said from the start that she would not be bullied into resigning, must now defend not only herself but also the Fed as a whole. She must do so without the formal institutional backing of the central bank, which for legal reasons cannot defend her directly. Instead, she will be represented at Friday’s hearing by her own private attorney.

In fact, Ms. Cook’s lawsuit names as a defendant not just Mr. Trump but also Mr. Powell and the Fed’s board of governors. The decision to include her associates at the central bank reflected a need to prevent anybody from executing what the president had demanded before the courts ruled on the case. Still, at least on paper, Ms. Cook is suing two of the world’s most powerful men and one of its most important institutions.

“I can’t imagine how hard this must be, the weight of Fed independence hanging on her decisions,” said Heather Boushey, who was an economic adviser to President Joseph R. Biden Jr. when he nominated Ms. Cook to her post.

If Ms. Cook proves victorious, the president’s capacity to strong-arm officials into leaving the Fed will be seriously curtailed and the central bank’s independence bolstered.

If she loses, it could open the door for Mr. Trump and future presidents to install loyalists at the Fed. That could undermine the central bank’s longstanding and highly prized independence, which has become foundational to the health of the world’s largest economy as well as the smooth functioning of the global financial system.

In the short term, Ms. Cook’s departure would give Mr. Trump his second opportunity in a matter of weeks to appoint someone to the board who is willing to follow his direction. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said he would nominate a top economic adviser, Stephen Miran, to a governor seat that was unexpectedly available after Adriana Kugler stepped down five months before her term ended.

Mr. Trump’s nominees to the seven-member board would then enjoy a majority, giving them sway over big decisions related to interest rates, the rules and regulations governing Wall Street and internal matters like staffing.

“The stakes could not be higher, for the Federal Reserve and for our system of separation of powers, and also for the American economy,” said Amit Agarwal, an attorney at Protect Democracy, an organization that has sued Mr. Trump over his efforts to oust officials at other independent agencies. “If this termination is allowed to stand, the Federal Reserve will no longer have any insulation from presidential control, and that means the death of the Federal Reserve as an independent agency.”

A Groundbreaking Appointment

Ms. Cook is perhaps an unlikely figure to carry such a weight.

She grew up in Georgia during desegregation — she and her sisters were among the first Black students to attend their schools — and studied philosophy as an undergraduate at Spelman College in Atlanta. She has said she turned to economics after hiking Mount Kilimanjaro alongside a British economist.

Ms. Cook stood out as one of relatively few Black women in economics, something that remains true nearly 30 years after she earned her doctorate in the field.

“Economics is neither a welcoming nor a supportive profession for women,” she and a colleague wrote in a New York Times opinion essay in 2019. She added, “But if economics is hostile to women, it is especially antagonistic to Black women.”

Mr. Biden nominated Ms. Cook to the Fed board in 2022. She was narrowly confirmed after Vice President Kamala Harris broke a 50-50 tie in the Senate. She was the first and so far only Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.

“One of the biggest mistakes anyone could make is to underestimate her moral resolve and commitment to causes in which believes,” said Mr. Wilcox, who is also the director of U.S. economic research at Bloomberg Economics. “Though she did not ask for this role, she is superbly equipped to step into it.”

What Role Does the Fed Play?

Until a court rules otherwise, Ms. Cook is still an active governor at the Fed. The central bank stipulated as much in a rare statement related to the president’s recent actions against the institution and its members.

The statement highlighted the protections laid out in the Federal Reserve Act, which designates that governors have 14-year terms and can be removed by presidents only for “cause,” which has tended to mean malfeasance while in office or a dereliction of duty.

“Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis and the long-term interests of the American people,” a spokesperson said, while stressing that the Fed would comply with any court decisions.

The Fed is limited in its ability to publicly aid Ms. Cook’s case, given that the allegations involve a personal matter as opposed to one directly related to her job as a governor.

Ms. Cook is being represented by Abbe Lowell, a longtime Washington litigator who has become the go-to lawyer for officials targeted by the Trump administration. One of his newest clients is Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whom the Trump administration has sought to fire after she refused to resign.

In Thursday’s lawsuit, Mr. Lowell and his team described the Trump administration’s actions as “unprecedented and illegal” and characterized Ms. Cook’s attempted removal as part of an overtly political campaign to pressure the Fed to reduce borrowing costs.

Legal experts say that because the Fed is listed as a defendant in Ms. Cook’s lawsuit, it is limited in its ability to file a friend-of-the-court brief backing her position even if a ruling in her favor would hugely benefit the institution.

An Uncomfortable Spot

The position that Ms. Cook finds herself in is one that the Fed had long hoped to avoid. Mr. Powell, who has borne the brunt of the president’s attacks, has insisted that any attempt to fire him would be illegal.

Another top Fed official, Michael Barr, stepped down as vice chair for supervision in January in order to avoid the chance that he would be fired by Mr. Trump and any risks posed to the institution if he fought back.

Mr. Barr, who stayed on as a governor, said at the time that he and his lawyers believed that he would prevail in court if Mr. Trump tried to remove him. But he ultimately opted to avoid the very legal battle that Ms. Cook now finds herself in.

Ms. Boushey, the former Biden adviser, said she was not surprised that Ms. Cook chose to fight, given her pathbreaking history and her importance particularly to young Black women considering careers in economics.

“She’s done enough research to know that her actions matter,” she said. “How she behaves in this moment will matter for the Howard girls down the street that are majoring in economics, that see her as a role model. She has to stand up for what she thinks is right.”

That legislation also created a commission to come up with new base names. In 2022, the commission ordered West Point to take down all displays that “commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy.” A few weeks later, the portrait of General Lee with his slave in the background was placed in storage.

It was not clear how West Point could return General Lee’s portrait to the library without violating the law, which emerged from the protests that followed George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers in 2020.

“At West Point, the United States Military Academy is prepared to restore historical names, artifacts, and assets to their original form and place,” said Rebecca Hodson, the Army’s communications director. “Under this administration, we honor our history and learn from it — we don’t erase it.”

Both President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have been outspoken in their desire to restore Confederate names and monuments that were removed over the last five years. Mr. Hegseth recently called for returning a memorial to the Confederacy that was removed from Arlington National Cemetery at the recommendation of Congress. In a social media post this month, Mr. Hegseth said the Arlington statue “never should have been taken down by woke lemmings.”

Earlier this summer, Mr. Trump and Mr. Hegseth restored the names of Confederate generals to the Army’s bases, but with a twist seemingly designed to avoid running afoul of the 2020 law. Mr. Hegseth and his staff found obscure soldiers who served honorably and shared a last name with the Confederate generals.

Rather than simply reinstate the name of General Lee to an Army base in Virginia, the Pentagon honored Pvt. Fitz Lee, a Black soldier who fought in the Spanish-American War. In the case of Fort Bragg, named for Braxton Bragg, an incompetent Confederate general, Mr. Hegseth celebrated Pvt. Roland L. Bragg, who fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II.

The naming commission’s initial order to remove General Lee’s portrait was complicated by the general’s long history with the Army and the academy. General Lee graduated near the top of his West Point class and served as the academy’s superintendent from 1852 to 1855. His name and likeness were all over the campus.

The commission decided that portraits of General Lee in his blue Army uniform should remain. But the divisive painting of General Lee in his Confederate gray uniform was hauled away. The commission also recommended that West Point’s Lee Barracks, Lee Road, Lee Gate, Lee Housing Area and Lee Area Child Development Center all be renamed.

“We will conduct these actions with dignity and respect,” Lt. Gen. Steven W. Gilland, the academy’s superintendent, promised in 2022.

Originally hung in 1952, the portrait was part of a broader effort to rehabilitate General Lee’s image as a revered figure in the history of the academy. General Maxwell Taylor, a famous World War II general who went on to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke at West Point on the day the portrait was unveiled.

“Few fair-minded men can feel today that the issues which divided North and South in 1861 have any real meaning to our present generation,” he said. At the time the Army had just begun to desegregate, but Black people in the South still lived under the cruel strictures of Jim Crow laws.

In 2017, after violent protests in Charlottesville, Va., by white nationalists who opposed a plan to remove a statue of General Lee from a city park, some West Point alumni urged the academy to re-examine its relationship with the Confederate hero.

“There’s no way to excise Lee from the Academy’s history,” Andrew J. Bacevich, a retired colonel and West Point graduate, wrote in The American Conservative magazine. “That he should occupy a place of honor in the Long Gray Line is something of an obscenity, however.”

In recent years, Mr. Trump has argued that the decision to rename the bases stemmed from a broader effort to erase the country’s traditions and heritage. He also has praised General Lee “as the greatest strategist of them all,” and suggested that “except for Gettysburg” he would have won the Civil War.

“For months, numerous representatives of the same federal government that is responsible for prosecuting this case have publicly disparaged Mr. Abrego’s character and reputation,” the lawyers wrote. The officials, they added, had “distorted the events and evidence underpinning his case to the public; misrepresented his criminal record; disseminated false, irrelevant, and inflammatory claims; and expressed the opinion that he is guilty of the crimes charged.”

Mr. Abrego Garcia is facing charges in Nashville of having taken part in a criminal conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants across the United States beginning in 2016. That case is separate from civil cases he has brought in Maryland challenging his wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March and his more recent possible expulsion to Uganda.

The gag order request on Thursday came after Mr. Trump and several of his aides had attacked Mr. Abrego Garcia in a variety of ways, tarring him as a wife beater, a pedophile, a member of the street gang MS-13 and a terrorist. Federal judges who have seen have the evidence against him in his criminal case have questioned the allegations of his gang ties as “fanciful” and have formally ruled that he is not a danger to the public.

By asking to limit the public assaults against their client, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers were effectively asking Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr., who is overseeing the case, to keep the matter focused on the facts and law.

That has not been how the Trump administration has handled the criminal case, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers said. In their motion for a gag order, they argued that almost from the moment their client sued the Trump administration in March for deporting him to El Salvador in violation of a court order, Trump officials “have vilified him in the media.”

That vilification, the lawyers said, has continued.

Just last week, for instance, when Mr. Abrego Garcia was freed from custody on the criminal charges he was facing in Tennessee, Ms. Noem, the homeland security secretary, issued a statement referring to him as an “MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser and child predator.”

That same day, the lawyers said, as Mr. Abrego Garcia was arrested again by federal immigration officials, a White House spokeswoman issued a similar statement, calling him “a criminal illegal alien, wife-beater and an MS13 gang member facing serious charges of human smuggling.”

Mr. Trump himself has joined in the attacks, falsely claiming this spring that Mr. Abrego Garcia had tattoos on his hand proving he was a member of MS-13.

This week, Mr. Trump declared that Mr. Abrego Garcia was an “animal” who had “beat the hell out of his wife,” a comment Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers noted in their motion. While it is true that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife had sought orders of protection against him years ago, she never pressed charges and has since supported him vocally in his efforts to fight his criminal case and the efforts to re-deport him.

The “pièce de résistance,” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers added in the gag order request, was a cartoon of their client posted on the White House’s official X account, with “MS-13” written beneath it.

“The government’s ongoing barrage of prejudicial statements severely threaten — and perhaps have already irrevocably impaired — the ability to try this case at all — in any venue,” the lawyers wrote. “If the government is allowed to continue in this way, it will taint any conceivable jury pool by exposing the entire country to irrelevant, prejudicial, and false claims about Mr. Abrego.”

“The applicable statutory requirements could not be clearer: the director of Voice of America ‘may only be removed if such action has been approved by a majority vote’” of the board, Judge Lamberth wrote. He added: “There is no longer a question of whether the termination was unlawful.”

The ruling is a setback to President Trump and Kari Lake, a fierce Trump ally who has led efforts to close federally funded news networks, including Voice of America, which the White House has accused of left-wing bias and spreading “radical” and “anti-Trump” propaganda.

Mr. Abramowitz said in a statement that it was critical for the government to continue U.S.-supported news broadcasting to countries with authoritarian governments that suppress independent journalism and spread anti-American rhetoric.

He said he was gratified that Judge Lamberth found that Trump officials “must follow the law as Congress mandated,” and added that Voice of America’s programming “is so important for the security and influence of the United States.”

The administration’s lawyers had argued to Judge Lamberth that the law limiting the president’s authority to fire Mr. Abramowitz was an unconstitutional check on executive power. They also claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction, as Congress established the Merit Systems Protection Board for federal employment disputes. (Mr. Trump has also moved to fire members of the M.S.P.B.)

Ms. Lake said the administration planned to appeal the ruling, calling it “absurd.”

“Elections have consequences, and President Trump runs the executive branch,” she said in an email. “I have confidence that the Constitution will eventually be enforced.”

Trump officials had moved to fire Mr. Abramowitz on Aug. 1 after he refused to accept reassignment as a “chief management officer” of a Voice of America radio station in North Carolina that the network had used to provide shortwave radio broadcasts to Latin America and West Africa.

Voice of America had stopped broadcasting to those regions in March after Mr. Trump put nearly all of the organization’s employees on paid leave. In June, the administration had tried — and failed — to lay off nearly all 1,300 of Voice of America’s reporters and support staff.

The network now broadcasts in only four languages — Persian, Mandarin and two main languages in Afghanistan, Dari and Pashto. Before, it aired news programs in 49 languages to 360 million people every week, including in Russia, China and Iran.

V.O.A.’s programming remains drastically curtailed despite an April order from Judge Lamberth that the administration restore the network to “serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news.”

It is unlikely that the administration could quickly get consent from the advisory board to fire Mr. Abramowitz. A few days after his inauguration, President Trump fired six of the seven board members, leaving only Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who automatically serves because he heads the State Department. At least four members, excluding Mr. Rubio, are required for the board to vote. The six members besides Mr. Rubio must be confirmed by the Senate, and none has been replaced.

“The defendants do not even feign that their efforts to remove Abramowitz comply with that statutory requirement,” Judge Lamberth wrote on Thursday. “How could they, when the board has been without a quorum since January?”

Congress established the advisory board in 2020 after President Trump’s appointee to lead Voice of America’s parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, was accused of trying to turn federally funded news agencies into a mouthpiece for the administration by firing the leadership of the newsrooms.

A federal investigation later found that the appointee, Michael Pack, had grossly mismanaged the Agency for Global Media by sidelining executives he felt did not sufficiently support Mr. Trump.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/29/multimedia/29trump-news-header-promo945am/29trump-news-header-930am-vlzj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 11:56:58.206334

So he was able to pursue a political asylum claim under Biden’s restrictions.
“At the beginning of that week, we heard of L.A. immigration court, San Francisco immigration court having ICE in the courtroom,” Mendez said.
She was blown away by how well-prepared he was for an asylum case — he had filed all of the paperwork by himself at that point.
Despite having a relatively strong political asylum case, Luis often thought about giving up.","Luis was a lawyer from South America who ended up homeless in San Diego.

He arrived in August 2024, at the tail end of a historically high migration period. In just a few years, hundreds of thousands of migrants from all over the world had crossed the border in San Diego to pursue asylum claims. There were so many that Border Patrol agents would drop off busloads of people at a San Ysidro transit center every day.

“I remember meeting Luis for the first time getting off one of the buses,” said Ruth Mendez, an immigrant advocate with the Detention Resistance Collective.

Luis is seeking asylum as a political dissident in his home country. KPBS is not disclosing his last name to protect him from retaliation.

By the time Luis got off the bus that day, San Diego County had closed its emergency migrant shelter. The private contractor selected to run the program ran out of money.

He ended up spending 10 days sleeping on the floor at San Diego International Airport before he found temporary housing at a local Catholic church.

Luis is still here today, with a more stable housing situation. His year-long case spans one of the most uncertain times in the history of the U.S. asylum system.

He arrived last summer, two months after the Biden administration bowed to political pressure by placing strict limits on asylum. And his case remains ongoing after the Trump administration began arresting people in immigration court hearings.

“They have peeled back the rights of asylum seekers like an onion,” said Melissa Crow, director of litigation for the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies (CGRS), which has sued both administrations over their restrictive immigration policies.

One of those policies was Biden’s Circumvention of Lawful Pathways, which established that anyone who crossed the border illegally, like Luis did, would be presumed ineligible for asylum.

Previously, everyone in the country had equal access to the asylum system, no matter how they entered.

That meant people like Luis would have to navigate legal loopholes to obtain an exemption and establish eligibility. Or pursue other forms of humanitarian relief that are much more difficult to obtain, Crow said.

Then, CGRS sued over one of President Donald Trump’s first executive orders. Among other things, it terminated humanitarian parole programs, further restricted the asylum system and ordered the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain every migrant who crossed the border illegally.

“The restrictions we’ve been talking about — the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule and the Securing the Border rule — in most cases take asylum off the table,” Crow said.

Fortunately for Luis, he entered the country before Trump’s crackdown. So he was able to pursue a political asylum claim under Biden’s restrictions.

A helping hand

Despite his own precarious housing situation, Luis wanted to use his own experiences in the system to help others. He kept returning to the San Ysidro transit center where CBP agents dropped off confused migrants. He offered to help the volunteers in exchange for a free lunch.

Luis’ presence gave Mendez and other advocates instant credibility among people wary of strangers, she said.

“He could tell people, ‘Hey, I was in your position. These folks can be trusted,’” she said.

Luis spent the end of 2024 preparing for his asylum case.

Back home, he was a vocal critic of the government and feared retribution for his political beliefs. Luis left behind his relatives, his son and his legal career.

The fears that prompted Luis to flee have been with him his entire life.

“My own father was disappeared for his political views,” he said in Spanish. “So I didn’t want that history to repeat itself with me and my son.”

Courthouse arrest

By the time Luis got to see a judge this spring, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were arresting people in immigration courts across the country.

The White House demanded ICE arrest 3,000 people each day nationwide and courts became a convenient place for agents to meet their quotas.

Mendez and other immigrant advocates were worried about this happening in San Diego. So they accompanied migrants to their court hearings. Their fear turned out to be well-founded.

“At the beginning of that week, we heard of L.A. immigration court, San Francisco immigration court having ICE in the courtroom,” Mendez said. “That was very worrying.”

Luis and Mendez didn’t notice any ICE agents in the courtroom when they arrived for his hearing the morning of March 22.

But when he left the courtroom to use the restroom, Luis saw the hallway was full of ICE agents. He quickly shut the door, went back into the courtroom and mentally prepared himself to be arrested.

Mendez remembers him shaking while sitting in the courtroom.

The lawyer in Luis remembers thinking how odd this was. The federal government was acting as if it didn’t want people to show up for court appearances.

“It removes a lot of credibility from the process,” he said. “Why should we do things correctly, the right way, if we are going to be arrested?”

Luis was among the first to be arrested in San Diego’s immigration court. As soon as the arrests began, advocates like Mendez called local immigration lawyers for help. Several lawyers rushed to the courthouse and offered pro-bono legal services to anyone being targeted by ICE. That’s how Tracey Crowley met Luis.

She was blown away by how well-prepared he was for an asylum case — he had filed all of the paperwork by himself at that point. But that was still not enough to keep him out of detention.

“He’s doing everything he’s supposed to do,” Crowley said. “He’s trying to do it the legal way, and he actually has a really strong case for asylum. It’s just a waste of money and a waste of everyone’s time to throw him into detention.”

Life in detention

Because of his personal family history with government-sanctioned disappearance, Luis was particularly traumatized during his stay at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. He said guards would constantly pressure detainees, particularly the ones who had been there longest, to sign “Voluntary Departure” papers to abandon their cases and self-deport.

He developed a skin infection and would often fall asleep to the sound of other detainees crying. He remembers his time at the private detention center as a mindless routine of eating, sleeping and waiting.

“I felt like a robot,” he said.

Despite having a relatively strong political asylum case, Luis often thought about giving up.

“It was very difficult to keep his spirits up, and to keep him motivated because I knew I could get him out on bond,” Crowley said.

After about six weeks, Crowley was able to secure Luis' release on bond. Luis described his release as “winning the lottery.”

Within days of his release, Luis started volunteering again. This time outside of the same immigration court where he was arrested months earlier. Mendez said he’s been an invaluable resource to the volunteers, especially when anxious families of people in immigration court ask for help.

“He just steps in and tells them what to expect,” Mendez said. “That type of information that advocates can relay, but it hits differently when it’s somebody who was directly impacted.”

Luis is still pursuing an asylum claim and is due back in court next month. Mendez, Crowley, and other volunteers plan to accompany him.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/571e6d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F36%2F49%2F2ffd762449058a780baad510c9a4%2Fice-in-hallway.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 11:57:03.198131

Monarez was reportedly fired by Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, for refusing to remove agency officials and committing to restricting proven vaccines.

The White House has said Susan Monarez, who was confirmed as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention just a month ago, was fired as she was “not aligned with the president’s agenda” – only for Monarez to refuse to depart. The official’s lawyers have said that, as a Senate-confirmed appointee, only Donald Trump himself can remove her.

Monarez was reportedly fired by Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, for refusing to remove agency officials and committing to restricting proven vaccines.

Kennedy, who previously founded an anti-vaccine group, has long spread misinformation about immunizations and this week placed new restrictions on who can get Covid vaccines.

This stance, along with concerns about budget cuts and political interference to the work of the CDC, prompted the resignation of four top agency leaders. On Thursday, dozens of CDC staff walked out of their Atlanta headquarters in support of Monarez and the other departed leaders.

The extraordinary turmoil at the CDC has provoked bipartisan alarm in Congress, earning the Trump administration a rare rebuke from normally slavishly loyal Republicans.

“She’s been on the job for only three weeks and I am very concerned and alarmed by this removal,” Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine, said of Monarez. Collins said there was “no basis” to remove the CDC director.

Bill Cassidy, another Republican senator who chairs the senate health committee, said that an upcoming meeting of the Department of Health and Human Services committee that advises on vaccine use should be postponed due to the attacks upon the CDC.

“If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,” Cassidy said, adding that “serious allegations” have been made about the lack of scientific process in vaccine recommendations.

Bernie Sanders, the independent senator, said that people of all political persuasions should be alarmed by the attempt to restrict access to vaccines, which he called “one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century”.

“We are witnessing a full-blown war on science, on public health, and on truth itself,” Sanders said. “In just six months, Secretary Kennedy has dismantled the vaccine review process, narrowed access to life-saving Covid vaccines and filled scientific advisory boards with conspiracy theorists and ideologues.”

The Trump administration shows no sign of backing down, however. In a press briefing on Thursday, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, criticized one of the departing CDC officials for using the term “pregnant people” in his resignation letter.

“I understand there were a few other individuals who resigned after the firing of Ms Monarez,” she said. “One of those individuals wrote in his departure statement that he identifies pregnant women as pregnant people, so that’s not someone we want in this administration anyway.”

The official, Demetre Daskalakis, resigned from his position as director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC on Wednesday, accusing the administration of using the agency to “generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public’s health”.

Daskalakis responded to Leavitt’s remarks in an interview on CNN. “I find it outrageous that this administration is trying to erase transgender people,” he said.

“I very specifically used the term pregnant people, and very specifically added my pronouns at the end of my resignation letter to make the point that I am defying this terrible strategy at trying to erase people and not allowing them to express their identities.

“So I accept the note from the press secretary and I counter that with: I don’t care.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b83765e5c0941478eff118c75ea9cdec6c72513/363_0_3633_2907/master/3633.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eed0c19639e4b5af55f6fe3a40ae4a54",N,,2025-08-29 13:00:16.456403

Migrants, most of whom trekked days across the Darien Gap on their way north, are even more vulnerable as they make their way back.
Migrants bus south through Mexico and other Central American nations until they arrive in the center of Panama.","More than 14,000 mainly Venezuelan migrants who hoped to reach the United States have reversed course and turned south since President Trump’s immigration crackdown began, according to a report published Friday by the governments of Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica.

The phenomenon, known as “reverse flow” migration, is largely made up of Venezuelan migrants who fled their country’s long-running economic, social and political crises only to encounter U.S. immigration policy no longer open to asylum-seekers.

Migration through the treacherous Darien Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed. That flow slowed somewhat in 2024, but dried up almost completely early this year.

Friday’s report, published with support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had dropped 97% this year.

Migrants traveling south interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia by those countries’ ombudsmen offices were almost all Venezuelans (97%) and about half of them said they planned to return to Venezuela, according to the report. Nearly all said they were returning because they could no longer legally reach the U.S.

Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled the crisis in Venezuela. For years, those migrants flocked to other South American nations, including Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile and more.

That changed in 2021, when hundreds of thousands of people set out for the U.S., braving the Darien Gap along the way.

A U.S. government smartphone app became the main way for asylum-seekers to enter the U.S. under the Biden administration. Then thousands of migrants became stranded in Mexico when Trump ended the use of the app on his first day in office.

Now, those migrants who were still trying to reach the U.S. when Trump entered and changed border policies have reversed course, traveling back to South America. Around a quarter of those interviewed planned to go to neighboring Colombia, previously the epicenter of the mass migration from Venezuela. Others said they didn’t know where they were going.

Colombia and other South American nations spent years pleading for aid from the international community to cope with the brunt of Venezuela’s migratory crisis, before many of those same migrants began moving toward the United States. Today, Venezuela’s political and economic turmoil rages on.

Migrants, most of whom trekked days across the Darien Gap on their way north, are even more vulnerable as they make their way back. They have fewer funds to finance their journey and few prospects for work when they get back. Migrants are dropped into regions with a heavy presence of criminal groups that increasingly prey upon them, the report said.

“Most of these people are already victims of human rights abuses,” Scott Campbell, a U.N. human rights representative in Colombia, said in a statement. “We urge authorities to aid people in this reverse migration to prevent them from being exploited or falling into trafficking networks run by illegal armed groups.”

The shift marks a radical reversal in one of the biggest mass migrations in the world.

Migrants bus south through Mexico and other Central American nations until they arrive in the center of Panama. From there, migrants pay between $260 and $280 to ride on precarious boats packed with people back to Colombia.

They take two different routes. Most island hop north of Panama through the Caribbean Sea, landing in the small town of Necocli, Colombia, where many started their journeys through the Darien.

Others travel south by sea along a jungled swath of Panama and Colombia through the Pacific Ocean, where they are dropped off in remote towns or the Colombian city of Buenaventura. Colombia’s Ombudsman’s Office estimates around 450 people have taken the perilous route, and the U.N. documented migrants getting scammed and stranded, facing boat accidents and arriving beaten down and vulnerable from their journey.

The region is one of the most violent in Colombia, and lack of state presence is filled by warring armed groups.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d99181b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5568x2923+0+394/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0f%2Fa7%2F5ba176004ff5847eb57ae3c47661%2Fap25226236256599.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 11:56:41.710004

This court ruling might have been the climax to a difficult summer for the government.","The Court of Appeal ruling that will allow asylum seekers to stay at the Bell Hotel, in Epping, is a technical victory for the government.

But for many Labour strategists, whichever way the ruling had gone, today was a case of ""heads they win, tails we lose"".

Let's begin with the good news for ministers.

They will be breathing a sigh of relief having feared that, had they lost this appeal, other local councils could bring legal challenges against the use of hotels to house asylum seekers in their area.

That would have risked throwing the whole system into chaos because there are thousands of asylum seekers awaiting decisions on their cases and limited accommodation options.

But the government has a legal duty to keep them off the streets.

This court ruling effectively resets the situation.

It gives ministers the time to fulfil their promise of removing all asylum seekers from hotels in ""a controlled and orderly way"" by 2029.

But there will not be any champagne corks popping in the Home Office.

That's because in order to uphold their legal responsibility to protect asylum seekers, they have had to argue in favour of using hotels to house them.

That is already being seized on by Labour's political opponents.

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed the government had used European human rights legislation ""against the people of Epping"" and that migrants had ""more rights than the British people under Starmer"".

While European human rights law was mentioned by the government in its written arguments, it was not a major part of its argument, nor the Court of Appeal's decision according to a summary of the ruling.

In fact, the duty to house asylum seekers so they don't sleep rough is a piece of British law, passed by MPs in 1999.

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: ""Keir Starmer has shown that he puts the rights of illegal immigrants above the rights of the British people who just want to feel safe in their towns and communities.""

She urged Tory councils to continue to bring legal cases against asylum hotels.

For a government under pressure after a summer of small boat crossings, this is a difficult position to be in.

As one Labour adviser told me, there will now be pressure on ministers to take more radical action to counter the kind of accusations they are facing.

That could include swapping some hotels for former military barracks or disused warehouses, as the health minister Stephen Kinnock suggested earlier on Sky News.

But such a move could further antagonise those voters on the left who believe the UK should be offering more support to asylum seekers.

The Green Party said the case was ""a distraction"" from ""Labour's failure to come up with workable, humane solutions"".

Former Labour leader and independent MP Jeremy Corbyn said asylum seekers ""should be supported so they can live in a more humane, sustainable, community-based form of accommodation"".

He added: ""Both Reform and Labour want you to think that the problems in our society are caused by these minorities. They're not.""

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss.
Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails.
At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18.
A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn’t partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.","When President Trump’s administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation’s largest immigration detention complex, it didn’t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.

Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.

The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in west Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.

The secretive — and brisk — contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government’s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president’s pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.

A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. “Private facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.

“The lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,” he said.

Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company’s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it’s unclear whether he might have partners.

Army declines to release contract

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees.

Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.

The camp has drawn comparisons to “Alligator Alcatraz,” a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.

The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida’s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.

At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.

Three white tents, each about 810 feet long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by the Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.

Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Detention Watch, said the use of military bases hearkens back to World War II, when Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Army camps including Fort Bliss. She said military facilities are especially prone to abuse and neglect because families and loved ones have difficulty accessing them.

“Conditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,” Ghandehari said. “But when there’s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.”

Company will be responsible for security

A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.

The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it’s classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.

Though Trump’s administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities. For a firm to compete for such contracts, at least 51% of it must be owned by people belonging to a federally designated disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.

One of the losing bidders, Texas-based Gemini Tech Services, filed a protest challenging the award and the Army’s rushed construction timeline with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’ independent oversight arm that resolves such disputes.

Gemini alleges Acquisition Logistics lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work, according to a person familiar with the complaint who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Acquisition Logistics’ past jobs include repairing small boats for the Air Force, providing information technology support to the Defense Department and building temporary offices to aid with immigration enforcement, federal records show.

Gemini and its lawyer didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.

A ruling by the GAO on whether to sustain, dismiss or require corrective action is not expected before November. A legal appeal is also pending with a U.S. federal court in Washington.

Schnell, the contracting lawyer, said Acquisitions Logistics may be working with a larger company. Geo Group Inc. and CoreCivic Corp., the nation’s biggest for-profit prison operators, have expressed interest in contracting with the Pentagon to house migrants.

In an earnings call this month, Geo Group CEO George Zoley said his company had teamed up with an established Pentagon contractor. Zoley didn’t name the company, and Geo Group didn’t respond to repeated requests asking with whom it had partnered.

A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn’t partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c60e77/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2327x1222+0+165/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fb0%2F9d21f50b4bbc81f638531566d12a%2F427a822ed80e469c91faad6ff16530c5.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:00:22.004616

Federal immigration authorities on Wednesday staged an operation on the scene of the Bear Gulch fire, a nearly 9,000-acre (3,600-hectare) blaze in the Olympic national forest, where they arrested two people who were part of a contract firefighting crew, the Seattle Times first reported. The fire is the largest currently burning in the state.

Authorities made the firefighters line up to show ID, the Seattle Times reported. One firefighter told the newspaper that they were not permitted to say goodbye to their detained colleagues.

“I asked them if his [co-workers] can say goodbye to him because they’re family, and they’re just ripping them away,” the firefighter said to the Seattle Times, adding that the federal agent swore and told the firefighter to leave.

The operation sparked widespread condemnation in the state. Murray in her statement released on Thursday morning demanded information about the whereabouts of the firefighters and the administration’s policy around immigration enforcement during wildfires.

The Trump administration’s immigration policy was “fundamentally sick”, Murray said. She continued: “Trump has wrongfully detained everyone from lawful green-card holders to American citizens – no one should assume this was necessary or appropriate.”

The US border patrol later on Thursday released some information on the operation, saying that it had assisted the Bureau of Land Management after that agency requested help after terminating contracts with two companies following a criminal investigation.

While verifying the identities of contract personnel, federal agents identified two people “present in the United States illegally”, the border patrol said in a statement, including one person who had a previous order of removal.

The agency did not provide more details about the nature of the criminal investigation and the identities of the firefighters have not been made public.

Authorities arrested the men on charges of illegal entry, and escorted 42 others off federal lands, according to the border patrol statement.

The US Forest Service said in a statement that it was aware of the border patrol operation and that the activities did not interfere with firefighting efforts.

Murray in her statement said the president had been undercutting firefighting abilities in other ways, including by “decimating” the US Forest Service. The administration significantly cut budgets and staffing at the agencies that manage much of the country’s federal lands, leaving the US unprepared for this year’s fire season, the Guardian previously reported.

“Here in the Pacific north-west, wildfires can [burn] and have burned entire towns to the ground. We count on our brave firefighters, who put their lives on the line, to keep our communities safe – this new Republican policy to detain firefighters on the job is as immoral as it is dangerous,” said Murray, who has represented Washington in the US Senate since 1993.

“What’s next? Will Trump start detaining immigrant service members? Or will he just maintain his current policy of deporting Purple Heart veterans?”

Nearly 430 personnel are responding to the Bear Gulch fire on the state’s Olympic peninsula.

Mengchen ZhangBBC Global China Unit, reporting from Texas

Jason Yuan, a second-hand car shop owner, closes the hood of a vehicle after tightening the last nut on the battery terminal - a routine he is all too familiar with.

Texas has long felt like home for him, as a naturalised US citizen born in China. But a recently passed state law is shaking his belief in his chosen homeland.

Texas Senate Bill 17 of 2025, also known as SB 17, will take effect on 1 September, restricting people and companies from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia from purchasing and renting property.

Officials say the bill is to protect national security. But to people like Mr Yuan, it sends a discriminatory message - that people who look like him are not welcome in Texas.

""It is anti-Asian, anti-immigrant, and specifically against Chinese-Americans,"" said Texas Representative Gene Wu, a Democrat leading the fight against the bill.

The new law could harm businesses in Texas, Wu told the BBC. Companies that could bring millions of dollars of investment to the state are looking for options elsewhere.

Bill targets 'malignant influence'

SB 17 was proposed earlier this year and signed into law on 20 June by Governor Greg Abbott, who called it the ""toughest ban in America"" to keep away foreign ""adversaries"".

It prohibits certain individuals and organisations of countries designated as national security threats from acquiring property in Texas - including homes, commercial space and agricultural land. It also restricts the length of time for which they can rent property to less than one year.

China is the first country named in the legislation, which accuses Beijing of using ""coercive, subversive, and malignant influence activities to weaken the United States"" in its bid to surpass the US economically, militarily and politically.

Those who violate the law could face fines of more than $250,000 (£193,000) or jail terms.

US citizens and green card holders are exempt, and valid visa-holders will still be allowed to own one primary residence. But opponents say regardless of the carve-outs, the bill is discriminatory in nature, and anyone deemed to look Chinese could be subject to unfair scrutiny.

In July, the Chinese American Legal Defense Alliance (Calda), a non-profit organisation, filed a lawsuit on behalf of three visa-holders from China, arguing that the law was unconstitutional.

The judge later dismissed the case, siding with the state attorney general who said the plaintiffs - who are student-visa and work-visa holders living in Texas - would not be personally affected by the law.

It therefore appears that the three plaintiffs are spared for now. But, for the wider group of visa-holders from the four countries, the lack of clear interpretation of the legal clauses still stokes uncertainty. Calda says it has filed an appeal.

'The Chinese Exclusion Act of 2025'

Chinese nationals are the largest group affected by the new law. At least 120,000 people who were born in mainland China were living in Texas as of 2023.

Qinlin Li, a recent graduate of Texas A&M University and a plaintiff of the lawsuit filed against SB 17, said she was shocked when she first learned about the bill.

""If there's no human rights, then we [are] back to like 150 years ago, we were like the railroad labourers,"" Ms Li said.

Ms Li lived in a rented apartment nestled in a quiet residential area in a suburb of Austin. Busy with her work and the lawsuit, she did not have time to search for a new apartment that could meet her needs until two weeks before her lease was due to expire.

She was in the middle of moving when the lawsuit was dismissed. Though the court ruling said she was not affected by the law, she said the entire process had taken a toll on her mental health.

""I think it's going to block people from studying here and working here because it's a lot of trouble just to think about it,"" Ms Li said.

Jason Yuan has devoted his time outside his car shop work to be a community activist. Before the bill passed, he led rallies outside the Texas capital and testified at a public hearing, telling the committee that the new land bill should be called ""the Chinese Exclusion Act of 2025"".

In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act, a law fuelled by anti-Chinese sentiment, was passed. The controversial law barred immigration of Chinese labourers into the US.

""Banning home ownership from folks just like me based on their country of origin, that is discriminatory in nature,"" Mr Yuan, the car shop owner, told the BBC.

Mr Yuan was concerned about the future for his two children - and when he spoke at a recent rally, his 13-year-old son stood behind him.

""I told everybody this is all worth it,"" Mr Yuan said. ""In the future, I would tell my kids when you face some discrimination, when somebody picks on you, this is a way to push back.""

Chinese companies consider looking elsewhere

As a small business owner, Mr Yuan also worries about the bill's financial impact as at least one third of his clients are Chinese immigrants.

""It's an ecosystem that the business owners of the Chinese community depend on,"" he said.

As well as small businesses, transnational companies from China could be directly hit by the bill.

Between 2011 and 2021, 34 Chinese companies recorded 38 investment projects, $2.7bn in capital investment and 4,682 jobs in Texas, according to a report by state officials.

Some Chinese companies are now reportedly seeking alternatives to Texas.

Nancy Lin, a commercial estate agent based in Dallas, told the BBC that several prospective Chinese clients she has spoken to are pausing their investment plans, including some in the electric vehicle and solar panel sectors.

""If this issue can't be resolved, I think it will be more difficult for Chinese companies to enter Texas. As for those that already have existing leases, they can't renew them. If they do, it can only be for no more than one year.""

The right to own land has been a struggle for Chinese-Americans, dating back over a century.

A previous alien land law in Texas, which restricted non-US citizens from purchasing land, was in force until 1965. It was deemed to be ""unreasonable and discriminatory"" and against ""economic development"".

Was project near airbase a threat?

Abbott says his top priority is the safety and security of Texans.

Asked for comment by the BBC, his office referred to previous statements on the matter, including a press release that said ""hostile foreign adversaries"", including China, ""must not be allowed to own land in Texas"".

Chuck DeVore, from a conservative think tank Texas Public Policy Foundation, was among those who spoke up in favour of the bill - highlighting the need to ""keep hostile regimes away from our military bases, farmland, and infrastructure, like Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio, Texas, or the ranches feeding our state"".

The legislative effort was prompted in part by Chinese businessman Sun Guangxin's controversial purchase of 140,000 acres land in Texas for a wind farm between 2016 and 2018, including land near Laughlin Air Force Base.

Although initially approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), Texas passed a law in 2021 prohibiting agreements with certain foreign-owned companies in ""critical infrastructure"", and Mr Sun's project was thwarted.

Texas Senator John Cornyn in 2024 said that as a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and a former senior leader in the Chinese military, Sun likely had other concerning surveillance plans on behalf of the Chinese government.

Mr Sun hit back at such claims. A 2024 lawsuit filed by one of his business subsidiaries highlighted that US officials had taken mitigation and cleared the project from national security concerns.

A survey conducted by Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, gathered 224 espionage cases against the US from China from 2000-2023 from open sources.

CCP-related threats to the US have grown in recent years, national security experts have suggested.

""The risk is real,"" Holden Triplett, former head of the FBI office in Beijing, told the BBC.

""Targeting the US at the sub-national level has increasingly become a trend in intelligence. The individuals and groups at that level tend to be less aware of the risks and more likely to establish relationships,"" Mr Triplett said.

But Patrick Toomey, from the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (ACLU), said that in the case of SB 17, some officials were wrongly equating Chinese people with the Chinese government.

""There is no evidence that harm to national security has resulted from Chinese people owning or leasing residential properties in Texas,"" he said.

Experts also question the necessity of Texas's new law from an regulatory standpoint. It was preferable for federal government to handle such matters to avoid overlapping jurisdictions, said Sarah Bauerle Danzman, from the Atlantic Council think tank.

A national trend

The Trump administration has also said it plans to ban Chinese nationals from buying farmland in the US.

""Texas's law should sound alarm bells,"" said Mr Toomey, adding that the legislation weaponised false claims of national security against Asian immigrants and other communities.

Mr Yuan believes that if Chinese-Americans do not put up a fight, the new law in Texas could lead to similar bills being passed in other states.

Ohio, for example, is considering a ban against ""adversarial countries"", but with stricter scope that could include green card holders as well. Activists have been rallying against it.

""They're trying to rewrite the rules of democracy,"" says Mr Yuan, ""but there is still a chance we could change the course.

""Otherwise, the US will become much more like China.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c808/live/91cb6440-8419-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:57:17.472250

Armored vehicles and a naval base outside Chicago may be utilized.

The Trump administration is making plans for an immigration crackdown in Chicago, according to multiple news outlets.

A major immigration enforcement operation could arrive in the city as soon as next week, CNN and The New York Times both reported on Aug. 28, citing unnamed administration sources. It comes after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, both Democrats, criticized President Trump's plan to send the National Guard into Chicago, as Trump did earlier this month in Washington, DC.

The Chicago operation could involve as many as 200 Department of Homeland Security officials, armored vehicles, and the use of a naval base outside the city as a staging area, the outlets reported. Chicago's violent crime is reportedly down 22%, compared to the same period a year ago. The statistic parallels a Council on Criminal Justice report in July showing that most crime categories have also dropped in other cities across America.

The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond directly to USA TODAY's request for comment on a planned Chicago operation. Both emailed a statement generally supporting Trump's immigration crackdown.

""President Trump has been clear: we are going to make our streets and cities safe again,"" the statement read. ""Under (Homeland Security) Secretary Noem, ICE and CBP are working overtime to deliver on the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe again.""

Chicago prepping for possible National Guard deployment

Meanwhile, Chicago city leaders are preparing for the possible arrival of National Guard troops as they briefed the City Council on what the city's response will be, according to WLS-TV.

Police Superintendent Larry Snelling was asked during an audio-only briefing with reporters on Aug. 28 how police would interact with the troops.

""It's impossible to answer that question without knowing if they're going to be here, what their orders are, what purpose they intend to serve,"" Snelling said. ""But the key here is to communicate, to have some type of communication, so that nothing gets out of hand, nothing gets out of control, and we maintain peace in our city.""

Mayor Brandon Johnson added during the briefing, ""We have not had any communication with the White House regarding the president's alleged, alleged, his purported desire to send federal troops into cities across America; he has not communicated that with us.""

Johnson, according to WMAQ-TV, also said, ""The National Guard, they do not have arresting authority or policing powers. They don't have that. Now, if there are federal agents that are arresting people -- the FBI, ATF -- those types of arrests happen throughout our country.""

Snelling told reporters that Chicago police officers will all be in uniform if there is any federal deployment to the city to ensure residents know who they are. If there is any immigration enforcement, a police supervisor would be dispatched to assess the situation, Snelling said.

""When federal agents come in to do work and whatever they decide to do when it comes to arrest things of that nature, the Chicago Police Department does not, cannot, and will not interfere with the work that federal agents are doing,"" Snelling said.

But the chief said they ""don't want to raise any fears.""

""We don't want to create any speculation around what's going on until we have concrete information. We don't put anything out there,"" Snelling said. ""As information trickles in, we prepare around that information. But right now, the communication is limited.""

However, one city leader, 15th Ward Alderman Richard Lopez, posted on social media criticizing the mayor and police chief on Aug. 28 after two teens were shot on the city's South Side.

""If having national guardsmen on hand to increase uniform presence keeps our youth from getting shot, what's the damn problem?"" Lopez said.

Trump doesn't tip his hand on when troops would come to Chicago

Trump has repeatedly talked about sending the National Guard to Chicago to help deal with its crime, similar to Washington, DC, but he has given no timeline. However, in a Truth Social post on Aug. 28, the president criticized Pritzker and indicated Chicago could be next.

So, what has the Supreme Court said about flag burning?
The Supreme Court addressed flag burning in the 1989 case of Texas v. Johnson.","President Donald Trump wants to prosecute flag burning, but can he make that happen without violating Supreme Court precedent? Trump contends it’s possible in an Aug. 25 executive order that instructs the attorney general to consider litigation that would “clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.”

Specifically, Trump’s order puts a spotlight on the court’s 1989 ruling in Texas v. Johnson, raising questions about possible loopholes in that case’s defense of flag desecration under the Constitution and about whether current justices would stand by their predecessors’ conclusions.

Here’s a brief explainer on free speech, flag burning, and what former Justice Antonin Scalia said he would do about flag desecration if he were king.

What does the executive order on flag burning say?

The order, titled Prosecuting Burning of the American Flag, describes the significance of the American flag and why it’s offensive to destroy it. Burning it “may incite violence and riot,” it says, and the pursuit of that outcome should be punished.

“Notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s rulings on First Amendment protections, the Court has never held that American Flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to ‘fighting words’ is constitutionally protected,” Trump contends.

The order goes on to instruct the attorney general to prosecute – using existing laws on property damage, discrimination, hate crimes, and other forms of violence – instances of flag burning that cause “harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.”

The order also instructs the attorney general, secretary of state, and secretary of homeland security to “deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas, residence permits, naturalization proceedings, and other immigration benefits” whenever they determine that “foreign nationals have engaged in American Flag-desecration activity under circumstances that permit the exercise of such remedies pursuant to Federal law.”

How did legal experts react to the flag burning order?

Trump’s executive order on flag burning was met with immediate pushback. Many legal experts said it runs afoul of Supreme Court precedent, not just on flag desecration but on free speech in general.

For example, Eugene Volokh argued that, although the order doesn’t ban all flag burning, it encourages “selective enforcement” of otherwise neutral laws regarding public fires and government property by telling federal authorities to “prioritize” the enforcement of those laws against people who desecrate the American flag. Such selective enforcement amounts to unlawful targeting of protected speech, he wrote.

However, administration officials were clearly ready for criticism. In their public statements on the order, they have emphasized their belief that it’s possible to prosecute flag burning without violating free speech protections.

“Thank you for protecting the American flag, and we’ll do that without running afoul of the First Amendment,” said Attorney General Pam Bondi at the signing ceremony for the order.

So, what has the Supreme Court said about flag burning?

The Supreme Court addressed flag burning in the 1989 case of Texas v. Johnson. A 5-4 majority held that states cannot enact blanket bans on flag desecration because, under some circumstances, flag burning is a form of symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment.

The case stemmed from a flag burning that took place at a demonstration against the Reagan administration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas. After being handed a flag from one of his fellow protesters, Gregory Lee Johnson “doused it with kerosene, and set it on fire.” Several observers reported being “seriously offended” by his behavior, but no one was hurt “or threatened with injury.” Johnson was convicted of violating a Texas law regarding the desecration of a venerated object, sentenced to one year in prison, and fined $2,000.

Johnson appealed his conviction to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state’s highest court for criminal cases, which ruled in his favor, holding that the state’s effort to punish Johnson for flag burning violated the First Amendment. To achieve its stated goal of keeping the peace without violating free speech protections, the court said, Texas only needed to criminalize incidents that truly fueled violence, not flag burning in general.

Texas appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, which ultimately affirmed the state court’s decision. The Supreme Court’s opinion, released in June 1989, said that the First Amendment protects a variety of forms of expressive conduct, not just actual speech, and that flag burning can become one such protected form, as it did in Dallas.

“Johnson burned an American flag as part — indeed, as the culmination — of a political demonstration that coincided with the convening of the Republican Party and its renomination of Ronald Reagan for President. The expressive, overtly political nature of this conduct was both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent,” wrote Justice William Brennan for the majority, which included Scalia.

The fact that flag burning can be protected speech does not mean it always is, Brennan added, noting that states retain the power “to prevent ‘imminent lawless action.’” The court made it clear, however, that offending observers is not the same thing as promoting lawlessness.

In dissent, Chief Justice William Rehnquist rejected the majority’s interpretation of the First Amendment, arguing that Johnson had been punished for what he did to the flag, not for the message he was trying to convey. “For more than 200 years, the American flag has occupied a unique position as the symbol of our Nation, a uniqueness that justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning,” he wrote.

Congress responded to the Johnson decision by criminalizing flag burning nationwide. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 outlawed mutilation, defacement, and other attacks on the American flag, while still allowing for the disposal of “worn or soiled” flags.

The Supreme Court took up a challenge to the 1989 law and heard arguments on it 11 months after releasing the Johnson decision. In United States v. Eichman, the same five-justice majority from Johnson again held that flag burning can be a protected form of speech, determining that prosecuting individuals who had set fire to American flags to protest the Flag Protection Act violated the First Amendment.

“[T]he Act still suffers from the same fundamental flaw: it suppresses expression out of concern for its likely communicative impact,” Brennan wrote for the court.

Where does the idea of Scalia as “king” come into this?

Those two 5-4 decisions did not settle the debate on criminalizing flag burning. Over the past 35 years, Congress has tried several times to add an anti-flag burning amendment to the Constitution, but none of the proposals got the support of two-thirds of the Senate, a bar that must be cleared before a constitutional amendment can make it through Congress.

Persistent interest in banning flag desecration helps explain why Scalia was sometimes asked during public appearances why he joined the Johnson majority. Excerpts from his responses circulated widely this week amid the discussion on Trump’s executive order.

“[I]f I were king, I would not allow people to go about burning the American flag. However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged. And it is addressed, in particular, to speech critical of the government,” Scalia said during a 2012 appearance on CNN.

He picked up the same refrain in 2015, during one of his last public events. “If it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag,” he said, according to the National Constitution Center. “But I am not king.”

What are the Trump administration’s arguments?

Administration officials are well aware of the Supreme Court’s past rulings on flag burning and Scalia’s comments. They’ve referenced them while defending the new order.

“Few things: 1) Antonin Scalia was a great Supreme Court Justice and a genuinely kind and decent person. 2) The President’s EO is consistent with Texas v. Johnson. 3) Texas v. Johnson was wrong and William Rehnquist was right,” wrote Vice President JD Vance on X on Tuesday.

Vance and others in the administration contend that the order is constitutional because it takes aim at only those acts of flag burning that even the Johnson majority did not defend. Specifically, the order is aimed at flag burning “that is likely to incite imminent lawless action” or which amounts to “fighting words,” words that are sufficiently offensive to provoke an average person to violently retaliate. In Johnson, the court said such expressive conduct is not entitled to the same protections as speech that merely causes offense.

But it remains to be seen whether it’s possible to draw clear distinctions between different acts of flag burning, classifying some as “fighting words” and others as protected forms of speech. In the 1989 case, Texas argued that prosecuting Johnson was part of keeping the peace, but the court looked at the same set of circumstances and said that peace was never at risk, since causing offense is not the same thing as disturbing the peace.

When will this come to a head?

As noted above, Trump’s order does not impose a new national ban on flag burning but instead encourages Bondi and others to prosecute flag burners under existing laws, such as laws prohibiting fires in fire safety zones.

One such law, a prohibition on lighting a fire in a public park, led to the arrest of a man on Monday who burned an American flag across the street from the White House while protesting against Trump, according to NBC News. The man will almost certainly use the First Amendment to fight the charge as he continues to protest the new executive order.

And the Trump administration is unlikely to mind that development. As previously noted, administration officials have expressed interest in getting the issue of flag burning back in front of the justices in the hope that they will clarify or overturn the court’s previous rulings.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/jimmy-woo-10mj_5nw-aI-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:01:36.082101

Neighbors living across the street from the facility, like LaShawnda Shavers — who has documented incidents between protesters and agents — say the disruptions, the tear gas and smoke, should be grounds for inspectors to step in.

City councilors heard public comment on the topic in July. City administrators then gave a memo to the mayor laying out possible pathways where ICE could hypothetically be found in violation of codes, anything from land use to noise and nuisance complaints.

However, even if an investigation found they were in violation, ICE would have to be given the chance to correct it.

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will resume an investigation practice it hasn't applied for decades, based on the opinion of neighbors of foreigners residing in the country.

The measure was published in a USCIS memorandum that came to light on Tuesday, although it is dated Aug. 22, and emphasizes the ""discretionary"" nature of the policy, which reviews subjective criteria like contributions to the ""happiness"" of the U.S.

Opinions of neighbors and coworkers

USCIS will take into account not only the opinions of neighbors but also those of coworkers of immigrants when determining their ""good moral character"" to grant them immigration benefits.

In this way, the federal agency intends to reinforce personal investigations of foreigners applying for U.S. citizenship.

CBS was the first to report on the new USCIS measure, which is based on section 335(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to veto applications for citizenship.

The neighborhood checks of immigrants would lead to possible interviews by USCIS officials with the applicants' neighbors and coworkers.

Until now, applicants for U.S. citizenship through the naturalization process must have lived in the country for three to five years as legal permanent residents, in addition to having no serious criminal record and passing a civics and English test.

But the additional USCIS requirements inject a political turn into the decisions by resuming a practice that the agency had ceased to perform in 1991, according to official records.

New technologies allow for quick verification of current requirements, such as criminal background checks. However, the change aims to strengthen the agency's discretionary verifications in line with the tightening of immigration policies under the Trump administration.

“The objective of the INA 335(a) investigation is to corroborate the eligibility of a foreigner for naturalization, which includes scrutinizing their residence, their good moral character, their attachment to the U.S. Constitution, and their disposition to the good order and happiness of the United States,” states USCIS in its memorandum.

It also indicates that the agency “may waive the requirement at its discretion for individual cases or certain cases.”

Origin of neighborhood checks

According to the USCIS document, between 1802 and 1981, ""applicants for naturalization had to present two witnesses who could attest to their qualifications for citizenship.""

In 1981, Congress decided to eliminate the witness requirement, determining then that the applicant's ""moral"" character could be better verified through an investigation that included the neighborhood, if necessary.

A decade later, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service officially ceased conducting neighborhood investigations. Nonetheless, USCIS now considers it appropriate to return to neighborhood investigations, which would include at least the five-year period prior to the immigrant's naturalization application.

In this way, the agency ceases “immediately the general waiver of neighborhood investigations to fully ensure that foreigners applying for naturalization meet the legal requirements, including, but not limited to, full adherence to the principles of the U.S. Constitution and a good disposition towards the good order and happiness of the United States.”

Consequences of the measure

USCIS can now request additional information from the foreign national seeking naturalization to support its final decision on neighborhood verifications, such as testimonial letters from neighbors, employers, coworkers and business partners who know the immigrant and can provide substantiated information about them.

“The fact that a foreign national does not present or refuses to present such evidence may lead to a neighborhood investigation which may affect the foreign national's ability to demonstrate their eligibility for naturalization,” clarifies USCIS.

In a statement cited by Politico, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow maintains that “the incorporation of neighborhood checks will contribute to improving these investigations required by law to ensure that we comply with the intent of Congress.”

Edlow was nominated by Trump to assume the direction of the federal agency, which was finalized in July, with the promise of a “new era” for USCIS, whose role is crucial for the legal adjustment of immigrants in the U.S.

Since then, USCIS has announced several changes regarding its immigration benefits policies, affecting naturalization applications, but also for permanent residence and other status adjustments.

The WA supreme court’s ruling should mark the end of the dispute between Reynolds and Higgins but it is still possible Higgins could decide to appeal against the judgment.
Sharaz said he would not challenge Reynolds’ defamation claim in April 2024 because he could not afford to pay his legal costs.","1. How did we get here?

The train had been set in motion once Higgins decided to go public about her version of events.

Higgins told news.com.au and The Project in February 2021 that she had been raped in Reynolds’ ministerial office by an unnamed former colleague, later publicly identified as Bruce Lehrmann, and claimed that Reynolds had not supported her adequately.

A criminal trial over the matter was abandoned because of juror misconduct and a second attempt was aborted owing to concerns for Higgins’ mental health.

Last year, in a defamation case brought by Lehrmann, Justice Michael Lee found that, on the balance of probabilities, Lehrmann had raped Higgins on the minister’s couch.

Upon watching the Project interview, Reynolds is alleged to have called Higgins a “lying cow” in front of her staff, in relation to the lack of support claim, which was then leaked to the media. She later said “she did not mean it in the sense it may have been understood” and that it was about Higgins’ allegations that she was not supported.

Higgins and Reynolds agreed to a settlement in March 2021, with Reynolds issuing a public apology to Higgins. The agreement also included a non-disparagement clause to prevent either party from speaking negatively about the other in relation to it.

But the public jabs at one another didn’t stop there.

In January 2022, almost a year after Higgins went public with her allegations, her partner, and now husband, David Sharaz, posted on Twitter that Reynolds could be asked in court about her involvement in making Higgins feel “pressured by the office not to continue” her police complaint against Lehrmann.

Higgins responded to Sharaz’s tweet, saying “I have no words”, ending with a zipper mouth emoji. This week, the WA supreme court ruled those four words and single emoji were defamatory and, because she couldn’t prove their truth or otherwise prove a defence, they would cost Higgins $135,000 in damages to Reynolds.

In July 2023, Reynolds revealed she would refer Higgins’ $2.445m personal injury settlement to the federal anti-corruption body.

In response, Higgins took to social media to accuse Reynolds of continuing a harassment campaign “through the media and in the parliament”.

“My former boss who has publicly apologised for mishandling my rape allegation. Who has had to publicly apologise to me after defaming me in the workplace … This has been going on for years now. It is time to stop,” Higgins wrote in the Instagram story in July 2023.

The court ruled that it was also defamatory and, because she couldn’t prove it was true or otherwise establish a defence, Higgins should pay Reynolds $180,000 in damages for the post.

Higgins’ legal team was successful in defending against defamation for another social media post in July 2023, in which she likened Reynolds’ submission to the ACT Board of Inquiry to “silencing” sexual assault victim-survivors. The ruling found Higgins’ lawyers had successfully established the defence of honest opinion, fair comment and qualified privilege.

The ruling also showed Reynolds had failed to prove Higgins and Sharaz had concocted a conspiracy to publicly release the details of Higgins’ alleged rape with the “sole or predominant purpose” of destroying the former senator’s reputation.

2. Is that the end of these legal battles?

The WA supreme court’s ruling should mark the end of the dispute between Reynolds and Higgins but it is still possible Higgins could decide to appeal against the judgment.

Missing from the supreme court’s decision this week, however, was a ruling on Sharaz’s case.

Reynolds had also taken defamation action against Sharaz for comments he made on social media in 2022. Sharaz said he would not challenge Reynolds’ defamation claim in April 2024 because he could not afford to pay his legal costs.

The judge has yet to deliver his ruling on Sharaz’s case.

Beyond this defamation fight, there are other cases afoot.

In June, the National Anti-Corruption Commission found “no corruption issue” with the $2.445m payout to Higgins, including that “there was no inappropriate intervention” by the former attorney general Mark Dreyfus.

Dreyfus responded to the Nacc’s finding that he regretted “the baseless allegation of corruption has been so widely publicised ahead of this finding and hope future matters can be resolved in a more timely manner”.

But Reynolds will also test her concerns about the settlement process in the federal court. The former senator said she had been denied the opportunity to defend herself against claims by Higgins that she had not supported her adequately and had mishandled the allegation.

In her statement of claim, Reynolds accused Dreyfus of “misfeasance of public office” by denying her defence and claimed Dreyfus had a conflict of interest because of critical comments he made against her. Dreyfus declined to respond at the time of reporting.

A case management hearing is listed for October.

Documents released to the Western Australian supreme court last year showed Reynolds was asked not to attend the mediation in December 2022 or make any public commentary about Higgins and to maintain confidentiality of information related to the settlement and civil claims in order to give the commonwealth the “best position to achieve a resolution at the mediation”. The settlement was signed a week later.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bb9aafa769499b08d1f8a38b9bcd22c40466d3/324_0_1875_1500/master/1875.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54e8c2b5060043dde3486b093f32f791",N,,2025-08-29 11:57:07.171134

He may be tapped to recreate his aggressive Los Angeles raids in other American cities.

“I’ve definitely received direction to be ready in the event that they want me to go,” Mr. Bovino said.

Mr. Bovino, 55, is the face of the Trump administration’s campaign to round up, detain and deport thousands of undocumented immigrants in the nation’s second-largest city. In just 11 weeks, he has gone from being the little-known head of one of the least busy sectors on America’s Southern border to the tactical commander of a contentious multiagency federal operation.

He has been testing the limits of politicized law enforcement, clashing on social media with California Democrats and producing Hollywood-style promotional videos of his masked, heavily armed officers marching to Kendrick Lamar’s “DNA.” He questioned an Army general’s loyalty to the country when the general expressed reservations about the National Guard’s involvement in one show of force at a Los Angeles park, according to court testimony. And he’s a named defendant in two lawsuits accusing his agents of crossing legal lines, including arresting Latino residents based on their skin color and regardless of their immigration status.

Mr. Bovino’s supporters say he’s helping to pull undocumented immigrants with violent criminal records off the streets. One of the biggest fans of his work is Mr. Trump. “The president called into the entire team that was assembled just to say, ‘Thank you, and you’re doing a good job in Los Angeles,’” Mr. Bovino said of a recent call with Mr. Trump.

His critics have a sharply different view, describing him as a showboat with a badge and a gun whose agents are using racial profiling to scoop up Hispanic men, women and teenagers. Outside of the federal takeover of the police force in the nation’s capital, no other region in America has seen such an aggressive display of federal force.

Two immigrants have died while trying to flee Mr. Bovino’s agents — a Mexican farmworker fell from a greenhouse, and a Guatemalan day laborer was struck by a vehicle on a freeway following a raid at a Home Depot.

And led by Mr. Bovino, they were involved this summer in two high-profile episodes that drew swift backlash from local officials.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Bovino and other agents showed up outside a museum in Los Angeles where Gov. Gavin Newsom was holding a rally. The event had nothing to do with immigration enforcement, but was focused instead on redistricting.

“We’re here making Los Angeles a safer place, since we don’t have politicians who can do that,” Mr. Bovino said as he stood next to his agents, some of whom carried rifles. “We do that ourselves.”

And last month, Mr. Bovino and dozens of federal agents marched through MacArthur Park, backed up by National Guard troops, helicopters and riot-ready horses. Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles suddenly showed up demanding answers, but the two officials did not meet face-to-face and talked by phone instead.

“I was on scene there,” Mr. Bovino later told the Fox affiliate in Los Angeles. “I was about 60 yards away from Mayor Bass. She didn’t want to come over and talk to me. She wanted to talk on the phone there.”

A spokeswoman for Ms. Bass said the mayor and Mr. Bovino spoke over the phone because he was not “immediately present” during the “military stunt.”

No arrests were made in the operation.

“It’s pretty unheard-of in any professional law enforcement organization to pull that stunt at MacArthur Park,” said Gil Kerlikowske, who served in the Obama administration as the commissioner of the Border Patrol’s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection. “If I was a commissioner at this point, I would have relieved him of duty after MacArthur Park.”

In two interviews with The New York Times, Mr. Bovino defended his operations in Los Angeles, calling them “legal, ethical and moral.” Mr. Bovino has said that agents have been targeting immigrants with criminal histories, but that any undocumented immigrant they come across could face arrest.

“And you may say, ‘Well, hey, don’t you feel bad?’ Well, no, I don’t,” Mr. Bovino said. “I’m not trying to be callous here, but it’s because we are giving them an out.” That out, he added, is the Trump administration’s announcement in May that it was offering $1,000 and a flight home to any undocumented immigrant who self-deports. He pointed out that one of his relatives used to live next door to an undocumented immigrant who was a drug trafficker.

“He came to our neighborhood, a place that we work in and out of every single day, and we arrest illegal aliens every single day and bring them right into that facility,” Mr. Bovino said. “I didn’t know he was inside the building until a police officer said, ‘Hey, the governor’s supposed to be here.’”

Mr. Newsom called the presence of federal agents outside “pretty sick and pathetic,” and he and other Democratic leaders disputed that it was a mere coincidence. Mr. Newsom’s office filed a formal request seeking all documents about the decision to show up outside the rally.

Though Mr. Bovino said he harbored no ill will toward the governor, he criticized Mr. Newsom for failing to respond to a request to meet with agency officials in Mr. Bovino’s border region, the El Centro sector, back in 2023. “So he ignored me,” Mr. Bovino said. “Didn’t want to talk. I guess I was beneath him. That’s sure what it felt like.”

Izzy Gardon, a spokesman for the governor, did not directly respond to a question about Mr. Bovino’s meeting request. But he said that Mr. Newsom had visited the border frequently and “doesn’t need a hall pass” from Mr. Bovino to do so.

Sector chiefs oversee day-to-day operations in their regions, and they are typically focused on their A.O.R., agency parlance for area of responsibility. Silvestre Reyes used his experience as a sector chief in El Paso to win a seat in Congress in the 1990s. Most sector chiefs, however, do not venture into the world of politics and avoid antagonizing their region’s elected officials, with whom they usually build partnerships.

Although he has described himself as “apolitical,” Mr. Bovino has taken a different approach and has adopted a distinctly partisan edge. His remarks in interviews, his social-media posts and the videos that his team creates often criticize or ridicule Mr. Newsom, Ms. Bass and Democratic-run California as a whole.

“I see a lot of outrage from the governor when he talks about these ICE raids,” Mr. Bovino said of Mr. Newsom on Fox News. “Where is the outrage when there are Tren de Aragua members walking with impunity on the streets of Los Angeles?”

One “Star Wars”-themed video posted by Mr. Bovino depicted his sector as Darth Vader’s lightsaber. The rebel troops Darth Vader slaughters are portrayed as Sanctuary Cities, Fake News and Human Smugglers, among others.

Another video opens with comments Ms. Bass made following a raid known as Operation Trojan Horse. As the mayor says the border operation failed, the video quickly cuts to show Mr. Bovino cracking a smile, and then supplies the Border Patrol’s response to Ms. Bass. Rap music blares as his agents jump out of a Penske rental truck and chase down immigrants outside a Home Depot. The video ends with Mr. Bovino, wearing a tactical helmet, walking across the parking lot in slow motion, like a triumphant scene out of an action movie.

“It’s just far too political,” said Mr. Kerlikowske, the former Customs and Border Protection commissioner. “I mean, I don’t think you can find any of the Border Patrol chiefs, any of the ICE chiefs in the past, making these kinds of statements or taking these kinds of actions.”

Mr. Bovino said he saw his approach not as political, but as defending his agents from being attacked by lawmakers.

“When you have politicians that are encouraging MS-13 gang members to take action against law enforcement, then you’re damn right I’m going to say something,” he said.

He was referring to a local elected official who posted a video urging the leaders of street gangs to “get your members in order” in response to the raids and wondering why, “now that your ‘hood is being invaded by the biggest gang there is, there ain’t a peep out of you.” That official, Cynthia Gonzalez, the vice mayor of Cudahy, a small city in Los Angeles County, later said in public remarks that the video was satirical and had nothing to do with violence.

Mr. Bovino sent an early signal that he was ready to lead the administration’s immigration crackdown before Mr. Trump was even president.

On Jan. 6, in the last days of the Biden administration, Mr. Bovino led Operation Return to Sender, a raid in agricultural Kern County. At least 78 people, including farmworkers, were arrested. During that operation, agents fanned out across the area, at gas stations and along farm roads.

The American Civil Liberties Union sued the federal government over the raid on behalf of the United Farm Workers union, arguing that people were stopped based on unlawful factors such as the color of their skin. In April, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction barring Border Patrol agents from stopping people in the Kern County area without reasonable suspicion that they are in the country illegally.

That pre-Trump raid in January was a kind of test run of the Los Angeles raids that started later in the year — high-profile sweeps in multiple locations at once to capture undocumented immigrants as they went about their daily routines. The L.A. raids started on June 6, and Mr. Bovino was named the operation’s tactical commander about a week later. Since the raids began, federal agents have made 5,000 arrests in the Los Angeles area, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

In his spare time, Mr. Bovino has been flipping through a classic novel from the 1800s, “The Count of Monte Cristo,” the epic of wrongful imprisonment and revenge. He considers bear hunting one of life’s pleasures, and got his start in law enforcement working as a reserve police officer in the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina, his home state. Federal officials declined to supply some biographical details about him, including his marital status or how many children he has, citing security threats.

Mr. Bovino attended Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., for graduate school, and joined the Border Patrol when he was in his 20s, inspired by authors who wrote about their work as agents. He joined the agency in 1996 as a member of Border Patrol Academy Class 325.

“People underestimate his intelligence because of his demeanor sometimes, but he’s exceptionally smart,” said Jason Owens, a former Border Patrol chief who is a friend of Mr. Bovino and was also part of Academy Class 325. “He just has the country-boy demeanor, where he talks about Ma and Pa America, and his accent, and so a lot of people can dismiss him. They do that at their own peril.”

The Los Angeles raids have continued in recent days, despite legal developments that have made local officials and activists question whether agents were violating court orders. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order barring federal agents from making indiscriminate stops in the Los Angeles area. An appeals court later upheld that ruling.

“They are not trying to follow the law,” said Mayra Joachín, a lawyer for the A.C.L.U. involved in both the Kern County and Los Angeles lawsuits. “They are not trying to avoid using race to stop someone.”

Mr. Bovino has pushed back on such accusations, noting that undocumented immigrants of various nationalities have been arrested and that a large percentage of Border Patrol agents are Hispanic.

“That’s agenda-driven talk by those trying to sow fear in people,” he said of racial-profiling claims.

It remains unclear how long Mr. Bovino will run operations in Los Angeles. But he said he had been told to be ready “to take on criminals at a moment’s notice in other locations.” The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on whether Mr. Bovino would be going to other cities.

Later this fall, he said, he would like to get back to North Carolina for bear-hunting season. “But I have a feeling that I may be continuing to make America a safer place,” he said, “and that always takes precedence over anything personal.”

The first change came when voters elected Carmen Ramirez, the first Latina on the Oxnard City Council.

Most recently, Benites launched a podcast to discuss issues such as immigration operations and to clarify the department’s role.","Latinos make up more than half of Oxnard’s 202,000 residents, and they have long taken pride in helping to build this sprawling city by the sea.

Constructed around the same agriculture fields where Cesar Chavez organized migrant laborers before establishing the United Farm Workers of America, Oxnard is a place where Latino influence is omnipresent — from music festivals to eateries.

At City Hall, officials have made it a priority to protect the area’s immigrant residents and workforce — whether that involves bolstering tenant rights against predatory landlords, or joining a civil rights lawsuit against indiscriminate raids.

But a summer of immigration sweeps has fueled distrust in the community, and put city officials on the defensive.

The Trump administration’s crackdown has sparked street protests, as well as complaints that city officials need to be more proactive and forceful in the face of federal immigration enforcement.

“Tensions are high in the community right now and relations are being strained,” said Lucas Zucker, co-executive director of Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy, the same group behind new tenant protections. “It takes a lot of work to build trust with the immigrant community and any law enforcement or government.”

At a City Council meeting last month, speakers criticized police and city leaders for not doing enough to help the immigrant population. Some called for legal action.

“Our community is under attack by the federal government,” Veronica Miranda, 65, told the council that evening. “I don’t know what you can do, but I’m going to ask you to do something — a gesture, can we look at an eviction moratorium?”

“You’re not able to stop the federal government,” said Pastor Greg Runyon. “I don’t fault you for that … but you do have a weapon — it’s a bully pulpit.”

Vanessa Valdez, an attorney and resident, didn’t mince her words.

“You’re here to serve us, if you refuse to act, we will make sure you do not get reelected,” she said. “We will hold every one of you accountable for what happens under your leadership, starting with the death of Jaime Alanis García.”

City officials said they understand the anger, but they insist they are doing all they can to fight the federal action.

Alexander Nguyen, city manager for Oxnard, said it was particularly alarming given the city’s efforts to build trust with immigrant communities.

“The Police Department has worked really hard over the last two decades to establish a tremendous amount of trust and respect, and open communication,” Nguyen said. “When you’re talking about the federal actions, it clearly can drive a wedge between specific communities and their police departments.”

Since January, federal immigration agents had been parachuting into the town and surrounding communities. The agents, successfully at times, entered farms and packinghouses to apprehend immigrant workers living in the country illegally. They stopped people in their vehicles and on the street, sometimes loitering around schools.

Some of the raids were captured on video and shared on social media, including one in May, when federal agents detained a man at a gas station, leaving his two sons behind. One of the sons was 19, but did not have a license to drive.

The following month, amid harvest season, federal agents were caught on video as they chased a farmworker across a strawberry field.

As the raids continued, community frustration grew. That was especially the case for the Police Department, whose officers often stood between agents and demonstrators.

It didn’t help that federal authorities would drive to the police station to report that they were being followed, prompting police officers to contact immigrant rights advocates, who have been alerting residents of the operations and documenting them.

And because federal agents often dressed in plain clothes, there were a few cases in which activists mistakenly followed police officers home from work. In some cases, sting operations by a police task force have been complicated by people mistaking them for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.

But things came to a head last month when the largest cannabis operator in the state — Glass House Brands — was the target of two separate worksite operations in Camarillo and Carpinteria.

There were hundreds of workers at the Camarillo property, many of them Oxnard residents, who were detained and taken away for deportation. It was during this operation that García fell three stories from a greenhouse while trying to evade federal agents.

García died from his injuries two days later.

The Department of Homeland Security said that García was not among those being pursued and that federal agents called in a medevac for him.

The operation led to an hours-long standoff between demonstrators and federal agents, who used less lethal ammunition to keep the crowd at bay. A few demonstrators responded by throwing rocks at federal vehicles as they left the area. At least one man was captured on video shooting a handgun at agents.

The operation also included members of the National Guard, prompting the National Immigration Law Center to file a Freedom of Information Act to ascertain the military’s role in the operation.

“The deployment of the U.S. military in our communities is not just unnecessary, it is yet another fear tactic this administration is using in its concerted assault on immigrant communities and our democratic traditions,” said Benjamin R. Farley, special counsel at NILC, in a written statement.

The situation only worsened when federal agents showed up at a local hospital where injured farmworkers had been taken, prompting Oxnard police to respond.

Oxnard Police Chief Jason Benites said the officers were requested by the Fire Department, not ICE. However, their presence drove a narrative that officers were helping federal agents. He said the officers were there to ensure that ambulances could access the emergency room.

Two days after the operation, a federal judge would order immigration authorities to stop detaining people based on their ethnicity or occupation. The order covers seven counties: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.

In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found sufficient evidence that agents were using race, language, a person’s vocation or the location they are at — such as a car wash, Home Depot, swap meets or a row of street vendors — to form “reasonable suspicion.”

Frimpong said reliance on those factors, either alone or in combination, does not meet the requirements of the 4th Amendment. Her order prohibits agents from relying solely on those factors to establish reasonable suspicion to detain people.

Farmworkers have long been a part of life of Oxnard. The vast coastal plain grows most of the nation’s celery, along with beans, strawberries, onions and peppers, according to UC Davis data.

Chavez, the father of the farm labor movement, spent a year in the town organizing workers and registering voters.

The city had its share of racial strife over the years, with some Latino migrants feeling they were mistreated by a white majority that also owned the farms where they worked. But by the early 1990s, Latinos became the majority and rapidly remade political and cultural life.

Over the next three decades, it became a magnet for Latino residents and saw its population nearly double. A thriving Latino middle class was also established.

But it wasn’t until 2010 — after a massive scandal brought government reforms — that Latinos were significantly represented in city affairs.

The first change came when voters elected Carmen Ramirez, the first Latina on the Oxnard City Council. She would later become the first Latina on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. An environmentalist, she along with environmental groups and residents worked together to stop the construction of a power plant. They would also address other environmental issues.

Another change came in 2018, when the city moved to district elections, allowing for Latino representation in government to grow.

“I think both things made the City Council more racially diverse, but also more accessible to grassroots community members who wanted to run for office, because it’s a lot easier to run in a small district, especially in a small town,” Zucker said. “And so I think that that has helped bring in some pretty progressive and community-oriented folks to the City Council, who have moved forward ... some really important policies.”

Immigration raids are not new here. In the 1970s and 1980s, the federal government launched roundups targeting Mexican and Central Americans.

Oxnard was still trying to recover from racial strife at the time of the crackdown. Much of the tension was related to school segregation and police brutality. The latter led to violent riots when residents of La Colonia, a Latino neighborhood where Chavez once lived, rose up.

But under Police Chief Robert Owens, the department tried to shift the way it conducted police work, pushing officers to build a closer relationship with the community.

When Benites joined the department more than 30 years ago, he was told that officers never got involved in federal immigration operations and that when it came to the immigrant population, everyone was treated equally and that the only time you’d arrest someone was for committing a crime.

Police departments have walked a fine line between being peacekeepers and crimefighters, a distinction that has been difficult to make at times amid controversial shootings and past enforcements.

In the summer of 1978, Oxnard police officers and Ventura County sheriff deputies found themselves standing between members of the Ku Klux Klan and demonstrators. The Klan attempted to show the film “The Birth of a Nation” at the town’s community center in an effort to recruit new members, but their arrival led to a standoff that turned violent.

Residents at the time accused Oxnard police officers of protecting members of the Klan. At least one officer who was there during the riot said he and others were there to keep the peace and prevent both sides from hurting each other.

Now, officers find themselves being accused of helping federal agents.

Zucker, the co-executive of Cause, said he doesn’t believe the Police Department is working with the federal government, but he does believe there is some soft cooperation. He said when federal agents go to the station and request police assistance, that same response is not provided to activists who are trying to determine what agency the federal agents work for.

“I think from the Police Department’s perspective, I think what they say is: ‘We would do this for anyone.’” he said. “But there’s just a perception in the community that it never seems to be the case that the local police are helping the protesters or immigrants in those confrontations, and it always just so happens they seem to be making it easier for ICE to do that.”

In order to preserve its relationship with the community, Benites said the department has reached out to immigrant rights advocates to discuss any issues. An officer also takes questions from the community on a local radio program — a long-standing tradition started many years ago and later expanded to include the Spanish media by Mayor Luis McArthur, a former Oxnard police officer.

Most recently, Benites launched a podcast to discuss issues such as immigration operations and to clarify the department’s role.

Even before Trump was sworn into office, Benites and other police chiefs in Ventura County put out a joint statement saying they do not assist or take part in federal immigration operations. They underscored their roles are limited and often subjected to investigations targeting organized crime such as drug organizations or human trafficking operations.

Despite the outreach, he said, it’s not always guaranteed that people will listen.

“There’s only so much you can do,” Benites said.

The raids have also had an impact on the relationships between city officials and social justice groups.

The groups want the city to stand with the immigrant community and have asked that the city allocate money for a legal defense fund to help families that have been affected by the immigration raids.

McArthur, the mayor, said the city has plans to meet with all groups to address ongoing immigration issues in the city.

McArthur said he’s hoping to keep the bridges that he and his predecessors spent years forging with local groups, but it has been difficult with the high number of operations taking place.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b680c01/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2F13%2Fa991b0334e9ab000e91bf0c00f91%2F1513810-ice-raids-camarillo-farm-jl-8214.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 09:56:20.276097

He didn't spend much time in ICE detention, only 16 days.
The bank in Nicaragua told him they were unable to deposit or cash the check.","Three Nicaraguan men recounted their experiences of detention and deportation following an ICE raid at a Tallahassee construction site.

The men described harsh conditions, including inedible food, lack of medical care, and prolonged detention.

Darwin Valles Rallo says he lost 14 pounds in 16 days.

Juan Hernandez-Vallejos was deported without his passport, his phone and his boots.

And Carlos Rivas Juarez called his detention ""torture.""

Even after signing his deportation orders, he spent weeks locked up in a detention center in Colorado, grappling with a growing sense of despair.

“I thought I was going crazy, I felt really bad. I felt like I was losing my mind,” said Juarez, 37. “Sometimes I wanted to jump, I was on the second floor and I wanted to jump to stop feeling so crazy, but that wouldn’t solve anything.”

These three men who were arrested and detained during an ICE raid in May at a Tallahassee construction site are now in their home country of Nicaragua. Their storylines and timetables differ, but each described what it feels like to be removed from the United States amid the largest mass deportation in history.

Their life trajectory in the U.S. was abruptly thrown off course when dozens of federal and state law enforcement officers descended upon a construction site near Tallahassee's CollegeTown on the morning of May 29. It was a show of force exhibiting Florida's partnership with the feds, a warning shot to the thousands of undocumented immigrants working in the state and the companies that employed them.

The Florida Highway Patrol and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement joined officers from federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the Internal Revenue Service, to detain over 150 workers at the site.

However, still unknown is the exact number of how many people were arrested and loaded onto white buses that day. The USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida asked Hedrick Brothers Construction how many of its subcontractors were detained, but a spokesperson said the company had been kept ""out of the loop.""

And a federal search warrant for the raid is still sealed.

The three men — Juan, Darwin and Carlos — spoke with the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida about what transpired after they were handcuffed, zip-tied, and processed through the immigration system.

""What they do to you, it's not humane, in the United States,"" Juarez said. ""That's not how they should treat a human, because we're not criminals, we were just trying to earn a living over there, we weren't hurting anybody.""

'They told me I was a criminal'

The USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida has been in touch with Hernandez-Vallejos, a father of five, and his family since the day he was arrested by immigration officials in Tallahassee.

When he was first detained, he was sent to a holding cell at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Tallahassee. Later that night, he was transferred to a facility in Fort Walton Beach for a couple of days.

Hernandez-Vallejos said he couldn't talk to his family during this time, and he was sick and they wouldn't give him medicine. When he returned to Tallahassee for his court date, he was then moved to FCI Tallahassee detention, where he would remain for weeks after he pleaded guilty and agreed to a ""fast-track"" program.

""They told me I was a criminal because I had previously entered the United States,"" Hernandez-Vallejos said.

Hernandez-Vallejos, a construction worker who specialized in framing, had previously been deported in 2014 and 2015, and was being charged with illegal reentry, a federal charge with a penalty of a maximum of two years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

In the Northern District Court of Florida, the plea agreement includes: Agreeing to waive their ability to appeal their guilt or their sentence; agreeing to waive most post-conviction rights; and agreeing to not challenge an order of removal.

The judge gave him time served. He was then transferred back to Fort Walton Beach, then to an ICE detention facility in Louisiana where his blood pressure spiked up to 200.

""I was very stressed,"" he said. He saw a doctor, but he had to advocate for himself and ask for his medication every night for those 25 days.

""If I didn't ask for my pill, they wouldn't give it to me,"" he said.

Some of the people he was detained with had been there for eight, nine months. While federal officials tout large numbers of deportations, the immigration and customs enforcement facility Hernandez-Vallejos was detained in was gridlocked.

He was finally booked on a removal flight to Nicaragua from Louisiana after 25 days and stayed the night in the airport — no blanket, no bed. He fell asleep in a hallway filled with trash. When he landed in Nicaragua on Aug. 7, U.S. officials didn't return his passport, his wallet or his boots. They said they were lost.

When he asked Nicaraguan police how to reclaim his belongings, he said they told him: ""There are lots of people like you who are trying to get their stuff back, and immigration from the U.S. is robbing you.""

He had approximately $1,300, both in his commissary and on his person when he was detained. That money was put on a VISA debit card and given to him when he arrived in Nicaragua. However, he is unable to use it or take money out of it, he said. He's called, he's been to the bank, and they have all give him different instructions.

Finally, a person from the debit card company told him he would not be able to retrieve his funds in Nicaragua — the card wasn't usable in his country.

Hernandez-Vallejos will have to go to Honduras, an hour away, to try to reclaim his money.

He knows he can't go back to the United States. He knows if he does, and he's detained, he'll go to prison. He said he misses working the most.

A comment from ICE is pending.

But Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie have rebuffed criticism about the treatment of detainees, especially those at the South Florida Detention Facility in the Everglades, which is in the process of being shut down.

""To say that, 'Oh, the AC is on too much. It's too cold,' or this or that, at some point it's like, good grief,"" said DeSantis at a press conference on July 25 outside of the facility.

""Just acknowledge the fact that what Kevin (Guthrie) and these guys have done has been a Herculean effort to get this up, that they are meeting or exceeding every state or federal standard, whichever is higher.""

'All I have left is memories'

Rallo, 29, spent three years in the United States. It's been three months since law enforcement detained him at his workplace, but it's still hard to talk about it, he said.

""I wasn't doing anything wrong. I wasn't in the street, robbing. There are so many people who are out there, doing harm, and they don't do anything about it,"" Rallo said.

His experience was much different compared to Hernandez-Vallejos. He didn't spend much time in ICE detention, only 16 days.

But in those 16 days, he didn't eat. The food was terrible, he said. All three men said the food provided by ICE was inedible. Juarez said it wasn't even good enough for dogs.

Rallo lost 14 pounds in 16 days.

When he got to Nicaragua, officials gave him bread and juice, which he said was better than the food he was given in ICE detention.

He had $82 dollars on him when he was detained. That money given to him when he landed in Nicaragua is in the form of a check from the Baker County Sheriff's Office with his last name spelled incorrectly. The bank in Nicaragua told him they were unable to deposit or cash the check.

He's holding onto it, but he doesn't know how he will ever get his money back.

Rallo said goodbye to his four children in Nicaragua, ages 4, 6, 7 and 9, and went to the United States to help his parents, who are old. They don't have many resources, and he struggled to get to the U.S. to hopefully provide a better life for his family.

""But it is what it is, that's how life is. They deported me,"" he said. He shared videos of the day he was detained, of his coworkers standing on top of an unfinished apartment building and of himself and others riding in a white bus while handcuffed.

""All I have left is memories,"" he said.

'They do what they want'

When Juarez was detained, he said he was taken straight from Tallahassee to Miami. But he didn't get off the bus there. Instead, the bus turned right around and traveled overnight and another half day to El Paso, Texas.

""Without stopping, without getting off the bus, and tied by the feet, the hands and by the waist,"" he added. ""They didn't tell us anything.""

They moved him from El Paso to a facility in Colorado. He signed his deportation papers 20 days in, but spent another 20 days in detention. He begged to be deported back to Nicaragua, but officials told him his only option was to be deported to Mexico.

""I told them no, but they said 'yes,' that I had to sign the papers so they could drop me off in Mexico. I asked them why, if I'm from Nicaragua, why are you sending me to Mexico? But there, they do what they want with you. It'll make you go crazy,"" Juarez said.

He left Colorado on a bus at 2 a.m. He was still handcuffed, and he was so thirsty, he said. Detainees were only given a sandwich and water around 4 p.m., and they arrived to El Paso at 9 p.m.

He got to Mexico on a Wednesday, and he said they took off his zip-ties and took him to a place to get food and wash his clothes. Two days later, he spent 35 hours on a bus, from El Paso to Villahermosa, a city close to the Mexico-Guatemalan border, and said that's as far as the bus was going to go.

He had no money and had to wait for someone to send him funds to get to Nicaragua. His deportation, including detention and travel, took 48 days.

In a video he sent to the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida, Juarez gave a tour of his home in Nicaragua, which sits off of a dirt road outlined by large stones with a river nearby.

In front of the house, to the right, there's a tall stack of large paving stones. He said he had planned to use these to build the house, but it didn't work out, he said.

""But thank God I have my life, I'm healthy,"" he added.

Behind the house and under a metal awning, there's an earthen oven and a large table, where his family is gathered. His house is made of adobe and wood, and the roof is metal. While the wooden slats below the roof let in a little light, the inside of the house is still dark. You can hear his feet shuffle against the dirt floors as he walks in the main room of the home.

""This is where I sleep,"" he said, as he pans into a room separated by a curtain. Laundry hangs over the two beds on a clothesline.

Juarez said U.S. immigration officials promised them things, like a quick deportation, the ability to talk to their family on the phone.

But he said they were all lies.

He has friends who were detained with him at the Tallahassee raid, and they're still locked up.

""If they wanted to deport us, send us, grab us and send us, that's it, why are you having us suffer for so long in those jails,"" he said. ""It's incomparable to anything, it's terrible.""","https://www.tallahassee.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/26/PTAL/85831473007-535-e-677-c-5-e-6-e-48-c-9-b-383-ece-82-a-6957-cf.JPG?crop=719,405,x0,y0&width=719&height=405&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-29 11:56:53.620092

Mr. Hernandez Rojas sobbed and cried for help.
He is not resisting!” Mr. Hernandez Rojas suffered a heart attack during the confrontation with federal agents and later died.
The case of Mr. Hernandez Rojas did not inspire a similar campaign against the violence of our immigration system.
The Southern Border Communities Coalition, a project of Alliance San Diego, has tracked fatal encounters with the Border Patrol since 2010, when Mr. Hernandez Rojas was killed.","The U.S.-Mexico border is no longer just a line on a map; it is a roaming force, drifting through our cities and ravaging schools, courthouses and workplaces. It has become unmoored from geography, dragging its violence and impunity into the heart of American life.

Once confined to the borderlands, the Border Patrol — with its culture of Wild West impunity — is now operating across the country, joining Immigration and Customs Enforcement in raids far from ports of entry. Gun-toting agents, sometimes in cowboy hats, are treating places like Los Angeles and other cities deep in the United States as if they were lawless outposts on a hostile frontier. ICE, the Border Patrol and other agencies have been deputized to carry the border with them — to enforce its racialized, exclusionary logic wherever they go. It has become routine to see masked agents jump out of unmarked vans to detain people violently, based on their skin color.

The border no longer divides only countries. It snakes between white and brown, between families and neighbors, between citizens and the rights they once thought were inviolate. The brute force that it once unleashed out of sight, in remote desert regions at the nation’s edge and behind the locked doors of detention centers, is beginning to erupt in broad daylight.

Our immigration system has always been deadly.

Human rights groups estimate that as many as 80,000 people have died at the border since the 1990s, when the United States began to militarize it against migration from Mexico. In “The Land of Open Graves,” the anthropologist Jason de León describes the border as “a killing machine that simultaneously uses and hides behind the viciousness of the Sonoran desert.” That machine is powered by the desert’s brutal heat and rising walls from which immigrants fall and break their backs. By the rivers threaded with barbed wire. By the Border Patrol bullets fired at unarmed teenagers.

Now, the barbarity that has long defined that machinery is bursting out of the margins, coming not only for immigrants but for anyone with the skin tone or tongue of the undesirables. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to lift a temporary restraining order against its use of racial and linguistic profiling in Los Angeles and other parts of California.

How did we get here — to this place where the border has become unfixed, a ghost fence snagging flesh and freedom? Some Democratic leaders have expressed outrage at the border’s inward creep. But Democrats and Republicans colluded to let it loose, and we must reckon with the bipartisan nature of our immigration regime if we are to restrain it. It was not an invention of President Trump. It was built, brick by brick, by both parties.

It was the Clinton administration that oversaw the birth of “prevention through deterrence,” a policy that set the stage for Stephen Miller’s embrace of cruelty to discourage migration. First outlined in 1994, the strategy was simple but brutal: to seal off safer urban crossing points at the U.S.-Mexico border and funnel migrants into the deadly terrain of the desert. Then, in 1996, President Bill Clinton signed two sweeping immigration laws — the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act and the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, dramatically expanding the grounds for deportation, eroding due process and making re-entering the country after deportation a federal felony.

Years later, President Barack Obama became known as “deporter in chief,” deporting three million people from the country, more than any previous president. One of those deportees was Anastasio Hernandez Rojas. A decade before a police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd, a federal agent knelt on the neck of Mr. Hernandez Rojas after he was intercepted trying to reunite with his wife and U.S.-citizen children in San Diego, where he had lived for more than two decades. In May 2010, he was hogtied outside the San Ysidro Port of Entry, surrounded by Department of Homeland Security agents. Several kicked and punched him. One tore his pants off. Mr. Hernandez Rojas sobbed and cried for help. “Please,” he wept. “Help!” Witnesses filmed on their phones as agents repeatedly used a stun gun on him. One bystander shouted: “Why are you guys using excessive force on him? He is not resisting!”

Mr. Hernandez Rojas suffered a heart attack during the confrontation with federal agents and later died. When Mr. Floyd died of a cardiopulmonary arrest 10 years later, it reignited a national movement against police brutality. The case of Mr. Hernandez Rojas did not inspire a similar campaign against the violence of our immigration system.

Despite years of pressure from immigrant rights advocates, Mr. Obama’s Department of Justice declined to bring criminal charges in the case. Most Americans moved on, and there was no accountability. In 2014, the second Obama administration also decided against removing exceptions for racial and ethnic profiling in immigration enforcement, despite issuing new guidance restricting profiling in other law enforcement. The Biden administration made the same decision. In doing so, both administrations affirmed a two-tiered system of justice — one in which immigrants, and those who merely look like immigrants, have fewer rights.

That instinct — to protect the Democratic Party over the people it claims to champion — turned the border loose on innocent people, ensnaring not only those without legal status but also Americans, green card holders and other legal immigrants. Meanwhile, the mass surveillance industry grew to profit from the border’s expansion. Tech companies like Palantir and Anduril are making billions by building A.I.-powered surveillance towers and other technology, potentially to spy on all of us. These companies, backed by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, will be cashing in on Mr. Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”

Democrats’ unwillingness to confront their record and their collaboration with restrictionists has betrayed citizens and noncitizens alike. They also undermined their own credibility with voters and normalized anti-immigrant cruelty among the general population. I have repeatedly asked Trump voters about his immigration policies, such as his first term’s family separations. They tend to reply by shrugging their shoulders and pointing at similar actions by Democratic leaders, saying: “Obama put kids in cages,” or “Obama separated families, too.”

Mr. Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy was distinct, separating children from asylum-seeking parents at the border as a spectacle to discourage migration. But Mr. Obama did in fact preside over widespread family separations through his mass deportations, which tore primary breadwinners and other parents from their U.S.-citizen children. In January 2021, I urged Mr. Biden in an essay in these pages to reunite the families separated when he was vice president, such as the family of Lucía Quiej, a Guatemalan mother who asked the Democratic candidates at a 2016 debate what they would do to reunify families like hers. “I will do everything I can to pass laws that would bring families back together,” Hillary Clinton pledged. “I will do everything that I can to unite your family,” Bernie Sanders said. But after Mr. Trump won, they treated his separations as a shocking new horror unique to Republicans. They acted as if families like Ms. Quiej’s didn’t exist.

The Democratic Party’s longstanding indifference to immigrants — except when wielded as a cudgel against Mr. Trump — worked symbiotically with the racism of some Republican leaders to enable the border’s violent encroachment into America. Mr. Miller, Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy, is a student of liberal hypocrisy. He grew up in the coastal city of Santa Monica, Calif., which prides itself on progressive values, even as working-class and immigrant residents have been pushed into overcrowded apartments or out of the city altogether amid rising rents. He saw and understood the performative nature of some Democrats’ compassion for immigrants. Years later, as Mr. Trump’s speechwriter, it was not hard for him to convince millions that Democrats defend immigrants only because they want cheap labor, or because they think it’ll win their votes.

Since Mr. Trump’s second inauguration, the Democratic Party leadership has largely fallen silent on immigration. Many Democrats blame the 2024 election outcome not on their selective outrage or insincerity, but on an excess of pro-immigrant zeal. The delusion would be comical if it weren’t so costly.

A month before Mr. Trump announced his first campaign in 2015, when I was a local immigration reporter, I covered the fifth anniversary of the killing of Mr. Hernandez Rojas. His widow, Maria Puga, was seeking accountability for the agents involved under Mr. Obama. She told me: “Nothing has been done. So much time has passed, and nothing has been done. Where is justice?”

Weeks later, I watched Mr. Trump announce his candidacy and felt a pit in my stomach. I couldn’t imagine our immigration system becoming more inhumane than it already was. As the reality TV star campaigned on promises of a bigger border crackdown, I traveled to the border and reported on the human remains scattered across the desert. I told the stories of the men behind Mr. Obama’s record-high deportations — the “felons, not families,” who in many cases had wives, children and homes and had committed only misdemeanors or the felony of illegal re-entry.

After being deported, many of those men ended up living in encampments along the Tijuana River canal, bearing tattoos of San Diego and other U.S. cities — symbols of the homes and families they’d been torn from. The Tijuana police raided the canal, arresting the men as perceived nuisances to American tourists and residents. “I’m illegal all over again here,” one of them told me. To escape the police, some of these men ran into an adjacent freeway, where at times they were struck and killed. When I learned of Montoya, the man who recently died on an L.A. freeway fleeing an immigration raid, I remembered the bloodstains on Tijuana’s freeway. The terrain has shifted — from a Mexican border town to a U.S. city — but the violence remains the same.

This year, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights — an autonomous human rights tribunal of the Organization of American States, made up of 34 independent nations in the Americas, including the United States — determined that U.S. agents tortured and killed Mr. Hernandez Rojas, and that border officials attempted to cover it up. The tribunal demanded a reopening of the criminal investigation and reparations for the family. But that seems unlikely. One of those alleged to be central players in the cover-up, Rodney Scott, is now the head of Customs and Border Protection. And most Democratic leaders remain silent on this case — just as they were under Mr. Obama.

The Southern Border Communities Coalition, a project of Alliance San Diego, has tracked fatal encounters with the Border Patrol since 2010, when Mr. Hernandez Rojas was killed. Their data shows something uncomfortable: Fatal encounters with Customs and Border Protection have tended to be higher under Democratic administrations than Republican ones. In their desperation to appear “tough on the border,” it’s possible that Democrats have at times had a stronger bite than Mr. Trump’s bark.

Now, many Democrats seem convinced that to regain voters’ trust, they have to sidestep the immigration issue, or channel the right’s antipathy. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has advocated cutting back on health care benefits for undocumented immigrants, and signed a budget in June that will bar them from new enrollment in the state’s Medicaid program.

As Democratic leaders like him appear to see it, their party’s failure isn’t inhumanity or incoherence, but rather an overabundance of compassion for the foreign-born. This delusion is a gift for the anti-immigrant movement, which uses the disconnectedness of Democrats to stoke resentment toward all liberals — and to bolster the false perception that immigrants are to blame for everything.

We need a reckoning with the structural abuses embedded in our immigration system, and with how elites in both parties play a role in sustaining them. Otherwise, the border will continue to coil inward like an ouroboros, devouring not just immigrant rights, but the rights of all but an elite few. That is the final shape of our immigration system as it stands.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/31/multimedia/31guerrero-thzc/26guerrero-thzc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 09:56:26.355579

Will they be prosecuted? - The Guardian,"William Christou, www.theguardian.com, william-christou",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/29/israel-war-crimes-gaza-us-military,"It is difficult to know the extent of direct US participation in Israeli military operations, as much of it is classified.
But whether US service members would ever actually face prosecution for alleged war crimes is doubtful.
Besides individual instances of US operational support for Israeli military operations in Gaza, US weapons transfers and sales have been critical to the war in Gaza.
Rights groups have argued that all of this military support should stop, in light of the growing instances of alleged war crimes.
“Not only is the US a party to the conflict but it could be liable for war crimes.","Human rights groups and activists who protest against continued US support for Israel have focused primarily on the flow of US weapons, warning that continuing to send weapons to a state which has been documented using them in probable war crimes makes the US complicit.

However, this week, Human Rights Watch (HRW) highlighted another facet of US military support for Israel: military cooperation and intelligence sharing.

Individual US military personnel who assist Israeli forces in committing war crimes could face criminal prosecution for their actions, the rights group said.

The US has made no secret of its operational support for Israel throughout its 22-month war in Gaza. The US has provided Israel with intelligence at various points during its military operations, and also embedded US military forces within Israeli operational planning.

The direct participation of US forces in Israel’s military activities in Gaza makes it a party to the conflict – and this would mean those individual US soldiers could be liable for any war crimes committed with their assistance, according to Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at HRW.

“It goes beyond complicity, the US has directly participated in hostilities. If you played a role in it and the Israeli forces carried out a war crime, you could still be liable for the war crime,” he said.

It is difficult to know the extent of direct US participation in Israeli military operations, as much of it is classified. But both the current and former administration have boasted about their operational support for Israel – at times in military operations which have questionable legality.

In October 2024, former US president Joe Biden said that US special operations personnel and members of the intelligence community helped Israel target Hamas leaders, including the former head of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar.

More recently, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters that the Trump administration was consulted by Israel before it resumed strikes on 18 March, killing more than 400 people.

A growing list of potential war crimes has not slowed US support for Israel. A strike on al-Nasser hospital in southern Gaza which killed 20 people, including five journalists, on Monday joins a long series of indiscriminate attacks killing civilians in Gaza.

Any US military personnel who provided the Israeli military with intelligence, or even material support in an operation that is against international humanitarian law, would have helped commit that war crime.

The US has previously come under criticism in similar cases. US help in refueling Saudi-led coalition aircraft in its war on Yemen drew outrage for its high civilian death toll. Even though it was not US pilots dropping bombs on Yemenis, their support enabled the coalition to continue bombarding the country.

In theory, US service members who assisted in war crimes could face criminal prosecution, potentially in the US, countries with universal jurisdiction such as Belgium and Germany, or the international criminal court (ICC).

“In principle, the Rome statute envisages that a person can be individually responsible for a crime under the jurisdiction of the Rome statute if he/she ‘aids, abets or otherwise assists in its commission or attempted commission,’” said Janina Dill, the co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict. The ICC has jurisdiction over crimes committed Gaza, even if the US is not a signatory to the Rome statute which created it, she explained.

But whether US service members would ever actually face prosecution for alleged war crimes is doubtful.

The current political climate in the US, and countries with universal jurisdiction like Germany, is largely supportive of the war in Gaza. The ICC is overstretched and the US has threatened the court’s members in the past when it contemplated opening an investigation into misconduct in Afghanistan.

Besides individual instances of US operational support for Israeli military operations in Gaza, US weapons transfers and sales have been critical to the war in Gaza. As of April, the US has $39.2bn in active foreign military sales to Israel – on top of the $4.17bn in arms transfers since October 2023.

The result is a complete package of US support to Israel’s war in Gaza. The US provides the weapons via sales and arms transfers, provides intelligence to help Israel aim the weapons, and provides political support to shield Israel on the international stage from growing global backlash against its conduct in Gaza.

Rights groups have argued that all of this military support should stop, in light of the growing instances of alleged war crimes.

“Not only is the US a party to the conflict but it could be liable for war crimes. The American public is paying for this and I don’t think they have a sense of what’s being done by their own country,” said Sarah Yager, Washington director at HRW.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25d6e33df62a26f8f2c0d9bf24b2b5225284947/440_0_4381_3507/master/4381.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c4cbbce88d672202fb26bea5daf69af",N,,2025-08-29 09:56:32.476453

But when those displaced seek safety here, they are dehumanised and branded as ‘illegal’. Sarri Bater from PPU Council explains the deep links between the arms trade, forced migration and UK immigration policy - and why we need to resist and dismantle this inhumane system.

A growing body of statistical and anecdotal evidence reveals that many refugees and asylum seekers are fleeing crises directly or indirectly linked to British foreign policy, commerce, and the arms industry. UK arms exports - valued at over £17 billion and frequently directed toward states with poor human rights records - have fuelled conflicts that drive mass displacement. Yet rather than recognising this responsibility, successive UK governments, embedded in discriminatory immigration rationalities, have pursued policies that criminalise those seeking refuge.

This punitive approach intensified in 2012 with the introduction of the 'hostile environment', a suite of immigration policies designed to make life so difficult for undocumented migrants that they would voluntarily leave. These policies extend border enforcement into everyday life, deputising landlords, employers, doctors and teachers as immigration enforcers. The result is a climate of surveillance, fear and exclusion.

In 2024, the top five countries of origin for people crossing in small boats were Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, Vietnam and Eritrea. These are nations shaped by complex legacies of conflict, often rooted in colonialism, Cold War politics, and the global arms economy - an economy in which the UK is a leading actor. Between 2013 and 2023, the UK licensed over £20 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, a country leading a coalition accused of war crimes in Yemen. British weapons, including aircraft and bombs, have been used in attacks on civilian infrastructure. Other export recipients include Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, and Turkey - countries with widely documented human rights violations.

This pattern is not incidental, it is systemic. The UK arms industry is deeply embedded in elite power networks and supported by government through export guarantees, defence partnerships, and diplomatic backing. Though marketed as supporting security and economic growth, these exports have devastating consequences: civilian deaths, displacement, trauma, and long-term instability.

Yet when survivors of these crises reach the UK, they are treated as threats. The Illegal Migration Act (2023) and the Rwanda Act (2024) classify many arrivals as ‘inadmissible,’ denying them the right to claim asylum. These laws authorise detention and deportation, turning survivors of violence into objects of suspicion and fear.

This logic reflects a colonial pattern: extract resources and capital, export violence, and then deny sanctuary to those displaced. The very systems that generate displacement now criminalise the displaced, branding them as ‘illegal’ or ‘invaders,’ rather than recognising them as survivors of global injustice. The Nationality and Borders Act (2022), Illegal Migration Act (2023) and Rwanda Act (2024) enshrine this approach in law, violating the spirit of the Refugee Convention by punishing those who arrive via irregular routes - often the only option available.

Beyond the Border - Wider Impacts on Society

The hostile environment doesn’t only harm those with direct experiences of migration, it undermines public safety and social trust more broadly. Investigations by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services have shown that police data-sharing with the Home Office deters victims and witnesses from reporting crimes, including domestic abuse. In response, organisations such as Liberty have called for a statutory ‘firewall’ to separate public services from immigration enforcement.

The ‘Right to Rent’ scheme has produced racial discrimination in housing. Research by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants found that even British citizens without passports have faced barriers due to racial profiling. In the health system, NHS charging policies and data-sharing have led to people avoiding necessary care, which threatens public health and exacerbates health inequities. The British Medical Association has condemned these policies for undermining disease control and patient care.

Public institutions - healthcare, education, housing, policing - have been co-opted into enforcing immigration control. The Windrush scandal revealed how lawful residents and British citizens were stripped of rights due to this enforcement-first culture. The result is a chilling effect on community cooperation and civic participation, undermining collective wellbeing.

Normalised rhetoric within politics and media which constructs immigration as a threat, of course fuels division and mistrust. Rhetoric and policies deeply damage social cohesion. Research from the British Future think tank shows that many UK adults rarely engage with people from different backgrounds.

The dehumanising discourse and threatened experiences takes a toll on mental health, particularly among ethnic minority communities. Scholars like Kalwant Bhopal have documented the psychological impact of systemic exclusion and xenophobic discourse. All this despite earlier reports - such as the Ouseley and Ritchie Reports - warning of the dangers of segregation in housing, education, and public life, and the ways this impairs social trust and integration. When public policy promotes exclusion instead of inclusion, it erodes the relationships that hold communities together.

Dismantling Systems of Harm

The dehumanising rationalisation of immigration and the ‘hostile environment' are not policy failures. This is a deliberate system rooted in empire, racial capitalism and militarised borders. It upholds a global order in which war and displacement are profitable for some and devastating for others. It criminalises the people most harmed by conflict, inequality, and ecological collapse, while shielding those who profit from them.

The UK’s immigration policies are shaped by histories of imperialism and present-day economic interests in militarism and security. They operate through racial hierarchies that decide who belongs and who is expendable. Refugees are punished for seeking safety, while the systems that forced them to flee go unchallenged.

We must confront the broader structures that produce the 'hostile environment' and the criminalisation of survivors: war economies, extractive capitalism, and racialised nationalism. Justice demands more than policy reform - it requires reparative action, sanctuary and solidarity with those displaced by systems of domination.

True safety is not built by militarising borders, but by investing in care, dignity and the protection of life. Justice means welcoming those we once displaced, shifting from punishment to repair and reimagining belonging as something shared, not conditional.",https://www.ppu.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/image/Stop_DSEI.png,N,,2025-08-29 09:56:39.293704

Jim Pillen’s plan to convert a state prison into an immigration detention facility.

State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln advised 13 progressive lawmakers who had requested that she schedule a public hearing to instead direct questions to the executive branch and the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office. Bosn said questions would be “most efficiently and effectively” be answered this way and be answered faster than what is needed to schedule a public hearing.

“Up to this point, the executive branch has been responsive to questions from the Legislature, and a public hearing is premature,” Bosn, a former prosecutor, wrote in a Thursday response letter.

Meanwhile, Nebraska Appleseed on Thursday delivered a petition to Gov. Jim Pillen’s office from more than 18,000 people in 386 Nebraska communities urging him to halt plans for the migrant detention center. The signatures were collected within the past week.

Pillen, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and other state officials on Aug. 19 announced that Nebraska would convert the state’s Work Ethic Camp in McCook from an approximate 200-bed facility aimed at helping prisoners prepare for life after incarceration into a nearly 300-bed detention center for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. State and federal officials have rebranded it as the “Cornhusker Clink.”

Director Rob Jeffreys of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services has said he wants the repurposed facility to be a “Midwest hub” for immigration enforcement. Pillen said earlier this week that the repurposed facility should be operational within the next 45 days.

What to know about Nebraska-ICE plan to retool McCook Work Ethic Camp

Legislative oversight

Back-and-forth legislative jockeying began Wednesday when State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, a progressive registered nonpartisan, and 12 Democratic lawmakers sent a list of questions to Bosn that the group said needed to be answered. In their letter, the senators suggested the answers should come in a public forum.

Other lawmakers signing the letter were State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Machaela Cavanaugh, Danielle Conrad, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Margo Juarez, Terrell McKinney, Dan Quick, Jane Raybould, Victor Rountree and Ashlei Spivey.

Lawmakers’ questions include the legality of Pillen entering a federal agreement to convert a state-run, legislatively defined prison into an ICE facility and the legality of Jeffreys’ department housing ICE detainees.

The Nebraska Constitution’s Article IV, Section 19, has since 1875 given the Legislature exclusive authority in the “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”

The Legislature this spring completed a nearly two-year effort to clarify and strengthen its legislative oversight of executive branch agencies, including the Nebraska prison system.

“The governor’s disregard for including the Legislature — the people’s branch — is deeply problematic,” the senators wrote Wednesday. “Nebraskans deserve answers.”

The Governor’s Office and Correctional Services Department have not yet addressed critics’ questions over state law and the Nebraska Constitution. Pillen has said he is stepping up to answer Trump’s call for governors and states to do their part to enforce federal immigration laws.

‘We aren’t going away’

Lawmakers will return for the 2026 legislative session in early January, when senators will likely introduce legislation dealing with the Work Ethic Camp. In Nebraska, all legislative proposals get a public hearing in the one-house, officially nonpartisan Legislature.

Among comments by petition signers:

“I say NO to opening a cruel and harmful ICE detainment camp anywhere in our state. This is inhumane.” — Lexington resident.

“Nebraskans do not want this. Not in our state, not anywhere. Do your job!” — Norfolk resident.

“NO using any prison in Nebraska to undermine our neighbors and friends. And absolutely…NO CORNHUSKER CLINK!!! That degrades every one of us!” — Tecumseh resident.

“As a McCook resident, I do not like seeing where Nebraska is headed with the new addition to WEC. This is not McCook. This is not Nebraska.” — McCook resident.

Darcy Tromanhauser, Appleseed’s immigrants and communities program director, said U.S. immigration laws have not been meaningfully updated in nearly 40 years. She said that has left families and neighbors targets while they try to navigate “outdated” immigration laws.

“Nebraskans want positive and updated immigration laws that support strong Nebraska communities, families, workforce needs, and our future — not punishment and military deployments,” Tromanhauser said.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, the lone Democratic senator on a new Legislative Oversight Committee, described the repurposed facility as an “internment camp” reminiscent of how the country detained Japanese Americans in the 1940s during World War II, “without any due process whatsoever.”

Hunt and Cavanaugh said Bosn’s decision not to host a public hearing was “disappointing but not surprising.” Hunt said lawmakers would “press for answers through every avenue,” even if Bosn and her committee refuse.

“The Legislature has a duty of oversight, and Nebraskans have a right to know what’s being done in their name and with their money,” Hunt said in a Thursday text. “We aren’t going away, and we won’t stop asking the questions the governor and his allies would rather ignore.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bosn-LB530-presser_AS_082525.jpeg,N,,2025-08-29 09:56:43.232042

The Seattle Times reported on Wednesday that two private contractor crews were targeted by immigration officials who requested their identification while the groups were working to contain the largest wildfire in Washington state.

“Trump has undercut our wildland firefighting abilities in more ways than one—from decimating the Forest Service and pushing out thousands of critical support staff, to now apparently detaining firefighters on the job,” Murray said in a Thursday statement.

“You risked your life out here to save the community,” one firefighter, who requested to remain unnamed, told the newspaper. “This is how they treat us.”

Flames from the fire, which scorched 9,000 acres, remained 87 percent uncontained as of Wednesday, local officials said.

“Here in the Pacific Northwest, wildfires can, and have, burned entire towns to the ground. We count on our brave firefighters, who put their lives on the line, to keep our communities safe—this new Republican policy to detain firefighters on the job is as immoral as it is dangerous,” Murray said of the contractors’ arrest.

‘Come back next year.’ ” Adonis went for his check-in on July 21 and was told to come back in August, his family said.","An Escondido family says a North County father was detained at the annual ICE check-in he’s regularly attended for more than 20 years.

Adonis Constantinovici fled Romania in 1990 at the age of 10, arriving as a refugee in Iowa, his family said. He got into trouble there, pleading guilty to multiple misdemeanor charges, including theft, public intoxication, possession of marijuana and more, beginning in 1999, according to a review of court records in Iowa.

Constantinovici was ordered removed in 2001, but, his family told NBC 7, Romania would not accept him.

“Supposedly he cannot go back to Romania because they have no record of his citizenship,” his father-in-law, Alan Giesecke, said Thursday.

Constantinovici’s father fled Romania first and his son joined him later with his mother and his sister Andromeda Constantinovici, who later enlisted in the military.

“She was so grateful for the fact that America had given her the opportunity to come to the United States that she wanted to pay America back,” Giesecke said. ""So she became a Marine.""

Andromeda wrote the federal government a letter in 2001, asking for dismissal of her brother's removal proceedings, detailing the danger they faced in Romania and on their journey to the U.S.

“He’s most regretful of his demeanor in the past,” Andromeda wrote. “He’s now horrified to go back to the country that at one point in time rejected him, belittled him, degraded him & tortured + verbally/physically abused him for believing in security & freedom.”

“I cannot allow my brother to die,” she added.

Shortly thereafter, Adonis's deportation was stayed and he moved to San Diego to be closer to his sister, who was stationed in the area, his family said. She later died unexpectedly from a brain aneurysm, which Adonis’s wife said still affects him to this day, even as he cares for his own family.

“When we met, we just clicked and became best friends,” Adonis's wife, Tiffany, said.

Tiffany is now a welder for the North County Transit District. They live in Escondido, where they are raising their son, who just started the sixth grade. She said her husband has been attending his ICE check-ins every year.

“I've gone with him before,"" Tiffany said. ""My son used to always go with him,. People were super-friendly. Everything was fine. In and out. No big deal. ‘Come back next year.’ ”

Adonis went for his check-in on July 21 and was told to come back in August, his family said. When he returned last week, he was taken into custody. A search of ICE’s detainee locator shows he remains at the Otay Mesa Detention Center.

ICE has not responded to questions or requests for comment on his case.

“I don’t think we’ve been apart this long since the day we met,” Tiffany said, through tears. “I don’t know when I’m going to see him again.”

“It seems ridiculous for him to be put into a prison, taken, uprooted from his family, his job,” Giesecke said. “And then our tax dollars are paying for this person in immigration who doesn't need to be there.”

“I think they're just trying to sweep up everybody they can in this process and not looking at the human factor of the lives they’re disrupting and tearing apart,” Giesecke continued.

Tiffany said she’s consulted with immigration attorneys, who have said he has to clear his record of an aggravated misdemeanor in Iowa before anything can be potentially done. She said they previously tried unsuccessfully to get a pardon.

Now, Tiffany said, they have no idea what ICE’s plan for Adonis is or even, specifically, why he was detained. She said Adonis relayed that the agents told him they had a warrant because he didn’t show up in July, but he had proof he did.

“I don't get any answers, and it seems like I can't get an attorney to help because he's in that deportable status, but he's always had that status,” Tiffany said. “So I don't know what to do.”

“We're just normal American citizens, trying to live the dream here in America,” Giesecke said. “I have a hard time enjoying life now because I feel when I'm sleeping in a comfortable bed, he's not.”

Tiffany said her husband never really engaged with the idea he could be deported to Romania, where he hasn’t been since he was 10.

“It's not something for him, he said, because he said that he's determined to be able to give us a life here,"" Tiffany said. ""And that this is where he’s — his home. I just thought that he would — we would — be old and he'd still be checking in.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/08/adonis-constantinovici.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-29 09:56:51.967652

More than half of the people U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested through July in D.C., Maryland and Virginia have no criminal conviction nor pending criminal charges, according to ICE arrest data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the News4 I-Team.

The finding reveals a stark shift in ICE enforcement actions — one the White House signaled shortly after Trump returned to office in January. The I-Team’s analysis of 2024 ICE arrest data found criminal convictions accounted for 57% of arrests in the region. In raw numbers, 2,103 convicted criminals were arrested by ICE last year, compared to 632 arrests of people with pending criminal charges and 936 on ""other"" immigration-related violations.

But after the inauguration, data show arrests for non-criminal immigration violations, such as overstaying a visa or working without authorization, sharply increased and now outpace those for criminal convictions.

Asked this week what message she has for D.C.’s immigrant community, Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was “devastated” by the fear many are feeling.

“I think you know very clearly how I feel about our nation needing comprehensive immigration reform, about the Congress establishing a pathway to citizenship for hardworking people who came to this country for a better life and who are not criminals — who are law-abiding,” she said. “[…] That’s the only way to deal with this fear or to deal with these agencies going after law-abiding people.”

Reached for comment about Bowser's remarks, White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told NBC News the federal surge has removed more than 1,000 “criminals” off D.C. streets, including “illegal aliens who have prior arrests for heinous crimes like assault or rape and are members of dangerous gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua.”

It’s unclear, however, how many of the arrests made during the ongoing federal surge this month are by ICE or for immigration-related reasons. Federal officials have not made that data public.

He is asked what happens if the government loses its attempt to keep the Bell Hotel in Epping open to asylum seekers.
Perhaps it is unsurprising then that rumours about potential tax raids, the chancellor's attempt to save money and Friday's asylum hotel ruling dominate.
He wrote: ""The Reform Council has always placed the principles of transparency, accountability, and free speech at the heart of our work.","Today, we're expecting to hear if the government's attempts to prevent the closure of the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, to asylum seekers will continue.

At 2pm today, Court of Appeal judges are expected to rule on whether the temporary injunction granted last week to stop the hotel's use by the Home Office will be overturned.

The government's argument has been framed by some as arguing that migrants' rights supersede those of Epping residents.

This is due to the Home Office lawyers saying that the requirement to prevent the destitution of asylum seekers under the European Convention on Human Rights - and so house them at The Bell - is of a higher legal importance than the planning laws used by the council to close the hotel.

The government also argued that the injunction could set a precedent that could see other appeals from different local authorities to close more hotels across the country.

Epping Forest District Council secured the initial ruling after arguing that housing migrants at The Bell changed its use without going through the requisite planning process.

Regardless of today's result, it will have a big impact on the government's policy towards the housing of asylum seekers.

With many protests having taken place recently outside hotels housing asylum seekers, pollsters at YouGov have done some research to find out how people feel about the demonstrations.

After asking 4,828 adults who live in Great Britain earlier this week, the researchers found that 54% of people think the protests are justified.

This compares to 34% thinking they are unjustified, and 11% not knowing.

As YouGov points out, there is a clear split down political lines, with Labour and Lib Dem voters more likely to say the protests are unjustified.

Stephen Kinnock is the minister speaking to us this morning.

He is asked what happens if the government loses its attempt to keep the Bell Hotel in Epping open to asylum seekers.

Kinnock says: ""We've got a whole range of options. Disused warehouse is disused office blocks, you know, disused military barracks.

""We are looking at every option that we have to manage the discharge.

""And it's really important that we do that and put those plans in place.

""But of course it's going to be much more effective if we're able to do that in a way where we're controlling the discharge from these hotels.

""I would simply say that I am as frustrated as every person in the country about the use of these hotels for asylum seekers. That is not what they are there for.""

Kinnock says it's not a question of ""if"" the government closes the hotels, but one of ""when"" and ""how"" they are closed.

He says a ""disorderly discharge from every hotel in the country"" would be worse than the current situation.

""So what we are doing is looking to appeal this injunction and simply because we're taking a pragmatic approach to how we want to manage the process, not because we believe that the hotel, per se, should stay open,"" he adds.

Former prime minister David Cameron once described himself as a ""modern, compassionate Conservative"".

That was in 2011, in an interview during the party's annual conference in Manchester, the early years of the coalition.

""Cameronism"" - or ""Cameroonism"", you take your pick - became the self-defined lens of conservatism that Cameron used during his six years in Number 10. Austerity, combined with policy to appeal to social liberals, such as equal marriage, and environmental ""responsibility - to the next generation"".

Fourteen years on from that interview, ""Badenochism"" has yet to truly define itself, but it's fair to say that the Conservatives of 2010 are different to those of 2025.

The party has shifted further to the right in recent years, with some jumping ship to join Reform UK. Both parties are now fighting for the soul of the British right.

This got Electoral Dysfunction listener Sean thinking - he sent in a question about whether defectors would be welcomed back to the Conservatives in the future. Co-host Ruth Davidson, who previously was leader of the Scottish Conservatives in Holyrood, had plenty of thoughts.

It's that time in the evening again - when tomorrow's front pages are released.

But Friday's papers will be the final set of weekday national newspapers before MPs return from recess on Monday.

Perhaps it is unsurprising then that rumours about potential tax raids, the chancellor's attempt to save money and Friday's asylum hotel ruling dominate.

Let's get into it:

Challenges for the chancellor

The FT splashes on ""fears"" from the City that the chancellor might target banks to help fill her financial black hole.

The front page reads: ""City fears mount over Reeves' tax raid on banks to help fill £20bn fiscal hole"".

The story is about whether Rachel Reeves might introduce a ""new bank levy"" or a surcharge on the sector's profits.

It also cites Angela Rayner, the deputy PM writing a memo to Reeves in May, urging her to hike the corporate rate for banks by 2%, and says a new report released by think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, will recommend a levy on banks.

The paper also warns that Labour is ""working hard to woo business executives"" ahead of its annual conference next month.

The FT isn't the only paper debating the public finances. The Daily Mail says the chairman of the supermarket, Asda, has accused Reeves of ""taxing everything in some way, shape or form"" - and warned that this is ""not particularly good for anybody"".

A splash on small boats

The Daily Express also has a story on the public finances, warning that Reeves' ""cruel"" winter fuel cut ""will save just £227m"".

But the paper splashes on a different story: ""French police 'won't go in sea' to stop boats"".

It cites a French union, which says the police don't ""want to go into the water"" as they lack equipment and orders on how to prevent people from crossing the Channel.

The Daily Mirror leads on a story about the royals, but includes an exclusive on its front page about the Archbishop of York criticising Reform UK's plan to tackle immigration as being ""beneath us as a nation"".

A British couple detained in Iran have been ""suddenly whisked"" to a courtroom in the country's capital, Tehran, their family have said.

Lindsay and Craig Foreman were arrested in January during a round-the-world motorbike trip and were later charged with espionage - allegations the couple deny.

Their son, Joe Bennett, said the family were informed the pair, from East Sussex, appeared in court in Tehran yesterday, with a ""state-appointed lawyer they only just met"".

""We cannot see how [this] could be considered to be a fair trial,"" he added.

Bennett's family said they are ""deeply concerned"" that they had no prior knowledge of the hearing being organised or carried out.

Earlier this month, the couple spoke to their family for the first time in seven months. They later said they were ""seriously worried"" about them after they were moved to one of Iran's ""harshest prisons"".

Through their adviser, Radd Seiger, the family have now requested a meeting with Foreign Secretary David Lammy to ensure efforts are made to secure the couple's return to the UK as urgently as possible.

Bennett said the latest court update has raised the family's concerns about their well-being.

He said the ambassador was due to meet Craig yesterday but that this didn't happen -and added it is more than three months since he was last seen.

The Foreign Office (FCDO) has warned all British and British-Iranian nationals not to travel to Iran due to a ""significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention"".

A spokesperson for the FCDO said: ""We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran. We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.

""We are providing them with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members.""

A council run by Reform UK has banned its councillors from speaking to the local newspaper, and has said it will not engage with ""any other media outlet"" that it views to be ""consistently misrepresenting"" its policies.

Cllr Mick Barton, the leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, has told Reform's 40 other councillors at the local authority not to give interviews or send press releases to Nottinghamshire Live, or its local democracy reporters (LDRs).

Barton has said the ban will only be lifted for emergencies, such as flooding.

It follows an escalating row between the newspaper and the council.

In a statement posted on the Reform UK Mansfield branch Facebook page today, Barton declared his boycott.

He wrote: ""The Reform Council has always placed the principles of transparency, accountability, and free speech at the heart of our work.

""We firmly believe that open dialogue is vital to a healthy democracy, and we welcome scrutiny that is conducted with fairness, balance, and integrity.

""However, we also have a duty to protect the credibility of our governance and the voices of those we represent.

""For this reason, we will not be engaging with Nottinghamshire Live or with any other media outlet we consider to be consistently misrepresenting our policies, actions, or intentions.

""Selective reporting, distortion, or omission undermines not only our Council but also the right of the public to accurate information.""

'It risks creating a vacuum of democracy'

Barton first cut the paper off from the council's communications on Tuesday, leading to criticism from the regional branch of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).

Chris Morley, from the NUJ, said: ""It's a key part of a local newspaper's role to hold decision makers to account. If reporters are barred from interviewing key councillors about those decisions, it risks creating a vacuum of democracy.

""We hope that Reform rethink this very sudden and rash decision, and continue to engage with all parts of the local media.""

Natalie Fahy, the paper's editor, said the party ""makes huge noises about respecting free speech"" and that the ""boycott flies in the face of all that"".

""When the press is not welcome, you know democracy itself is in danger,"" she added.

The leader of the Conservative opposition on the council has also condemned the decision.

But Barton has defended the move, saying that it is ""not about silencing journalism"" - and that ""our door is always open to honest debate and constructive criticism"".

He added that he would be ""no longer"" commenting on the issue.",https://e3.365dm.com/25/08/1600x900/skynews-bell-hotel-epping-asylum-seekers_7003494.jpg?20250828103804,N,,2025-08-29 03:57:27.733298

With the Texas Dream Act repealed, Mariel's tuition went from $11,000 — which she would pay with financial aid — to $22,500 without financial aid, which she also lost access to.
Mariel is one of the about 57,000 students enrolled in Texas public universities who were affected the lawsuit ending the Texas Dream Act.
Barbara Hines, the former director of the Texas Law School Immigration Clinic at UT Austin, helped push for the Texas Dream Act over 20 years ago.
Passage of the Texas Dream Act in 2001 was a bipartisan effort backed by Republican Gov.","Mariel and her mother are among those families dragging suitcases and carrying boxes as UT students return to campus the weekend before the first day of class.

The college senior is moving into an apartment for the first time. It's supposed to be exciting, but Mariel is a mixed bag of emotions.

Until a couple weeks ago, Mariel didn't know if she could go back to school.

In June, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Texas to end access to in-state tuition for students without legal status, arguing the Texas Dream Act discriminated against U.S. citizens. Within hours, the state conceded.

KUT News is using Mariel's first name only because of privacy concerns over her immigration status.

Mariel had been set to graduate from UT Austin next spring with two degrees, one in biology and another in Spanish. She would be a step closer to becoming a doctor.

""That was the one thing that I felt like I had, [it] was my education. That's the one thing I thought I had that would never be taken away from me,"" Mariel said. ""And for that to happen, it was like … I was crushed.""

After they heard the news, Mariel's family tried to stay positive. They thought maybe it would take a while for the state to eliminate the program. But in mid-July, university officials asked Mariel for proof of lawful status to keep paying in-state tuition.

""I'm not considered a Texas resident, so I have nothing,"" she said.

Mariel was born in Mexico but grew up in Texas. During her first three years of college, she paid in-state tuition and could get financial aid through the Texas Dream Act. She and her family paid about $13,000 a year for her dorm and meals.

Even that required a big effort, Mariel said. Her parents each worked two jobs. But her mom, Mireya, said it was worth it.

""We'd have to limit ourselves. But as long as it was for her education, so she could have a better life than us, then we didn't mind,"" she said. KUT is also using only her first name because of privacy concerns.

With the Texas Dream Act repealed, Mariel's tuition went from $11,000 — which she would pay with financial aid — to $22,500 without financial aid, which she also lost access to. With living expenses, Mariel's family would have to pay $29,500 a semester. And since she still had a year to go, that meant close to $59,000.

The annual income for the family of six is about $40,000.

Mariel is one of the about 57,000 students enrolled in Texas public universities who were affected the lawsuit ending the Texas Dream Act.

According to the organization Every Texan, in 2021, students without legal status were awarded $10.6 million in financial aid. But that same year, students without legal status paid $71 million in tuition and other fees.

Barbara Hines, the former director of the Texas Law School Immigration Clinic at UT Austin, helped push for the Texas Dream Act over 20 years ago. She said keeping these families from accessing in-state tuition has repercussions beyond higher education institutions.

""The business community supported the in-state tuition because it leads to a qualified workforce,"" she said. ""So this is really bad for the community.""

The Texas Immigration Council estimates the state could lose over $460 million in economic activity every year: $244.4 million in lost wages and $216.9 million in spending power.

The group said a college degree increases the earning potential by 57% for students without legal status.

""Why would you want to deny kids who have lived their entire lives the opportunity to go to college,"" Hines said.

Passage of the Texas Dream Act in 2001 was a bipartisan effort backed by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. Then, 22 other states and the District of Columbia followed Texas in making college more affordable for students without legal status.

Now, advocates worry that just as Texas set a precedent to pass the law, other sates may soon follow in taking away in-state tuition. So far, the federal administration has filed lawsuits against Kentucky, Minnesota and Oklahoma.

Immigrant groups, students and higher education institutions like Austin Community College, have tried fighting the decision in Texas courts. But so far their efforts have not been successful.

Mariel is the only child in her family who is not a U.S. citizen. She was brought to the U.S. when she was 14 months old. Her parents wanted her to have more opportunities. But now, Mireya said she sometimes feels guilty.

""I was the one that brought her here. She didn't decide to come. She's not guilty of anything,"" Mireya said. ""For her, this is her world.""

Two weeks before classes started, Mireya and her husband decided their daughter's dreams couldn't be taken away just like that. They had worked too hard to get where they are now. So, they took out a $15,000 loan from a family friend.

Advocates don't know how many students were unable to pay out-of-state tuition and had to drop out.

But even though she's back in school, Mariel has had to make some adjustments. She dropped her Spanish degree and is trying to finish her biology degree in the fall semester by taking eight classes.

""I have mixed feelings. I'm happy to be back and to be able to finish my degree,"" she said. ""But I feel a lot of guilt for making my parents pay that much.""

Her mother took on a third job cleaning offices. And her dad, who does landscaping, has also increased his work hours.

""I've told my husband, I won't be happy until my girl can achieve the dreams we have in mind,"" Mireya said. ""Until then, I won't be at peace.""

Mariel is hopeful things will change, and she'll be able to go to medical school in Texas. If not, she has considered getting her degree in Mexico — a country she hasn't been to in almost two decades.

She said the exact circumstances around the arrests are still unclear, but attorneys with the city’s Rapid Response Network are scrambling to meet with the detainees and gather more information.

At least seven migrants were detained during a morning ICE operation at an apartment complex in the area of 10th and Harrison streets, according to Milli Atkinson, director of the San Francisco Immigrant Legal Defense Program.

“I think it’s probably the largest single arrest in San Francisco that we’ve been able to confirm through rapid response,” Atkinson said.

A video posted to Reddit showed three men handcuffed on a sidewalk surrounded by masked agents. At least four others, not pictured in the video, were also detained, according to Atkinson.

She said the exact circumstances around the arrests are still unclear, but attorneys with the city’s Rapid Response Network are scrambling to meet with the detainees and gather more information.

“They have so many people that they’ve detained this morning that it’s going to be a couple hours before they’re processed and we know exactly what’s going to happen in those cases,” Atkinson said.

Atkinson encouraged anyone with information to call the Rapid Response Network’s 24-hour hotline.

Another six migrants were also arrested Thursday following hearings at the immigration court on Sansome Street, Atkinson confirmed.

“The courthouse arrests seem to align with their practice over the last two months of trying to get cases dismissed so they can take away people’s rights to apply for asylum and put them in expedited proceedings,” Atkinson said. “Those we’ve been seeing pretty consistently every week at the court.""

That funding was finally disbursed late last month after 10 Republican senators pleaded for the Trump administration to release the Congressionally appropriated funds.
Transgender children were often the focus of political attacks by Mr. Trump and his campaign surrogates during the election last year.
Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russian deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said the M.S.S.’s difficulties were predictable.
And over the weekend Mr. Trump and Mr. Moore got into a social media spat that began about crime in Baltimore.","That legislation also created a commission to come up with new base names. In 2022, the commission ordered West Point to take down all displays that “commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy.” A few weeks later, the portrait of General Lee with his slave in the background was placed in storage.

It was not clear how West Point could return General Lee’s portrait to the library without violating the law, which emerged from the protests that followed George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers in 2020.

“At West Point, the United States Military Academy is prepared to restore historical names, artifacts, and assets to their original form and place,” said Rebecca Hodson, the Army’s communications director. “Under this administration, we honor our history and learn from it — we don’t erase it.”

Both President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have been outspoken in their desire to restore Confederate names and monuments that were removed over the last five years. Mr. Hegseth recently called for returning a memorial to the Confederacy that was removed from Arlington National Cemetery at the recommendation of Congress. In a social media post this month, Mr. Hegseth said the Arlington statue “never should have been taken down by woke lemmings.”

Earlier this summer, Mr. Trump and Mr. Hegseth restored the names of Confederate generals to the Army’s bases, but with a twist seemingly designed to avoid running afoul of the 2020 law. Mr. Hegseth and his staff found obscure soldiers who served honorably and shared a last name with the Confederate generals.

Rather than simply reinstate the name of General Lee to an Army base in Virginia, the Pentagon honored Pvt. Fitz Lee, a Black soldier who fought in the Spanish-American War. In the case of Fort Bragg, named for Braxton Bragg, an incompetent Confederate general, Mr. Hegseth celebrated Pvt. Roland L. Bragg, who fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II.

The naming commission’s initial order to remove General Lee’s portrait was complicated by the general’s long history with the Army and the academy. General Lee graduated near the top of his West Point class and served as the academy’s superintendent from 1852 to 1855. His name and likeness were all over the campus.

The commission decided that portraits of General Lee in his blue Army uniform should remain. But the divisive painting of General Lee in his Confederate gray uniform was hauled away. The commission also recommended that West Point’s Lee Barracks, Lee Road, Lee Gate, Lee Housing Area and Lee Area Child Development Center all be renamed.

“We will conduct these actions with dignity and respect,” Lt. Gen. Steven W. Gilland, the academy’s superintendent, promised in 2022.

Originally hung in 1952, the portrait was part of a broader effort to rehabilitate General Lee’s image as a revered figure in the history of the academy. General Maxwell Taylor, a famous World War II general who went on to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke at West Point on the day the portrait was unveiled.

“Few fair-minded men can feel today that the issues which divided North and South in 1861 have any real meaning to our present generation,” he said. At the time the Army had just begun to desegregate, but Black people in the South still lived under the cruel strictures of Jim Crow laws.

In 2017, after violent protests in Charlottesville, Va., by white nationalists who opposed a plan to remove a statue of General Lee from a city park, some West Point alumni urged the academy to re-examine its relationship with the Confederate hero.

“There’s no way to excise Lee from the Academy’s history,” Andrew J. Bacevich, a retired colonel and West Point graduate, wrote in The American Conservative magazine. “That he should occupy a place of honor in the Long Gray Line is something of an obscenity, however.”

In recent years, Mr. Trump has argued that the decision to rename the bases stemmed from a broader effort to erase the country’s traditions and heritage. He also has praised General Lee “as the greatest strategist of them all,” and suggested that “except for Gettysburg” he would have won the Civil War.

“For months, numerous representatives of the same federal government that is responsible for prosecuting this case have publicly disparaged Mr. Abrego’s character and reputation,” the lawyers wrote. The officials, they added, had “distorted the events and evidence underpinning his case to the public; misrepresented his criminal record; disseminated false, irrelevant, and inflammatory claims; and expressed the opinion that he is guilty of the crimes charged.”

Mr. Abrego Garcia is facing charges in Nashville of having taken part in a criminal conspiracy to smuggle undocumented immigrants across the United States beginning in 2016. That case is separate from civil cases he has brought in Maryland challenging his wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March and his more recent possible expulsion to Uganda.

The gag order request on Thursday came after Mr. Trump and several of his aides had attacked Mr. Abrego Garcia in a variety of ways, tarring him as a wife beater, a pedophile, a member of the street gang MS-13 and a terrorist. Federal judges who have seen have the evidence against him in his criminal case have questioned the allegations of his gang ties as “fanciful” and have formally ruled that he is not a danger to the public.

By asking to limit the public assaults against their client, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers were effectively asking Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr., who is overseeing the case, to keep the matter focused on the facts and law.

That has not been how the Trump administration has handled the criminal case, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers said. In their motion for a gag order, they argued that almost from the moment their client sued the Trump administration in March for deporting him to El Salvador in violation of a court order, Trump officials “have vilified him in the media.”

That vilification, the lawyers said, has continued.

Just last week, for instance, when Mr. Abrego Garcia was freed from custody on the criminal charges he was facing in Tennessee, Ms. Noem, the homeland security secretary, issued a statement referring to him as an “MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser and child predator.”

That same day, the lawyers said, as Mr. Abrego Garcia was arrested again by federal immigration officials, a White House spokeswoman issued a similar statement, calling him “a criminal illegal alien, wife-beater and an MS13 gang member facing serious charges of human smuggling.”

Mr. Trump himself has joined in the attacks, falsely claiming this spring that Mr. Abrego Garcia had tattoos on his hand proving he was a member of MS-13.

This week, Mr. Trump declared that Mr. Abrego Garcia was an “animal” who had “beat the hell out of his wife,” a comment Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers noted in their motion. While it is true that Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife had sought orders of protection against him years ago, she never pressed charges and has since supported him vocally in his efforts to fight his criminal case and the efforts to re-deport him.

The “pièce de résistance,” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers added in the gag order request, was a cartoon of their client posted on the White House’s official X account, with “MS-13” written beneath it.

“The government’s ongoing barrage of prejudicial statements severely threaten — and perhaps have already irrevocably impaired — the ability to try this case at all — in any venue,” the lawyers wrote. “If the government is allowed to continue in this way, it will taint any conceivable jury pool by exposing the entire country to irrelevant, prejudicial, and false claims about Mr. Abrego.”

Craig Trainor, a top official in the department’s civil rights office, said in the statement that the school district was “not free to accept federal taxpayer funds and harm its students.” Denver Public Schools did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The move fulfills a campaign promise by President Trump, who vowed last year to pull funding from schools that recognize or provide protections for the hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren who identify as transgender or are questioning their gender identity. The Education Department has used similar threats to pressure schools to eliminate diversity programs.

The Trump administration had already withheld millions in federal funds from Denver Public Schools as part of a wider freezing of federal grants earlier this year. That funding was finally disbursed late last month after 10 Republican senators pleaded for the Trump administration to release the Congressionally appropriated funds.

Thursday’s move is the latest addition to Mr. Trump’s wide-reaching effort to restrict the rights of transgender people and undermine the idea that transgender identities are legitimate. Borrowing from Mr. Trump’s rhetoric, the Education Department portrayed transgender students in Denver as dangerous and predatory, asserting that the public schools had violated students’ civil rights by allowing transgender children who were born male “to invade sensitive female-only facilities.”

Those efforts have particularly focused on restricting the ability of transgender children to seek gender-related health care. The Justice Department has demanded confidential data from doctors and hospitals on children seeking transgender care. Other agencies, like the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, have threatened to pull federal funding as part of the administration’s pressure campaign to end all transition care for children.

Transgender children were often the focus of political attacks by Mr. Trump and his campaign surrogates during the election last year. Many of those attacks stoked fears that children were being indoctrinated by their schools and teachers into becoming transgender against the will of their parents.

The Trump campaign also sought to portray policies protecting transgender children in Democrat-governed states as a scheme to undermine parental rights and — in their most extreme forms — authorize the state to take custody of transgender children.

And on Wednesday, employees reeled from news that the agency’s new director, Susan Monarez, had been fired after less than a month on the job — followed by her announcement that she was refusing to leave.

On Thursday morning, three senior officials were escorted from the building after announcing on Wednesday that they would quit over Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s vaccine policies. Staff members gathered outside the C.D.C.’s gates to celebrate the leaders who had resigned.

“It’s brutal,” one employee said. “Everyone is in tears because we love and care about this agency so much.”

Mr. Kennedy has long held the agency in contempt, accusing its scientists of corruption and incompetence, and of hiding what he believes are links between some vaccines and autism.

He once compared immunizing children to practices in Nazi death camps.

“There’s a lot of trouble at C.D.C., and it’s going to require getting rid of some people over the long term in order for us to change the institutional culture,” Mr. Kennedy said at a news briefing on Thursday.

The president — who previously praised Dr. Monarez as “an incredible mother and public servant” — was silent.

But late Thursday afternoon, a senior administration official said, Mr. Kennedy’s deputy, Jim O’Neill, a former biotechnology executive, was installed as the C.D.C.’s acting director. The Washington Post first reported the news.

In interviews, about two dozen C.D.C. employees said that the mood inside the agency was bleak. Some blamed Mr. Kennedy for what they felt was a campaign waged against science.

Others said they were terrified for the future of the C.D.C. and the nation’s health. Some said they were in shock. All spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

“We’re scared for ourselves and for the country,” one said.

At one small group meeting Thursday morning, two people broke down in tears, according to an employee who was present. At another meeting, a senior leader who has always stayed calm under pressure was visibly shaking, another scientist said.

Several groups of employees were discussing striking before a colleague reminded them that strikes by federal workers were felonies punishable by a permanent ban from federal service.

Many employees had been skeptical of the ability of Dr. Monarez, an infectious disease expert, to defend the agency. After she refused to fire senior leaders or to rubber-stamp what she felt were unscientific vaccine policies, they changed their minds.

Staffers also were contending with fresh rumors that as many as 100 people will soon lose their jobs.

The C.D.C. had already weathered a downsizing in April, losing entire divisions and thousands of employees. (Some were later rehired.) Some C.D.C. leaders were placed on administrative leave.

Others left, saying they feared for the lives of Americans if Mr. Kennedy were to continue his course. “I can’t imagine who is going to stay at this point if they have any alternative,” one staff member said.

The latest blow arrived on Wednesday as three of the agency’s highest-profile officials resigned. The officials all dealt with vaccines in some way.

“These colleagues are the X-Men of public health — courageous, thoughtful, and dedicated to using the best research and policies to answer lifesaving questions,” said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, who served as director of the C.D.C.’s center for H.I.V. and sexually transmitted infections. He has been on administrative leave since April.

On Thursday afternoon, hundreds of C.D.C. employees, including some in full service uniforms, gathered outside the agency, cheering and clapping for the three officials who had quit.

Some carried signs saying “Save the C.D.C.” and thanking the officials for their service. Hundreds more watched online, reacting with heart emojis.

The officials who resigned were upset in particular over Mr. Kennedy’s attempts to undermine vaccines and cut back on those that Americans can access easily.

Dr. Daniel Jernigan, who led the center that oversees emerging diseases and vaccine safety, said he decided to resign before he was dismissed, in part hoping that doing so would allow Dr. Monarez to continue as the director.

“If we were the problem, and she had the opportunity to actually stay, removing us as a problem I think was something that we were willing to do,” he said.

The other officials who left on Thursday were Dr. Debra Houry, the agency’s chief medical officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who ran the center that oversees respiratory illnesses and issues vaccine recommendations. They said their concerns had escalated sharply after new members of the agency’s vaccine advisory panel said that they would revisit the childhood and adolescent vaccination schedules in the fall.

The panel may curtail access to several vaccines. “It really is transparent that these decisions have all been predestined,” Dr. Daskalakis said.

“The applicable statutory requirements could not be clearer: the director of Voice of America ‘may only be removed if such action has been approved by a majority vote’” of the board, Judge Lamberth wrote. He added: “There is no longer a question of whether the termination was unlawful.”

The ruling is a setback to President Trump and Kari Lake, a fierce Trump ally who has led efforts to close federally funded news networks, including Voice of America, which the White House has accused of left-wing bias and spreading “radical” and “anti-Trump” propaganda.

Mr. Abramowitz said in a statement that it was critical for the government to continue U.S.-supported news broadcasting to countries with authoritarian governments that suppress independent journalism and spread anti-American rhetoric.

He said he was gratified that Judge Lamberth found that Trump officials “must follow the law as Congress mandated,” and added that Voice of America’s programming “is so important for the security and influence of the United States.”

The administration’s lawyers had argued to Judge Lamberth that the law limiting the president’s authority to fire Mr. Abramowitz was an unconstitutional check on executive power. They also claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction, as Congress established the Merit Systems Protection Board for federal employment disputes. (Mr. Trump has also moved to fire members of the M.S.P.B.)

Ms. Lake said the administration planned to appeal the ruling, calling it “absurd.”

“Elections have consequences, and President Trump runs the executive branch,” she said in an email. “I have confidence that the Constitution will eventually be enforced.”

Trump officials had moved to fire Mr. Abramowitz on Aug. 1 after he refused to accept reassignment as a “chief management officer” of a Voice of America radio station in North Carolina that the network had used to provide shortwave radio broadcasts to Latin America and West Africa.

Voice of America had stopped broadcasting to those regions in March after Mr. Trump put nearly all of the organization’s employees on paid leave. In June, the administration had tried — and failed — to lay off nearly all 1,300 of Voice of America’s reporters and support staff.

The network now broadcasts in only four languages — Persian, Mandarin and two main languages in Afghanistan, Dari and Pashto. Before, it aired news programs in 49 languages to 360 million people every week, including in Russia, China and Iran.

V.O.A.’s programming remains drastically curtailed despite an April order from Judge Lamberth that the administration restore the network to “serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news.”

It is unlikely that the administration could quickly get consent from the advisory board to fire Mr. Abramowitz. A few days after his inauguration, President Trump fired six of the seven board members, leaving only Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who automatically serves because he heads the State Department. At least four members, excluding Mr. Rubio, are required for the board to vote. The six members besides Mr. Rubio must be confirmed by the Senate, and none has been replaced.

“The defendants do not even feign that their efforts to remove Abramowitz comply with that statutory requirement,” Judge Lamberth wrote on Thursday. “How could they, when the board has been without a quorum since January?”

Congress established the advisory board in 2020 after President Trump’s appointee to lead Voice of America’s parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, was accused of trying to turn federally funded news agencies into a mouthpiece for the administration by firing the leadership of the newsrooms.

A federal investigation later found that the appointee, Michael Pack, had grossly mismanaged the Agency for Global Media by sidelining executives he felt did not sufficiently support Mr. Trump.

The case of Mr. Dunn, who is 37 and a former Justice Department paralegal, captured the attention of much of Washington this month after a video of him hurling a submarine sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer on patrol with other federal agents near the corner of 14th and U Streets went viral. In the video, Mr. Dunn can be seen standing inches from the officer, calling him and his colleagues “fascists” and shouting, “I don’t want you in my city!”

The Trump administration brought its own sort of attention to the case after officials posted their own video of a large group of heavily armed law enforcement officers showing up at Mr. Dunn’s apartment to arrest him.

Prosecutors filed the misdemeanor charges in Federal District Court in Washington in a document known as an information, which was signed by one of the highest-ranking officials in the prosecutors’ office. The decision to back off on the more serious felony count came two days after they had gone into a grand jury seeking to indict Mr. Dunn on charges of felony assault and came out empty-handed.

It is all but unheard-of for prosecutors to fail to secure indictments, because they have almost complete control over the grand jury process. They are in charge of what evidence grand jurors hear, and defendants are not allowed to have their lawyers in the room as the evidence is presented.

Given the secrecy that typically surrounds grand juries, it was not immediately clear whether prosecutors had gone into a second grand jury and failed again to obtain an indictment. Under the law, prosecutors generally have 30 days from the moment a defendant is arrested to secure an indictment or file an information — a deadline that would have come in Mr. Dunn’s case in about two weeks.

His lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, declined to comment on charges being reduced.

Something similar took place in a separate case on Monday when prosecutors reduced to a misdemeanor the felony charge they had initially brought against a woman accused of assaulting an F.B.I. agent during a protest against immigration officials at the Washington jail last month.

In that case, prosecutors failed not just once, but three times, to obtain an indictment from grand jurors.

All of these developments were an indication that the residents of Washington who sit on grand juries have been looking with a measure of skepticism on efforts by federal prosecutors to bring harsh charges against people caught up in Mr. Trump’s surge of federal agents and National Guard troops onto the streets. Those efforts have resulted in a flurry of defendants being charged with federal crimes that would typically be handled at the local-court level, if they were filed at all.

Not long before the information was filed against Mr. Dunn, a federal magistrate judge sitting in a different case released from custody a man named Paul Bryant, a lawyer and West Point graduate, who had been arrested on Tuesday on charges of assaulting, resisting or impeding the police and threatening a federal official.

At a court hearing, the magistrate judge, Zia M. Faruqui, assailed prosecutors for having held Mr. Bryant behind bars in the first place as he awaited trial, saying that the government had a “close to zero” chance of proving that he was a danger to the community, according to WUSA9 News.

“This is perhaps one of the weakest requests for detention I have seen and something that, prior to two weeks ago, would have been unthinkable in this courthouse,” Judge Faruqui said.

Prosecutors say that on Sunday evening Mr. Bryant approached a group of National Guard members from Delaware and Ohio who were patrolling 14th Street and threatened to kill them. Before turning away, the prosecutors said, Mr. Bryant “threw his left shoulder” into the shoulder of one of the Guard members.

The United States and Panama presented a draft proposal to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that would create a “gang-suppression force” with a maximum of 5,550 uniformed personnel. The force would have arrest and detention powers and more military-grade capabilities and lethal equipment.

The plan would also mandate a U.N. office in Haiti to supply logistical and operational support, which would help provide more stable funding, a key issue that has hampered the current security mission.

It was unclear whether the new plan would replace the Kenyan officers or expand on the force already in Haiti. A spokesman for the Kenyan-led force did not return a request for comment.

The Haitian prime minister’s office and a spokeswoman for the presidential council that runs the country also did not respond to a request for comment.

Under the proposal, countries would donate forces and funding, and several countries, including Canada, El Salvador, the United States and Kenya, would provide “strategic direction” — including choosing the force’s commander.

Experts who reviewed a draft of the plan said it was still unclear what countries would help finance the force and contribute troops.

Haiti has been in the throes of a gang uprising for the past 18 months. Gangs have repeatedly attacked neighborhoods in and around the capital, Port-au-Prince, forcing more than 1.3 million people to flee their homes. At least 8,000 people have been killed in the last year and a half.

The Biden administration assembled a Multinational Security Support mission, known as the M.S.S., largely staffed by Kenyan police officers. But too few countries contributed additional personnel or money so, while the Kenyan officers had a few successes, the mission has largely done little to improve security and repel the gangs.

The multinational force had originally been envisioned to have 2,500 officers, but it reached only a little more than 1,000.

Its U.N. mandate will expire on Oct. 2, and the sense of urgency to decide its future is palpable.

The proposal would empower the new force to conduct operations on its own to neutralize gangs rather than simply play a support role for the Haitian National Police — a key difference, said Sophie Rutenbar, an expert on Haitian peacekeeping missions at the Brookings Institution.

“That in itself is an acknowledgment that the current approach is failing,” Ms. Rutenbar said.

Still, experts say the chances that the Security Council will approve the plan are slim since Russia and China would most likely veto it.

The U.S. proposal noted that, despite the multinational forces’ best efforts, “its modest resources and resultant capacities have not been able to keep pace with the dramatic expansion of the threat posed by gangs.”

Dorothy Shea, the acting U.S. ambassador to the U.N., thanked Kenya for stepping up, adding that the country’s officers had “prevented a complete collapse of the Haitian state.”

She urged members of the Security Council to approve the measure.

“This will ensure the mission has the tools at its disposal to take the fight to the gangs and ensure that the Haitian state can meet the foundational needs of its people,” Ms. Shea said.

The Trump administration has come under criticism for dragging its feet on Haiti, particularly since António Guterres, the U.N. secretary general, had made a similar proposal months ago, which never came before the Security Council for a vote.

Russian and Chinese representatives did not indicate on Thursday whether they would support the measure, and it was unclear when the Security Council would vote on it. Russia and China both argue that Haiti’s problems were created by Western meddling, and can be solved only by respecting and supporting homegrown solutions.

Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russian deputy ambassador to the United Nations, said the M.S.S.’s difficulties were predictable.

“We warned about all of this at the very beginning,” he said, “yet our warnings fell on deaf ears.”

In a clear recognition that the United Nations brought cholera to Haiti during its peacekeeping mission there that ended in 2017, causing an outbreak that resulted in nearly 10,000 deaths, the proposal specifically called for appropriate wastewater management to control the spread of waterborne diseases.

The city has long been a target of the Trump administration. In recent weeks, President Trump has called the city a “mess,” and immigration officials have clashed with city's leadership over Chicago’s status as a so-called sanctuary city, which generally refers to places that limit cooperation with agents looking to deport undocumented immigrants.

“Chicago still has a crime problem. So President Trump, again, made a promise to the American people he will make the country safe again,” said Tom Homan, Mr. Trump’s border czar. He said that there were “discussions” about using the base; he would not confirm how many people would be sent there.

Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago issued a blistering response to reports of the crackdown.

“This plan seems to be a rerun of their tactics in Los Angeles, where ICE agents were used as a pretext to justify further escalation by federal agents and National Guard troops,” he said in a statement. “We reject any attempts that put Chicagoans in danger as a means of furthering the president’s political ends.”

He said the city would “ensure that Chicagoans know their rights” and help families learn what to do if detained.

The plans for the operation also dovetail with Mr. Trump’s promise to take his crackdown on crime beyond Washington.

“I think Chicago will be our next, and then we’ll help with New York,” Mr. Trump said last week after he deployed hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington and his administration tried to make the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration the emergency police commissioner.

The Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement across the country, seeking to target and arrest people in jurisdictions that typically don’t work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including Los Angeles and Boston.

The aim is to carry out the mass deportation campaign promised by Mr. Trump during his campaign. Immigration officials have been under increasing pressure to make more arrests and deport a growing number of people.

The draft request for use of Naval Station Great Lakes near Chicago describes “30 days of operations in the Chicago Metropolitan area.” One U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that the Homeland Security Department had discussed using the base for immigration enforcement with the military.

Naval Station Great Lakes, a hub for recruit training, would provide “facilities, infrastructure and other logistical needs” if the Homeland Security Department’s request is granted, according to a Defense Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The request awaits review by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth.

A group of advance members from the homeland security team would arrive on Sep. 2, the document says. The request seeks space for 250 department personnel plus a “Tactical Operations Center” and an “Incident Command Post,” as well as bathrooms, laundry, parking for 140 vehicles and storage space for medical supplies and weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas.

Former ICE officials said the request indicated a significant operation targeting Chicago.

“This appears to be a large-scale sustained plan. Having a tactical operations center and incident command center indicates the type of preparation you would see in a military setting,” said Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former senior ICE official. “That this is separate from the police department and existing local ICE infrastructure looks like a massive surge operation” building on operations in Los Angeles and Washington.

A Homeland Security Department statement said that agency officials have been arresting and deporting “the worst of worst, including gang members, murderers, pedophiles and rapists that have terrorized American communities.”

Trump administration officials have hinted in recent days that an effort was on the way for Chicago. The Chicago Sun-Times reported on Wednesday about an email from a local Navy captain saying that homeland security officials would be coming to the base.

ICE has made at least 1,400 immigration arrests in Illinois since Trump took office through last month, a much lower rate per capita than in other immigrant heavy states like New York or Virginia.

More than a thousand of those arrests have been in the Chicago area, and because of Chicago’s noncooperation policy, almost 90 percent of the arrests in Illinois have been arrests in communities, known as at-large arrests, a similar share to last year. Arrests have almost doubled compared to the same period in 2024, but that is still a smaller increase than in most other states.

Eric Schmitt and Albert Sun contributed reporting.

“Instead of actually addressing crime, President Trump cut federal funding for law enforcement that states rely on and continues to politicize our military by trying to undermine the executive authority of governors as commanders in chief of their state’s National Guard,” the governors wrote.

“Whether it’s Illinois, Maryland and New York or another state tomorrow, the president’s threats and efforts to deploy a state’s National Guard without the request and consent of that state’s governor is an alarming abuse of power, ineffective, and undermines the mission of our service members,” they added. “This chaotic federal interference in our states’ National Guard must come to an end.”

Governors JB Pritzker of Illinois, Wes Moore of Maryland and Kathy Hochul of New York signed the statement, along with all but four of the nation’s Democratic governors — those in Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii and Minnesota. Their statement came a day after Mr. Trump said he has “the right to do anything I want to do” with the National Guard.

Blue state governors have been vocally pushing back on the idea that Mr. Trump could deploy troops into other cities as easily as he has done Washington, where he has cited a number of false or misleading crime statistics to justify taking over policing in the nation’s capital.

Earlier this week, Mr. Pritzker warned Mr. Trump to keep the military out of Chicago, pointedly noting during a news conference that of the 10 states with the highest homicide rates, eight are led by Republican governors. And over the weekend Mr. Trump and Mr. Moore got into a social media spat that began about crime in Baltimore.

And earlier Thursday, Gov. Maura Healey of Massachusetts called a veiled Trump administration threat to take control of Boston’s South Station — as it said it would with Union Station in Washington — “outrageous.”

While reading through his personal emails, he saw one from the White House that said his position had been “terminated, effective immediately.” Mr. Primus shared a copy of the email with The New York Times. No explanation or cause was given in the email.

By Thursday, his name and biography had been removed from the Surface Transportation Board website’s list of current board members. Mr. Primus said he would continue his work, and explore legal options if prevented from doing so.

“As far as I’m concerned, I haven’t received cause for the termination, so I don’t believe it to be valid,” Mr. Primus said. “It’s illegal. The president cannot remove me arbitrarily. There has to be a reason — there has to be cause.”

Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said in statement, “Robert Primus did not align with the president’s America First agenda, and was terminated from his position by the White House.” He added, “The administration intends to nominate new, more qualified members to the Surface Transportation Board in short order.”

Before joining the five-seat board, Mr. Primus served as a senior adviser to Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, and then as senior adviser and chief of staff to Representative Tony Cárdenas, a California Democrat. In the 1990s, he worked for four years at a lobbying firm, where he advised clients on transportation and national security matters. In 1999, he became the legislative director to former Representative Michael Capuano, a Massachusetts Democrat, eventually becoming his chief of staff.

The A.F.L.-C.I.O. Transportation Trades Department issued a statement on Thursday calling for a reversal of the firing.

Mr. Primus “has been a thoughtful leader in carrying forward the board’s mission to support an efficient, competitive and economically viable freight rail network that meets the needs of rail shippers,” the statement said.

“It would be a mistake to replace Mr. Primus with a member who caters only to powerful carriers that prioritize profits over the long-term success of the industry,” it added.

The Surface Transportation Board oversees freight rail and some other forms of transportation and is charged with reviewing the impact of rail mergers. In 2023, Mr. Primus was the dissenting vote in the merger of Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern.

Last month, Union Pacific said it had reached an agreement to buy Norfolk Southern for $85 billion. If the deal goes through, the network will span about 50,000 miles across 43 states and create the nation’s first coast-to-coast rail network. The deal needs approval from the Surface Transportation Board.

Mr. Primus would not comment on his position on the pending rail merger, saying he still considers himself a member of the board. He noted, however, that “you have to question, in terms of growth, in terms of what is needed for our national freight network and our supply chain, does that require further consolidation within the network?”

He said he did not know whether he had been removed for his views on consolidation in the rail industry.

“Was I let go because of my thoughts on that?” he asked, referring to his thoughts on growth. The reason for his termination was a matter of speculation, he said, because he was never given a cause. “Was it because I’m a Black male at the board? I was the first Black chairman.”

In May 2024, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appointed Mr. Primus as the board chair. He was replaced as chair after Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January but remained on the board as a member.

“The decision they’re making would have an adverse impact on the board and our freight rail network and on the supply chain,” Mr. Primus said of his removal. “To take an agency that has proven itself impartial and to be apolitical and now make it political, I think, threatens that integrity we’ve worked very hard at.”

Mr. Primus was removed days after Mr. Trump attempted to fire Lisa Cook, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board. Ms. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump on Thursday, arguing that she should retain her job because the White House had no authority to order the dismissal.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/28/multimedia/28trump-news-promo-9pm-lcbp/28trump-news-promo-9pm-lcbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 22:57:20.542100

Border czar Tom Homan told reporters Thursday that a large contingent of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents will be sent to Chicago as operations increase in four other cities that refuse to work with ICE.

“Operations are ramping up across the country but you are going to see a ramp up of operations in Chicago absolutely. You are going to see ramp up of operations in New York. You're going to see a ramp up of operations continue in LA, and you know, Portland, Seattle,” Homan said. “All these sanctuary cities that refuse to work with ICE, where we know public safety threats are being released every day into this country, especially those cities, we're going address that.""

Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said he met with Gov. Bob Ferguson, Attorney General Nick Brown and the major general of the Washington National Guard to discuss their response.

“This is clearly an example of illegal overreach and we are prepared to fight in the courts and use our voices very loudly,” Harrell said. “We don't get bullied here and we think this is an intimidation tactic. We are well versed in law and under the 10th amendment it is very clear. Those are the safeguards in place to prevent federal overreach.""

Advocates for immigrants and refugees are extremely concerned, though they said they expected this to come ever since Congress approved a massive funding increase of ICE operations.

“We've seen the tactics of ICE and they are ever-present everywhere. We know it's going to get worse after Labor Day,” said Soumyo Lahiri-Gupta, the immigration advocacy manager for “Seattle is being targeted solely because it is a welcoming city to so many who are just trying to find a new home.”

The announcement about the immigration crackdown follows Trump's increasing criticism of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker over crime in Chicago.

The Trump administration has said it will intervene to protect the public and is considering using a naval base in the Chicago area as an operations hub.

“We're going to take the assets we have and move them to problem areas like sanctuary cities where we know for a fact they are releasing public safety threats, illegal aliens, to the streets every day,” Homan said. “That's where we need to send the majority of the resources and that's where we're going.""

Harrell said overall crime is down in Seattle and many of the immigrant members of the community help the city to prosper.

“Many of them are paying their taxes. They are good residents and employees in our city,” Harrell said, adding “our crime rates are going down. Our homicide rates are going down. Shots fired are going down in Seattle, so this is not a lawless place as they try to describe it.""

Lahiri-Gupta said the threats of increased enforcement will have a further chilling effect on an already marginalized community.

“Our members at OneAmerica are really scared right now given the ever presence of ICE and this attack on our immigrant communities,” he said. “They're scared to take their kids to school, drive to the grocery store, or even go to work.""

Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss.

A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications.
At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18.
A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn't partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.","When President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation’s largest immigration detention complex, it didn’t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.

Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.

The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in West Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.

The secretive — and brisk — contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government’s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president's pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.

A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. “Private facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.

“The lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,” he said.

Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company’s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it's unclear whether he might have partners.

Army declines to release contract

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined for three weeks to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees. After this story was published Thursday, the department's spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, issued a statement that said “under President Trump’s leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.”

She said the Fort Bliss facility “will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals.”

Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.

The camp has drawn comparisons to “Alligator Alcatraz,” a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.

The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida’s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.

At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.

Three white tents, each about 810 feet long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by The Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.

Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Detention Watch, said the use of military bases hearkens back to World War II, when Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Army camps including Fort Bliss. She said military facilities are especially prone to abuse and neglect because families and loved ones have difficulty accessing them.

“Conditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,” Ghandehari said. “But when there’s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.”

Company will be responsible for security

A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.

The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it's classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.

Though Trump's administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities. For a firm to compete for such contracts, at least 51% of it must be owned by people belonging to a federally designated disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.

One of the losing bidders, Texas-based Gemini Tech Services, filed a protest challenging the award and the Army’s rushed construction timeline with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’ independent oversight arm that resolves such disputes.

Gemini alleges Acquisition Logistics lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work, according to a person familiar with the complaint who wasn't authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Acquisition Logistics' past jobs include repairing small boats for the Air Force, providing information technology support to the Defense Department and building temporary offices to aid with immigration enforcement, federal records show.

Gemini and its lawyer didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

A ruling by the GAO on whether to sustain, dismiss or require corrective action is not expected before November. A legal appeal is also pending with a U.S. federal court in Washington.

Schnell, the contracting lawyer, said Acquisitions Logistics may be working with a larger company. Geo Group Inc. and CoreCivic Corp., the nation’s biggest for-profit prison operators, have expressed interest in contracting with the Pentagon to house migrants.

In an earnings call this month, Geo Group CEO George Zoley said his company had teamed up with an established Pentagon contractor. Zoley didn't name the company, and Geo Group didn’t respond to repeated requests asking with whom it had partnered.

A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn't partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.

That's a violation of state promises.

Federal court documents obtained by KING 5 show that in May, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers conducted ""a query of Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) records"" specifically to identify and detain an undocumented man in Kirkland—a direct violation of agreements that prohibit using state data for immigration enforcement.

The DOL immediately revoked federal immigration agents' access to its licensing database after KING 5 provided evidence that ICE officers used the database for immigration enforcement.

The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project said the misuse extends beyond just licensing data, calling for scrutiny of health and other agency databases that may be inadvertently helping federal immigration enforcement.

""At the end of the day, this impacts us all,"" said Malou Chavez, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. ""We are asking for an audit of all systems because we have also seen that data shared with federal agencies for health purposes is always being used.""

The advocacy group isn't limiting its concerns to the Department of Licensing. Chavez said every state agency needs to prove they aren't unwittingly helping federal agents track down undocumented residents.

Sharp increase in federal database searches

KING 5's investigation last month uncovered that the DOL maintains data-sharing agreements with several Department of Homeland Security agencies, including ICE. While these agreements include promises that the information won't be used for immigration enforcement, federal searches of the database have spiked 188% since President Donald Trump's election in November.

When KING 5 first reported on these agreements in July, DOL officials assured the station that ICE wasn't misusing state data. But the federal court documents KING 5 provided showed otherwise.

""I'm very concerned because this is explicitly what the Department of Licensing said it wasn't doing. And now we see that it is,"" said University of Washington professor Angelina Godoy. ""I think the focus needs to be on the government agencies, to the extent that they are betraying the public trust, they need to be held accountable for that.""

State law prohibits immigration enforcement collaboration

The data sharing appears to violate the state's Keep Washington Working Act, which prohibits state agencies from sharing private information with federal authorities for immigration enforcement purposes. The 2019 law only allows such sharing when there's a judicial warrant or a criminal investigation unrelated to immigration.

""This is all happening to do what? What is the purpose? Are we getting criminals out of the country? Or are we just simply getting people of color? Is this racism?"" questioned State Sen. Lisa Wellman, D-Mercer Island, who sponsored the legislation. ""There's nothing that's telling me that we're really spending this time, energy, money and human capital simply to get people that are criminals out of this country.""

Officials promise action

After KING 5 provided evidence of the violations, the DOL and Governor Bob Ferguson's Office immediately shut down ICE's access to the state database.

Wellman, who contacted the licensing department following the initial July investigation, said she plans to follow up again.

""Of course I'm disappointed. I really do believe we need to be aware this is going on. Think twice and ask probing questions about how this data is going to be used,"" Wellman said. ""I'm going to follow up on this one with direct contact with the director of the department of licensing and I know the AG is as well.""

Thirty four of Oregon’s 36 county sheriffs signed a letter supporting the lawsuit against federal agencies and Gov. Tina Kotek, which asks a judge to weigh in on what the county described as conflicts between the state’s sanctuary law, public records law and federal law.

The Oregon State Sheriffs’ Association sent the letter to the county Wednesday, according to a statement from Marion County.

“We agree that there is a good deal of uncertainty in how these state and federal laws apply to local governments and sheriff’s offices in the state of Oregon, including those situations where a sheriff’s office or local government is served with an administrative subpoena,” the Oregon State Sheriffs Association letter said.

Sheriffs from Multnomah and Washington counties were the only Oregon sheriffs who did not sign the letter.

The county filed the lawsuit in Eugene U.S. District Court Aug. 18 regarding federal requests for information about people on county parole supervision.

The suit followed four administrative subpoenas U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office Aug. 1 for information about people on parole for offenses including rape, sexual abuse and kidnapping, according to the lawsuit.

The four people are alleged to be undocumented immigrants, a county statement said last week.

ICE requested each person’s home address, phone number, driver’s license number, country of origin, employer and information about the crimes they were convicted of.

Oregon’s sanctuary law prevents agencies from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement or sharing information about someone in their custody unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Government agencies can only cooperate with court-ordered subpoenas, and not administrative ones, like the subpoenas Marion County received.

Sanctuary law allows agencies to share public information with immigration authorities, but it bars sharing a person’s address, workplace, school or contact information unless other laws require it.

The county’s lawsuit claims that while state law restricts responding to subpoenas, federal law requires cooperation with federal subpoenas.

The association asked Marion County to request a detailed ruling from a federal judge that addresses all local agencies to help “ensure they are properly following federal, state and local laws.”

“Uncertainty from conflicting laws is bad for everyone,” Steve Elzinga, legal counsel for Marion County, said in a statement Thursday. “Marion County seeks legal clarity that will benefit all Oregonians, especially the dedicated law enforcement officers across our state who work hard to keep us safe and are currently stuck in the middle of conflicting state and federal laws.”

Since the county filed its lawsuit, local Democrats have denounced it.

“Despite four decades of legal precedent, through seven presidential administrations, Marion County taxpayers foot the bill for this disingenuous legal dispute in an attempt to reshape Oregon’s laws,” the Democratic Party of Marion County said on Facebook.

The group launched an effort to send letters to the Marion County Commission opposing the lawsuit. So far, over 600 letters have been sent online.

A consulting agency founded by former state Rep. Teresa Alonso Leon, a Woodburn Democrat, also posted a statement opposing the lawsuit.

The lawsuit could make a “loophole” allowing ICE administrative subpoenas to be treated like court-ordered ones, the agency said, and would “pretty much kill the sanctuary law.”

Two senior DHS officials confirmed the administration is preparing to expand immigration arrest operations mirroring the activations in Los Angeles in the spring.

The operations could start as soon as Sept. 5, the sources said.

The operations in Los Angeles included armored vehicles, tactical gear and weaponry. Sources say the same tactics are expected to be deployed in Chicago.

In June, Trump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles amid massive protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions there. At the time, Chicago officials said they were told the president was sending ICE tactical units to Chicago as well.

Chief of Staff Cristina Pacione-Zayas said at the time that the city had received word the tactical teams were given 48-hour notice to ""stand by and be ready to deploy.""

But those tactical units never materialized in the city. It was not immediately clear if this immigration operation is part of that apparently stunted immigration enforcement effort or a separate operation.

Sources said these plans are separate from President Trump's push in recent weeks to deploy the National Guard to Chicago to fight city crime. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have forcefully pushed back against those plans, with Pritzker warning Trump earlier this week, ""Mr. President, do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here, nor needed here.""

CBS News Chicago reported the Department of Homeland Security has been in talks with administrators at Naval Sation Great Lakes over infrastructure and logistical help for ICE staff assisting with immigration efforts in the Chicago area. It was not immediately clear if those discussions were prompted by planned escalations of immigration enforcement.

Gov. Pritzker said he has not been contacted by the Trump administration at all, nor has anyone in his administration.

""They're just looking to invade the city of Chicago, not coordinate with law enforcement,"" he said at an event Thursday.

Mayor Johnson said he has heard the reports in the news about the operation, but he nor his office has had any direct communication from the federal government.

The Department of Homeland Security released a statement, saying, ""President Trump has been clear: we are going to make our streets and cities safe again. Across the country, DHS law enforcement are arresting and removing the worst of worst including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists that have terrorized American communities. Under Secretary Noem, ICE and CBP are working overtime to deliver on the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe again.""

""This move is a chilling attempt to evade accountability, setting a terrible precedent that would only embolden dictators and autocrats and dangerously weaken respect for human rights at home and abroad.""

""The ACLU will continue to hold the Trump administration accountable for US human rights obligations and calls on Congress and state and local elected officials to join the fight to defend human dignity and everyone's basic rights and freedoms as promised by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,"" Dakwar added.

The Trump administration has faced mounting criticism since the February order, including after it missed an August 4 deadline to submit a national report in preparation for the next cycle of the UPR, set to take place in November.

After that deadline passed, the UPR Project at the United Kingdom's Birmingham City University and the UPR Academic Network released a joint statement noting that the US ""participated in its previous three cycles of UPR in 2010, 2015, and 2020 and engaged as a recommending UN member state from the UPR's inception in 2008 until recently.""

""The UPR is a nonconfrontational, cooperative mechanism which enables constructive dialogue between states on human rights. It is also a method of national self-reflection involving dialogue between civil society and the state,"" the signatories stressed, calling on the US to resume cooperation and other UN member states, UNHRC President Jürg Lauber, and the wider international community ""to take appropriate steps and measures"" encouraging the administration to do so.

The Lebanese Center for Human Rights (CLDH) reshared that statement on social media Thursday, declaring that the US position is ""threatening global human rights accountability and international dialogue,"" and this is a ""critical moment for human rights!""

The ACLU and CLDH comments came after Agence France-Presse confirmed the Trump administration's refusal to participate in the review, reporting on a Thursday letter that the US mission sent to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.

According to AFP:

Thursday's letter said that the UPR system, which was created after the establishment of the rights council in 2006, was meant to be ""based on objective and reliable information and conducted in a manner that ensures equal treatment"" of all countries.

""However, this is not the case today,"" it charged, adding that ""the United States objects to the politicization of human rights across the UN system, as well as the UN's unrelenting selective bias against Israel.""

It also accused the UN of ""ignoring human rights abuses in China, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela,"" which it said had ""tarnished the UPR process"" and other rights council mechanisms.

UNHRC spokesperson Pascal Sim told the news agency that ""since the inception of the UPR in 2008, the secretariat has occasionally received requests from states to postpone reviews,"" often due to national crises, and the council will discuss how to proceed on the US review when it meets for a month beginning September 8.

Thursday's letter and the backlash come after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his department put out an annual report on other nations' human rights conditions earlier this month—a day after a coalition of LGBTQ+ and human rights groups sued over the administration's delay in releasing the congressionally mandated publication.

Amanda Klasing, Amnesty International USA's national director of government relations and advocacy, said at the time that the report made ""clear that the Trump administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries."" Other critics highlighted Israel as an example of this.

Charles Blaha, a former State Department official who now serves as a senior adviser at DAWN, which advocates for democracy and human rights in the Middle East, called it ""functionally useless for Congress and the public "" and ""nothing more than a pro-Israel document.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61330618&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-08-29 00:56:21.929077

Earlier this week the government introduced legislation in Parliament to amend the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), including amendments allowing the removal of certain non-citizens to third countries without affording them procedural fairness.

Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay said: ‘These amendments strip away one of the most basic legal protections of a fair society: the right to be heard. They would allow the government to remove someone to a third country without giving them a meaningful opportunity to respond to a decision that has significant consequences for their life, safety, health and family.

‘Procedural fairness is a cornerstone of our legal system and a safeguard against error. Expressly removing it from decisions about third country transfers risks serious harm and sets a troubling precedent.

‘The proposed laws also seek to retrospectively validate relevant visa decisions, which may give rise to retrospective criminal liability. This raises significant concerns about the rule of law and requires careful scrutiny.

‘These changes must be carefully examined by the Parliament to ensure they do not undermine Australia’s human rights obligations. Fairness should never be optional.’

The amendments form part of the government’s ongoing response to recent High Court decisions, including the 2023 decision in NZYQ which found indefinite immigration detention to be unconstitutional. That ruling led to the release of hundreds of detainees from immigration detention who could not be deported to their country of origin, prompting a series of legislative changes including provisions which allow the government to pay a third country to accept non-citizens under “third country reception arrangements”.

‘These amendments need to be seen in their broader context,’ Commissioner Finlay said.

‘Rather than a patchwork of reactive responses, we need to ensure principled migration and asylum policies that maintain the integrity of Australia’s migration system while also upholding our human rights obligations.’",https://humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/migration%20act%20image_0.png,N,,2025-08-28 20:56:44.431148

No, Mr. President, no kings, no dictators, no need for the National Guard in Chicago.

We don’t need Trump’s troops on our streets. What we need is investment in our neighborhoods, food on our tables, health care for our families and safety, rooted in justice and opportunity, in our communities. In fact, thanks to the investment in community intervention initiatives, Chicago’s rate of violent crime has fallen 22% this year to date; homicides are down more than 33% and shootings are down 38%. Similar declines have been observed in other Democratic-led cities, such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C., that are also being threatened by Trump’s unlawful actions.

You can’t claim to protect people while stripping away the resources they rely on to survive.

Trump knows that. He knows there is no good reason to deploy the military inside the United States. For him, abusing the power of the National Guard is not about protecting public safety — it’s about control. It’s about threatening diverse, successful Democratic-led cities, like ours, that refuse to bow to authoritarianism.

Trump has repeatedly targeted cities that fight back against his power grabs and harmful, unconstitutional actions — whether by defending immigrants, protecting reproductive rights or standing against his disastrous economic policies like his tariffs. He has sought to use U.S. military power to retaliate against his political opposition, while creating a political spectacle that distracts from his unpopular and damaging policies.

We’ve seen this playbook employed before. Earlier this year, Donald Trump deployed the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles to clear peaceful protesters standing up for their neighbors, against his violent immigration raids. Their actions didn’t quell unrest or de-escalate the situation — they inflamed tensions, instigated confrontation and created opportunities for the administration to violate Americans’ constitutional First Amendment rights.

So when Trump talks about “restoring order” with National Guard troops, let’s call it what it is: a suppression of dissent. An expensive, unlawful political stunt. A distraction from failed policies. An attempt to instill fear in the communities that have every right to protest.

Chicago is next on his list. But we will not be intimidated.

Chicago is the city of labor strikes, sanctuary movements and civil rights. We are home to freedom fighters, organizers and community caregivers. We know how to take care of one another — and we know how to defend our rights and communities.

This is not just about one city. It is not about politics. It’s about who we are as a nation.

From day one, this White House has done its best to make Chicagoans poor, sick, scared and silent. Trump and his administration have cut the very programs that keep our communities safe and help us thrive. Under Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Justice Department froze and rescinded community violence prevention grants, undermining programs that were designed to interrupt cycles of gun violence in cities.

His 2025 budget proposes cutting $3 billion from Medicaid and reducing SNAP benefits for millions of working families, gutting access to health care and food for tens of thousands of Chicagoans. These aren’t luxuries; they are the foundation of public safety and community well-being. You can’t claim to protect people while stripping away the resources they rely on to survive.

Instead of stealing our resources and programs to provide trillions of taxpayer dollars to the ultrawealthy in tax breaks, Trump and his administration need to invest in our communities.

We see through the smoke and mirrors. The president’s harmful policies, combined with his use of fear-based propaganda and militarization, clearly reflect tactics commonly used by authoritarian regimes to silence dissent. But we will not be silenced nor will we bend the knee.

Combined with the National Guard deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., Trump’s threat against Chicago desensitizes us to federal overreach. He is eroding our constitutional boundaries and normalizing the abuse of our military power so that he can succeed where he failed his first term: to undermine our democratic institutions, perpetrate a coup and hold our country hostage.

This is not just about one city. It is not about politics. It’s about who we are as a nation. When armed troops are sent into American communities to suppress protests, target civil society leaders or facilitate the disappearances of our neighbors, that is not just a local issue — it strikes at the core of our democracy. We cannot let this continue.

Everyone in local government, in the business community, in civil society and in Congress — regardless of political affiliation — needs to show courage, recognize the threat to our people, our freedoms and our democracy, and condemn Trump’s unlawful overreach before it becomes normalized. We need to speak out, to push back and to define the very values that have been laid out by our Constitution: the right to free speech, peaceful assembly and protection from government overreach. If this continues, we risk eroding the very rights that define what it means to be American.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250828-donald-trump-Delia-Ramirez-vl-421p-8d2af6.jpg",N,,2025-08-28 19:56:41.084147

The Department of Homeland Security asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago, said Wednesday.

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Although details of the administration’s plans for Chicago are scarce, city leaders said Thursday that they are preparing for multiple possible scenarios, from troops assisting in immigration arrests to patrolling in the streets.

“We don’t want to raise any fears,” Police Superintendent Larry Snelling told reporters. “We don’t want to create any speculation around what’s going on.”

Chicago leaders want more communication

City leaders said Thursday that the White House hadn’t contacted them about its plans, and a spokesman for the Illinois National Guard said the base hadn’t received requests regarding a Chicago mobilization.

Mogle, the base spokesman, said no decisions had been made on the request, and that the base hadn’t received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

DHS did not confirm whether it had asked to use the base. But it said in a statement Thursday that it was working to make “our streets and cities safe again.”

Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have pushed back against a possible mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn’t want or need the military’s help. They are planning to sue.

City leaders said workers were circulating know-your-rights cards in neighborhoods with heavy immigrant populations, which offer tips on what to do in case of an encounter with an immigration agent. Other workers were checking in on Chicago’s homeless encampments and providing information about shelters since Trump has pushed to move homeless people far from Washington.

Snelling asked for more communication on plans involving law enforcement.

“To make sure that we’re not stoking fears through neighborhoods and we don’t have people running scared and it doesn’t create chaos on our streets, we’re willing to have those conversations,” Snelling said.

Many Chicagoans are on edge about the rumored deployment. Former President Barack Obama, who is from Chicago, weighed in Thursday, posting on X: “The erosion of basic principles like due process and the expanding use of our military on domestic soil puts the liberties of all Americans at risk, and should concern Democrats and Republicans alike.”

The politics of a deployment

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen and said there is no emergency in Chicago requiring military intervention. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

“What he’s trying to do is try to inflame something that will cause a problem that he can then point at,” the two-term governor said, referring to President Donald Trump.

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago’s long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump’s second inauguration.

Pritzker and Trump, who has zeroed-in on Democrat-led cities, have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network.

In recent days, the administration has been pointing out recent shootings in the city, including at Thursday’s White House press briefing when press secretary Karoline Leavitt listed crime statistics.

“This is JB Pritzker’s legacy, by the way,” she said.

Crime in Chicago

Violent crime has dropped significantly in Chicago in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem in parts of the city.

Chicago had a homicide rate of 21.7 per 100,000 residents in 2024, according to analysis of federal data by the Rochester Institute of Technology. Seven other major U.S. cities — St. Louis, New Orleans, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Indianapolis and Richmond, Virginia — had higher rates than Chicago.

Still, Chicago reported 573 homicides in 2024, the most of any U.S. city that year. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of this year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by more than 22% compared with the first half of 2024.

In Illinois there are roughly 10,000 members of the Illinois Army National Guard and 3,000 Air National Guard. They routinely mobilize at armories around the state, including nearly a dozen in Chicago and its suburbs. But they are state-owed property and if the federal government mobilizes the Guard without the governor’s blessing, the armories aren’t available for use.

The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the DOJ agency that oversees the nation’s immigration courts, announced the change on Wednesday in a final rule scheduled for publication in the Federal Register the following day.

A Major Expansion of Authority

Under the rule, EOIR’s director, with Bondi’s approval, can “designate or select any attorney to serve as a temporary immigration judge” for six-month renewable terms. That means the department can bypass earlier restrictions limiting temporary appointments to former immigration judges, certain administrative law judges, or Justice Department attorneys with at least a decade of immigration law experience.

The department argued those restrictions were “needlessly narrow” and hampered efforts to manage an immigration court backlog that peaked at more than 4 million cases earlier this year.

“Immigration law experience is not always a strong predictor of success as an IJ,” EOIR wrote in the rule, pointing to permanent judges hired without prior immigration law backgrounds who it says went on to become “exemplary” jurists.

Critics Warn of Politicization

The move has alarmed immigration advocates, who warn that it risks turning the courts into political instruments of the Trump administration’s mass deportation push.

“There is an attempt here to more quickly address the backlog of the immigration court and prioritize speed over justice,” Adriel Orozco, senior policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, told GovExec. He cautioned that temporary judges, subject to renewal every six months, would feel “an added incentive to ensure they are meeting the expectations of leadership.”

The DOJ dismissed such concerns in the rule, calling accusations that new hires would not be neutral arbiters “unsupported”.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

Court System Under Strain

The administration is framing the rule as a pragmatic response to a crisis. Even after Congress authorized EOIR to hire up to 800 permanent judges by 2028, the agency says the backlog is too large to be resolved through traditional hiring alone.

Still, critics note that DOJ itself has worsened the staffing crunch by firing dozens of judges or pressuring them to leave since Trump returned to office.

Terminology Rollback

The final rule also rescinds several changes made under the Biden administration, striking the terms “noncitizen” and “unaccompanied child” from DOJ regulations and restoring the statutory language of “alien” and “unaccompanied alien child”. The department said the newer terms created confusion and were inconsistent with congressional usage.

The Bigger Picture

For Trump and Bondi, the new authority could accelerate deportation cases at a moment when the White House is leaning heavily on mass removal as a signature policy. With the backlog still hovering near record highs, immigration advocates see the rule as less about efficiency and more about consolidating executive power over who decides the fate of migrants in the United States.

“This is about control,” said one immigration lawyer who reviewed the rule. “If you can put any lawyer you want on the bench, you can stack the courts with people who will deliver the outcomes you want.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!XyVn!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F843442e8-057d-4ee2-a1d3-31b276fce1d1_1500x1000.webp",N,,2025-08-28 18:56:32.653420

Lawmakers, led by the Democratic Socialist caucus, proposed a package of five bills to meet those goals at a press conference Thursday. Federal agents have used increasingly aggressive tactics to arrest immigrants as they seek to advance the Trump administration’s immigration agenda. In Wisconsin, ICE arrests have doubled under Trump with agents arresting an average of 85 people per month since January.

“The Trump administration is threatening our state’s fundamental values by commanding ICE and its agents to ignore due process, rip people from their communities and repeatedly violate basic human rights,” Rep. Darrin Madison (D-Milwaukee) said. The bills, he said, will implement “strong accountability measures so that all Wisconsinites, regardless of their background, are welcome and safe here.”

Rep. Sylvia Ortiz-Velez (D-Milwaukee) said that most of the people being detained by the Trump administration aren’t criminals. According to ABC News, a recent report found that since late May, people with no criminal convictions and no pending criminal charges have started to make up an increasing percentage of those arrested by ICE.

“The vast majority have been people who pose no public threat,” Ortiz-Velez said. “They are the essential workers that put food on our tables, milk the cows and keep the meat factories operating. They build our homes, and they’re our neighbors, and they’re our friends.”

Republicans, who hold majorities in the Senate and Assembly, would be necessary for the bills to advance.

Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) said it’s unlikely Republicans will sign on.

“We hope that our Republican colleagues will work with us on common-sense legislation, especially when the stakes are this high, but no, I don’t anticipate any support from our Republican legislative colleagues on this,” Clancy said.

Republicans introduced a bill earlier this year that would require local law enforcement to cooperate with ICE. It passed the Assembly in March.

One of the bills in the Democratic package is a measure introduced earlier this year by Ortiz-Velez to do the opposite by prohibiting cooperation of law enforcement with ICE

Another bill would require law enforcement officers to identify themselves when arresting someone including making their name and badge number visible, providing the authority for arrest or detention and prohibiting them from covering their face or wearing a disguise. Face coverings would be allowed if worn for safety or protection.

Violations would be a Class D felony and carry a penalty of maximum $100,000 fine.

Leaders of the Department of Homeland Security have said agents are covering their faces to protect themselves from doxing and threats, according to NPR.

“It’s not normal for any law enforcement officer, any agency to wear masks and hide their identity, nor is it safe,” Ortiz-Velez said. “No exception should be made here.”

One bill would prohibit state employees and police officers from aiding in the detention of someone if the person is being detained on the “sole basis that the individual is or is alleged to be not lawfully present in the United States.” The bill would also prohibit law enforcement agencies in Wisconsin from participating in 287(g) agreements.

The federal 287(g) program provides the opportunity for state and local law enforcement agencies to partner with ICE, allowing local officers to perform certain immigration-related duties, including identifying, processing and detaining removable immigrants in local jails.

According to the ACLU of Wisconsin, there are 13 counties in Wisconsin as of the end of July that formally participate in the program. Several have joined this year including Kewaunee, Outagamie, Washington, Waupaca, Winnebago and Wood.

“It’s important to remember as we’re here at the state capitol that Wisconsin has shown strong opposition to policies like 287(g),” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director and co-founder of Voces de la Frontera, a nonprofit immigrant rights organization.

Neumann-Ortiz noted that in 2016 thousands protested immigration legislation that Republicans were proposing at the time, and it ultimately failed.

“People can make the change,” Neumann-Ortiz said.

Another bill would prohibit state and local facilities from being used to hold detained immigrants and would prohibit funds from being used to establish new immigrant detention facilities. The bill’s co-author, Rep. Christian Phelps (D-Eau Claire), called it “the Communities, Not Cages” bill.

“Over the past eight months, my constituents have stopped me at events and contacted my office and shared personal stories of fear and horror that grows and comes with watching the Trump regime abduct, detain and deport people they perceive to be immigrants without due process without accountability, often without even showing their faces,” Phelps said. “Our constituents in every corner of the state wish for us to be welcoming, safe and humane — a state that invests in communities and not in cages.”

The final bill would establish a grant program run by the Department of Administration for community-based organizations in Wisconsin to support them in providing civil legal services to people and families in immigration matters.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PXL_20250828_150121367-2048x1152.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 18:56:41.968818

The notice states that the DOJ “declines to adopt any limitations on the number of extensions of the six-month periods or otherwise cap the length of a temporary appointment.” The EOIR conducts immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative hearings.

Md.) against all 15 judges in that same court, seeking to block a standing order issued by that court that gives every alien facing removal who files specified papers an automatic stay from deportation. On August 26, Judge Thomas T. Cullen of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia (W.D. Va.) issued an opinion dismissing that complaint — while offering a roadmap for DOJ to follow to achieve its goals.

“Standing Orders”

As the Committee on Rules and Practice of the Judicial Conference of the United States (the latter being “the national policymaking body for the federal courts”) has explained:

For years, judges and lawyers have been concerned about the proliferation of “standing orders[]” ... in the federal district courts. The term ""standing orders"" describes orders — including ""administrative orders"" or ""general orders"" — adopted by district courts or bankruptcy courts as district-wide or division-wide orders, without an opportunity for notice or public comment.

Those ”concerns” are that local standing orders undermine uniformity across the 94 federal district courts (“undermining consistency in areas where the national rules were meant to provide it and creating traps for the unwary and even for the wary”); they are promulgated without public input; they are hard to find; and that there are variations of such orders between different districts and even different judges.

In most law schools, students spend two semesters on the national rules of federal court procedure (and even then, only get a handle on them in practice), so you can imagine the complexity added by local rules — not that I expect anyone to have sympathy for lawyers.

Amended Standing Order 2025-01

The standing order in question is Amended Standing Order 2025-01, issued by the D. Md. on May 28.

It’s a slightly different version of a standing order (Standing Order 2025-01) issued by Chief Judge George L. Russell III on May 21 that I analyzed on May 27. There’s not much difference between the two orders, and the flaws I identified in the first iteration carried over to the amendment.

Most saliently, both enjoin and restrain DHS for two business days from removing any alien who properly files a petition for writ of habeas corpus and other information with the D. Md.

The court apparently doesn’t think that a two-day delay makes much difference, but then the judges on that court don’t have much experience in immigration, either.

That’s not a dig at the esteemed jurists on the D. Md.; as Judge Cullen notes in his first footnote in his opinion, “Congress has limited the authority of federal district courts to review immigration matters”, and consequently they rarely get into the nuts and bolts of the process.

In practice, however, DHS must have three things to physically remove an alien under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA): (1) an order of removal; (2) a travel document issued by the country of removal; and (3) a plane ticket or a seat on a chartered flight out of the United States.

Removal orders are evergreen (unless and until they are reopened, reversed, or rescinded), but travel documents are often issued for limited windows of time, plane tickets expire, and vacant seats on charters are a waste of taxpayer’s money.

In other words, this isn’t a simple issue of executive branch peevishness in response to a standing order that forces them to wait a few days.

“Judicial Review”

Nor is district court review necessary from a due process standpoint in any but the most exceptional cases.

That’s because Judge Cullen could not have been more correct in his initial footnote: Congress twice — in 1996 and again in 2005 — amended section 242 of the INA to cut the district courts out of the judicial review process for final orders of removal.

That’s not to say aliens under final orders aren’t entitled to seek judicial review of administrative removal orders. As I explained in May:

In section 106 of the REAL ID Act of 2005 ... Congress amended the judicial review provisions in section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to channel aliens’ challenges to final removal orders away from the district court to the U.S. Courts of Appeals.

Specifically, section 242(g) of the INA provides:

Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter. [Emphasis added.]

Section 242(a)(2) of the INA eliminates all court review of certain issues (like denials of some forms of discretionary relief), but otherwise section 242(b) allows aliens to file a “petition ... with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings” within 30 days to seek judicial review of their removal orders.

There are rare cases in which a district court could properly review an alien’s claim, but when it comes to most alien claims, Congress deliberately cut district courts out of the process entirely.

The “Rare Case” of Kilmar Abrego Garcia

Which brings me to the “rare case” of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

I will spare you the extensive legal analysis of that case (which you can find elsewhere), to note that in March, Abrego was (1) under a final order or removal; that (2) permitted DHS to remove him to any country other than El Salvador, from which an immigration judge in 2019 (in a truly convoluted order) granted him “statutory withholding of removal” under section 241(b)(3) of the INA.

Of course, Abrego was living in Maryland when DHS arrested him in March and summarily removed him to the one country it allegedly couldn’t, El Salvador.

DOJ later admitted it removed Abrego “in error”, but not until after Abrego’s family filed suit with the D. Md. to have him returned to the United States. The case was assigned to Judge Paula Xinis, and let’s just say that after she ordered the government to return Abrego, she wasn’t happy with either the speed or the manner with which the government complied with her order.

I have no insight into the deliberations that preceded the issuance of either of these standing orders, but it’s not much of a stretch to conclude Abrego’s case precipitated both.

Having handled immigration cases over the course of decades, I can tell you that while such erroneous deportations occur, they are few and far between. When aliens are erroneously deported, the State Department almost always locates the alien and DHS gives the alien a travel document back and allows the alien to return.

The government’s compliance with Judge Xinis’s return order in Abrego’s case was complicated by the fact that as soon as he landed in El Salvador, the Salvadoran government immediately took him into custody and put him in prison.

Usually, when aliens are deported home, they are admitted and hit the street. But that’s not what happened in Abrego’s case, and nowhere in any of the thousands of barrels of ink that has been spilled about his case has anyone asked why he was detained in El Salvador.

The popular consensus is that the Trump administration asked El Salvador to detain him, but respectfully, that doesn’t make any sense: So long as he’s not in this country, who cares where he goes or whether he’s free or detained abroad?

That suggests the Salvadoran government decided on its own to detain him, but regardless, Abrego’s return in accordance with Judge Xinis’s order required a diplomatic negotiation between Washington and San Salvador.

Still, the inescapable conclusion is that the D. Md. treated Abrego’s removal as the rule, not the wild exception that it was, which is why it issued these two standing orders.

Judge Cullen’s Order

Because all 15 judges on the D. Md. were defendants, they were all recused from hearing the case, and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit tapped Judge Cullen of the W.D. Va. to hear the matter.

His order dismissing the DOJ complaint is 37 pages long, but overly simplistically, it comes down to his conclusion that the judiciary and the executive are equal branches of government and there’s no mechanism in law or precedent that allows disputes between the two to be resolved in this manner.

But that’s not to say that his order is a ringing endorsement of the standing orders, either. As he explained:

According to the Executive, the standing orders are unlawful for three principal reasons. First, the Executive argues that they are inconsistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because they automatically afford injunctive relief only to a special class of litigants (i.e., removable aliens) without requiring those litigants to satisfy the prerequisites for this type of equitable relief. Second, the Executive contends that the standing orders are ultra vires — or beyond the power of the court — given the limited statutory authority of district courts to review immigration matters. Third, the Executive submits that, in issuing the orders, the District of Maryland violated well-established procedures for promulgating local rules of court.

Fair enough, as far as it goes.

The Proper Forum

He continued, noting that “If these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,” while clarifying that the proper forum was not the D. Md. but rather the appellate Fourth Circuit, either on a direct appeal of one of the habeas cases the orders focus on or “by petitioning the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify local court rules”.

The statute governing federal courts’ rulemaking power, 28 U.S.C. § 2071, states at clause (c)(1) that, “A rule of a district court ... shall remain in effect unless modified or abrogated by the judicial council of the relevant circuit”, while 28 U.S.C. § 332(d)(4) gives those judicial councils authority to “periodically review” rules established by the district courts and abrogate any rule “found inconsistent”.

Of those two choices, a direct appeal seems to me to be preferable as it would get these standing orders to the Supreme Court for review most expeditiously. Whether DOJ listens to Judge Cullen, however, is an open question.

A “More Confrontational Path”

Finally, the judge complains that instead of either of those options, DOJ “chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely”, adding in a footnote:

Indeed, over the past several months, principal officers of the Executive (and their spokespersons) have described federal district judges across the country as “left-wing,” “liberal,” “activists,” “radical,” “politically minded,” “rogue,” “unhinged,” “outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional,” “[c]rooked,” and worse. Although some tension between the coordinate branches of government is a hallmark of our constitutional system, this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.

It would be ideal if the three branches of our federal government treated one another with the highest degree of respect and courtesy, but let’s not forget that President Jefferson and Chief Justice Marshall were not only the heads of their respective branches but also second cousins, and yet fought like cats and dogs.

And while castigating the executive branch, perhaps Judge Cullen should look at how Trump’s been treated by his own circuit.

In writing for the majority of the Fourth Circuit its June 2017 opinion in Trump. v. International Refugee Assistance Project, then-Chief Judge Robert Gregory complained that Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 13780 (the second so-called “travel ban”) “in context drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination”, while his colleague, Judge Andrew Wynn, in concurrence described the EO as “naked invidious discrimination against Muslims”.

That language prompted Judge Paul Niemeyer, writing for himself and two other judges in dissent to take Judges Gregory and Wynn to task, asserting their “opinions ... betray an object beyond a disciplined analysis” and that their “statements flatly mischaracterize an order that undisputedly contains no facial reference to religion”.

“Politics Ain’t Beanbag”

As the saying goes, “politics ain’t beanbag”, and the more judges delve into political questions reserved to the other branches, the more likely they are to learn that truism.

For now, Maryland U.S. district court judges can keep blocking removal orders despite limits on their jurisdiction in section 242 of the INA, but maybe it’s time for the Supreme Court to revisit the language of the act and keep the courts in their proper lane.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/judge-gavel-warrant-social.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 19:57:41.904974

Panic stricken Governor Pritzker says that crime is under control, when in fact it is just the opposite.","The Trump administration plans to intensify immigration enforcement in five major U.S. cities, including Chicago, where federal officials are considering using a naval base as an operations hub.

Border czar Tom Homan told reporters Thursday that a ""large contingent"" of resources will be sent to Chicago. He also said there will be a ""ramp up"" of operations in sanctuary jurisdictions that ""refuse to work with ICE.""

""You can see a ramp up of operations in Chicago, absolutely,"" Homan said. ""You're going to see a ramp up of operations in New York. You're going to see a ramp up of operations continue in L.A. and, you know, Portland, Seattle.""

Why It Matters

The announcement follows President Donald Trump's renewed criticism of Illinois Governor JB Pritzker over crime in Chicago, suggesting the city's leadership is failing to protect residents. Trump said the federal government stands ready to intervene, while Homan confirmed ongoing discussions about expanding ICE's footprint near the city.

""Governor Pritzker had 6 murders in Chicago this weekend. 20 people were shot. But he doesn't want to ask me for help. Can this be possible? The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren't capable of doing. STAY TUNED!!!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Thursday.

What To Know

Officials at Naval Station Great Lakes said they received a request from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeking ""limited support"" for ICE, The Washington Post reported.

If the request is granted, the base would provide ""facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs,"" defense officials said in a statement obtained by the outlet.

Pritzker told reporters on Wednesday that he was not contacted about the request.

""They don't seem to want to communicate at all. And that's odd because it sounds like what they're trying to do is march right over local police,"" Pritzker said.

What Is a Sanctuary City?

Earlier this month, the Department of Justice (DOJ) described sanctuary jurisdictions as ""states, cities, and counties identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

What Cities Are Considered Sanctuary Cities?

The DOJ published a list of sanctuary jurisdictions earlier this month. The cities listed were Albuquerque, New Mexico; Berkeley, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; East Lansing, Michigan; Hoboken, New Jersey; Jersey City, New Jersey; Los Angeles, California; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York City, New York; Newark, New Jersey; Paterson, New Jersey; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Portland, Oregon; Rochester, New York; Seattle, Washington; and San Francisco City, California.

What People Are Saying

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker told reporters: ""You know, we used to hear that the president of the United States supported local police. We support local police. But now it appears that he wants to ignore them all together and just do whatever he has a whim about on that day.""

President Donald Trump, on Truth Social: ""A really DEADLY weekend in Chicago. 6 DEAD, 27 HURT IN CRIME SPREES ALLOVER THE CITY. Panic stricken Governor Pritzker says that crime is under control, when in fact it is just the opposite. He is an incompetent Governor who should call me for HELP. Mayor Johnson is no better. Make Chicago Great Again!""

Border czar Tom Homan told reporters: ""We're going to take the assets we have and move them to problem areas like sanctuary cities, where we know for a fact they're releasing public safety threat illegal aliens to the streets every day.""

What Happens Next

No decision has been made yet on the request from the DHS regarding Naval Station Great Lakes, The Washington Post reported.

I write with deep gratitude for your solidarity during my recent detention. In moments when my freedom was stripped from me, your support reminded me that I was not alone, that my voice still carried, and that the struggle for justice is larger than any one of us.

For 104 days, I was unlawfully detained by U.S. immigration authorities in rural Louisiana and separated from my family and my community for speaking out against the genocide of my people. The support of communities from around the world is what kept me going. You kept me going. Thank you for raising your voices when I was detained and separated from my family.

My release is not the end of this story. Many others remain behind bars – immigrants, refugees, and activists who, like me, were torn from their families by the Trump administration’s cruel machinery of suppression, detention, and deportation. Their names are less visible, their stories less told, but their suffering is no less real. I ask that we continue to hold them in our collective conscience and fight for their freedom.

My detention was political. It was an attempt to silence me for speaking openly about Palestinian rights, for refusing to let the daily reality of occupation, apartheid, forced starvation and mass killing be normalized. But repression does not weaken conviction, it strengthens it. I will not back down. The fight for Palestinian liberation is inseparable from the global struggle for justice, dignity, and human rights that Amnesty International has long championed.

Thank you for standing with me, not only in my personal ordeal but in the broader struggle that connects all of us. Though powerful forces are trying to discredit, dehumanize and erase us, we must continue our work together.

Many Palestinians across the occupied territories and across the world are still suffering. Families are still struggling to survive. Children are still being starved. Lives are still being destroyed.

So please, stay committed to your important activism. Keep raising your voices. Keep demanding justice and accountability. Keep fighting — not just for me, but for all of us. opens in a new tab

Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails.
At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18.
A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn't partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.","WASHINGTON (AP) — When President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation’s largest immigration detention complex, it didn’t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.

Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.

The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in West Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.

The secretive — and brisk — contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government’s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president's pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.

A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. “Private facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.

“The lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,” he said.

Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company’s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it's unclear whether he might have partners.

Army declines to release contract

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined for three weeks to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees. After this story was published Thursday, the department's spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, issued a statement that said “under President Donald Trump’s leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.”

She said the Fort Bliss facility “will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals.”

Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.

The camp has drawn comparisons to “Alligator Alcatraz,” a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.

The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida’s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.

At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration detention. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.

Three white tents, each about 810 feet (250 meters) long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by The Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.

Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Detention Watch, said the use of military bases hearkens back to World War II, when Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Army camps including Fort Bliss. She said military facilities are especially prone to abuse and neglect because families and loved ones have difficulty accessing them.

“Conditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,” Ghandehari said. “But when there’s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.”

Company will be responsible for security

A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.

The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it's classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.

Though Trump's administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities. For a firm to compete for such contracts, at least 51% of it must be owned by people belonging to a federally designated disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.

One of the losing bidders, Texas-based Gemini Tech Services, filed a protest challenging the award and the Army’s rushed construction timeline with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’ independent oversight arm that resolves such disputes.

Gemini alleges Acquisition Logistics lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work, according to a person familiar with the complaint who wasn't authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Acquisition Logistics' past jobs include repairing small boats for the Air Force, providing information technology support to the Defense Department and building temporary offices to aid with immigration enforcement, federal records show.

Gemini and its lawyer didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

A ruling by the GAO on whether to sustain, dismiss or require corrective action is not expected before November. A legal appeal is also pending with a U.S. federal court in Washington.

A judge in that case denied a motion that sought to freeze construction at the site at a sealed hearing Thursday.

Schnell, the contracting lawyer, said Acquisitions Logistics may be working with a larger company. Geo Group Inc. and CoreCivic Corp., the nation’s biggest for-profit prison operators, have expressed interest in contracting with the Pentagon to house migrants.

In an earnings call this month, Geo Group Executive Chairman George Zoley said his company had teamed up with an established Pentagon contractor. Zoley didn't name the company, and Geo Group didn’t respond to repeated requests asking with whom it had partnered.

A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn't partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.

Associated Press

SEATTLE (AP) — Immigration advocates gather like clockwork outside Seattle’s King County International Airport to witness deportation flights and spread word of where they are going and how many people are aboard. Until recently, they could keep track of the flights using publicly accessible websites.

But the monitors and others say airlines are now using dummy call signs for deportation flights and are blocking the planes’ tail numbers from tracking websites, even as the number of deportation flights hits record highs under President Donald Trump. The changes forced them to find other ways to follow the flights, including by sharing information with other groups and using data from an open-source exchange that tracks aircraft transmissions.

Their work helps people locate loved ones who are deported in the absence of information from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which rarely discloses flights. News organizations have used such flight tracking in reporting.

Tom Cartwright, a retired J.P. Morgan financial officer turned immigration advocate, tracked 1,214 deportation-related flights in July—the highest level since he started watching in January 2020. About 80% are operated by three airlines: GlobalX, Eastern Air Express and Avelo Airlines. They carry immigrants to other airports to be transferred to overseas flights or take them across the border, mostly to Central American countries and Mexico.

Cartwright tracked 5,962 flights from the start of Trump’s second term through July, a 41% increase of 1,721 over the same period in 2024. Those figures including information from major deportation airports but not smaller ones like King County International Airport, also known as Boeing Field. Cartwright’s figures include 68 military deportation flights since January—18 in July alone. Most have gone to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

The work became so demanding that Cartwright, 71, and his group, Witness at the Border, turned over the job this month to Human Rights First, which dubbed its project “ICE Flight Monitor.”

“His work brings essential transparency to U.S. government actions impacting thousands of lives and stands as a powerful example of citizen-driven accountability in defense of human rights and democracy,” Uzrz Zeya, Human Rights First’s chief executive officer, said.

The airlines did not respond to multiple email requests for comment. ICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which would not confirm any security measures it has taken.

La Resistencia, a Seattle-area nonprofit immigration rights group, has monitored 59 flights at Boeing Field and five at the Yakima airport in 2025, surpassing its 2024 total of 42.

Not all are deportation flights. Many are headed to or from immigration detention centers or to airports near the border. La Resistencia counted 1,023 immigrants brought in to go to the ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington, and 2,279 flown out, often to states on the U.S.-Mexico border.

“ICE is doing everything in its power to make it as hard as possible to differentiate their contractors’ government activities from other commercial endeavors,” organizer Guadalupe Gonzalez told The Associated Press.

Airlines can legally block data

The Federal Aviation Administration allows carriers to block data like tail numbers from public flight tracking websites under the Limiting Aircraft Data Displayed program, or LADD, said Ian Petchenik, a spokesman for FlightRadar24.

“Tail numbers are like VIN numbers on cars,” Gonzalez said.

Planes with blocked tail numbers no longer appear on websites like FlightRadar24 or FlightAware. The tracker page identifies these them as “N/A – Not Available” as they move across the map and when they are on the tarmac. Destinations and arrival times aren’t listed.

Carriers have occasionally used LADD for things like presidential campaigns, but in March, FlightRadar24 received LADD notices for more than a dozen aircraft, Petchenik said. It was unusual to see that many aircraft across multiple airlines added to the blocking list, he said. The blocked planes were often used for ICE deportations and transfers, he said.

Of the 94 ICE Air contractor planes that La Resistencia was tracking nationwide, 40 have been unlisted, Gonzalez said.

Similar things happened with the call signs airlines use to identify flights in the air, Gonzalez said.

Airlines use a combination of letters in their company name and numbers to identify their planes. GlobalX uses GXA, for example. But in the past few months, the ICE carriers have changed their regular call signs, making it more difficult to locate their immigration activates, he said.

Cameras at Boeing Field help volunteers track flights

King County International Airport is one of the few sites in the country where passengers can be seen getting off and on the planes, thanks to county-operated cameras. Volunteers gather each time a flight arrives to count each person and note whether they struggle on the stairs or appear to have health issues.

ICE Air operations at Boeing Field started in 2011. The county set up cameras on the tarmac in 2023 after King County Executive Dow Constantine, having unsuccessfully tried to stop the ICE flights, issued an order requiring the county to track them at the airport. The county publishes monthly statistics on them.

The cameras record immigrants arriving on buses, being searched and being led up the stairs onto the planes. On Tuesday, one man who was hunched over shuffled down the bus’ stairs and across the tarmac using a cane, then an officer helped him climb onto the plane, one step at a time.

Detainees must navigate the plane’s stairway with their ankles chained together. Their wrists are also chained, and those cuffs are connected to a chain around their waist, so they can’t raise their arms, hold the railing or take big steps, activist Stan Shikuma told the AP.

The video can be viewed live on a giant screen in a nearby building where advocates can watch people being taken off buses from the ICE Northwest detention center. It’s also livestreamed on the county website.

“They’re patted down, head to toe, mouth examined, sometimes the chains are tightened before they’re allowed to board the plane,” Shikuma said. “People coming off the plane: same treatment.”",https://nwasianweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deportation-flight_Featured.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 19:56:57.031993

Instead, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) not only escalated her mental health crisis, but shot Linda within minutes of arriving.
This is especially true for people who are trans, non-binary, or gender non-conforming, unhoused, and experiencing mental health crises.
Reimagining a world beyond ableism, trans-phobia, and anti-Black racism requires us to move funds away from policing and towards robust community-based mental health services that don’t require law enforcement involvement for people to access crisis mental health care.","The Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF) condemns law enforcement targeting and killing of disabled people and calls for solidarity from the disability community and justice for all those impacted. DREDF honors the lives of all disabled people targeted and killed by police, including Linda Becerra Moran and Victor Perez, and demands justice in the wake of their murders at the hands of the police.

Since January, the rhetoric and actions of this administration have sought to dehumanize and limit the rights of people with disabilities through executive orders and statements. Just recently, President Trump began an attempted takeover of Washington, DC’s police force and has militarized and exponentially increased law enforcement presence targeting unhoused people, people with mental illness and immigrants. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed actions limiting access to essential mental health, early education and healthcare for some immigrants will disproportionately harm brown disabled people.

Policing and government intrusion do not belong in our response to mental health crises, our schools, our hospitals, our communities, our homes, or our families. Reducing police and immigration enforcement interaction with Black and brown people with disabilities and increasing community-based supports and services are imperative for keeping our communities safe from state violence.

Linda Becerra Moran was a 30-year-old trans woman, Ecuadorian migrant, and primarily spoke Spanish. She lived in Los Angeles and experienced cycles of being unhoused while looking for consistent work as a cook. Victor Perez was a 17-year-old autistic, nonverbal, teenager of Puerto Rican descent with an intellectual disability and cerebral palsy. He primarily understood Spanish and lived with his family in Idaho.

On February 7, 2025, Linda called 911 for help. She described that she had endured gender-based violence and was currently experiencing a mental health crisis. Despite naming that she was experiencing a mental health crisis, police were dispatched to the scene instead of crisis intervention specialists. The police who responded neither listened to Linda nor provided her with mental health services. Instead, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) not only escalated her mental health crisis, but shot Linda within minutes of arriving. Linda died on February 27th after being taken off of life support.

On April 5, 2025, the police were called to the home of Victor’s family, where the family was having a barbeque. The police approached the gathering with guns already drawn despite being on the other side of the fence from Victor and his family. Multiple officers shot Victor within seconds of arriving on the scene. He died on April 12th after being taken off life support.

On August 11, 2025, U.S. Border Patrol agents handcuffed a 15-year-old disabled child outside of a Los Angeles school because of mistaken identity. On June 8, 2025, the Disabled Ginger called attention to the cruel and inhumane treatment of disabled immigrant detainees Alma Bowman and Rodney Taylor.

Alongside their loved ones and communities, we grieve and rage over the deaths and targeting of Linda Becerra Moran, Victor Perez, Alma Bowman, Rodney Taylor, and many more people with disabilities[1], particularly Black disabled people, who have been disproportionately detained, criminalized, imprisoned, and murdered by law enforcement.

These instances of violence are not the exception for Black and people with disabilities—they are the rule. This is especially true for people who are trans, non-binary, or gender non-conforming, unhoused, and experiencing mental health crises. In the words of Talila A. Lewis:

“policing in the united states was originally developed and later honed to control Black and Indigenous people’s lives — our movement, labor, speech, ownership, family, and more — most are unaware that disabled people (and those labeled disabled) have always been primary among the carceral machine’s intended target.”

We cannot rely on a system to keep us safe that was built on white supremacy and designed to oppress and dehumanize Black, brown, trans, queer, and disabled communities. Disability and racial bias trainings for police are not enough.[2] Trainings have not and will not reduce police violence against disabled Black and Brown people. We must continue to support and advocate for community-led public safety efforts that are geared towards reducing police interactions to keep our Black and brown, trans, immigrant, unhoused, immigrant, and disabled community members safe.

In 2024, DREDF joined 27 other disability rights and advocacy organizations in a public call for eliminating the role of police in responding to situations that should be addressed by peer led service systems, rooted in a framework of disability justice. Any advocacy for eliminating the role of police involvement and preventing violence against people with disabilities must be led by people who are most impacted by police violence: Black, brown, and Trans people with disabilities, especially people who are formerly incarcerated, have come in contact with the criminal legal system or carceral state, have mental health conditions, or are currently or at risk of being unhoused.

We must reimagine the ways that our mental health and community safety services operate. Investing and participating in local mutual aid networks allows our communities to create solutions and provide resources that work for us without violent police involvement.

Reimagining a world beyond ableism, trans-phobia, and anti-Black racism requires us to move funds away from policing and towards robust community-based mental health services that don’t require law enforcement involvement for people to access crisis mental health care.[3] We must hold law enforcement personally accountable for violence and harm by abolishing qualified immunity, which denies justice to all victims of the violence of policing. Disability Justice also calls for us to eradicate all systems and places where marginalized people are disappeared and separated from their families and loved ones.

During this political moment, where we are faced with a rise in state-targeted efforts to erase and disappear Black, Brown, immigrant, trans, unhoused and disabled lives, it is more critical than ever that we divest from law enforcement and invest in non-carceral community focused crisis response and health programs. With the shattering of our social safety net through Federal attacks on Medicaid and the elimination of state health services and programs, low income immigrant communities, Black and Brown communities, trans people, people with disabilities, and older adults are at risk of losing vital benefits, like home and community-based services that keep us alive and enable us to live integrated into our communities. Without access to these services, people will be forced into institutions to access care and segregated from society.

These attacks not only violate well established and hard-won civil rights of people with disabilities provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Olmstead v. Lois Curtis et al., but also the visions of safety and community-based systems of care that our communities have long fought for. We understand that a rights framework is one useful tool to combat discrimination and harm, but established rights are being systemically weakened and chipped away at with each passing year. Rights frameworks were not designed with the most marginalized in mind, and rights are not enough to achieve true justice. Justice requires us to work towards a horizon of abolition by divesting from law enforcement and investing in disability justice centered, community visions of safety. Linda Becerra Moran and Victor Perez should still be with us today, and we urge you to join us in meeting the call of both the present and future moment by working towards a future where Black and Brown, trans, unhoused, immigrant, disabled people can not only survive but thrive.

This type of behavior could be considered “litigation abuse”, also called “vexatious litigation” or something else along those lines.
Litigation abuse often takes place in divorces or other complicated cases, especially when both sides have to share documents and information before the trial.","Not every state has litigation abuse laws (statutes) in place. However, it can be important for you to understand litigation abuse so that you can recognize it. We have general information below that might be helpful. You can also find free and paid lawyers on our Finding a Lawyer page if you want to get specific advice about your situation.

What is litigation abuse?

When a victim ends an abusive relationship, the abuser may try to keep power and control by misusing the court system against the victim. For example, the abuser might:

file repeated petitions or motions without a legal reason to do so;

try to delay the process by asking to postpone one or many court dates (adjournments);

appeal the judge’s orders without a legal reason to do so;

serve you with inappropriate demands; or

take other actions that make you go to court again and again.

This type of behavior could be considered “litigation abuse”, also called “vexatious litigation” or something else along those lines.

Litigation abuse often takes place in divorces or other complicated cases, especially when both sides have to share documents and information before the trial. You can read more about this in our Preparing for Court - By Yourself section, under What if the abuser is using discovery as an abuse tactic?

What can I do if the abuser is filing many petitions or motions against me?

Unfortunately, litigation abuse can be challenging to deal with because people generally have the right to go to court and file cases. However, some states have started passing laws to protect victims from abusive litigation, recognizing that abusers often use the courts to keep contact with the victim or continue a pattern of abuse. In states that have litigation abuse laws, the judge may be more willing to do things like limit the abuser’s ability to file new court cases.

Even if your state does not have a specific abusive litigation law, you can still try to show the judge that the abuser is using the court in bad faith and ask the judge to punish the abuser. For example, you may file a motion asking the judge to make the abuser pay your legal fees each time s/he loses a case or motion against you. Sometimes, a financial penalty can be enough to make the abuser stop. If this is something you’d like to pursue, hopefully, a lawyer can help you figure out the process in your state.",,N,,2025-08-28 16:57:10.641363

But in March, the Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia to a notorious El Salvador prison, alleging he was a member of MS-13.
Abrego Garcia is accused of taking money to transport people who were in the country illegally.
There were nine passengers in the SUV and Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in cash on him.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case has come to encapsulate much of President Donald Trump ’s hard-line immigration agenda, wants to seek asylum in the United States, his lawyers told a federal judge Wednesday.

The asylum request — Abrego Garcia’s second, after a denial in 2019 — has been submitted in a Maryland immigration court, further complicating his complex immigration case that intensified in March when he was wrongfully deported to a notorious prison in his native El Salvador.

The Trump administration maintains that Abrego Garcia, 30, is part of the dangerous MS-13 gang — an allegation he denies — and has said it intends to deport him to the African country of Uganda.

If Abrego Garcia’s new asylum request is approved, it could provide a green card and a path to citizenship. But his petition must go through the U.S. immigration court system, which is not part of the judiciary but an arm of the Department of Justice and under the Trump administration’s authority.

Asylum or deportation

Immigration courts have become a key focus of Trump’s renewed immigration enforcement efforts. The president has fired more than 50 immigration judges since he returned to the White House in January.

But Abrego Garcia has something that most people in his situation lack: A team of lawyers fighting for him and a federal judge who is monitoring his case.

His attorneys filed a lawsuit before U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland to ensure that Abrego Garcia can exercise his constitutional right to fight against deportation in immigration court. They have also argued he has the right to express fear of persecution and torture in Uganda. Abrego Garcia has told authorities he would prefer to be sent to Costa Rica if he must be removed from the U.S.

Xinis stated explicitly during a conference call with lawyers Wednesday that she will not — and cannot — rule on whether Abrego Garcia is granted asylum or is deported.

“We have the understanding that the asylum process is of no moment to me,” Xinis said. “I don’t have jurisdiction over that.”

But Xinis said she can weigh in to ensure Abrego Garcia is allowed to exercise his right to due process. His attorneys say he is entitled to immigration court proceedings and appeals, including to the U.S. Court of Appeals, before he can be deported.

Xinis said she’ll focus on whether Abrego Garcia goes through required immigration court process or “if there is no process.”

“But there could be shades of that,” she said.

The government cannot remove Abrego Garcia from the continental U.S. before an evidentiary hearing for the lawsuit on Oct. 6, Xinis ruled. She also ordered that he be kept within 200 miles (320 kilometers) of her court in Greenbelt to ensure he can access his lawyers, who said Monday that he’s in a Virginia detention facility.

Abrego Garcia was released Friday from a jail in Tennessee, where he has been charged with human smuggling. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained him in Baltimore on Monday and said he would be deported to Uganda.

During Wednesday’s conference call, Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign said the government disagrees with the court’s order not to remove Abrego Garcia while the lawsuit is pending but that it will comply.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers say sending him to Uganda would be punishment for successfully fighting his deportation to El Salvador, refusing to plead guilty to the smuggling charges and for seeking release from jail in Tennessee.

Abrego Garcia is facing immigration proceedings with a level of legal representation and oversight that few people get, according to Ohio State University law professor César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández.

“I wish I could tell you that I am 100% confident that they’re not going to stick him on an airplane to Kampala right now,” he said, naming Uganda’s capital. “But I can’t because the president is personally involved in his legal fight. The attorney general is personally involved in his legal fight … Half the Cabinet officials know who he is.”

An earlier request for asylum

Abrego Garcia fled El Salvador at the age of 16, around 2011, because a local gang was extorting and terrorized his family, according to court records. He arrived in the U.S. without authorization and joined his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen, and settled in Maryland.

Abrego Garcia found work in construction, eventually got married and started a family. In 2019, he was detained by local police in Maryland when he arrived outside a Home Depot in search of work as a day laborer.

Authorities had been told by a confidential informant that Abrego Garcia and other men outside the store could be identified as members of MS-13 because of their clothing and tattoos. Abrego Garcia was never charged — and has repeatedly denied the allegation. He was turned over to ICE and subsequently applied for asylum.

A U.S. immigration judge denied his request because he applied more than a year after he had entered the U.S. But the immigration judge issued an order shielding Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador because he established he had a well-founded fear of gang persecution.

Abrego Garcia was released under federal supervision and continued to live with his American wife and children. He checked in with ICE each year, received a federal work permit and was working as a sheet metal apprentice earlier this year, his lawyers have said.

But in March, the Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia to a notorious El Salvador prison, alleging he was a member of MS-13.

Wrongful deportation and his return

The deportationviolated the immigration judge’s 2019 order barring his removal to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia’s wife sued to bring him back. Facing mounting pressure and a U.S. Supreme Court order, the Trump administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. in June, where he was charged with human smuggling, a federal offense.

Abrego Garcia is accused of taking money to transport people who were in the country illegally. He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, saying it was filed to punish him for challenging his deportation.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee. There were nine passengers in the SUV and Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in cash on him. While officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling, he was allowed to drive away with only a warning.

A Homeland Security agent testified that he didn’t begin investigating until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The trial is set for January.

Federal officials argue Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and the immigration judge’s 2019 ruling deemed him eligible for expulsion, just not to his native El Salvador.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/110182397.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-08-28 17:57:15.215451

What we learned, Thursday 28 August

Another busy final sitting day of the week. We are wrapping up the live blog here. This is what made the news:

Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja met the prime minister to discuss gambling ads and Gaza, with the meeting initially cancelled but eventually rescheduled.

The Pentagon walked back a statement describing defence minister Richard Marles’ meeting with his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, and vice-president JD Vance as a “happenstance encounter”.

Marles and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, faced questions on that in the final question time of the week, as well as Australia’s relationship with the US and Israel.

Albanese said the South Australian algal bloom was directly related to climate change.

Richard Boyle has avoided jail time for blowing the whistle on unethical debt recovery practices at the Australian Taxation Office.

Bob Katter told a journalist “I punch blokes in the mouth for saying that” for mentioning his Lebanese heritage during a press conference where he threw his support behind the anti-immigration, so-called “March for Australia” rallies planned for 31 August.

Qantas’ net profit rose by a third to $1.6bn in the year to June as customer numbers surged and Jetstar revenue surged while fuel costs fell.

We’ll be back tomorrow with a regular live news blog. Take care until then.

ABC welcomes decision not to convict ATO whistleblower

The ABC has welcomed the decision not to convict ATO whistleblower, Richard Boyle and again called for strengthened whistleblower protections.

Boyle gave information to investigative journalist Adele Ferguson in 2018 on tactics used on taxpayers who owed money that resulted in a joint Nine and Four Corners investigation in 2018.

ABC director of news Justin Stevens said:

We acknowledge the seriousness of these offences. However, Boyle had principled intentions, and his actions were in the public’s interest. His allegations were vindicated. He received no personal gain and has paid a high personal price for his whistleblowing.

If it wasn’t for whistleblowers such as Richard Boyle coming forward to journalists, there are many important issues affecting people’s wellbeing and livelihoods that the public would never know about.

Human rights organisations condemn noncitizen deportation bill

The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and the Human Rights Law Centre are among the organisations condemning legislation introduced into parliament this week that removes procedural fairness for noncitizens the government is seeking to move to third countries.

In legislation introduced in the parliament on Tuesday, the home affairs minister said the changes will address the cohort who have remained in Australia following the NZYQ high court decision.

He said:

Procedural fairness is a fundamental principle in many areas of decision-making. However, these provisions can and are being used by noncitizens to delay and frustrate their removal, at cost to the commonwealth in circumstances where it is neither necessary nor appropriate for it to continue to apply.

The amendments in this bill are largely directed at noncitizens who have come to the end of any visa processes, and who are on a removal pathway.

These provisions are primarily directed to noncitizens who have exhausted all legitimate avenues to remain in Australia – and for whom removal is the only remaining outcome under Australian law.

He said the purpose of the law should be clear to give effect to removal as swiftly and effectively as possible.

The human rights organisations say the bill would “strip migrants and refugees of their legal rights” when sending them to third countries such as Nauru, and was “yet another attempt at rushed law-making”.

Jana Favero, deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said:

The decisions are serious and lifelong. We are talking about people being permanently deported to places like Nauru. Decisions like this must not be made without fundamental legal safeguards. This legislation is clearly designed to manipulate the law so that the government is not accountable to the courts.

Josephine Langbien, associate legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

This legislation would save the government from having to consider basic questions like whether someone can access the medical care they need in Nauru, or whether they would be permanently separated from their families. By eliminating safeguards that are designed to ensure fairness and accuracy, the government is showing that it does not care if it gets these life-changing decisions wrong.

Family of girl killed in Stonehaven bus crash release statement

The family of Milla Killeen, the 12-year-old girl killed in the bus crash at Stonehaven in Victoria yesterday, have released a statement and a photo to the media.

The family said:

Our whole family are struggling to come to terms with the loss of our beloved Milla.

We were made aware of the crash quite quickly, but it wasn’t for several hours that our worst fears were realised - Milla was the one that was sadly taken.

She was a beautiful soul with the whole world in front of her.

Milla had the patience of a saint.

She was so kind and protective of those she loved, especially her younger brother.

Milla was thriving at school where she loved learning new languages.

It brought us great joy when she would come home and try to teach her nan bits of Indonesian or Japanese that she’d learned throughout the day.

Milla was very artistic, enjoyed drawing and designing lots of different things and she loved her sport.

She used to play junior footy but lately had been focusing on basketball where she reached representative level and was about to play in a final on Friday night.

Milla was a passionate supporter of the Geelong Football Club, and we will always remember her sitting in the stands with her mum and pa, cheering for the Cats.

We don’t know why this has happened.

It’s difficult to describe all the emotions we feel right now but we are supporting one another and now ask that our family’s privacy is respected.

Age assurance company to brief on technology trial next month

We’re all awaiting the release of the final report of the age assurance technology trial that will inform what technology the social media sites will use to keep under 16s off their services from December.

The report has been with the federal government since the start of the month, but there haven’t been any indications on when it’ll be released.

There is a sign it may be imminent, however, with the head of the trial, Tony Allen, posting on LinkedIn that there will be a series of briefings on the outcome of the trial in Australia and New Zealand towards the end of September.

The office of the communications minister, Anika Wells, was approached for comment.

The trial has kept quiet about its findings, mostly, since the report was finalised, amid concerns about leaks to media.

Taylor defends focus on Marles meeting

The shadow defence minister, Angus Taylor, has defended the Coalition focusing on whether the defence minister, Richard Marles, did meet with his US counterpart or not, arguing it was important whether Aukus and the US alliance are strong.

He told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing that there had been conflicting statements, and there was a material issue:

I think the material issue here is what progress are we making ensuring Aukus, ensuring the US alliance at a time which is the most dangerous since the second world war, authoritarian regimes are flexing their muscles and we need a strong alliance and we need a strong Aukus. We want to see progress on this and that is why we are asking the questions and questions need to be continued to be asked of the defence minister and of the prime minister.

He said the government should be offering to seriously fund the defence force.

Marles’s US meeting was ‘productive’, assistant minister says

Matt Thistlethwaite, the assistant minister for foreign affairs, has said the meeting between the defence minister, Richard Marles, and his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, was “productive” and dismissed attention on whether it was a “happenstance” or a meeting from the Coalition.

Thistlethwaite told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing Marles told him the meeting was productive, and the government believes the alliance is going well and strong.

Asked why the Pentagon initially described it as happenstance, the assistant minister said that was a question for the Pentagon.

I don’t know about that statement put out, [but] we can confirm the meeting occurred and Richard also met with Marco Rubio and the vice president JD Vance. Critical minerals, treaty relationship, issues internationally were discussed.

He said a meeting had been requested with US president Donald Trump and that “is all we can do”.

He questioned the “priorities” of the opposition in raising it during question time, rather than a specific question on Aukus, when the government has been focused on the cost of living for Australians in parliament this week.

Federal government condemns planned anti-immigration rallies

The Albanese government has condemned anti-immigration rallies scheduled for this weekend, saying the “brand of fight-right activism grounded in racism and ethnocentrism” has no place in modern Australia.

A series of so-called March for Australia rallies are planned in cities across the country on Sunday to protest against “mass migration”.

In a statement on Thursday, the minister for home affairs, Tony Burke, said there was “no place in our country for people who seek to divide and undermine our social cohesion”.

We stand with modern Australia against these rallies – nothing could be less Australian.

The multicultural affairs minister, Anne Aly, said “multiculturalism was an integral and valued part of our identity”.

We stand with all Australians, no matter where they were born, against those who seek to divide us and who seek to intimidate migrant communities. We will not be intimidated.

This brand of far-right activism grounded in racism and ethnocentrism has no place in modern Australia.

The shadow multicultural affairs minister, Paul Scarr, earlier this week condemned a pamphlet promoting the rallies that referenced Indian migrants.

Scarr said at the time:

So I am compelled to rise in this place at the earliest opportunity to call it out and to condemn it and say that the language and references to Australians of Indian heritage is unacceptable. It is outrageous ... it seeks to divide Australians at a time when we need to unite.

Whether or not he thinks Folbigg innocent is ‘irrelevant’ to payout calculation, NSW AG says

The innocence of Kathleen Folbigg, jailed for two decades after the deaths of her four children, was “irrelevant” to the calculation of a $2m payout, the NSW attorney general says.

Folbigg was jailed in 2003 before being released and having her convictions quashed in 2023, when fresh scientific evidence cast reasonable doubt over her guilt.

Michael Daley did not meet with her before announcing the payment offer on 7 August, telling a budget estimates hearing on Thursday that “it would not have assisted” him in determining the amount offered.

The best way to deal with ex gratia payments is to deal with the objective facts. When you meet with people seeking ex gratia payments, it raises expectations.

Daley said he did not plan to meet with her now that “the matter has concluded”.

I can’t see any point in doing that. I don’t want to hold any hope out to her that she can come in and ask for that figure to be varied because I think the premier has indicated quite clearly, on a number of occasions, that it won’t be.

Labor has been under pressure to explain how it arrived at the $2m figure, after experts suggested it should be five to 10 times higher.

Lindy Chamberlain, jailed for four years before authorities agreed a dingo had likely taken her baby from an Uluru campsite, was awarded $1.7m, including legal costs, in 1992. That sum would be worth $4 million today.

But Folbigg’s case stood alone, Daley suggested.

Medical evidence, which led to her release and acquittal in 2023, did not exist at the time of her trial.

“That was a huge factor,” the attorney general said.

“What set this matter apart was there was no proven malfeasance on the part of the state.”

He said he followed a process to determine the amount offered.

Whether he considered Folbigg innocent or guilty was “completely irrelevant” to his decision.

Known as the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), it calls on member states to submit a report every 4 1/2 years on actions it has taken to improve the human rights situation in their own countries, and receive recommendations from member states for continued improvement. The U.S. was expected to submit its report in November.

Reuters first reported that the U.S. would not participate.

Spokespeople for the intergovernmental HRC and the U.N. human rights office told Reuters the U.S. Mission in Geneva had notified them of the decision.

The move was slammed by human rights advocates. The U.S.-based Human Rights First called the Trump administration’s refusal to participate “another damaging setback to American credibility on human rights and accountability.”

Human Rights First said the U.S. joins Israel as the only country to not submit a report since the UPR started in 2006, but it noted Israel rejoined the process in 2013, 2018 and 2023.

“Showing up and explaining your own record on human rights is the bare minimum for any government that purports to exercise international leadership and uphold democratic norms,” said Uzra Zeya, president and CEO of Human Rights First. Zeya previously served as under secretary of state for civilian security, democracy, and human rights in the Biden administration.

“The United States isn’t being singled out — every UN member state takes its turn having its human rights record assessed. Running away from that scrutiny doesn’t just show weakness and a lack of confidence, it will give rights-abusing governments cover to do the same themselves,” she continued.

Phil Lynch, executive director of international service for Human Rights First, criticized Trump as turning the U.S. into “a human rights pariah state.”

“To avoid a domino effect, it is important that a government’s refusal to participate in the UPR does not mean they escape scrutiny. Instead it should mean that other human rights experts and bodies intensify their focus and reporting on that State,” Lynch posted on the social platform X.

Michael Posner, director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at NYU Stern School of Business, told Reuters that the U.S. was undermining global efforts on human rights.

“By withdrawing from the UPR, the U.S. gives gross human rights abusers like Iran, Russia and Sudan an excuse to follow suit,” said Posner, a former senior State Department official who helped direct the UPR process under former President Obama.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/united_nations_09282019_AP_AP19271728750915.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-28 15:57:48.327277

Trading of common stock and warrants of the new public company, YD Bio Limited, is expected to commence on the Nasdaq Global Market on August 29, 2025, under the ticker symbols “YDES” and “YDESW”

TAIWAN, Aug. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YD Bio Limited (“YD Bio Ltd” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: YDES), a biotechnology company advancing DNA methylation-based cancer detection technology and ophthalmologic innovations, today announced the successful completion of its previously announced business combination with Breeze Holdings Acquisition Corp. (“Breeze”), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company. Beginning August 29, 2025, YD Bio’s ordinary shares and warrants will trade on Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbols “YDES” and “YDESW,” respectively. The transaction was approved by Breeze shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting held on August 14, 2025.

The Company also announced that the previously announced PIPE offering closed, in full, contemporaneously with the closing of the business combination. The proceeds of the PIPE offering together with the cash released to the Company from the trust for the benefit of the former Breeze shareholders, after satisfaction of all business combination closing-related expenses, is expected to yield more than $11,500,000 to fund the Company’s future operations.

The Business Combination and the PIPE closing mark a significant step in the Company’s evolution, positioning YD Bio Ltd as an emerging leader in the biotech industry with strong growth potential across multiple fast-growing healthcare markets. By entering the public markets, YD Bio Ltd is poised to accelerate innovation, scale production, and drive the development and commercialization of groundbreaking technologies.

YD Bio Ltd’s business model centers on partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies to transform innovative technologies into commercially viable drugs and cancer detection diagnostics. Led by Chairman Dr. Ethan Shen, a biomedical expert with over 30 years of experience, the Company is focused on advancing a diversified portfolio of innovative healthcare solutions across oncology diagnostics, regenerative medicine, and clinical trial support. The Company’s core programs include:

Blood-Based Cancer Detection: Through exclusive licensing agreements with its partner EG BioMed, the Company is developing proprietary DNA methylation-based detection technology for a range of cancers. This includes a screening test for the early detection of pancreatic cancer, which is available as a laboratory-developed test (LDT) through EG BioMed’s CLIA-certified laboratory, and a monitoring test for recurrent breast cancer, expected to launch as an LDT later this year.

Stem Cell- and Exosome-Based Ophthalmology Therapies : In partnership with 3D Global Biotech, the Company is advancing corneal stem cell and exosome technologies for the treatment of ocular diseases such as dry eye syndrome, glaucoma, and corneal injury. Clinical development efforts are underway, with Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved specimen collection and plans to initiate trials evaluating exosome-based contact lenses and artificial tears in 2027.

Clinical Trial and Ancillary Services : The Company has served as a trusted supplier of investigational drugs and ancillary materials to global pharmaceutical companies, supporting clinical development and post-launch commercialization.

The Company’s multi-decade exclusive licensing agreements, together with its proprietary patented technologies, provide the Company with a significant first-mover advantage across its clinical markets.

“Today is an incredibly proud moment and a major milestone for our company, our employees and our shareholders, as we begin our journey as a publicly traded company,” said Dr. Ethan Shen, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of YD Bio Ltd. “Since our founding in 2013, YD Bio has evolved from a supplier of clinical trial drugs and health supplements into a dynamic innovator in diagnostics and therapeutics. From pioneering exosome technologies to advancing early cancer detection, our progress reflects years of dedication and transformation. Becoming a publicly traded Nasdaq-listed company enables us to accelerate our mission of delivering innovative solutions that improve lives and advance global health. We are profoundly grateful to the patients who participate in our trials, our dedicated team members, and our investors. We believe this achievement represents the next step in advancing our programs and products, redefining the future of healthcare, and bringing life-changing solutions to patients who need them.”

Then the protests started,CalMatters,,,,,https://www.mv-voice.com/calmatters/2025/08/28/immigration-agents-signed-up-to-recruit-at-a-california-university-then-the-protests-started/,"“FYI @calpolypomona invited ICE to come and recruit at a job fair on September 18th from 10:30am-2:30pm.
Both Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection are in the system and receive updates about campus career events.
The campus appointed an administrator to deal with immigration law enforcement.
Cal State University spokesperson Amy Bentley-Smith didn’t answer CalMatters’ questions about whether other campuses invited immigration law enforcement agencies to job fairs.
“That can include informing key stakeholders, like Dream Center coordinators, of the dates and times when” immigration law enforcement are on campus, she wrote.","This story was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.

Cal Poly Pomona postponed its annual fall job fair this week after students, alumni and community members criticized its inclusion of Customs and Border Protection as an in-person recruiter, underscoring the heightened sensitivity about immigration agencies on college campuses this fall.

The interim president of the Los Angeles County campus with nearly 28,000 students — the majority of whom are Latino — said leadership responded to the criticism and decided to rethink their approach to job fairs.

“We have listened carefully and are leveraging this input to design career programming this fall that is more personal and better tailored to the evolving needs of our students and to workforce demands,” said Iris S. Levine in a public letter Monday. “I want to thank those of you who reached out and shared your perspectives with honesty and passion,” she added.

Tracee Passeggi, the career center director at Cal Poly Pomona, said she received 200 to 250 emails between late Thursday and Monday protesting the presence of immigration law enforcement at the job fair.

In the days leading up to the postponement, social media swirled with rumors that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be among the employers at the September job fair, something the campus said is not true in a Tuesday FAQ.

“FYI @calpolypomona invited ICE to come and recruit at a job fair on September 18th from 10:30am-2:30pm. Even when calling themselves a HSI (Hispanic serving institution). Stand up against the racial profiling and ICE bounty hunters. Contact: Career@cpp.edu, President@cpp.edu, Admin_affairs@cpp.edu,” read one message from a poster on the campus’s main Facebook page on Sunday.

More than 106,000 employers share job updates on the Cal Poly Pomona career portal called Handshake, a common software tool among college campuses. Both Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection are in the system and receive updates about campus career events. But ICE has never taken part in a career fair, the FAQ said.

Meanwhile, Customs and Border Protection, the multi-pronged agency that oversees Border Patrol, a law enforcement agency that’s conducted immigration raids in California, was among the roughly 200 employers registered for the career fair slated Sept. 18-19 and has participated in almost every job fair at the campus since 2017.

Billy Gallagher, the faculty union senior field representative at Cal Poly Pomona, said the hyper-vigilance about immigration law enforcement on the campus makes sense, especially given that judges have faulted the agencies for using racial criteria in their arrests in the Los Angeles area. The federal government under the current Trump administration has appealed a preliminary injunction from a district judge to the U.S. Supreme Court.

“There’ve been arrests, U.S. citizens swept up. At this point, it’s hard to tell even who’s who in some of these raids, so there was definitely concern among faculty for sure,” Gallagher said, adding that officers at both Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have led immigration raids in California. Most of the students on campus are Latino, he also noted.

Career fair postponed, not cancelled

The campus doesn’t have a new date for the career fair, said Passeggi of the career center, but she aims to finalize those plans by late September, she said in an interview.

The postponed career fair was technically two events on consecutive days, and Customs and Border Protection was scheduled to appear on just one of those days with some 80 other employers.

Still, both dates were postponed. Passeggi said her team will use the opportunity to organize the fairs in new ways. What that means, she doesn’t know yet, but she pointed to the job fairs for the school’s hospitality and education majors that are smaller and subject-specific. Each event includes 200 students and 35 employers. The postponed event usually draws more than 1,500 students. It’s also outside and exposed to the elements on hot or, in the spring, possibly rainy days. She’s unsure if the redesigned fairs will be virtual or in-person.

“We have received some feedback from students saying that they were disappointed that the career fair was canceled,” she said, noting that her office was battling two types of misinformation: that the fair was called off and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was among the employers. Neither is true.

The Career Center will still support students seeking to connect with employers and organize internships, she said.

With much of the email and social media blowback occurring over the weekend, she thinks the campus leadership rallied fast. “We moved as quickly as we could” in a transparent manner, she said, pointing to the FAQ and letter from the president.

Nonetheless, “I can definitely hear where our community is coming from,” she said.

Faculty, student perspectives

The campus’ response to the outcry was sensible, said Mario Guerrero, a professor at Cal Poly Pomona who is chair of the university’s Political Science Department. “I think it speaks volumes about (Levine’s) leadership and being able to hear what folks were saying, but also respond appropriately. It’s a super delicate situation for fairly obvious reasons,” he said. “Even reading the comments now, people are still unhappy, and that’s always going to be part of it, but at least you know you can point to leadership being able to make proactive moves to protect the students however they can.”

Guerrero also thinks that the worry over immigration law enforcement as an employer at a job fair tapped into wider fears about those federal agents entering campus and arresting students, faculty or staff.

On Instagram, a student group that’s a subsidiary of the faculty union and that has chapters across multiple Cal State campuses, criticized Cal Poly Pomona for writing that it cannot bar employers from participating in its job fair because it is a public university. “Disappointed once again in administration, ignoring the safety and needs of their campus population — while claiming their hands are tied,” read the text on an Instagram Story posted earlier this week.

The campus administration was “getting pretty pummeled by students,” Gallagher said, and he’s “certainly hoping that the (Cal Poly Pomona) administration continues to listen to students.”

Campus staff limited if federal immigration officers enter campus

The California Faculty Association, the systemwide faculty union, published in January a list of demands to California State University leadership that seeks to block federal agents from conducting immigration law enforcement on campus. The demands, updated in July, included blocking those agencies from participating in job fairs.

But as a public system, Cal State University campuses cannot limit who enters their sites. Cal Poly Pomona administrators said as much in a February email to staff: “CSU is a public university, and a large portion of CSU property is open to the general public. The areas on campus that are open to the general public, like the campus quad and walkways, are also open to federal immigration enforcement officers.”

The notice said that immigration officers cannot enter areas that aren’t open to the general public, such as classrooms that are in session and residence halls — “unless the officer presents a valid judicial warrant or declares that exigent circumstances exist.”

However, the guidance says that staff and faculty do not need to divulge any information. The campus appointed an administrator to deal with immigration law enforcement. The guidance says personnel should “respectfully inform the officer that you lack authority but will immediately contact” the designated administrator. If that person isn’t available, personnel should contact campus police or campus legal counsel.

The University of California has similar guidance and stresses that hiding evidence or individuals violates federal law. So does interfering with an arrest. “Further, you should not put yourself in physical danger,” UC’s guidance says.

Cal State University spokesperson Amy Bentley-Smith didn’t answer CalMatters’ questions about whether other campuses invited immigration law enforcement agencies to job fairs. But in an email, she wrote that campuses should try to “mitigate” community concerns about those agencies appearing on site. “That can include informing key stakeholders, like Dream Center coordinators, of the dates and times when” immigration law enforcement are on campus, she wrote.

CalMatters is a Sacramento-based nonpartisan, nonprofit journalism venture committed to explaining how California's state Capitol works and why it matters. It works with more than 130 media partners throughout the state that have long, deep relationships with their local audiences, including Embarcadero Media.",https://i0.wp.com/www.mv-voice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cropped-favicon-32x32-1.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-28 18:56:56.729288

Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.

The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in west Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.

The secretive — and brisk — contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government’s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president’s pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.

A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. “Private facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.

“The lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,” he said.

Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company’s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it’s unclear whether he might have partners.

Army declines to release contract

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees.

Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.

The camp has drawn comparisons to “Alligator Alcatraz,” a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.

The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida’s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.

At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.

Three white tents, each about 810 feet (250 meters) long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by The Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.

Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Detention Watch, said the use of military bases hearkens back to World War II, when Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Army camps including Fort Bliss. She said military facilities are especially prone to abuse and neglect because families and loved ones have difficulty accessing them.

“Conditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,” Ghandehari said. “But when there’s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.”

Company will be responsible for security

A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.

The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it’s classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.

Though Trump’s administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities. For a firm to compete for such contracts, at least 51% of it must be owned by people belonging to a federally designated disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.

One of the losing bidders, Texas-based Gemini Tech Services, filed a protest challenging the award and the Army’s rushed construction timeline with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’ independent oversight arm that resolves such disputes.

Gemini alleges Acquisition Logistics lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work, according to a person familiar with the complaint who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Acquisition Logistics’ past jobs include repairing small boats for the Air Force, providing information technology support to the Defense Department and building temporary offices to aid with immigration enforcement, federal records show.

Gemini and its lawyer didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.

A ruling by the GAO on whether to sustain, dismiss or require corrective action is not expected before November. A legal appeal is also pending with a U.S. federal court in Washington.

Schnell, the contracting lawyer, said Acquisitions Logistics may be working with a larger company. Geo Group Inc. and CoreCivic Corp., the nation’s biggest for-profit prison operators, have expressed interest in contracting with the Pentagon to house migrants.

In an earnings call this month, Geo Group CEO George Zoley said his company had teamed up with an established Pentagon contractor. Zoley didn’t name the company, and Geo Group didn’t respond to repeated requests asking with whom it had partnered.

A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn’t partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.

A Rwandan government spokesperson said Thursday that seven deportees arrived in the East African country earlier this month. No announcement was made at the time.

Rwanda did say in early August that it had agreed to take up to 250 deportees but declined then to say when the first would arrive.

Two other African nations, South Sudan and Eswatini, have already accepted a small number of deportees from the U.S. in what have also been secretive deals, while Uganda said last week it has an agreement in principle to take deportees.

Here’s what we know about the deportations of migrants from the U.S.

Rwanda

Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo said the seven deportees are being visited by representatives from the United Nations’ migration agency and Rwandan social services.

Three of them want to return to their home countries while the other four “wish to stay and build lives in Rwanda,” she said. The Rwandan government didn’t say where the deportees are being held.

There was no information on their identities, nationalities or if they have criminal records.

Deportees previously sent to South Sudan and Eswatini were all described by U.S. authorities as dangerous criminals.

Rwanda’s deal with the U.S. follows a contentious migrant agreement it reached with the U.K. in 2022 that collapsed and was ruled unlawful by Britain’s Supreme Court. That deal was meant to see people seeking asylum in the U.K. sent to Rwanda, where they would stay if their asylum applications were approved.

Uganda

Uganda, which borders Rwanda, said it would accept deportees from the U.S. as long as they don’t have criminal records or are unaccompanied minors.

The U.S. has said it wants to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose case has become a flashpoint in U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, to Uganda.

Like the other countries, Uganda didn’t give any other details of its deal with the U.S. or what it might gain from accepting deported migrants. African nations might get a range of benefits for accepting deportees and improving their relations with the Trump administration.

“We are sacrificing human beings for political expediency, in this case because Uganda wants to be in the good books of the United States,” Ugandan human rights lawyer Nicholas Opio said when his country announced it was seeking a deal with the U.S.

South Sudan

The U.S. sent eight men from South Sudan, Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan in July after their deportations were held up by a legal challenge. That led to them being kept for weeks in a converted shipping container at an American military base in nearby Djibouti.

U.S. officials said the men had been convicted of violent crimes in the U.S.

South Sudan’s government said it would ensure their “safety and wellbeing” but has declined to say where the men are being held and what their fate might be.

South Sudan has been wracked by conflict since it gained independence from Sudan in 2011 and is teetering on the edge of civil war again.

Eswatini

Two weeks after the South Sudan deportations, the U.S. announced that it had sent five other men — citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos — to the small kingdom of Eswatini, in southern Africa.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described them as violent criminals whose home countries had refused to take them back.

Eswatini’s government said the men would be held in solitary confinement until their repatriation, and later said that might take up to a year.

A human rights lawyer in Eswatini has taken the authorities to court alleging the men are being denied legal representation while being held in a maximum-security prison.

Eswatini, which borders South Africa, is one of the world’s last absolute monarchies. King Mswati III has ruled since he turned 18 in 1986 and authorities under him are accused of violently subduing pro-democracy movements.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/2025-08-26T203009Z_1597272155_RC2XEGAIC74I_RTRMADP_3_MIGRATION-USA-JOBS-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 14:56:51.916712

The administration is in the midst of surging 10,000 employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement after securing funding for the hires in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, creating unprecedented demand at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. Training needs could create bottlenecks as ICE seeks to rapidly onboard the new officers and agents, current and former officials have warned, and the administration is now taking drastic measures to avoid those pitfalls.

“To support the onboarding of 10,000 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations personnel and 1,000 ICE Homeland Security Investigations personnel by Dec. 31st, 2025, we must focus our resources on surge-related training,” acting FLETC Director Paul Baker and his deputy, Ariana Roddini, said in a message to staff Wednesday. “As a result, training programs for agencies not directly involved in these efforts, originally scheduled between Sept. 9 and Dec. 31, 2025 will be rescheduled to later dates in Fiscal Year 2026.”

More than 75 federal law enforcement agencies train at FLETC, which maintains its primary campus in Glynco, Georgia. Those agencies range from other Homeland Security Department components like Border Patrol and the Transportation Security Administration to the National Park Service, military police and inspectors general offices across government.

“We recognize the impact this decision may have on our partner agencies and the additional demands it places on our staff,” Baker and Roddini said.

The DHS component has stood up a Surge Training Operations Center to help manage the influx from ICE and “coordinate planning and execution.” That group is assembling daily to address challenges that arise and meet the administration’s priorities, while still supporting its partner agencies “as much as possible.”

Baker and Roddini added they are examining whether other FLETC sites could accommodate critical training programs and are working with other agencies to find temporary solutions to meet their training needs. In addition to ICE’s 10,000 ERO hires, 1,000 HSI hires and normal federal law enforcement onboarding—which Trump has exempted from his governmentwide hiring freeze—the president’s signature immigration enforcement and tax bill funded 8,500 new employees for Customs and Border Protection and provided $3 billion for Bureau of Prisons hiring.

FLETC itself received $750 million to support those hiring efforts and current and former officials highlighted the need to quickly expand capacity at the training center to accommodate the surges. The current limitation on classrooms, instructors, firearms ranges and other assets could limit FLETC's throughout, they said.

Jason Owens, a longtime Border Patrol official who served as chief of the agency under President Biden and as its chief operating officer through March, recently told Government Executive that expanding capacity at FLETC could create its own speed bumps because construction “doesn’t happen overnight,” requires a buildup of procurement capacity and the typically-not-timely awarding of contracts.

One FLETC employee said the agency did not “appear to be prioritizing the building of long term capabilities.” Instead, the employee said, “they look focused on short term, temporary fixes to accommodate the mission.”

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For its part, FLETC stressed that it is committed to helping its own employees work through the changes.

(AP) — An immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades dubbed “ Alligator Alcatraz ” must keep moving toward shutting down operations by late October, a judge has ruled, even as the state and federal governments fight that decision.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams late Wednesday denied requests to pause her order to wind down operations at the facility, which has been plagued by reports of unsanitary conditions and detainees being cut off from the legal system.

The facility was already being emptied of detainees, according to an email exchange shared with The Associated Press on Wednesday. The executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, said on Aug. 22 “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days,” in a message to South Florida Rabbi Mario Rojzman about chaplaincy services at the facility, implying there would soon be no need.

The detention center was quickly built two months ago at a little-used training airport, where chain-link cages now surround large white tents filled with rows of bunk beds. State officials signed more than $245 million in contracts for building and operating the facility, which officially opened July 1.

President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.

Attorneys for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in their request for a stay that Williams’ order last week, if carried out, would disrupt the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws.

But the judge in Wednesday night's order noted that the detainee population already was dwindling at the facility, and that the federal government's “immigration enforcement goals will not be thwarted by a pause in operations.”

Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ’ administration is preparing to open a second immigration detention facility dubbed “Deportation Depot” at a state prison in north Florida.

Williams said in last week’s order that she expected the population of “Alligator Alcatraz” to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can’t bring any new detainees onto the property.

State officials said shutting down the facility for the time being would cost them $15 million to $20 million and that it would cost another $15 million to $20 million to reinstall structures if they ultimately are allowed to reopen the facility. They also said that the Florida Division of Emergency Management will lose most of the value of the $218 million it has invested in making the training airport suitable for a detention center.

“Alligator Alcatraz” has been targeted by several lawsuits, ranging from its impact on the Everglades to civil rights concerns.

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe said further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their lawsuit claimed the facility threatened sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars spent over decades on environmental restoration.

Civil rights groups filed a second lawsuit last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system. Another federal judge last week dismissed parts of the lawsuit and moved the suit to another court district for procedural reasons.

A third lawsuit by civil rights groups last Friday described “severe problems” at the facility which were “previously unheard-of in the immigration system.” The suit alleges detainees were being held for weeks without any charges, had disappeared from ICE’s online detainee locator, and no one at the facility was making initial custody or bond determinations.

The groups want a federal court in Fort Myers to issue a restraining order and a temporary injunction that would bar Florida agencies and their contractors from holding detainees there.

Since immigration is a federal issue, the rights groups say Florida agencies and the state's private contractors have no authority to operate the facility. The rights groups want their lawsuit to be certified as a class action.

Meanwhile, almost two dozen Republican-led states urged the appellate court reviewing Williams’ order to overturn it. The 22 states argued in a court filing that she overstepped her authority and that the federal environmental laws only applied to the federal agencies, not the state of Florida.

Census data also drives the allocation of hundreds of billions in federal funds to state and local governments.
To be clear, there has never been a mid-decade census used for congressional apportionment.
What President Trump proposes is not unconstitutional — it’s unprecedented.","President Trump is calling for a recount — a recount of the American people. And he’s calling for something else: a rejection of the Left’s new math and a return to common sense. The president has ordered the Commerce Department to begin preparing a new mid-decade census that would count only those who are legally present in the United States.

Why does that matter?

The Constitution requires that Congress establish the manner by which a census is conducted every 10 years. The results of the census determine how the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are apportioned among the 50 states. Census data also drives the allocation of hundreds of billions in federal funds to state and local governments. So it’s no surprise to hear the wailing and gnashing of teeth from Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is now threatening to dismantle California’s so-called independent redistricting commission and push through a Democrat-favoring election map.

President Trump’s proposal — to count only those legally residing in the country — would force sanctuary cities and states to forfeit the political and financial benefits they’ve gained through open-border policies. The estimated 10 to 11 million illegal immigrants who have entered the U.S. during President Biden’s term were not accidental. While illegal voting has occurred in isolated cases, the real impact is demographic: population growth in deep-blue states that translates into increased congressional representation and control over federal funding.

The 2020 Census, which preceded the current border crisis, already shifted the balance slightly: seven traditionally blue states each lost a congressional seat, giving Republicans a narrow advantage. But left unchanged, the next census could dramatically shift power back to blue states — thanks to the millions of undocumented immigrants now residing within their borders.

To be clear, there has never been a mid-decade census used for congressional apportionment. But there have been mid-decade counts for data collection and planning purposes. What President Trump proposes is not unconstitutional — it’s unprecedented. Congress should support this effort as a benchmark and standard for the 2030 Census, which could occur under a Democratic administration determined to inflate blue-state population numbers through illegal immigration, thereby regaining control of Congress and the federal purse.

Texas offers a case study. With 38 House seats and a red-leaning electorate, it has been a top destination for refugee resettlement under both the Obama and Biden administrations — second only to California. These refugees, lawfully admitted, were disproportionately settled in Houston, Dallas, and Austin — urban centers that have become Democratic strongholds.

The pattern is clear: Democrats have used both legal and illegal immigration to reshape the political landscape and redirect federal resources. Many of President Trump’s early executive orders can be reversed by his successor. But this initiative — teaching the nation to count fairly and accurately — could set a lasting precedent.

And that’s what makes this moment so critical.",https://www.frc.org/img/domain/frc/item/AE25H150_NORMAL.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 13:56:49.768167

""The Catholic Church has always proclaimed the inviolable dignity of the human person, created in the image and likeness of God,"" they said.
At a time when political rhetoric often generates division and fear, especially over immigration, ""the Church stands as a beacon of God-given hope,"" they said.
Some Catholics are asking, ""What does the pastoral reflection want us to do?""
""The bishops of this country have been engaging in the legislative process for many years for important immigration reform,"" Walsh told The Catholic Messenger.","A pastoral reflection on immigration from the Iowa Catholic bishops aims to present church teaching in a way that ""transcends"" political rhetoric and ""fear and false narratives"" about the issue often found in secular and social media, Bishop Dennis Walsh of Davenport said.

""Our response to those seeking refuge and stability in hope is not only a reflection of our nation's founding values, but is primarily a testament to our fidelity to Christ,"" said Archbishop Thomas Zinkula of Dubuque; Bishop William Joensen of Des Moines; Bishop John Keehner of Sioux City; and Bishop Walsh.

The reflection, titled ""Pilgrims of Hope: A Pastoral Reflection on Immigration,"" was released Aug. 22 by the Iowa Catholic Conference, the public policy arms of the bishops.

""The Catholic Church has always proclaimed the inviolable dignity of the human person, created in the image and likeness of God,"" they said. ""Governments do not bestow this dignity, nor does legal status instill it, but it is intrinsic to every human person as a beloved child of the heavenly Father.""

The Catholic Church has always affirmed the ""right to migrate,"" the bishops wrote, citing St. John XXIII's 1963 encyclical, Pacem in Terris (""Peace on Earth"") The pope, they said, ""taught that 'every human being has the right to freedom of movement and of residence within the confines of his own state. When there are just reasons in favor of it, he must be permitted to migrate to other countries and take up residence there.'""

The nation has a right to regulate its borders, the bishops said, but ""the security of a nation can never be used as an excuse to violate the dignity and human rights of migrants, including the right to due process by law.""

At a time when political rhetoric often generates division and fear, especially over immigration, ""the Church stands as a beacon of God-given hope,"" they said.

""Immigration is not merely a political or economic issue; it is a deeply moral matter that calls for a response rooted in faith, justice, and mercy. Sacred Scripture consistently reveals God’s care for the immigrant and the refugee,"" the bishops said.

""'Pilgrims of Hope' is intended to serve as a guide for the faithful, providing clear and authentic Catholic perspective on the complex issue of migration,"" Walsh told The Catholic Messenger, Davenport's diocesan news outlet. ""The letter seeks to present the church's teaching in a way that transcends the political rhetoric often found in secular and social media, which can focus on fear and false narratives.""

A ""Catholic perspective on immigration must always begin with the inherent dignity of each person. The letter affirms that the rights possessed by every individual are intrinsic to the human person and cannot be disregarded for political expediency,"" Walsh said. ""The pastoral letter is not just another voice in the debate; for Catholics, the magisterial teaching of the church holds a privileged position as it presents the authentic and perennial teaching of the church.""

""Every Catholic Christian has a moral responsibility to ensure that the personal dignity of migrants is upheld,"" the pastoral said. ""This responsibility includes personal dispositions rooted in the truth of the Gospel with its call to love our neighbor as we love ourselves.""

Some Catholics are asking, ""What does the pastoral reflection want us to do?""

It ""seeks to engage Catholics on a deeper level, beyond sound bites and political rhetoric,"" Walsh said. ""The teaching of the church is not opinion"" but is ""authoritative,"" he said, and this teaching — not the ""political platforms of both parties"" — should be used to help Catholics ""appropriately form their consciences.""

""The church does not advocate for open borders,"" he continued. ""A government has a duty to ensure that its citizens are protected. When people commit serious and sometimes violent crime, the government should and must act in those situations for the protection of society. However, the vast majority of those who have been here peacefully have adjusted well to life in the United States. Perhaps a pathway should be found for them to legalize their status.""

""Meaningful change comes not through 'quick fixes' but through long-term dedication to advocacy, hospitality, and accompaniment,"" the pastoral stated. ""The call to welcome the stranger challenges us to move beyond comfort and convenience, embracing a spirit of encounter that reflects the heart of the Gospel.""

""The bishops of this country have been engaging in the legislative process for many years for important immigration reform,"" Walsh told The Catholic Messenger. ""However, there does not really seem to be the political will or desire to fix the problem. It seems that politicians prefer to keep the problem for their political purposes rather than find real solutions.""

""First and foremost,"" the pastoral reflection stated, ""prayer must guide our personal and collective responses, asking God for the prudence to enact just policies and the grace to see Jesus in the faces of those seeking a better life.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-08/20250827T1656-IOWA-PASTORAL-IMMIGRATION-1803114%20%281%29.jpg?h=2832428a&itok=2V3jbrPH,N,,2025-08-28 13:57:01.704065

At least not according to a decision this week that rejected a motion to dismiss from Hannah Dugan, the Wisconsin state judge who’s charged with concealing from arrest and obstructing the apprehension of a person wanted by immigration authorities for removal.

Unless Dugan’s lawyers appeal and get the ruling reversed, it brings her a step closer to trial in one of the criminal cases the administration has touted in Trump’s second term. The decision comes as the administration is having a tough time getting cases off the ground in Washington, D.C., where federal prosecutors in Jeanine Pirro’s office have been unable to even secure indictments in cases alleging assaults on agents amid the federal takeover of the nation’s capital.

Unless Dugan’s lawyers appeal and get the ruling reversed, it brings her a step closer to trial.

In Dugan’s failed motion to dismiss, her lawyers cited the Trump immunity case while arguing that she “has both immunity from conviction and immunity from prosecution.” But U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman ruled that the separation of powers concerns that animated Trump v. United States, which focused on protecting the president, “do not arise when one of the nation’s many judges is subject to prosecution.”

While acknowledging that Dugan raised “very real concerns,” the Clinton appointee wrote that the judicial defendant doesn’t get immunity “simply because some of the allegations in the indictment describe conduct that could be considered ‘part of a judge’s job.’”

The federal judge set a scheduling hearing for Wednesday that could shed light on the next steps in the state judge’s case.

Dugan, who has pleaded not guilty, was arrested in April in what The New York Times called “a major escalation in the Trump administration’s battle with local authorities over deportations.” That battle and the Republican administration’s broader effort to use the law to exert power over Democratic-aligned cities, groups and people is still raging today.

In response to the ruling rejecting Dugan’s immunity claim, her lawyers said they were disappointed and that they “look forward to the trial which will show Judge Dugan did nothing wrong and simply treated this case like any other in front of her courtroom.”

If the case goes to trial, then that would be another difference between it and the prosecution that prompted the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling. The high court’s decision came in July 2024, and the justices instructed the trial judge to apply the new ruling to Trump’s case. Before that litigation could be completed, Trump’s electoral victory in November led the DOJ to drop the case, citing its policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-hannah-dugan-se-1126a-c488c2.jpg",N,,2025-08-28 12:57:22.589897

Not all are deportation flights.","Immigration advocates gather like clockwork outside Seattle's King County International Airport to witness deportation flights and spread word of where they are going and how many people are aboard. Until recently, they could keep track of the flights using publicly accessible websites.

But the monitors and others say airlines are now using dummy call signs for deportation flights and are blocking the planes' tail numbers from tracking websites, even as the number of deportation flights hits record highs under President Donald Trump. The changes forced them to find other ways to follow the flights, including by sharing information with other groups and using data from an open-source exchange that tracks aircraft transmissions.

Their work helps people locate loved ones who are deported in the absence of information from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which rarely discloses flights. News organizations have used such flight tracking in reporting.

Tom Cartwright, a retired J.P. Morgan financial officer turned immigration advocate, tracked 1,214 deportation-related flights in July — the highest level since he started watching in January 2020. About 80% are operated by three airlines: GlobalX, Eastern Air Express and Avelo Airlines. They carry immigrants to other airports to be transferred to overseas flights or take them across the border, mostly to Central American countries and Mexico.

Cartwright tracked 5,962 flights from the start of Trump's second term through July, a 41% increase of 1,721 over the same period in 2024. Those figures including information from major deportation airports but not smaller ones like King County International Airport, also known as Boeing Field. Cartwright's figures include 68 military deportation flights since January — 18 in July alone. Most have gone to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.

The work became so demanding that Cartwright, 71, and his group, Witness at the Border, turned over the job this month to Human Rights First, which dubbed its project ""ICE Flight Monitor.""

“His work brings essential transparency to U.S. government actions impacting thousands of lives and stands as a powerful example of citizen-driven accountability in defense of human rights and democracy,"" Uzrz Zeya, Human Rights First's chief executive officer, said.

The airlines did not respond to multiple email requests for comment. ICE is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which would not confirm any security measures it has taken.

La Resistencia, a Seattle-area nonprofit immigration rights group, has monitored 59 flights at Boeing Field and five at the Yakima airport in 2025, surpassing its 2024 total of 42.

Not all are deportation flights. Many are headed to or from immigration detention centers or to airports near the border. La Resistencia counted 1,023 immigrants brought in to go to the ICE detention center in Tacoma, Washington, and 2,279 flown out, often to states on the U.S.-Mexico border.

“ICE is doing everything in its power to make it as hard as possible to differentiate their contractors’ government activities from other commercial endeavors,” organizer Guadalupe Gonzalez told The Associated Press.

Airlines can legally block data

The Federal Aviation Administration allows carriers to block data like tail numbers from public flight tracking websites under the Limiting Aircraft Data Displayed program, or LADD, said Ian Petchenik, a spokesman for FlightRadar24.

“Tail numbers are like VIN numbers on cars,” Gonzalez said.

Planes with blocked tail numbers no longer appear on websites like FlightRadar24 or FlightAware. The tracker page identifies these them as “N/A - Not Available"" as they move across the map and when they are on the tarmac. Destinations and arrival times aren't listed.

Carriers have occasionally used LADD for things like presidential campaigns, but in March, FlightRadar24 received LADD notices for more than a dozen aircraft, Petchenik said. It was unusual to see that many aircraft across multiple airlines added to the blocking list, he said. The blocked planes were often used for ICE deportations and transfers, he said.

Of the 94 ICE Air contractor planes that La Resistencia was tracking nationwide, 40 have been unlisted, Gonzalez said.

Similar things happened with the call signs airlines use to identify flights in the air, Gonzalez said.

Airlines use a combination of letters in their company name and numbers to identify their planes. GlobalX uses GXA, for example. But in the past few months, the ICE carriers have changed their regular call signs, making it more difficult to locate their immigration activates, he said.

Cameras at Boeing Field help volunteers track flights

King County International Airport is one of the few sites in the country where passengers can be seen getting off and on the planes, thanks to county-operated cameras. Volunteers gather each time a flight arrives to count each person and note whether they struggle on the stairs or appear to have health issues.

ICE Air operations at Boeing Field started in 2011. The county set up cameras on the tarmac in 2023 after King County Executive Dow Constantine, having unsuccessfully tried to stop the ICE flights, issued an order requiring the county to track them at the airport. The county publishes monthly statistics on them.

The cameras record immigrants arriving on buses, being searched and being led up the stairs onto the planes. On Tuesday, one man who was hunched over shuffled down the bus' stairs and across the tarmac using a cane, then an officer helped him climb onto the plane, one step at a time.

Detainees must navigate the plane’s stairway with their ankles chained together. Their wrists are also chained, and those cuffs are connected to a chain around their waist, so they can’t raise their arms, hold the railing or take big steps, activist Stan Shikuma told the AP.

The video can be viewed live on a giant screen in a nearby building where advocates can watch people being taken off buses from the ICE Northwest detention center. It's also livestreamed on the county website.

“They’re patted down, head to toe, mouth examined, sometimes the chains are tightened before they’re allowed to board the plane,"" Shikuma said. ""People coming off the plane: same treatment.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/08/AP25238752100359-e1756318777309.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-28 13:57:06.656195

In the absence of any meaningful and sustained opposition, domestic or otherwise, the Taliban regime has consolidated its power in the years since 2021. Despite horrendous restrictions on women and girls, including a ban on female education beyond grade six, the Taliban regime’s power is buoyed by a combination of pragmatic, tacit and genuine endorsement at the regional level.

In April 2025, Russia’s supreme court suspended a ban on the Taliban, removing the group from Russia’s list of terror organizations. In July, Russia became the first – and so far the only – country to offer the Taliban government diplomatic recognition. Amir Khan Muttaqi, Taliban foreign minister, welcomed Moscow’s endorsement as ‘courageous’, arguing that this was simply accepting the reality in Afghanistan.

Reporting on Afghanistan has subsided as other conflicts, regions and issues have come to dominate headlines – except when it concerns Western domestic policy. Afghanistan returned to the UK news agenda when the Ministry of Defence admitted to dozens of data breaches concerning applications for relocation by Afghans who had worked with UK armed forces in Afghanistan.

The effects of sanctions

When the Taliban seized power, the internationally recognized government collapsed. The return of the Taliban and their self-proclaimed emirate (they officially refer to their government as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) in 2021 triggered the imposition of international sanctions because many Taliban leaders – now government officials – were on sanctions lists. These sanctions, primarily imposed by the UN and the US, are not aimed at Afghanistan as a country. Instead, they target individual Taliban leaders and entities, and predate the group’s 2021 return to power. The US under the Biden administration also froze around $7 billion of Afghan state reserve assets.

The result has been a crippling set of restrictions on Afghan institutions – including the banking sector – and the private sector. Sanctions have left Afghanistan isolated and without access to international financial institutions. Already one of the poorest and aid-dependent countries in the world, the sanctions have been devastating for ordinary Afghans.

Foreign development aid for Afghanistan’s long-term state-building efforts, infrastructure projects and development agendas is suspended. Instead, international assistance goes almost entirely to the humanitarian budget which the UN and other aid actors disperse so that – it is argued – international funds do not end up in Taliban hands. Humanitarian and UN agencies in the country have raised the alarm about mounting levels of acute malnutrition affecting children and the elderly. The situation has deteriorated further following the Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID, which has significantly reduced aid funding for Afghanistan.

Regional and international engagement

Afghanistan’s economic stagnation is partly linked to sanctions, but Afghanistan’s socio-economic crises predate the Taliban. With an estimated population of 40 million, Afghanistan has persistently ranked in the ‘low human development’ tier for decades. Lacking international legitimacy, Taliban leaders know they cannot afford unmanageable domestic resentment sparked by socio-economic pressures. This partly explains the Taliban regime’s continuing desire to engage with the United States and the West more broadly. Primarily, the Taliban would like to see Western engagement result in the unfreezing of Afghan state assets and the removal of sanctions – goals that warm relationships with countries like China and Russia have not achieved.

China and a host of other regional countries have established amicable relations with the Taliban government. But the financial vacuum left by the suspension of US-led Western development assistance remains unfilled. Taliban leaders have been pragmatic by continuing to highlight many regional countries’ main concern when it comes to Afghanistan: security. The Taliban government’s acceptance by regional states is a testament to the Taliban’s ability to project itself as the guarantor of security in Afghanistan.

Meanwhile, Western engagement on Taliban terms is unlikely, as it will mean discarding serious concerns about human rights – particularly women’s rights – in Afghanistan. However, there are signs of a changing political mood in parts of Europe. Norway and Germany already host Taliban-appointed officials in Afghan diplomatic missions to support consular services, while Switzerland reopened its key development agency’s office in Kabul this week, insisting the country was keen to support humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan.

This increasing engagement with Afghanistan is driven both by an acceptance that the Taliban government is here to stay and by domestic pressures around migration in the West – especially a push to deport failed Afghan asylum seekers from Europe. Senior British opposition figures in the Conservative Party have indicated they would be open to engaging the Taliban to facilitate such deportations. Taliban leaders would, unsurprisingly, be pleased by such developments.

Immediate prospects and challenges

The Taliban government has quashed any perceived or real opposition. Aside from its quest for external recognition, its main challenge is the socio-economic problems facing Afghanistan – and they are substantial.",https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_1200_630/public/2025-08/2025-08-28-afghanistan-taliban-2229427864.jpg?itok=ckfwLZuF,N,,2025-08-28 13:57:11.732012

The city of Rochester this week codified its sanctuary city policy. The step underscores the city’s resolve, but it may offer little protection against an administration determined to dismantle sanctuary measures nationwide and threaten the loss of federal funds.

Sanctuary cities have existed in the United States since the Reagan administration—City Council declared Rochester a “City of Sanctuary” in 1986—but they have come under attack by President Donald Trump. Executive orders have signaled his intention to compel jurisdictions to withdraw sanctuary status.

Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that seek to protect the safety and well-being of all residents by limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities, ensuring local resources remain focused on serving the community.

Rochester is not alone. It is among a group of cities, counties, and states that the federal government has targeted over the last several months, through lawsuits and threats.

The U.S. Department of Justice sued the city of Rochester in April as part of a nationwide effort to crack down on sanctuary municipalities. Similar lawsuits have been filed against New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, featuring a key argument: that sanctuary policies discriminate against federal immigration enforcement in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.

The Supremacy Clause establishes that the Constitution and federal law take precedence over conflicting state laws. While the federal government has used similar arguments in its lawsuits against sanctuary designations, they vary across cities, counties, and states. Cities like Chicago and New York explicitly refuse to detain individuals without a judicial warrant, and limit information sharing between local and federal agencies.

Rochester corporation counsel Patrick Beath’s initial response to the federal government’s lawsuit defends sanctuary policies under the 10th Amendment’s anti-commandeering doctrine: that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are reserved to the states.

“Sanctuary laws like Rochester’s are some of the clearest examples of policies protected by the anti-commandeering doctrine of the Constitution, and basically what that says is that the federal government is free to do what is within their power to do,” says Peter Markowitz, professor of law at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York City. “What they are not free to do is to conscript states and localities to do their jobs for them.”

Rochester’s sanctuary policy, updated in 2017 to include the LGBTQIA+ community, affirmed that:

■ the Rochester Police Department shall not engage in activities solely for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement, including inquiring about or investigating and making arrests regarding the immigration status of an individual;

■ city personnel shall not inquire about or request proof of immigration status when providing services or benefits; and

■ the city shall not use its funds or personnel to enforce or assist in federal immigration enforcement.

The ordinance City Council approved this week codifies previous resolutions and provides additional protections. According to councilmembers, the sanctuary city ordinance:

■ empowers the city to engage in budgeting and policy making to provide material support to immigrants and LGBTQIA+ community members impacted by federal attacks and discrimination;

■ makes it unlawful for RPD to engage in activities solely for the purpose of immigration enforcement, therefore creating a legal course of action;

■ establishes a pathway for discipline and removal of city employees who violate sanctuary laws, including a process for investigation and public reporting;

■ prohibits the use of city personnel and resources for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement;

■ includes pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive autonomy as protected statuses, as outlined in the state Equal Rights Amendment;

■ affords equal rights to LGBTQIA+ individuals, including accessing school athletic activities and receiving full health care, including gender-affirming care;

■ bars the sharing of city records with federal authorities targeting people based on immigration status, gender identity, or reproductive choices; and

■ establishes that sanctuary city protections are now binding on all residents and businesses in the city, as they’re now codified into municipal code.

The City Council action comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have continued to make arrests in Rochester. Rochester Police Department officers directly aided ICE in a civil arrest in March. When border czar Tom Homan visited the Locust Club in defense of local law enforcement, his message to Rochester and Mayor Malik Evans was clear.

“End your sanctuary city policies,” Homan said. “Work with us on public safety threats and national security threats that are in the country illegally. Your number one responsibility is the protection of your communities.”

Taking action

Sanctuary city policies, John Harland Giammatteo contends, actually make communities safer.

“They’re policies that generally make communities safer by removing the concern for individuals within that community that they will be subject to immigration enforcement if, for instance, they report a crime or if they call the local police for some reason, either as a witness or as a victim of crime,” says Giammatteo, associate professor of law at the University of Buffalo School of Law. “The federal government is still free to do as much enforcement as it wants to do. It is free to use its resources for that.”

Studies continue to support an underlying motivation behind sanctuary jurisdictions: that they promote trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement. A 2013 University of Illinois at Chicago survey of 2,004 Latino individuals living in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and Phoenix found that 44 percent of those surveyed said that increased local police involvement in immigration enforcement made them less likely to contact police officers if they were the victim of a crime for fear of inquiry into immigration status. Nearly half of those surveyed stated that they were less likely to report a crime or voluntarily offer information about it due to similar fears. And a 2017 study by the Center for American Progress concluded: “Crime is lower and economies are stronger in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary counties.”

“What we have seen over and over again is that when police departments, local police departments, are engaged in routine immigration enforcement, immigrant communities are afraid to come forward as witnesses and victims of crime, and that becomes an impediment to the police department’s primary law enforcement duty,” adds Markowitz. “Getting entangled in immigration enforcement undermines public safety and undermines the work of local police departments, which is why so many jurisdictions with robust immigrant communities have enacted laws like these to create a clear boundary between police and federal immigration authorities.”

In July, New York Attorney General Letitia James filed an amicus curiae brief in defense of Rochester, arguing that the police power reserved to states and their localities is protected under the principle of federalism, which grants distinct authority and autonomy to state governments. James and Beath follow a similar argument, contending that the 10th Amendment prohibits Congress from conscripting local officers and resources to assist with federal immigration enforcement.

“(An amicus curiae) basically means a ‘friend of the court’ brief,” explains Giammatteo. “These briefs provide additional perspectives, useful information, and often, you know, the views of another entity that isn’t a party to the lawsuit formally, but still might have some interest in it.”

Related briefs have been filed by the Immigration Reform Law Institute in support of the federal government, while the Ibero-American Action League, New Hope Free Methodist Church, Third Presbyterian Church, and Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies have submitted an amicus brief in defense of Rochester.

“I think it’s helpful to have the (state) attorney general on the side of Rochester … both Rochester and the attorney general’s arguments are quite strong,” says Giammatteo. “Sanctuary city policies are about that sovereignty within the state and locality, rather than instructing federal immigration officials to do one thing or the other. … It’s helpful to have New York on that, on the side of the defendants.”

While the trajectory of Rochester’s lawsuit remains unclear, U.S. District Judge Lindsay Jenskins dismissed a similar suit against Illinois, Cook County, and Chicago, arguing their sanctuary policies are protected under the 10th Amendment’s anti-commandeering doctrine.

“This is not the first time the federal government and the Trump administration has attempted to unlawfully undermine local sanctuary laws and policies,” says Markowitz. “They’re going to continue to lose over and over again, because sanctuary policies rely upon the bedrock principle in our Constitution that the federal government cannot draft states and localities into the federal government service. … I would expect that (Rochester’s) lawsuit would be similarly resolved in that way in the coming months.”

The ruling in Chicago remains the first setback in the Justice Department’s lawsuits against sanctuary policies. It has not altered the federal government’s efforts to end the use of sanctuaries nationwide.

The federal threat

In August, the Justice Department published an updated list of sanctuary cities, counties, and states, aiming to identify and pressure local governments to withdraw their policies. That threat has grown substantially with a letter sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to officials in various sanctuary jurisdictions, including Evans.

The letter, arguing that sanctuary policies obstruct federal immigration enforcement, references Executive Order 14287 in directing the attorney general to evaluate federal funding that could be withheld from Rochester should it not withdra w its policy. Bondi’s letter also states that individuals using their official position to obstruct federal immigration enforcement may be subject to criminal charges, and gives Evans and other officials across the nation a deadline to comply: Aug. 19.

That deadline has passed, with little noise from Bondi or the Justice Department. A response from Beath further affirms the arguments made in the city’s lawsuit, before raising concerns of ethical violations against the attorney general for contacting Evans without consulting counsel beforehand.

“Given this pending litigation, you—as counsel for the government of the United States—should have no direct communication with my clients without my prior permission,” wrote Beath. “The City intends to continue to fully comply with federal law while vigorously preserving its local autonomy and rights under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.”

“I completely agree with the city’s letter,” says Lenni Benson, distinguished chair in immigration and human rights law at the New York Law School. “This DOJ is not behaving with the limits and traditions of most prior administrations, from Reagan to Trump’s first (term). This was a clear ethical violation due to the pending litigation.”

In Printz v. United States, a case decided in 1997, the Supreme Court held that the federal government could not issue directives requiring state governments to address particular problems, nor command their officers to administer federal regulatory programs. However, a decade earlier, the court ruled in South Dakota v. Dole that Congress could attach conditions to federal funds to encourage cooperation. The amount of conditional funding, however, could not be disproportionate or coercive.

“We’re seeing a pattern across multiple different subject areas where the Trump administration is attempting to use statutes and authorities in sort of new ways to both outwardly threaten entities, whether governments, organizations, or museums, with the threat of legal sanction,” says Giammatteo, “but also try to attempt to scare (them) into complying with the political objectives of the Trump administration.”

Bondi’s letter is not the first time the Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal funding from sanctuary jurisdictions. The president’s first term saw a similar executive order challenged and thwarted by a lawsuit from the city and county of San Francisco.

Last week, U.S. District Judge William Orrick issued a preliminary injunction preventing the federal government from following through on its threat to withhold funding. Preliminary injunctions—a form of temporary court order—only serve to prevent irreparable harm from happening before the court reaches a final decision on a lawsuit.

“It’s a good sign if you can get a preliminary injunction,” explains Giammatteo, “but it might not (be) the final word.”

Funds at stake

Should the Trump administration be successful in its lawsuit against Rochester, the city would stand to lose over $81 million in federal funding, most of which comes from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. While the city’s most recent annual comprehensive financial report indicates it received the largest proportion of funding from COVID-19-related relief, no new awards were issued in 2025. Without that, the city’s primary source of federal funding falls under the Community Development Block Grants, which are used to develop affordable housing.

The city’s use of CDBG grants and other HUD funding is detailed in annual action plans as well as five-year consolidated planning documents. The final 2020-2024 Consolidated Plan states funding is intended to provide low- and moderate-income households with viable communities. Eligible activities include housing rehabilitation and preservation, affordable housing development, and community facilities and improvements. An estimated 70 percent of funds go toward these activities

Similar threats have been levied against Monroe County after County Executive Adam Bello announced the county’s participation in a lawsuit against the federal government over the potential loss of $9 million in grant funding over DEI policies.

“Enough is enough,” said Bello during an Aug. 21 press conference. “Monroe County is not going to be put in a position where we’re either going to lose millions of dollars in infrastructure dollars that go to our airport, or dismantle perfectly legal programs that are constitutional, that we’re allowed to have, that are actually working, and that were created in a bipartisan, unanimous way.”

“This type of threat is more like dark periods in our history,” Benson observes, comparing the threats leveled by the federal government to similar attempts to scare the public into coercion during the Red Scare and Cold War era. “These are not moments of pride.”

Evans’ office and City Council President Miguel Meléndez declined to comment.

The response

While Boston and Chicago’s mayors have responded to the Trump administration in full-throated defense of their sanctuary city policies, Evans has remained silent on the issue since a press conference held after the March incident with RPD officers. That response has angered community advocates who seek greater accountability and transparency from their local leaders.

“I would like to see our City Council and our mayor be a lot more vocal in their defense of our immigrant communities, because we have such strong immigrant communities here,” says LGBTQ+ rights advocate Mickey Di Perna. “It’s just a matter of are they willing to put their money where their mouth is? Are they willing to stand up to Trump? Are they willing to go an extra mile for their community?”

Di Perna has been a primary influence on strengthened legislation that would codify sanctuary protections for immigrant and LGBTQ+ communities, developing the bill alongside progressive City Councilmembers Kim Smith, Mary Lupien, and Stanley Martin. Di Perna joined Martin last week in a public meeting to discuss the ramifications of the bill and provide context for the federal government’s opposition.

“In order for any of this to ever take effect, it’s never going to be by the goodwill of people in office,” said Martin last week. “It’s going to have to be through public pressure.”

The motivation behind codifying protections was heightened after the March incident and garnered vocal public support in the months leading up to Tuesday’s vote. A rally held last week before August’s Speak to Council session saw a variety of speakers and advocates call on their councilmembers to defend their community by passing an ordinance that would both provide financial support to affected immigrant and LGBTQ+ communities and give Council the power to investigate and discipline city officials who violate sanctuary policies.

“Rochester needs to do everything it can to strengthen the sanctuary city ordinance. That’s not going to end the fear of people in our city who feel the targets on their backs, but it will show them that they’re not alone. That this city won’t abandon them,” said Marie Evans at the Speak to Council session. “We all need to reject the normalization of government terror. Refusal to resist what’s happening isn’t caution, it’s collaboration.”

Tuesday saw the body unanimously vote to strengthen protections—a key victory for the progressive caucus of Council and associated advocacy organizations that helped author the final version of the bill. With an amendment and input from the New York Civil Liberties Union, sanctuary protections now move from a citywide policy to a codified ordinance that is enforceable.

“I think this happened because of movement building,” said Martin after Tuesday’s vote. “We had the immigrant groups, we had folks supporting LGBTQ rights, and we had folks who just organized for the general well-being of our community. And it happened because everyone came together, including Council.”

In support of the legislation Tuesday evening, Meléndez affirmed that Rochester’s decision to strengthen its sanctuary protections—a decision that has come with significant legal hurdles—represents a statement of values.

“I’ve been asked why the Latino community hasn’t been more vocal locally. The truth is, people are vocal every day, though not always in public spaces,” said Meléndez. “Tonight I have the privilege of speaking in a public space on their behalf. We are doing this because it matters. It is important for our community to know where their elected leaders stand.”

It is unclear how the ordinance will affect the federal government’s lawsuit against the city. Yet the choice to strengthen sanctuary protections, for Markowitz, represents a commitment to community.

“There’s an element of some states and localities seeing the kind of misguided, brutal and inhumane nature of federal immigration enforcement today and saying, ‘We won’t be a party to this’,” says Markowitz. “It is devastating our communities. It is devastating our families. It is leaving children without parents. It is leaving businesses without workers. And it is sending human beings into some of the most brutal foreign kind of torture prisons that exist on earth today. And there are communities and local jurisdictions that have said, ‘We refuse to be a party to that.’”

New York School of Law’s Benson notes that it is clear that Rochester does not aim to impede the activities of the Department of Homeland Security or thwart federal immigration enforcement altogether.

“The AG and others can try to misdirect public attention to the cities that are not patrolling the streets with ICE and CBP,” says Benson. “But that is a false story, and a dangerous one.”

The escalation in arrests, military mobilization and lawsuits, Benson believes, is part of a larger approach: terrifying the population into submission, whether through voluntary departure or otherwise. Should the federal government be successful, it would not be unlikely to request that RPD begin to arrest individuals for immigration violations, or always respond to specific questions DHS asks.

“This suit against Rochester is part of the desire to create an intimidated community,” says Benson. “(The) people of Rochester should be proud of their city and state for acting calmly and carefully.”

The Department of Homeland Security has asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” said Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago.

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Details about the administration's plans for Chicago remain scarce.

Mogle said no decisions have been made on the request, and that the base hasn't received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

Chicago Mayor Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have fought back, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn't want or need the military's help. They are planning to sue.

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

“What he’s trying to do is try to inflame something that will cause a problem that he can then point at,” the two-term governor said, referring to President Donald Trump.

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago’s long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump's second inauguration.

Pritzker and Trump have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network.

Violent crime in the city has dropped significantly in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem.

In 2024, the city reported 573 homicides, the most of any U.S. city that year, according to the Rochester Institute of Technology. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by over 22% when compared with the same time period last year.

After declaring his “crime emergency” in D.C., Trump mandated a serious change in the mission of the National Guard.
A new Quinnipiac University national poll found that 56% of voters disapprove of the National Guard being deployed in D.C.","President Trump declared Tuesday that federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., should seek the death penalty for murders committed in the capital, claiming without explanation that “we have no choice.”

“That’s a very strong preventative,” he said of his decision. “I don’t know if we’re ready for it in this country, but we have it.”

Trump’s pronouncement is about much more than deterring killings, though. With speed and brazenness, Trump seems intent on creating a new, federal arrest and detention system outside of existing norms, aimed at everyday citizens and controlled by his whims. The death penalty is part of it, but stomping on civil rights is at the heart of it — ruthlessly exploiting anxiety about crime to aim repression at whatever displeases him, from immigration protesters to murderers.

This administration “is using the words of crime and criminals to get themselves a permission structure to erode civil rights and due processes across our criminal, legal and immigration systems in ways that I think should have everyone alarmed,” Rena Karefa-Johnson told me. She’s a former public defender who now works with Fwd.us, a bipartisan criminal justice advocacy group.

Authoritarians love the death penalty, and have long used it to repress not crime, but dissent. It is, after all, both the ultimate power and the ultimate fear, that the ruler of the state holds the lives of his people in his hands.

Though we are far from such atrocities, Spain’s purge of “communists” and other dissenters under Francisco Franco, Rodrigo Duterte’s extrajudicial killings of alleged drug dealers in the Philippines (though the death penalty remains illegal there) and the routine executions, even of journalists, under the repressive rulers in Saudi Arabia are chilling examples.

What each of those regimes shares in common with this moment in America is the rhetoric of making a better society — often by purging perceived threats to order — even if that requires force, or the loss of rights.

Suddenly, violent criminals become no different than petty criminals, and petty criminals become no different than immigrants or protesters. They are all a threat to a nostalgic lost glory of the homeland that must be restored at any cost, animals that only understand force.

“We have no choice.”

The result is that the people become, if not accustomed to masked agents and the military on our streets, too scared to protest it, fearful they will become the criminal target, the hunted animal.

Already, the National Guard in D.C. is carrying live weapons. With great respect to the women and men who serve in the Guard, and who no doubt individually serve with honor, they are not trained for domestic law enforcement. Forget the legalities, the Constitution and the Posse Comitatus Act, which should prevent troops from policing American citizens, and does prevent them from making arrests.

Who do we want these soldiers to shoot? Who have they been told to shoot? A kid with a can of spray paint? A pickpocket? A drug dealer? A flag burner? A sandwich thrower?

We don’t even know what their orders are. What choices they will have to make.

But we do know that police do not walk around openly holding their guns, and certainly do not stroll with rifles. For civilian law enforcement, their guns are defensive weapons, and they are trained to use them as such.

Few walking by these troops, even the most law abiding, can fail to feel the power of those weapons at the ready. It is a visceral knowledge that to provoke them could mean death. That is a powerful form of repression, meant to stop dissent through fear of repercussion.

It is a power that Trump is building on multiple fronts. After declaring his “crime emergency” in D.C., Trump mandated a serious change in the mission of the National Guard.

He ordered every state to train soldiers on “quelling civil disturbances,” and to have soldiers ready to rapidly mobilize in case of protests. That same executive order also creates a National Guard force ready to deploy nationwide at the president’s command — presumably taking away states’ rights to decide when to utilize their troops, as happened in California.

Trump has already announced his intention to send them to Chicago, called Baltimore a “hellhole” that also may be in need and falsely claimed that, “in California, you would’ve not had the Olympics had I not sent in the troops” because “there wouldn’t be anything left” without their intervention.

Retired Maj. Gen. Randy Manner, a former acting vice chief of the National Guard Bureau, told ABC that “the administration is trying to desensitize the American people to get used to American armed soldiers in combat vehicles patrolling the streets of America. “

Manner called the move “extremely disturbing.”

Add to that Trump’s desire to imprison opponents. In recent days, the FBI raided the home of former National Security Advisor John Bolton, a Republican who has criticized Trump, especially on his policy toward Ukraine. Then Trump attempted to fire Lisa D. Cook, a Biden appointee to the Federal Reserve board, after accusing her of mortgage fraud in another apparent attempt to bend that independent agency to his will on the economy.

On Wednesday, Trump wrote on social media that progressive billionaire George Soros and his son Alex should be charged under federal racketeering laws for “their support of Violent Protests.”

“We’re not going to allow these lunatics to rip apart America any more, never giving it so much as a chance to “BREATHE,” and be FREE,” Trump wrote. “Soros, and his group of psychopaths, have caused great damage to our Country! That includes his Crazy, West Coast friends. Be careful, we’re watching you!”

Consider yourselves threatened, West Coast friends.

But of course, we are already living under that thunder. Dozens of average citizens are facing serious charges in places including Los Angeles for their participation in immigration protests.

Whether they are found guilty or not, their lives are upended by the anxiety and expense of facing such prosecutions. And thousands are being rounded up and deported, at times seemingly grabbed solely for the color of their skin, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, arguably the most Trump-loyal law enforcement agency, sees its budget balloon to $45 billion, enough to keep 100,000 people detained at a time.

Despite Trump’s maelstrom of dread-inducing moves, resistance is alive, well and far from futile.

A new Quinnipiac University national poll found that 56% of voters disapprove of the National Guard being deployed in D.C.

This week, the U.S. attorney’s office in D.C. for a second time failed to convince a grand jury to indict a man who threw a submarine sandwich at federal officers — proof that average citizens not only are sane, but willing to stand up for what is right.

That comes after a grand jury three times rejected the same kind of charge against a woman who was arrested after being shoved against a wall by an immigration agent.

Californians will decide this in November whether to redraw their electoral maps to put more Democrats in Congress. Latino leaders in Chicago are protesting possible troops there. People are refusing to allow fear to define their actions.

A new detention facility, with plans to be the biggest in the country, is now open on a military base in Texas.

On the outskirts of El Paso’s Fort Bliss, you can see a sprawling tent city taking shape. It is President Trump’s newest immigration detention facility — Camp East Montana. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, said she recently toured the site, which opened earlier this month and currently houses nearly 1,000 adults.

“I am very concerned that there are not enough Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel who have been trained by the federal government and have done this for a living for their full career. I'm concerned that there are not as many federal personnel on site to provide oversight as we should have,” Escobar said at a press conference.

“We have limited resources in our community, and this is definitely a strain on local resources, whether they be medical resources or utility resources,” she continued.

The Trump administration says the detention center will eventually hold 5,000 undocumented immigrants, which would make it the country’s largest immigration detention center.

“The Fort Bliss Facility will offer everything a traditional ICE detention facility offers, including access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation, recreational space, medical treatment space and nutritionally balanced meals. It also provides necessary accommodations for disabilities, diet, and religious beliefs,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to Spectrum News.

Reportedly, Camp East Montana will cost $1.26 billion.

“I want you to think about how much good that money could do in El Paso if it were spent on the community, if it were spent on access to child care for El Paso kids, if it were spent on universal pre-K for El Paso kids, if it were spent on health care for El Pasoans,” Escobar said. “There is a tremendous amount of good that that money could do for El Pasoans, but it is instead being used to fund mass deportation by the Trump administration.”

The president’s signature policy law spends big on his immigration and border security agenda. It includes more than $150 billion over the next four years, with $45 billion to build immigration detention centers. All the Texas Republicans in Congress backed it.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, recently visited the facility, which he dubbed the Lone Star Lockup.

“There will be whatever we need in order to restore the rule of law and order to our immigration system,” Cornyn told journalists.

He said he is confident ICE will operate the site humanely and safely. Cornyn said Trump is following through on what he campaigned on, removing those with no legal right to be in the country.

""Many of my Democratic colleagues said we needed to pass new laws in order to control the border, when the truth is we needed a new president,"" Cornyn said.

The El Paso County Republican Party chairman, Michael Aboud, agreed.

“It's good for the state of Texas and for the nation as a whole, because that facility gives law enforcement the ability to bring people who are here illegally, a central location that they can keep track of them. It also is good for the immigrants, because it gives them a safe place to be while they're waiting to go back home,” Aboud told Spectrum News.

The Trump administration is seeking to more than double the number of immigrants it can hold in detention facilities to at least 100,000 people.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.

The Department of Homeland Security has asked Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support in the form of facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,” said Matt Mogle, spokesperson for the base 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of Chicago.

The request came weeks after the Republican administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Details about the administration's plans for Chicago remain scarce.

Mogle said no decisions have been made on the request, and that the base hasn't received an official request to support a National Guard deployment. The Chicago Sun-Times first reported on the request to the Navy base.

Chicago Mayor Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker have fought back, saying crime has fallen in Chicago and that the city doesn't want or need the military's help. They are planning to sue.

Pritzker, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has spent days showcasing parts of the city where crime has fallen. He told The Associated Press that the presence of troops could worsen the situation.

“What he’s trying to do is try to inflame something that will cause a problem that he can then point at,” the two-term governor said, referring to President Donald Trump.

Trump has often singled out Chicago, likening it to a war zone and “hellhole.” Chicago’s long-held status as a so-called sanctuary city has irked the Trump administration, which used Chicago to kick off a nationwide crackdown on immigration weeks after Trump's second inauguration.

Pritzker and Trump have traded barbs over the issue for days.

“The people are desperate for me to STOP THE CRIME, something the Democrats aren’t capable of doing,” Trump posted Thursday on his Truth Social network.

Violent crime in the city has dropped significantly in recent years, but it remains a persistent problem.

In 2024, the city reported 573 homicides, the most of any U.S. city that year, according to the Rochester Institute of Technology. At the same time, violent crime dropped significantly in the first half of the year, representing the steepest decline in over a decade, according to city data. In the first six months of 2025, total violent crime dropped by over 22% when compared with the same time period last year.

The Tennessee Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence has long provided legal help to immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking.

Effective June 30, however, the nonprofit’s immigrant legal clinic permanently closed after the Tennessee Office of Criminal Justice Programs, which decides how to allocate federal crime victim dollars, ended immigrant legal aid grants.

Jennifer Escue, the coalition’s CEO, said the elimination of grants will leave already vulnerable victims with few legal alternatives.

“The major concern is that this just drives these communities deeper underground,” Escue said. “They’re not going to get help, they’re not going to report and it’s one more thing their abusers can hold over them.”

The organization’s legal clinic provided victims without legal immigration status help in applying for special visas set aside for domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking victims who are cooperating with police.

Visas that provide temporary legal status – and a pathway to lawful permanent residence – have long been made available to certain crime victims, in part so they are willing to help law enforcement pursue perpetrators without fear of deportation.

Visas are also made available to victims out of a recognition that an abusive spouse may hold the key to a partner’s immigration status as a sponsor of their immigration application, or may be using the threat of reporting a victim to immigration authorities as a tool to buy silence about the abuse.

Escue’s organization provided legal services and representation to about 150 new victims each year and ongoing legal work for 400 to 500 others through a visa petition process she said can take a decade or more to complete.

The loss of the funding – $137,000 annually for the coalition – comes as other immigration lawyers and legal organizations experience crushing demands and wait lists amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, leaving victims with few alternatives.

“We had to refer them to new representation which is of course difficult to find, because there were never enough immigrant legal services, especially low cost or, in our case, free.” Escue said.

Emily Stotts, legal director for the nonprofit Justice for our Neighbors, said her nonprofit organization already had a high volume of immigrant victims when the coalition’s legal clinic closed. They are now seeing some of the coalition’s former clients, she said.

“We still have to turn away a lot of people who are seeking assistance especially through the U visa,” which was established as a pathway to legal immigration status for victims in order to help law enforcement investigate and prosecute crimes.

Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

“We already had a capacity issue and this is aggravating the capacity issue,” Stotts said.

Asked to provide a reason for the grant funding cut, Jennifer Brinkman, executive director for the Office of Criminal Justices Programs, said the “contract which provided this funding had reached its end date and was not renewed.”

But the decision to end funding for immigrant legal services comes as the Trump administration attaches more strings to federal Victims of Crime Act funding that federal officials have explicitly said are in support of the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Among them is a new requirement that states receiving the funding, and the nonprofits that accept it, cooperate with federal immigration enforcement activities.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss.
Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases.
At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18.","WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump's administration last month awarded a contract worth up to $1.2 billion to build and operate what it says will become the nation’s largest immigration detention complex, it didn’t turn to a large government contractor or even a firm that specializes in private prisons.

Instead, it handed the project on a military base to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small business that has no listed experience running a correction facility and had never won a federal contract worth more than $16 million. The company also lacks a functioning website and lists as its address a modest home in suburban Virginia owned by a 77-year-old retired Navy flight officer.

The mystery over the award only deepened last week as the new facility began to accept its first detainees. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract or explain why it selected Acquisition Logistics over a dozen other bidders to build the massive tent camp at Fort Bliss in west Texas. At least one competitor has filed a complaint.

The secretive — and brisk — contracting process is emblematic, experts said, of the government’s broader rush to fulfill the Republican president's pledge to arrest and deport an estimated 10 million migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal status. As part of that push, the government is turning increasingly to the military to handle tasks that had traditionally been left to civilian agencies.

A member of Congress who recently toured the camp said she was concerned that such a small and inexperienced firm had been entrusted to build and run a facility expected to house up to 5,000 migrants.

“It’s far too easy for standards to slip,” said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss. “Private facilities far too frequently operate with a profit margin in mind as opposed to a governmental facility.”

Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law, said he was troubled that the Trump administration has provided so little information about the facility.

“The lack of transparency about this contract leads to legitimate questions about why the Army would award such a large contract to a company without a website or any other publicly available information demonstrating its ability to perform such a complicated project,” he said.

Ken A. Wagner, the president and CEO of Acquisition Logistics, did not respond to phone messages or emails. No one answered the door at his three-bedroom house listed as his company’s headquarters. Virginia records list Wagner as an owner of the business, though it's unclear whether he might have partners.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved using Fort Bliss for the new detention center, and the administration has hopes to build more at other bases. A spokesperson for the Army declined to discuss its deal with Acquisition Logistics or reveal details about the camp’s construction, citing the litigation over the company’s qualifications.

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the detention camp it oversees.

Named Camp East Montana for the closest road, the facility is being built in the sand and scrub Chihuahuan Desert, where summertime temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit and heat-related deaths are common. The 60-acre (24-hectare) site is near the U.S.-Mexico border and the El Paso International Airport, a key hub for deportation flights.

The camp has drawn comparisons to “Alligator Alcatraz,” a $245 million tent complex erected to hold ICE detainees in the Florida Everglades. That facility has been the subject of complaints about unsanitary conditions and lawsuits. A federal judge recently ordered that facility to be shut down.

The vast majority of the roughly 57,000 migrants detained by ICE are housed at private prisons operated by companies like Florida’s Geo Group and Tennessee-based CoreCivic. As those facilities fill up, ICE is also exploring temporary options at military bases in California, New York and Utah.

At Fort Bliss, construction began within days of the Army issuing the contract on July 18. Site work began months earlier, before Congress had passed Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, which includes a record $45 billion for immigration enforcement. The Defense Department announcement specified only that the Army was financing the initial $232 million for the first 1,000 beds at the complex.

Three white tents, each about 810 feet (250 meters) long, have been erected, according to satellite imagery examined by The Associated Press. A half dozen smaller buildings surround them.

Setareh Ghandehari, a spokesperson for the advocacy group Detention Watch, said the use of military bases hearkens back to World War II, when Japanese Americans were imprisoned at Army camps including Fort Bliss. She said military facilities are especially prone to abuse and neglect because families and loved ones have difficulty accessing them.

“Conditions at all detention facilities are inherently awful,” Ghandehari said. “But when there’s less access and oversight, it creates the potential for even more abuse.”

A June 9 solicitation notice for the Fort Bliss project specified the contractor will be responsible for building and operating the detention center, including providing security and medical care. The document also requires strict secrecy, ordering the contractor inform ICE to respond to any calls from members of Congress or the news media.

The bidding was open only to small firms such as Acquisition Logistics, which receives preferential status because it's classified as a veteran and Hispanic-owned small disadvantaged business.

Though Trump's administration has fought to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs, federal contracting rules include set-asides for small businesses owned by women or minorities. For a firm to compete for such contracts, at least 51% of it must be owned by people belonging to a federally designated disadvantaged racial or ethnic group.

One of the losing bidders, Texas-based Gemini Tech Services, filed a protest challenging the award and the Army’s rushed construction timeline with the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress’ independent oversight arm that resolves such disputes.

Gemini alleges Acquisition Logistics lacks the experience, staffing and resources to perform the work, according to a person familiar with the complaint who wasn't authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Acquisition Logistics' past jobs include repairing small boats for the Air Force, providing information technology support to the Defense Department and building temporary offices to aid with immigration enforcement, federal records show.

Gemini and its lawyer didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

A ruling by the GAO on whether to sustain, dismiss or require corrective action is not expected before November. A legal appeal is also pending with a U.S. federal court in Washington.

Schnell, the contracting lawyer, said Acquisitions Logistics may be working with a larger company. Geo Group Inc. and CoreCivic Corp., the nation’s biggest for-profit prison operators, have expressed interest in contracting with the Pentagon to house migrants.

In an earnings call this month, Geo Group CEO George Zoley said his company had teamed up with an established Pentagon contractor. Zoley didn't name the company, and Geo Group didn’t respond to repeated requests asking with whom it had partnered.

A spokesperson for CoreCivic said it wasn't partnering with Acquisition Logistics or Gemini.

Places that were off limits before for Border Patrol agents or ICE agents are no longer off limits,” certified immigration specialist Lilia Velasquez said.
Hospitals are the latest location where ICE agents have attempted to carry out immigration detentions.
Velasquez said fear often discourages migrants from seeking care, but she says nothing is more important than their health and wellbeing.
The California Hospital Association said a statement to NBC 7, in part, “There is a special trust between patients and health care providers, and no one should ever be afraid to seek care for themselves or their loved ones because they fear being deported.”","As the Trump administration ramps up mass deportations, the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents has become more common at hospitals.

“One thing is for sure. Places that were off limits before for Border Patrol agents or ICE agents are no longer off limits,” certified immigration specialist Lilia Velasquez said.

Velasquez has dealt with a wide range of immigration cases, but there’s one that is hard for her to forget.

“I’ve had a case where the person was diabetic, was doing dialysis, but had no medical insurance, and he had an order of deportation,"" Velasquez said. ""They went to the hospital, and they wanted to disconnect them from the dialysis machine, saying, 'We’re going to deport you right now.' I had to go speak with the agents and say, 'You cannot do that. Don’t you have a heart? This person is going to die. You cannot unplug him.'""

Hospitals are the latest location where ICE agents have attempted to carry out immigration detentions.

“I’m not aware of that situation happening yet, but it’s important for hospital personnel to understand what the limits are of what agents can and can’t do when they enter a hospital,” immigration advocate Pedro Rios said.

According to the California Hospital Association, California and federal health information privacy laws prohibit hospitals, doctors and other health providers from disclosing patient information to ICE officers, unless the patient signs a form authorizing the release of information or the officer provides a valid subpoena or judicial warrant signed by a judge.

Rios said patients with a precarious immigration status have the right to request that their personal information remains private, but there is still a level of risk involved.

“One way that federal agents may go around that is if they know that the person they are looking for is at the hospital is they could obtain a judicial warrant that would allow them then access to a hospital room where the person they are looking for is currently at,” Rios said.

In a statement to NBC 7, Sharp Health said in part, ""Existing California laws protect all individuals’ rights to access medical care, regardless of their immigration status, and Sharp Staff are trained in policies relevant to law enforcement interactions within our facilities.""

Velasquez said fear often discourages migrants from seeking care, but she says nothing is more important than their health and wellbeing.

“A person should not die because they’re afraid to go to the clinic, or to see the doctor, or to the emergency room,” Velasquez said.

Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps.","B. said he left Cameroon nine years ago because he was scared for his life. Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.

B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.

But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.

“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”

SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.

“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.

“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.

Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.

But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.

They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.

“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”

Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.

“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.

‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.

Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.

“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”

According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.

In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.

The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.

“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.

“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”

‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.

Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.

“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”

Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.

Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.

“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers a variable amount of monthly cash assistance through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.

In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.

The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.

Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.

“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”

B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.

Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the lawsuit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.","A federal judge on Aug. 26 threw out the Trump administration‘s lawsuit against Maryland’s entire federal bench over an order by the chief judge that stopped the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals.

U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Cullen granted a request by the judges to toss the case, saying to do otherwise “would run counter to overwhelming precedent, depart from longstanding constitutional tradition, and offend the rule of law.”

“In their wisdom, the Constitution’s framers joined three coordinate branches to establish a single sovereign,” Cullen wrote. “That structure may occasionally engender clashes between two branches and encroachment by one branch on another’s authority. But mediating those disputes must occur in a manner that respects the Judiciary’s constitutional role.”

The White House had no immediate comment.

Cullen was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2020. He sits in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the case because all 15 of Maryland’s federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s harsh response to judges who slow or stop its policies.

Cullen expressed skepticism of the lawsuit during a hearing in August. He questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue all the judges as a means of challenging the order.

Signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III in the District of Maryland, the order prevents the Trump administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in Maryland district court. It blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The order says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.”

The Justice Department, which filed the suit in June, says the automatic pause violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president’s authority to enforce immigration laws. The department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking Trump’s agenda, repeatedly accusing federal judges of improperly impeding his powers.

The lawsuit was an extraordinary legal maneuver, ratcheting up the administration’s fight with the federal judiciary.

Attorneys for the Maryland judges argued the lawsuit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the Trump administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” attorney Paul Clement said during the hearing. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement is a prominent conservative lawyer who served as solicitor general under Republican President George W. Bush. He listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges said the government was simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

In an amended order pausing deportations, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

Attorneys for the Trump administration accused the Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, writing in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the Trump administration in March illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2025/05/TRUMP-EXITING-PLANE-scaled-1.webp,N,,2025-08-28 08:56:17.790911

“This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision.
Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.","A federal judge Tuesday threw out what he called a “novel and potentially calamitous” attempt by the Trump administration to sue the entire federal court in Maryland over an order that put a two-day pause on deportations.

When a party disagrees with a court action, there is “a tried-and-true recourse,” wrote Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia — file an appeal. But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk, and the court itself.

Given recent conflicts between the White House and the courts, “it’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely,” wrote Cullen, who was nominated by Trump in 2019. “Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”

But judges enjoy broad immunity for judicial acts, wrote Cullen in a 37-page ruling, adding that when co-equal branches of government are involved, “there is no right — express or implied — to litigate that grievance in this manner.”

“Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” wrote Cullen, who was assigned the case because of the conflict of Maryland judges hearing it.

The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Judge George L. Russell III, chief judge of the Maryland district and the prime target of the administration’s lawsuit.

It was Russell’s order in May that sparked the lawsuit. Faced with a flood of habeas corpus petitions from immigrants facing deportation under the administration’s amped-up immigration enforcement, Russell ordered that deportations of those petitioning the court would be put on hold for at least two days, so that judges could schedule and review their cases.

On June 25, the Justice Department announced that it filed a complaint against the Maryland District Court judges, arguing that they had exceeded their authority with the 48-hour freeze on deportations because it interfered with the administration’s exclusive right to enforce immigration law.

“President Trump’s executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a written statement at the time. “The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.”

But Cullen agreed with the Maryland judges that the Trump administration chose the wrong avenue to raise its issues with Russell’s order.

“If these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,” Cullen said. “And under normal circumstances, it would not be surprising if the Executive raised these concerns through the channels Congress prescribed — that is, by challenging the orders as applied to a particular habeas proceeding through a direct appeal to the Fourth Circuit or, as expressly authorized by federal statute, by petitioning the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify local court rules.”

“All of this isn’t to say that the Executive is without any recourse; far from it,” Cullen wrote. “If the Executive truly believes that Defendants’ standing orders violate the law, it should avail itself of the tried-and-true recourse available to all federal litigants: It should appeal.”

Stunt?

Mark Graber, regents professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, believes that the case was more of a stunt than an earnest legal challenge from the Trump administration.

“Issuing an injunction against judges is a guaranteed loser,” he said. “What the Trump people were trying to accomplish may simply to have been noise and publicity … Whether they really thought they could ever win this case is doubtful — and if somebody thought that they should ever win that case, that person should be fired for incompetence.”

Graber said that allowing the case to move forward would have “fundamentally changed the way our judicial system works.”

“The implications would be startling,” he said. “This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision. That’s not the way the separation of powers works. There’s a judicial system; it has a way of correcting errors – it’s called appeals.”

Graber compared the case to being charged for a crime in Maryland and then asking a judge in another state to issue an injunction against the judge who handed down the sentence.

“This is Law 101 — it is Law 101 to the point where virtually all non-lawyers know this,” he said.

Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.

“What the Trump administration is claiming – and this is not a horrible legal argument – is that the court could only issue orders with respect to the people before the court,” Graber said.

“There’s a legitimate debate on this, and if they appealed it, who knows what the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court would have done?” he said. “The problem is they didn’t appeal it in the normal way.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/maryland-IMG_7527-2048x1720-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 10:56:48.849688

It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It’s putting a spotlight on Trump’s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It’s a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president’s deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump’s administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans hold firm even as public opinion shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump’s success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We’ve never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it’s one of the most secure southern borders we’ve had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they’re out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump’s approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There’s still a search for consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America’s security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration’s handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we’ll see if now’s the time.”

Agents with the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection would be housed at Naval Station Great Lakes near North Chicago from Sept. 2-30, according to an email Monday from Navy Cpt. Stephen Yargosz to his leadership team.

“These operations are similar to what occurred in Los Angeles earlier this summer. Same DHS team,” wrote Yargosz, the commanding officer of Naval Station Great Lakes. “This morning I received a call that there is the potential to also support National Guard units. Not many details on this right now. Mainly a lot of concerns and questions.”

He said the operation would focus on “downtown Chicago,” and a formal “request for assistance” still required approval from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Two sources with knowledge of the email confirmed it’s authentic.

Local leaders in the dark

Trump has threatened to send troops to Chicago to get a handle on what he has characterized as rampant crime and lawlessness — a move that Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have deemed unnecessary given that crime has fallen significantly.

Pritzker, Johnson and Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth said they hadn’t gotten any information about the planning.

“We know that Donald Trump bringing in ICE and other federal enforcement to Chicago isn’t about ‘law and order’ because he is once again refusing to coordinate with our local officials,” said Duckworth, a retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who lost her legs in an attack on her helicopter during the Iraq War.

“Forcing the military, uninvited, into Chicago to intimidate Americans in their own communities does not make our nation stronger, it simply distracts the military from executing its core mission of keeping Americans safe from real adversaries who wish us harm. It’s yet another unwarranted, unwanted and unjust move straight out of the authoritarian’s playbook that will only undermine our military’s readiness and ultimately weaken our national security.”

Durbin said state and local leaders “have not asked for or consented to President Trump bringing in the military to ‘save’ our city.”

“And now he reportedly wants to further abuse his power, waste government resources, and undermine military readiness by using Naval Station Great Lakes as a center of his operation in Illinois,” Durbin said. “May I remind the President that deploying the military to Chicago, and derailing critical operations at Naval Station Great Lakes, would be both unhelpful and illegal.”

At a news conference Wednesday, Pritzker acknowledged he had “received no calls from the White House, from the federal government, from anybody who might be in charge of some sort of troop movement.”

“We only know so much,” he said. “Right now, it’s hard to tell. We haven’t seen troop movements yet. We also haven’t seen any call up of our National Guard. But we are on guard, hoping that that does not happen.”

A DHS spokesperson wouldn’t answer questions, but claimed the Trump administration is “going to make our streets and cities safe again.”

“Across the country, DHS law enforcement are arresting and removing the worst of worst including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists that have terrorized American communities,” the spokesperson said in a statement. “Under [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem, ICE and CBP are working overtime to deliver on the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe again.”

The White House wouldn’t comment, deferring to immigration officials. ICE, CBP and the Defense Department didn’t respond to questions.

In recent days, Trump has vacillated between bluster, disparagement and deference to Pritzker. The president renewed his threats on Tuesday, saying Pritzker should be asking for his support — just a day after he said he wouldn’t send federal resources unless the governor requested help.

“I’m not a dictator, I just know how to stop crime,” Trump said at a televised cabinet meeting. “But [Pritzker] should be calling me and he should be saying, ‘Could you send over the troops, please? It’s out of control.’”

Pritzker, Johnson and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul have said they are exploring all legal options in the face of a possible federal deployment to Chicago.

Trump has already federalized the police force in Washington, D.C. and has deployed federal law enforcement agents and thousands of National Guard troops, some carrying firearms, to the nation’s capitol to make stops and arrests.

In June, 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were deployed in Los Angeles to quell protests against federal immigration arrests, according to the Associated Press. Between 250 and 300 guard troops remain and have been activated through November, though California has sued the Trump administration over the deployment.

Questions about legality

Chicago was top on Trump’s list as a potential next target for a military takeover, along with several other Democrat-led cities, such as New York and Baltimore. The Washington Post recently reported that the Pentagon had been planning a military intervention in Chicago for weeks.

The scale and legality of the planned operation and the role of staff at the base remained unclear, according to a source with knowledge of the planning

Another source familiar with the plan told the Sun-Times about 30 to 40 ICE agents had been practicing riot control tactics at the military installation for months, using flash-bang grenades and marching in phalanxes with shields. The source said the planned operation would likely involve more agents than had been previously running drills, noting that the barracks can house 200 people.

Federal agents would be given control of Building 617, which houses the Navy College Learning Center and the Morale, Welfare and Recreation Library, according to Yargosz’s email.

He told his staff to “stay clear of DHS vehicles and equipment and act professionally.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf8c0ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F46%2F25%2F074c78e94baab6c4d773b4986ddf%2Ficenavy-082725-15.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 11:59:53.559414

Canada must be committed to upholding human rights and restoring justice in the immigration system.

Over the past year, the federal government has rolled out a series of policy changes that tighten and securitize every major immigration stream—decisions which deepen long-standing inequities in the system. Racialized migrants and refugees, women, 2SLGBTQI+ people and disabled persons, many of whom rely on community sponsorships, open work permits or low-wage streams, now face longer family separations, greater precarity and heightened surveillance.

Over the last two decades, Canada moved decisively towards “two-step” immigration. It does so by selecting permanent immigration candidates primarily from among temporary study and work permit holders. The cumulative effect is an immigration and refugee architecture that claims to celebrate diversity while operationalising exclusion, reinforcing historic patterns of racism and structural disadvantage—even as Canada brands itself an immigration success story.

By entrenching precarity and racialized gatekeeping, Canada undermines its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The federal government must re-align its migration framework with human rights principles, equity, and global justice.

Overview

Federal policymakers introduced extensive changes to immigration rules over the past 12 months. In September 2024, Ottawa announced a two-year cap that will cut new study-permit approvals to 437,000 for 2025 and curtail spousal work-permit eligibility, part of a wider plan to drive the share of temporary residents from seven per cent down to five per cent of Canada’s population. The October 2024 Immigration Levels Plan lowered permanent-resident targets by almost 20 per cent (to 395,000 in 2025) and formalised ceilings on temporary residents , while January 2025 allocations imposed a further 10 per cent drop in study permits. Other measures restricted open work permits for spouses and dependants of most international students and low-wage workers (Jan 2025). These shifts have left thousands of students and workers scrambling for status, as asylum claims by international students alone jumped 22 per cent in the first quarter of 2025 as other pathways closed.

Policymakers simultaneously narrowed refugee streams, implementing a temporary pause on private “Groups of Five” sponsorships (in which five Canadians together can “sponsor” a displaced person) from November 2024 to December 2025. Expired Refugee Protection Claimant Documents were declared invalid after April 2025, adding paperwork hurdles for people already waiting years for hearings. Ottawa simultaneously launched a multilingual digital campaign warning potential claimants about Canada’s “difficult” asylum process, and granted officers new powers to cancel visas, study permits and work permits on the spot (Feb 2025).

Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act introduced on 3 June 2025, would dramatically expand executive control over immigration. It proposes to grant cabinet the authority to pause, terminate or cancel entire classes of applications (as opposed to individual cases) or existing immigration documents “in the public interest,” and introduces stringent new requirements on the timing limits for making certain refugee claims. The bill also bolsters cross-border intelligence-sharing, lets Canada Post and CBSA open mail, and gives the Coast Guard police-style enforcement powers.

Canada also continues to be a signatory to the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA), which bars asylum seekers from making refugee claims if they have already set foot in a designated safe country—a designation it applies the U.S., despite that country having closed nearly all refugee intake streams. Despite the U.S. government’s recent predilection to send migrants to overseas concentration camps in places like El Salvador, Djibouti, and Guantanamo Bay, the Canadian government continues to designate the U.S. as a “safe” country for refugees—effectively preventing large numbers of asylum seekers from making legitimate claims in Canada.

Actions

Refugee protection and asylum

The AFB will rescind the Canada–U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA). The agreement undermines equitable refugee protection; the U.S. is not a safe country for all asylum seekers.

The AFB will withdraw Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act.

The AFB will end immigration detention. In the interim, the AFB will implement alternatives to detention, such as community-based supervision models managed in partnership with non-profit organizations.

Status and regularization

The AFB will launch a comprehensive regularization program for everyone with undocumented or precarious immigration status—including a one-step Permanent Residency pathway for undocumented individuals, rejected claimants, and people on precarious temporary status.

The AFB will restore permanent-resident targets and dismantle the “two-step” system. It would reverse the shift to mass temporary migration.

The AFB will reinvest in robust humanitarian, family-class, and economic immigration.

The AFB will guarantee permanent-status-on-arrival and open work permits for all workers.

The AFB will guarantee a predictable permanent residence pathway for study permit holders who were made ineligible because of immigration policy and regulation changes.

The AFB will eliminate closed/employer-specific permits for all foreign worker programs, including temporary foreign workers, to ensure labour mobility and full legal protection.

Labour rights and mobility

The AFB will establish binding national employment standards and housing regulations for migrant agricultural and low-wage workers as recommended in the guidance document, “National Housing Standards for Migrant Agricultural Workers.”

The AFB will ensure full access to federal benefits and social insurance (such as Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan, and so on, for all contributors regardless of immigration status, including migrant workers.

Justice and due process

The AFB will reform criminal inadmissibility and end immigration consequences of minor charges or protest-related arrests.

The AFB will introduce humanitarian discretion, a right of appeal, and a ban on deporting anyone brought to Canada as a child, regardless of immigration status.

The AFB will mandate an independent racial-equity audit of the entire immigration and refugee system.

The AFB will investigate systemic disparities in approval rates by country of origin, particularly for African, Caribbean, and Black applicants. As a result of that study, the AFB will mandate corrective measures, transparency, and binding equity reforms at IRCC and partner agencies as needed.

Health and human rights

The AFB will guarantee universal, provincial/territorial health coverage and treatment to all migrants living in Canada regardless of immigration status, including for people who are undocumented.

The AFB will guarantee culturally informed mental-health coverage and services to all migrants living in Canada regardless of immigration status, including for people who are undocumented.

The AFB will legislate national standards for Interim Federal Health Program and direct provider compensation to remove barriers to care and treatment for refugees and refugee claimants.

The AFB will protect and invest in legal aid, settlement agencies, and migrant worker support centres.

System reform and international commitments

The AFB will eliminate IRCC application backlogs and meet timely processing standards.

The AFB will create a new oversight body for Canada Border Services as per Bill C-20, An Act establishing the Public Complaints and Review Commission which received royal assent in October 2024.

The AFB will reverse IRCC staffing cuts, modernize systems, and publish regular processing metrics with disaggregated demographic data to ensure timely access and transparency.

The AFB will ratify the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) Migrant Workers Convention (No. 97), the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143) and Domestic Workers Convention (No. 189).

The AFB will reaffirm Canada’s global commitment to migrant rights and align domestic policy with international human rights obligations.

Settlement services

The AFB will adopt a National Plan for Asylum with Dignity. It will model refugee reception on the holistic support provided to Ukrainians in 2022-23, including intake centres, immediate work permits, and federal housing/shelter support.",https://www.policyalternatives.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CCPA-Site-Image.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 04:57:36.911411

Jose de Jesus Ortega, 38, of Highland and Danielle Nadine Davila, 33, of Corona have been charged with assaulting, resisting and impeding a federal officer, a felony, according to a news release Wednesday from the U.S. attorney’s office for the Central District of California. A trial date has been scheduled for Oct. 6.

Ortega and Davila were charged last month by the U.S. attorney’s office on the same matter. By returning an indictment, the grand jury indicated that it believed federal prosecutors had proved that there is probable cause the defendants violated federal law and that the case can proceed to trial.

According to court documents, two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were conducting raids in Ontario on July 8 while wearing government-issued equipment, including law enforcement vests, the release states.

The agents followed a truck with three men inside and approached them after the men exited the truck in the parking lot of the surgery center, according to the release. Two of the men ran away; one of them, an allegedly unauthorized immigrant from Honduras, was detained near the facility’s front entrance and tried to pull away, causing him and the ICE officer to fall to the ground.

A medical staffer helped the landscape worker off the ground and pulled him away from the officers, according to the release. The man went into the surgery center and was chased by the ICE agent, who eventually stopped him.

According to video obtained by KTLA-TV Channel 5, staffers told the two agents to leave because they didn’t have a warrant to enter the property. The agents were trying to detain 30-year-old Denis Guillen-Solis and two other landscapers, according to the release.

In the video, Guillen-Solis is shown holding onto the doorway at the surgical center and asking the agents to present identification. The agents then pulled Guillen-Solis from the doorway and detained him.

Davila allegedly interfered with the arrest by wedging herself in front of the officer and saying, “Let him go!” and, “Get out,” according to the release. Ortega allegedly interfered by grabbing the officer’s arm and vest.

Another ICE officer arrived to help and allegedly saw staff members grabbing one of the officers, according to the release. They detained and handcuffed the alleged unauthorized immigrant.

The charges against the two staffers continue U.S. Atty.

Bertran suffered a broken finger, along with other injuries, while protesting a July raid at Glass House Farms in Camarillo.

Bertran, who plays guitar and piano, claims immigration agents hit him with less-lethal rounds numerous times, with one of the projectiles hitting his hand and breaking his left ring finger.

""I did not interfere. I stood where I was allowed to stand, and I made my voice known,"" Bertrand said at the news conference. ""I was more than happy to tell them what I thought about them, but that's within my right. I did not interfere in any way. We just stood there and peacefully assembled.""

Civil rights attorney James DeSimone is representing Bertrand in his lawsuit against DHS, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

During the raid, immigration agents fired tear gas and non-lethal rounds at protesters.

Bertrand's legal team says immigration agents were supposed to give the protesters a warning that they were going to fire tear gas and non-lethal rounds into the crowd.

""No warning was given to those individuals,"" DeSimone said. ""Alec Bertrand did not know that he was going to be shot five times in a matter of 15 seconds when he was standing there protesting the activities.""

Alec Bertrand added, ""They created a war zone that day. A war zone in a peaceful farming town in a California suburb.""

The foundation and a coalition of partners launched the Ventura County Neighbors Support Fund in late July to support families and small businesses.","After two meetings, hours of testimony and emotional pleas for support, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors this week rejected calls to provide attorneys and funds for immigration legal services.

The proposals to invest in legal assistance for local residents drew big crowds to the board's Ventura chambers on Aug. 12 and – after the initial meeting was continued – Aug. 26. Hundreds spoke to supervisors or submitted comments. Most urged support.

But the board, citing financial and other concerns, rejected nearly all the actions that Supervisor Vianey Lopez brought forward in response to widespread immigration raids. Lopez, who immigrated to the U.S., moving to Oxnard at 4, said the county relies heavily on an immigrant and undocumented workforce.

""At what point do we stand up for what is right?"" Lopez asked before the board voted.

Locally, hundreds have been detained since January, including during a July raid at Glass House Farms, a cannabis farm near Camarillo. Legal representation can be a barrier for those detained and their families, local nonprofit groups have said. But some cannot find an attorney or afford what can be costly representation, despite what could be valid avenues to stay in the country.

Before voting, supervisors listed concerns, including steep cuts facing the county's budget and other needs. Supervisor Matt LaVere, however, called $250,000 for a legal aid fund, one that would be set up by the Ventura County Community Foundation, a small ask. He would support the contribution, he said.

""We have to be honest about the storm clouds kind of hovering over our budget,"" LaVere said at this week's meeting. ""But at the same time, I think we all recognize what is happening right now to many in our community.""

He called the current immigration system complex, expensive to navigate and broken in many ways. Without legal guidance, people have no chance, he said.

""I don't view this as fighting the federal government. I don't view this as standing up against the administration,"" he said. ""I really view this as helping people know their rights and helping people stay in this workforce, which we so desperately depend on.""

What proposals did county supervisors consider?

Lopez had proposed a series of actions. She also asked the board to agree to waive her salary increase over the next two years to help pay for the fund. The list of proposals included:

Setting up an immigration legal assistance fund and approving $250,000 for the fund.

Establishing an immigrant defense unit in the county Public Defender’s Office, which would include seven positions for a fixed term. The estimated annual cost would total nearly $1.3 million.

Directing the County Executive Office to work with county counsel to prepare policies and train staff regarding access and use of county facilities by federal officers engaging in immigration enforcement.

Adding immigration-related issues to the county's state and federal legislative agenda and platform.

On Aug. 26, the board voted unanimously to support additions to its state and federal legislative agenda after changing some of the wording, and 4-1 to direct staff to finalize policies and training. Supervisor Janice Parvin opposed the latter motion.

Other proposals, including one to support an immigration unit failed to get to a vote. Supervisors also narrowly defeated Lopez's motion to contribute to a legal aid fund, which would have been set up at the community foundation. The board voted 3-2 in favor, but the item needed four ""yes"" votes to pass.

Parvin and Supervisor Jeff Gorell voted no. Gorell, who talked about budget challenges, said that if the community foundation created such a fund, he would personally donate but would have difficulty voting for taxpayer dollars to be spent.

Foundation CEO offers to match county funds

LaVere said the contribution likely would have a multiplying effect economically and other local jurisdictions, philanthropic donors and foundations likely would also support such a fund. He said the board needed to consider the economic impact of not doing something.

Vanessa Bechtel, the community foundation's president and CEO, called the situation a crisis locally, one that some may not recognize in their normal, day-to-day routines. People may not see the separated families or empty neighborhoods where people are too afraid to leave home, she said.

Partnering with local government could provide a signal to people that the county is in a crisis and people really need help, she said. She offered to try to first raise $250,000 to match the county's proposed contribution.

The foundation and a coalition of partners launched the Ventura County Neighbors Support Fund in late July to support families and small businesses. The fund focuses on helping with food, shelter and other basic needs, but not legal assistance, Bechtel said. A new fund could do that, officials said.

Parvin referred to herself as a fiscal conservative and described the county's budget as unpredictable. She listed increasing costs from health care to union contracts.

""I'm not trying to say the effort is not worth it, because it's great,"" Parvin said. ""I'm just saying I'm looking at this from a bigger picture, and from a budget standpoint, I have to look at this very conservatively.""

What happens next for a legal assistance fund?

During the meeting, some spoke out against the proposals, raising concerns about spending and questioning legal risks.

But most of the public comments urged the board to invest in an immigration legal defense team and fund, efforts some said were critical to support residents and to stop families from being separated.

The 805 Immigrant Coalition – 805 Undocufund, Mixteco/Indigena Community Organizing Project, the Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy and other groups – supported Lopez's proposals.

After the hearing, Primitiva Hernandez, executive director of the local nonprofit 805 UndocuFund, called what happened ""a big slap in the face"" to the local community members who showed up for the hours-long meetings and asked supervisors to support the proposals.

Hernandez said the coalition would continue to talk to local cities. Bechtel, too, said discussions were ongoing with jurisdictions.

The detainees are being transferred to other immigration detention centers, DHS said in a statement Wednesday, blaming a court order from an ""activist judge"" that it called ""another attempt to prevent the President from fulfilling the American people's mandate to remove the worst of the worst.""

""DHS is complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities. We will continue to fight tooth-and-nail to remove the worst of the worst from American streets,"" DHS said in a statement to CBS News.

Earlier Wednesday, the Associated Press reported a top Florida emergency official had told a South Florida rabbi last week that Alligator Alcatraz would likely be empty ""within a few days.""

The facility, run by Florida's state government on a largely abandoned airstrip, is part of a wider push by the Trump administration to ramp up the number of immigration detention beds by partnering with Republican-led states willing to aid its escalating mass deportation efforts.

Republican officials in Indiana and Nebraska have also offered to convert state prisons into immigration detention centers, and the Trump administration has been eyeing similar facilities in other states.

The administration has cast ""Alligator Alcatraz"" as a cost-effective way of holding immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and suggested the treacherous terrain around the site could serve as a deterrent. But advocates have described inhumane conditions at the facility, including a lack of access to water, scarce and unsanitary food and limited access to attorneys — allegations that federal and state officials have denied.

Last week, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered an indefinite stop to all new construction at ""Alligator Alcatraz"" and barred the transfer of new detainees to the facility. She also directed state officials to remove all fencing, light fixtures, generators and certain other equipment at the site within 60 days, siding with environmental activists who said the facility skirted federal environmental laws.

The ruling did not require the facility to be shut down immediately.

Florida's state government quickly appealed Williams' ruling last week. Late Wednesday evening, Williams declined to halt her ruling pending appeal, rejecting a request by the Trump administration and Florida.

In her new order Wednesday, Williams said federal and state officials had failed to present ""new evidence"" showing the detainees at ""Alligator Alcatraz"" are particularly dangerous or that a pause in operations at the facility would thwart immigration enforcement efforts.

""Alligator Alcatraz"" is also the subject of two other lawsuits. One of them alleges that detainees have been unable to meet with their lawyers confidentially.

The request to Yost came at the behest of Michael Gmoser, the prosecuting attorney for Butler County, near Cincinnati.
It holds that only county commissions, not sheriff’s offices, can enter such contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
There, Dann opined that counties can only hold people for 48 hours (not counting Saturdays, Sundays or holidays) as a “detainer” until federal law enforcement claims custody of the person.
Yost said once a county and ICE reach a contract, the county can lawfully hold them for longer periods of time until ICE executes a deportation.","Ohio county commissions can legally enter contracts with federal officials to detain immigrants subject to deportation, GOP Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said in an advisory opinion Tuesday

If such a contract is in place, detainees are not subject a traditional 48-hour time limit for the state to hold subjects awaiting federal law enforcement.

Federal law allows the counties to enter the contracts, Yost said, and state law doesn’t prohibit it.

The net effect of the ruling is more counties could reach financial deals with ICE calling for them to hold people awaiting deportation in jail, even though immigration is a civil and not a criminal offense.

“Local officials’ authority to confine such persons in a county jail would derive, instead, from a lawful agreement with federal immigration authorities to detain aliens subject to removal from the United States,” he wrote.

Advisory opinions don’t carry the force of law, but they function as an important form of blanket advice for government actors who rely on legal counsel or services of the attorney general.

The request to Yost came at the behest of Michael Gmoser, the prosecuting attorney for Butler County, near Cincinnati. There, the county jail is holding about 400 people on “ICE detainers,” and 92% of them are only held on immigration offenses as opposed to violent ones, according to WCPO9.

Yost’s opinion comes with a wrinkle. It holds that only county commissions, not sheriff’s offices, can enter such contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The ACLU has previously filed lawsuits against sheriffs of Geauga and Seneca counties, claiming they’ve illegally refused to provide copies of their contracts to transport and house immigrants for ICE.

On Wednesday, attorneys with the advocacy group issued a letter to nine sheriffs around the state, warning them that only their county governments can contract with ICE. Such contracts with the sheriffs but not their county commissions would be “invalid,” the ACLU said.

“As Attorney General Dave Yost has made clear, these agreements were invalid at their inception and have no legal force,” wrote Freda Levenson, legal director for the ACLU. “For you to continue holding anyone under that invalid authority is unlawful, and a violation of these individuals’ constitutional rights.”

The ruling from Yost also comes as President Donald Trump’s administration wages an aggressive, mass deportation campaign across the nation that includes targeting those with no criminal records as well.

Yost’s writing deviates from a 2007 advisory opinion from his Democratic predecessor, Marc Dann. There, Dann opined that counties can only hold people for 48 hours (not counting Saturdays, Sundays or holidays) as a “detainer” until federal law enforcement claims custody of the person. Yost said once a county and ICE reach a contract, the county can lawfully hold them for longer periods of time until ICE executes a deportation.",https://signalohio.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ohio-Attorney-General-Dave-Yost-Bernie-Moreno-Rally.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 23:56:34.291624

Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law.","This story was reported and written by our media partner the Virginia Mercury.

Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger says one of her first acts if elected would be to undo Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s February directive requiring Virginia law enforcement to help carry out federal immigration crackdowns — a policy she argues wastes local resources and undermines community trust.

“I would rescind his executive order, yes,” Spanberger told The Mercury in a lengthy policy interview earlier this month, referring to Youngkin’s Executive Order 47 issued in February. The order gave state police and corrections officers authority to perform certain immigration duties and also urged local jails to fully cooperate with federal deportation operations.

The governor said at the time the measure was meant to keep “dangerous criminal illegal immigrants” off Virginia’s streets. Spanberger countered that Youngkin’s approach illustrates how immigration enforcement can pull local agencies away from their core responsibilities while pushing state agencies into federal civil enforcement.

“Our immigration system is absolutely broken,” she said. “The idea that we would take local police officers or local sheriff’s deputies in amid all the things that they have to do, like community policing or staffing our jails or investigating real crimes, so that they can go and tear families apart … that is a misuse of those resources.”

Spanberger’s stance sets up a sharp contrast with her opponent — Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who has embraced the order and tied it to her own story as a legal immigrant from Jamaica.

The divide between the two candidates underscores how immigration has become one of the most combustible issues in Virginia’s 2025 campaign for governor — and how Youngkin’s policies continue to shape the race even as he prepares to leave office in January.

That influence stretches beyond Youngkin’s executive order. In late February, Youngkin also launched the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, a sweeping federal-state operation staffed with more than 200 personnel from agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the FBI, state police and corrections, which has claimed hundreds to thousands of immigration and gang-related arrests in Virginia.

Keep enforcement federal, Spanberger says

Spanberger, who represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in Congress before launching her gubernatorial bid, argued that immigration enforcement should be handled by federal officials with judicial oversight, not by local police diverted from their own duties.

She said Democrats are often wrongly portrayed as opposing law enforcement when they object to policies like Youngkin’s that conscript local agencies into immigration sweeps.

“If someone has a criminal violation at the state level or at the federal level … local resources are required to arrest that person or put them in a local jail before transferring them to federal custody. Absolutely the locality should participate in that,” she said.

But Spanberger insisted the standard should be the same for immigration cases as for any other criminal matter.

“They have to have a warrant to pick somebody up off the street, so they meet that same standard,” she said. “And they can easily go get that detention order signed by a judge or a magistrate, if they want that local support.”

Without those safeguards, Spanberger argued, local cooperation with ICE undermines community policing, creates constitutional concerns and strains already tight budgets. She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.

Earle-Sears emphasizes rule of law

Earle-Sears, who initially agreed to a similar policy interview with The Mercury but canceled minutes before it was to take place, has publicly and repeatedly defended Youngkin’s executive order.

“I am a legal immigrant and now a naturalized citizen. Working together, the governor, attorney general, and I have made Virginia safer,” she said in February when announcing the policy. “Now, working with President Trump, we can take on the scourge of dangerous and violent illegal immigrants.”

In December, while unveiling a “No Sanctuary Cities” budget proposal, she described the bureaucratic hurdles her own family went through when immigrating to the U.S. and argued that others should follow the same path.

“My father and I had to file documents and wait to be granted permission to enter the United States. Under Governor Youngkin’s leadership, Virginia stands firm: we are not a sanctuary state,” she said.

“The rule of law is not negotiable — it is the foundation of our safety, our freedom, and the promise of opportunity that defines America,” she added.

Earle-Sears’ broader ideas on immigration remain unclear, as she has not gone beyond a handful of public statements and her campaign website offers no issue page outlining her positions.

Dispute over Youngkin’s deportation claims

The candidates also diverge sharply on Youngkin’s claim in July that all 2,500 immigrants arrested and deported by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force are “violent criminals.”

Spanberger said she has seen no evidence to support the governor’s sweeping assertion.

“If they were violent criminals, presumably, they were arrested on those charges for the violent crime that they committed, in which case, there would be clear documentation,” she said. “Frankly, as somebody who believes in upholding the law, I want people to be arrested for the crimes that they are committing.”

Civil rights groups have also raised alarms, arguing that Youngkin’s mandate is “playing politics with people’s lives.”

“For years, Virginia’s governor has been pushing the same dangerous, false narrative as the Trump administration that immigrants commit crime at higher rates than people who were born here, despite the fact that no data exists to support that conclusion,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia said in a statement.

Earle-Sears has not directly addressed the governor’s 2,500 figure but has frequently pointed to grim cases of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in arguing for tougher enforcement.

“We’ve seen too many tragic stories after dangerous criminals in this country illegally were put back on the streets, and this executive order will make sure we send them back to where they came from,” she said earlier this year.

The Laken Riley Act

The immigration debate has also touched on Spanberger’s record in Congress.

Earle-Sears has faulted her for initially voting against the Laken Riley Act, named for a Georgia college student killed by a Venezuelan national who entered the country unlawfully. The law, which eventually passed after Spanberger left Congress, requires federal authorities to detain immigrants accused of theft and burglary while their cases proceed.

Spanberger said she opposed the bill in its first iteration because it “was essentially putting incredible burdens on localities removing any form of due process” and would not have prevented Riley’s murder.

“As a mother of three daughters, I was deeply offended that they would utilize that young woman’s murder as a political talking point,” she said. “At the time of that vote, her father was in the press saying that he was deeply distressed by the fact that her murder was being utilized in the way that it was.”

David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said Spanberger has staked out a position that balances criticism of Trump-era immigration policies with support for reforms viewed as moderate.

“Spanberger has been fairly vocal in criticizing the Trump administration’s methods of dealing with undocumented immigration,” Richards said.

“Her voting record on bills centered around immigration has been mixed, supporting some of the more moderate bills, but voting ‘no’ on some key GOP bills like the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act. … It falls in line with her presenting herself as a pragmatic candidate.”

By contrast, he said, Earle-Sears has been relatively quiet on immigration, surfacing the issue primarily when it intersects with her biography or when amplifying President Donald Trump’s agenda.

“She did talk about the issue back in June, saying that she, as an immigrant, did things the ‘right way.’ But overall, she has skirted the issue,” Richards said.

“She may feel that the issue is not one she can really win with in Virginia, although, as more immigration related arrests happen in the commonwealth, she may have to start talking about this.”

The bigger picture

The fight over immigration in Virginia is inseparable from national politics. Youngkin has aligned himself closely with Trump on enforcement strategies, boasting of joint operations with ICE and staging press events around courthouse raids and “gang and immigration sweeps” that have drawn criticism from Democrats and civil liberties groups.

Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law. She cited bipartisan bills like the Farm Workforce Modernization Act and the Dignity Act as examples of incremental progress, even if they fell short.

“There are many places where the governors of states can bang on the table and tell Congress, ‘Stop making this such a political issue that you campaign on every two years and just fix it,’” she said.

She added that immigration is not only a humanitarian concern but also a pressing economic issue for Virginia, from hospitals seeking visas for foreign-trained nurses to seafood producers dependent on seasonal guest workers.

Earle-Sears, meanwhile, has emphasized border security and public safety, drawing a bright line between legal immigrants like herself and those who arrive unlawfully.

“Any local elected official who instructs law enforcement to defy efforts to keep Virginians safe abandons their duty and breaks the trust of the people they swore to protect,” she said last year.

Looking ahead

With polls showing immigration remains a top concern among Republican voters — and a complicated one among independents — the issue is likely to stay at the forefront of this year’s election cycle.

Spanberger is betting Virginians will see Youngkin’s executive order as overreach that diverts local resources and harms public safety by discouraging immigrant communities from reporting crimes. Earle-Sears is counting on voters to view strict enforcement as common sense, framed by her own story of navigating the legal immigration system.

“Maybe she is waiting for a Trump endorsement,” Richards said of Earle-Sears. “But if immigration remains in the headlines, she may not be able to avoid it.”

For now, voters face a stark choice between a Democrat who vows to unwind the governor’s crackdown and press Congress for broader reforms, and a Republican who pledges to double down on enforcement in the name of law and order.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f05e05/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+173/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F45%2F5d%2Fbf1159714b5a9ce90d9244144213%2Fimg-4799-1536x1152.jpg,N,,2025-08-28 10:56:53.223189

DHS issued a similar proposed rule in September 2020, toward the end of the first Trump administration.
And for I nonimmigrants, “duration of status” is generally the duration of the foreign media representative’s assignment/employment in the United States.
Some aspects of the proposed rule could be revised during the review and finalization process, based on public feedback.
If your organization wishes to comment on the proposed rule, please contact your designated Fragomen professional or the firm’s Government Strategies and Compliance Group.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has released an advance copy of a proposed regulation that would replace the current “duration of status” (D/S) policy for international students (F status), exchange visitors (J status), representatives of foreign information media (I status), and their dependents with a policy that would set a finite expiration date for their authorized stay. The proposed rule is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register tomorrow. DHS will accept public comments on the proposal for 30 days after publication.

If the proposal becomes final, F, J, and I nonimmigrants would be admitted to the United States for a specific period of stay, and like other nonimmigrants, they would be required to apply for an extension of stay if they need more time to complete their program, employment, or assignment.

The proposed rule would also result in a change to current policies on how and when F, J, and I nonimmigrants begin accruing “unlawful presence,” for purposes of the three- and ten-year bars applicable to foreign nationals who have been unlawfully present in the United States for over 180 days or over one year. Currently, F, J, and I nonimmigrants only begin to accrue unlawful presence if USCIS or an immigration judge formally finds that the individual has violated their nonimmigrant status. Under the proposed rule, F, J, and I nonimmigrants would generally begin accruing unlawful presence as soon as their specified admission period expires, as is currently the case for other nonimmigrant categories.

DHS issued a similar proposed rule in September 2020, toward the end of the first Trump administration. The incoming Biden administration withdrew the proposal in July 2021, and the second Trump administration is now seeking to resurrect the initiative with additional provisions that have not previously been proposed.

While most nonimmigrants are admitted to the United States until a specific date, F, J, and I nonimmigrants have long been admitted for the duration of the individual’s status in that visa classification. Under current rules, a “duration of status” (D/S) admission for F-1s is the time it takes the individual to complete their academic program and any post-completion optional practical training (OPT), plus a 60-day grace period. For J-1s, “duration of status” is the time it takes the exchange visitor to complete their J-1 program, plus a 30-day grace period. And for I nonimmigrants, “duration of status” is generally the duration of the foreign media representative’s assignment/employment in the United States.

Nonimmigrants admitted for duration of status are not required to apply for an extension of stay with USCIS if their program or employment lasts longer than initially anticipated. For Fs and Js, the sponsoring educational institution or exchange program can extend the student’s or exchange visitor’s ability to remain in the United States simply by issuing a revised Form I-20 or DS-2019 with a later program completion date, and foreign media representatives in I status can remain in the United States as long as they remain employed in their qualifying employment.

The proposed rule would end this longstanding practice of admitting F, J, and I nonimmigrants for duration of status and would bring these classifications in line with other nonimmigrant categories, by subjecting them to defined periods of stay and requiring them to apply to USCIS for extensions of status if they wish to remain in the United States beyond that defined period.

If F, J, or I nonimmigrants require additional time to complete their program, practical training, or employment, they would need to apply for an extension of stay with USCIS and complete biometrics screening. The rules governing the duration of approved extensions would mirror the rules above for the initial admission periods.

The proposed rule indicates that in order for an extension of F-1 status to be approved, the foreign national would need to present either a currently issued Form I-20 indicating that additional time is needed to complete their program or documentation demonstrating compelling academic reasons (e.g., change of major or research topic, unexpected research problems, etc.); illness; or other circumstances beyond the foreign national’s control (e.g., natural disaster, national health crisis, closure of institution).

If an F, J, or I nonimmigrant fails to depart or apply to change or extend their status before their status expires, they would begin to accrue unlawful presence upon expiration of their authorized admission period, in the same manner as other nonimmigrants.

The proposed rule contains complex transition provisions for the treatment of foreign nationals admitted for duration of status (D/S) prior to the effective date of the rule.

After the rule is published in the Federal Register tomorrow, the public will have 30 days to comment. DHS will then review the feedback and prepare a final rule for issuance in the Federal Register. Some aspects of the proposed rule could be revised during the review and finalization process, based on public feedback. There is no set timeframe for publication of a final rule, though the process typically takes several months.

Comments from the academic and business communities will be important to make the agency aware of the impact of the rule on schools, businesses, and U.S. competitiveness in the market for global talent. If your organization wishes to comment on the proposed rule, please contact your designated Fragomen professional or the firm’s Government Strategies and Compliance Group.

The Wednesday letter to State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln calls on Bosn to use her authority to call a hearing on the planned repurposing of the Nebraska Work Ethic Camp in McCook. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a state-federal plan Aug. 19 to convert the nearly 200-bed dormitory-style, rehabilitative-focused prison facility into a 300-bed ICE detention facility over the next 45 days.

Pillen, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and other state officials called the rebranded facility the “Cornhusker Clink.”

“There was no meaningful notice to the Legislature, local officials or the public about this agreement,” the senators wrote Wednesday in a letter shared publicly and with the Nebraska Examiner. “The governor’s disregard for including the Legislature — the people’s branch — is deeply problematic. Nebraskans deserve answers.”

Almost every legislative committee introduces a resolution each year to examine any issues that might arise between legislative sessions within a committee’s jurisdiction. Bosn’s committee has Legislative Resolution 108, which is signed by all eight committee members.

Bosn said she received the letter late Wednesday afternoon and was still reviewing it. She said she would have a response Thursday.

‘How democracy works’

Lawmakers signing the letter were State Sens. John Cavanaugh, Machaela Cavanaugh, Danielle Conrad, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Megan Hunt, Margo Juarez, Terrell McKinney, Dan Quick, Jane Raybould, Victor Rountree and Ashlei Spivey.

“This is not about partisanship. It is about process, constitutional authority and protecting Nebraskans,” Hunt, a nonpartisan progressive, said in a statement. “The governor cannot secretly cut deals to hand over state facilities to ICE without public input or legislative oversight. That is not how democracy works.”

The other dozen lawmakers who signed are Democrats in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.

Asked for a response on the lawmakers’ letter, Laura Strimple, a Pillen spokesperson, said the lawmakers had not posed the questions to the Governor’s Office and that if the lawmakers want answers, they’re welcome to ask.

“The governor has always been transparent and would be more than happy to answer questions,” she said. “However, the administration cannot answer questions when they are not asked. Rather than engaging in political theater, these Democrat senators should simply send these questions to be answered.”

Three legislative Democrats did not sign the letter: State Sens. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and Jason Prokop of Lincoln. DeBoer is vice chair of the Judiciary Committee, which is split 5-3, majority Republicans. McKinney and Rountree also serve on the committee.

DeBoer could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

Hunt said on social media Wednesday that a reason some Democratic lawmakers didn’t sign was because of a “quick turnaround.” She said she thought there were “for sure” some Republicans who would have signed.

Nebraska’s plans to keep the repurposed Work Ethic Camp state-owned and operated would likely leave it open to legislative oversight, a power that lawmakers have worked to clarify and strengthen over the past two years.

Legal authority

Some of the lawmakers’ questions revolve around whether the governor has the authority to enter an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to convert a state prison into an ICE detention facility without legislative action. They also want to probe whether the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services can house ICE detainees at all.

The letter notes Article IV, Section 19 of the Nebraska Constitution, which gives the Legislature power over the “management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory and penal institutions.”

Senators argued Pillen is “unilaterally” bypassing the Nebraska Constitution and multiple state laws that dictate the prison system’s powers and outline the purpose of the Work Ethic Camp in statute.

While the letter alludes to fiscal questions, lawmakers did not include any specific questions on the finances of the new facility.

Pillen and State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, have said the federal government will fully reimburse Nebraska for the $9.5 million facility plus daily bed costs. They have said the deal could financially benefit Nebraska.

Previous Judiciary Committee reactions

Rountree, who represents a purple legislative district that elected him and voted for President Donald Trump in November, previously told the Examiner that he approaches immigration enforcement from a “humanitarian viewpoint” and from his 30 years as a veteran.

“There’s a place for the rule of law to exist along with humanitarian effort,” Rountree said.

What to know about Nebraska-ICE plan to retool McCook Work Ethic Camp

State Sens. Tanya Storer of Whitman and Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, who also serve on the Judiciary Committee, said they had been briefed on the federal plan and were more confident in its direction. Both said they were assured Nebraska facilities would not be hurt by the plan.

“I think if Nebraska is in a position to help be part of that effort in a positive way, that’s a good thing,” Storer said at the time.

Hearing requested with ‘deliberate speed’

Among the letter’s other questions Wednesday:

What impact does this agreement have on Nebraskans who are incarcerated and front-line prison system employees, who are already facing overcrowding and staffing issues?

Will employees at the Work Ethic Camp be reassigned to work at other facilities? Will they be trained to work at the converted facility? Will federal officials also work at the converted facility? Will federal officials replace or supplement current staff at the Work Ethic Camp?

Where will the incarcerated Nebraskans now housed at the Work Ethic Camp be moved to? How does the recent significant damage and forced relocation of inmates at the Nebraska State Penitentiary impact prisoner relocation efforts? What impact will the relocation have on rehabilitation-focused programming and eligibility for parole?

Who will be detained or placed in the converted ICE detention facility?

If Nebraska has prison space to give away to the Trump administration, why are state lawmakers spending more than $313 million to build a new state prison?

“These and other subjects are deserving of a public hearing on the record at which officials can provide additional information and answer questions, and where Nebraskans can be heard,” the letter states.

The senators asked Bosn, a former prosecutor appointed to the Legislature in 2023 and elected in 2024, to inform her colleagues and the public of the answers to these questions if she can.

If Bosn cannot answer, the letter adds, “We encourage you to stand in your power and set and publicize the hearing date to take this matter up with all deliberate speed as the governor notes this transition will be happening within a few short weeks.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/progressives-PSL-huddle_ZJW_032625-02.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 22:57:23.542704

“I heard one officer say about us ‘they smell like sh–,’” one detained person recounted in a federal court filing. “And another officer responded, ‘They are sh–.’”

Attorneys for immigrant children collected these stories, and more, from youth and families detained in what they called “prison-like” settings across the U.S. from March through June, even as the Trump administration has requested a federal district court judge terminate existing protections that mandate basic rights and services — including safe and sanitary conditions — for children held by the government.

The administration argues that the protections mandated under what is known as the Flores Settlement Agreement encourage immigration and interfere with its ability to establish immigration policy. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who is in California, is expected to issue a ruling on the request after an Aug. 8 hearing.

With the agreement in place, children are being held in “unsafe and unsanitary” U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities such as tents, airports, and offices for up to several weeks despite the agency’s written policy saying people generally should not be held in its custody longer than 72 hours, according to the June court filing from immigrants’ attorneys. In addition to opposing the U.S. Department of Justice’s May request to terminate the Flores consent decree, the attorneys demanded more monitoring for children in immigration detention.

“The biggest fear is that without Flores, we will lose a crucial line of transparency and accountability,” said Sergio Perez, executive director of the California-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. “Then you have a perfect storm for the abuse of individuals, the violation of their rights, and the kind of treatment that this country doesn’t stand for.”

The Flores agreement has set minimum standards and oversight for detained immigrant children since 1997, when it brought an end to a decade-long lawsuit filed on behalf of unaccompanied immigrant minors who had been subjected to poor treatment in unsafe and unsanitary conditions without access to medical care. It is named for Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old from El Salvador who was taken into U.S. custody in the mid-1980s, subjected to strip searches, and housed alongside unrelated men.

The agreement established national standards for the protection of immigrant children detained by federal authorities, with requirements for safe and sanitary detention facilities, access to clean water, appropriate food, clothing, bedding, recreational and educational opportunities, sanitation, plus appropriate medical and mental health care. Children in immigrant detention range from infants to teens.

In 2015, Gee ruled that the agreement includes children accompanied by adults.

The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which includes both the Customs and Border Protection agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to respond on the record to questions about the administration’s intent to end the Flores agreement or about the conditions in which kids are detained. In a May court filing, government attorneys argued, among other points, that the agreement improperly directs immigration decisions to the courts, not the White House. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also has said that the Flores agreement has “incentivized illegal immigration,” and that Congress and federal agencies have resolved the problems Flores was designed to fix.

ICE detention facilities have the “highest standards,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in an email to KFF Health News. “They are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings.”

Immigration lawyers and researchers have pushed back on the idea that the Flores agreement encourages migration, arguing that the conditions in people’s homelands are driving them to move.

Trump is not the first president to seek to modify, or end, the agreement.

In 2016, President Barack Obama’s administration unsuccessfully sought to exempt accompanied minors from the Flores agreement, arguing that an influx of immigrants from Central America had overwhelmed the system.

In 2019, following a policy that caused family separation, the first Trump administration announced it would replace Flores with new regulations to expand family detention and eliminate detention time limits. The courts rejected that plan, too.

In 2024, President Joe Biden’s administration successfully requested to remove the Department of Health and Human Services from the agreement after the Office of Refugee Resettlement incorporated some Flores standards into agency regulations.

Allegations of unsafe conditions under the agreement also predate this latest immigration crackdown under Trump. One court filing from 2019 said that attorneys visiting two Texas detention centers found at least 250 infants, children, and teens, some of whom had been held at the facility for nearly a month. “Children were filthy and wearing clothes covered in bodily fluids, including urine,” the filing said.

Seven children are known to have died while in federal custody from 2018 to 2019, according to media reports.

And in 2023, 8-year-old Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez became sick and died while in Customs and Border Protection custody in Texas for nine days. Her parents had turned over medical records detailing the girl’s medical history, including diagnoses of sickle cell disease and congenital heart disease, upon their detention. Yet her mother’s repeated pleas for emergency medical care were ignored.

Her family filed a wrongful death claim in May.

Advocates attributed the deaths partly to prolonged detention in increasingly crowded facilities and delayed medical care. Officials have said they increased medical services and acknowledged failures in the wake of the deaths.

But with the Trump administration’s unprecedented push to detain and deport migrants — including families — the threat to the health of children caught up in those sweeps is alarming child advocates.

“Very rarely do you have spikes in populations of detained folk that you don’t see a drastic decrease in the quality of their medical care,” said Daniel Hatoum, a senior supervising attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, one of the groups that filed the wrongful death claim for Anadith’s family.

Recent reports from court-appointed monitors cite continued lack of access to appropriate medical care; temperature extremes; few outside recreational opportunities; lack of appropriate food and clothing; and an inability to dim lights to sleep.

Terminating the Flores agreement would remove all outside oversight of immigration detention facilities by court-ordered monitors and attorneys. The public would have to depend on the government for transparency about the conditions in which children are held.

“Our system requires that there be some oversight for government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, but in general,” Hatoum said. “We know that. So, I do not believe that DHS could police itself.”

In the months after Trump took office and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency began cuts, the administration shuttered DHS’ Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which were intended to add a layer of oversight. After a lawsuit, the Trump administration reversed action and noted the offices would remain open, but it is unclear how those offices have been affected by shifts in policy and cuts in staffing.

Leecia Welch, an attorney with the legal advocacy group Children’s Rights, said the Flores agreement itself, or efforts to hold the government responsible for abiding by its requirements, are not rooted in partisan politics. She said she raised concerns about conditions during Biden’s administration, too.

“These are not political issues for me,” Welch said. “How does our country want to treat children? That’s it. It’s very simple. I’m not going to take it easy on any administration where children are being harmed in their care.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-08-28 05:57:03.095452

Mary Gay Scanlon (D-5th District) said she was denied entry to the largest immigration detention center in the northeast on Wednesday.

The privately operated Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Clearfield County was the subject of a high-profile complaint by civil rights advocates last year. Scanlon told the Capital-Star she has heard concerns about constituents from her suburban Philadelphia being held in the center under poor conditions including inadequate medical and mental health care.

“We’ve had reports about folks being unable to get adequate food. Either they were going hungry or they were … forced to purchase their own food from the commissary,” Scanlon said.

Despite a provision in a 2024 federal appropriations bill giving members of congress the authority to make unannounced oversight visits, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials refused her request to enter the facility.

“They said they would not be letting me in specifically to do the oversight visit, because they were under orders not to do so by the secretary of DHS Kristi Noem,” Scanlon said. “And they repeatedly said they were aware of the fact that there is a federal law.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment on Scanlon being denied entry to the facility.

Scanlon is the second member of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation to be turned away by officials at Moshannon Valley this week. On Monday, U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (D-12th District) was denied entry to the center to conduct oversight after the death earlier this month of a Chinese national being held there.

Lee said in a statement Monday her denied entry into Moshannon Valley is an example of the Trump administration’s executive overreach.

“With numerous allegations of human rights abuses, our communities deserve to know how people are being treated inside these taxpayer-funded facilities,” Lee said. “Transparency and accountability are non-negotiables in a democracy, and ICE cannot be allowed to operate in the shadows.”

Similar scenes have played out at detention centers elsewhere in the nation in recent months. Notably, Democratic New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver and other lawmakers were involved in a confrontation with federal officials outside a recently reopened facility in Newark in May.

McIver was later indicted on three counts of “assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering” with federal officers, which she has said are politically motivated.

Moshannon Valley, which Scanlon said has recently housed between 1,200 and 1,700 people, is a former federal prison operated on behalf of ICE by private prison operator GEO Group. The company operates 97 facilities, including the one in Newark where McIver was denied entry.

GEO Group’s contract is with Clearfield County, which provides the space to ICE in an arrangement that circumvents a Biden-era ban on for-profit prisons.

Scanlon said the complaint the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, Legal Services of New Jersey and the University of Pennsylvania law school filed with the Department of Homeland Security has not been resolved. That’s in part, she claimed, because the Trump administration gutted the DHS Office of Civil Rights that was handling it.

The Sheller Center for Social Justice at Temple University Beasley School of Law and the immigrant rights group Juntos also released a report last year based on interviews with 70 people held at Moshannon Valley.

It called for the center to be closed, alleging immigrants and asylum seekers are subject to physical and psychological abuse, lack adequate access to health care, and face retaliation for standing up against mistreatment.

“There are problems that we’re hearing about from a variety of sources, and that’s why we need to be able to get in there and see what the situation is,” Scanlon said.

Scanlon said federal immigration officials have historically been willing to work with members of Congress and advocates to address concerns about conditions in immigration facilities. With the Trump administration’s “rampant ramp up” of deportation and the Republican budget reconciliation bill adding $45 billion to ICE’s budget, Congressional oversight is more important than ever, she said.

“What we’re seeing now is, first of all, a total lack of transparency,” Scanlon said, noting that families, their lawyers and advocates are having difficulty locating people within the immigration system. “There’s a whole host of issues which, if you have transparency, you can then begin to address all of this,” she said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_8034-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 21:56:45.267876

Mike Kehoe is weighing a request from the Trump administration to deploy the state's National Guard to support federal immigration enforcement in Missouri.

If approved, Guard members would help handle administrative and logistical tasks for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — not arrests — according to Kehoe's spokesperson Gabby Picard.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Defense said assistance could include case management, transportation and clerical support for the in and out processing of detainees without legal status.

The Missouri National Guard did not respond to a question on how many troops were requested from the Trump administration.

The request follows a July 25 order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to bring members of military under the command of state governors and authorized them to support immigration enforcement. That adjustment added 500 troops to help the immigration agency, bringing total DoD support to about 1,700 service members.

Picard said Missouri is among 10 new states that could get that extra support. While federally funded, the Guard would remain under Kehoe's authority.

""By providing these crucial services, DoD military personnel directly enable ICE to dedicate more trained agents to core law enforcement activities, significantly enhancing overall effectiveness,"" said Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell in a statement. ""The Department of Defense is committed to supporting the Department of Homeland Security in its mission to maintain the security of our borders and enforce immigration laws.""

As of Friday, 20 states — all led by Republican governors — were either carrying out ICE's request for troops or considering it, according to Stars and Stripes.

Earlier this year, Kehoe declared a state of emergency and activated the state's National Guard ahead of immigration protests in St. Louis that ended up being peaceful. The Guard was ultimately not deployed.

""While other states may wait for chaos to ensue,"" the governor said at the time, ""the State of Missouri is taking a proactive approach in the event that assistance is needed to support local law enforcement in protecting our citizens and communities.""

The Guard deployment would mark the latest expansion of federal law enforcement's presence in St. Louis.

Last week, U.S. Sen. Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, and FBI Director Kash Patel announced the FBI would be getting extra staffing to help fight violent crime in the region.

The deployment of the National Guard to help ICE across the U.S. is separate from President Donald Trump's recent decision to send nearly 2,000 federal troops — and counting — to address crime in Democratic-led cities such as Washington, D.C.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials Wednesday denied U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Delaware County, entry to the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania.

A Chinese citizen died in early August while in custody inside the ICE facility. Scanlon said she was there to conduct a congressional oversight visit.

“The private prison director and the ICE manager for the facility came out and told me they knew there was a federal law requiring them to let me in — but that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had ordered them not to allow members of Congress to visit these facilities,” Scanlon said in a video posted to X.

Neither ICE nor the U.S. Department of Homeland Security immediately responded to a request for comment.

Members of Congress are legally allowed to conduct unannounced oversight visits to ICE facilities. The Moshannon Valley Processing Center is the largest in the region. Officials also denied U.S. Rep. Summer Lee, D-Allegheny County, access to the compound Monday.

Scanlon told WHYY News that she’s received complaints about the facility from her constituents. She said she plans to join Democratic lawmakers suing the Trump administration over similar entrance denials.

“There’s a lot of concerns that arise when you have the government incarcerating people and hiding what’s going on behind those walls — and that’s the purpose for doing oversight,” Scanlon said.

While President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown continues, DHS has asserted that members of Congress must provide advanced notice to be granted entry for tours.

Scanlon said there’s a lot at stake in regards to Trump’s immigration policies. She pointed to the administration’s history of detaining and deporting people without a criminal record. ICE is receiving $45 billion from Trump’s latest spending bill, and private prison contractors are benefitting, Scanlon said.

“​​They’re spending an estimated $3.4 million a month at Moshannon in taxpayer dollars, and I think people have a right to know what that money’s being spent on,” she said.

In his separate opinion, Justice Gorsuch rebuked the district court (and other district courts) for failing to follow Supreme Court precedent.
She also expressed concern that the government’s rushed cancellation of funding grants would halt life-saving biomedical research.","On August 21, 2025, the United States Supreme Court allowed the federal government to proceed with the cancelation of $783 million in funding grants from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to universities and research institutions. Previously, a federal district court declared the government’s cancellation of the grants, and the NIH guidance documents on which it relied to cancel those grants, to be unlawful and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied the government’s application to stay the district court’s rulings pending appeal. A closely divided Supreme Court left in place the district court’s ruling vacating the guidance documents while simultaneously staying the district court’s order that invalidated the government’s move to terminate the funding grants.

The justices issued a complicated series of opinions relating to the court’s order. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the majority, concluding that the Court’s split opinion was necessary to ensure the government’s claims are channeled to the appropriate venue in the lower courts. Justice Barrett said the government’s claim regarding its ability to cancel the funding grants belonged before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (“CFC”), which handles contract disputes involving the federal government. But Justice Barrett said the challenge to the NIH’s guidance documents was properly before the federal district court. “Two-track litigation,” she wrote, “results from the jurisdictional scheme governing actions against the United States, which often requires plaintiffs to file two actions in different courts to obtain complete relief in connection with one set of facts.”

The Court also stated in its opinion that the government must be allowed to cancel the funding grants because the funds may not be recoverable after the recipients expended them. The Court reasoned that “the plaintiffs’ contention that they lack the resources to continue their research projects without federal funding is inconsistent with the proposition that they have the resources to make the Government whole for money already spent.”

Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh agreed with Justice Barrett to the extent the Court vacated the district court’s order terminating the NIH funding grants, but they would have also stayed the portion of the district court’s order that declared the NIH’s guidance documents unlawful.

In his separate opinion, Justice Gorsuch rebuked the district court (and other district courts) for failing to follow Supreme Court precedent. Justice Gorsuch wrote that “[l]ower court judges may sometimes disagree with this Court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them.”

Chief Justice Roberts did not agree that the district court was required to split the case into two parts. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson agreed that the plaintiffs were not required to proceed before separate courts.

Justice Jackson, in a sharply worded opinion, criticized the Court for “sending [the] plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief.” She did not agree that the Court’s precedents required allowing the government to terminate the funding grants. She also expressed concern that the government’s rushed cancellation of funding grants would halt life-saving biomedical research.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12073_3056.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 21:56:54.232517

Migrants and refugees deserve the same access to justice and protection under the law as anyone else in this country.","Human rights organisations have condemned the Government’s Home Affairs legislation tabled in Parliament this week, as yet another baseless attack on the rights of migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum.

In a move the organisations say shows blatant disregard for the law, the Albanese Government has introduced legislation that would strip migrants and refugees of their legal rights when sending them to third countries like Nauru, legislating their way out of cases currently before the courts.

The Bill is yet another attempt at rushed law-making, this time stripping protections from migrants and refugees that make sure bungled bureaucratic decisions that affect people’s safety and family integrity can be challenged. It is designed to limit government accountability for making sure those decisions are fair and based in fact.

The Bill also has a retrospective effect – validating incorrect decisions that were made in the past, preventing the right for these decisions to be corrected. The Bill even allows the government to continue to prosecute criminal charges that were brought as a result of incorrect decisions.

Jana Favero, Deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said:

“The decisions are serious and lifelong. We are talking about people being permanently deported to places like Nauru. Decisions like this must not be made without fundamental legal safeguards. This legislation is clearly designed to manipulate the law so that the Government is not accountable to the courts.”

“If the idea of people being deported without the ability or right to challenge the decision makes you think of ICE and Donald Trump – you’d be right. The Albanese government is setting a dangerous precedent of removing people’s legal rights to question when the government has made serious mistakes.”

Sarah Dale, Centre Director and Principal Solicitor at the Refugee Advice and Casework Service said:

“All people are entitled to have such serious legal decisions made about them using the correct facts and law, to have an opportunity to respond, and to be protected from unilateral and unjustified changes to that law by the Government after the fact. These decisions are often life and death. They must be correctly and fairly made, and the Government must not be given power to override the protections of the law in this way.”

“The Courts have already recognised one man was not afforded due process prior to an attempt to forcibly exile him to Nauru. The Government now seeks power to override fair processes – and even the established law – in order to facilitate their powers to remove people, including to harm. It’s dangerous law-making to erode these fundamental protections, that are for all members of the Australian community. It’s a disturbing precedent that attacks the core of our fundamental rights.”

Josephine Langbien, Associate Legal Director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“Just weeks ago, the United Nations’ Human Rights Committee agreed there are serious questions that the Australian Government must answer about its Nauru deportation plans, and the consequences for the people subjected to them. Yet now the Albanese Government wants to permanently exile people to Nauru without having to consider the consequences. This legislation would save the Government from having to consider basic questions like whether someone can access the medical care they need in Nauru, or whether they would be permanently separated from their families. By eliminating safeguards that are designed to ensure fairness and accuracy, the Government is showing that it does not care if it gets these life-changing decisions wrong.”

The group of human rights organisations say this Bill is a blatant attempt at removing scrutiny, stripping people of rights, and shielding the Government from accountability. Migrants and refugees deserve the same access to justice and protection under the law as anyone else in this country. They call on Parliament to reject this dangerous legislation in its entirety.

The lawsuit seeks a $1 million damage claim from the Trump administration, alleging that the student, who is disabled, was waiting for his sister in front of Arleta High School when the “conduct of ICE agents and Border Patrol agents caused the false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, [and] battery” of the boy on Aug. 11, the Los Angeles Times reported.

“Allegations that Border Patrol targeted Arleta High School are FALSE,” said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in response to the lawsuit. “Agents were conducting a targeted operation on [a] criminal illegal alien.”

Andreina Mejia, the student’s mother, said during a Tuesday news conference that at least two masked men with guns approached her and her son from a white truck, separated the two, placed him in handcuffs, and pulled weapons on him.

“I looked at my son’s reaction, and I saw that he was scared,” Mejia said. “He didn’t know what was going on, so I just told him: ‘Don’t make any movement. Don’t move. Just follow instructions.’”

Mejia’s son receives special services for difficulty processing language and expressing himself, she said, and could be at greater risk of being targeted by ICE agents.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security claimed that immigration agents had later arrested an undocumented immigrant and suspected ‘MS-13 member’ found to be the boy’s cousin. On Tuesday, attorneys for the Mejia family said the man arrested was not a member of their family and was of a different nationality altogether.

“There’s no resemblance, except for the brown color,” said attorney Michael Carrillo. “That’s why they were confused, thinking that this — her boy — was the gang member when there was never a case.”

Why It Matters

The arrest comes as President Donald Trump's administration ramps up immigration arrests in a bid to deport millions of undocumented immigrants as part of a hard-line deportation operation. Critics says the government has not been abiding by due process rights for immigrants.

What To Know

Obed Elias Gonzalez-Morales, 36, a long-time U.S. resident with children who are U.S. citizens, was arrested on August 10, 2025, while fishing with his family on the Hooper Islands, Maryland, according to his attorney.

Law enforcement reportedly ran his license plate, identified an immigration issue, and detained him as he returned to his vehicle, the family said.

""I didn't even get to ask what crime I had supposedly committed. They just took me away,"" Gonzalez-Morales told Newsweek in an exclusive interview.

""My family was there—my kids. When they saw that, they were shocked and traumatized. They had never seen me like that before. They handcuffed me and took me away right in front of them,"" he said.

Gonzalez-Morales was transferred to Adams County Detention Center in Natchez, Mississippi. On August 15, Judge Thanos Kanellakos of the Hyattsville Immigration Court approved a $15,000 bond, allowing him to be released. His family had been preparing to post the bond on Monday morning.

Instead, Gonzalez-Morales was removed from his cell late Saturday and sent to Guatemala overnight.

""We got a call on Sunday from Mr. Obed that he was in Guatemala,"" family attorney Tilman Dunbar Jr. told Newsweek.

""He was taken from his cell late Saturday night and put on a plane to Guatemala sometime Sunday morning,"" he added.

""Obed Gonzalez-Morales, an illegal alien from Guatemala, was issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge on August 9, 2025. He never posted bond and remained in ICE custody until he was removed to his home country, Guatemala, on August 17, 2025,"" a senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told Newsweek.

A judge-approved bond typically allows detainees to be released pending further hearings.

Gillett said that Gonzalez-Morales was never served with a Notice to Appear or scheduled for a Master Calendar hearing. He added that Gonzalez-Morales has ""strong ties"" to the U.S., including U.S. citizen children, has lived in the country since 2012, and would have sought relief through a Section 42B Application for Cancellation of Removal.

Section 42B allows certain long-term U.S. residents to seek cancellation of removal if they meet specific criteria, including demonstrating strong family and community ties.

Gonzalez-Morales's attorney said he would have been eligible under immigration law.

""The president is doing a lot of harm, separating families. My children are traumatized. They still don't understand why I'm here in my country and not with them. I've always tried to be a good father,"" Gonzalez-Morales said.

He has five children in total, three born in Guatemala and two born in the United States.

What People Are Saying

Chris Yonushonis, a family friend and retired combat veteran, told Newsweek he was ""livid"" following Gonzalez-Morales's removal from the county.

Yonushonis also accused the DHS of violating court orders.

""ICE ignored the orders of a federal judge. We have laws. They apply to the government, too,"" Yonushonis told Newsweek.

""He just disappeared from the ICE detainee lockup after he was trafficked out of the country. We shouldn't say he was deported. Deportation is a legal process that didn't happen here,"" he said.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2710560/ice.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 20:57:01.005462

OPINION – Since January, ICE agents have arrested at least 22 people at California state courthouses in Fresno – with no regard for due process or dignity. These individuals were not fugitives. Some were awaiting trial and had not been convicted of any crime.

All of them were exercising their right to appear in court.

These raids sabotage the integrity of our courts and undermine our democracy. People miss hearings, delay trials, or plead to charges they would otherwise fight, just to avoid an encounter with ICE and deportation without due process. This shuts down access to courts for an entire class of people. Having access to a judicial system is an integral part of a working democracy. Thus, for many in our community a fundamental pillar of democracy has been removed.

California has tried to resist this intrusion. Our state’s laws and courts have repeatedly said that local law enforcement and courts must not cooperate with immigration enforcement. But ICE has proven willing to bypass those guardrails with brute force. Local law enforcement has turned a blind eye to ICE intrusions.

ICE agents in state courts are an affront to the rule of law. Beyond threatening safety and trust, these raids highlight a deeper moral failure in how our immigration system—and too often, our public discourse—treats people with past criminal convictions.

Even among those who condemn ICE’s presence in state courts, it’s become common to distinguish between “good” immigrants and “bad” ones. Immigrants with no criminal record are seen as deserving of protection, while those with prior convictions are cast aside – as though any contact with the criminal legal system forever forfeits a person’s humanity or right to remain.

Such a belief is to ignore how the war on drugs and the continuing scourge of mass incarceration has created a legal system that is deeply flawed. Communities of color, including immigrant communities, are disproportionately targeted, surveilled, arrested, and prosecuted for crimes that white people commit at similar or higher rates. From widespread stop-and-frisks to massive over policing, the U.S. legal system has created criminal records for generations of people of color, particularly in low-income communities.

To then turn around and say those records justify permanent banishment from the country only deepens the harm.

Consider this: many of the people being picked up by ICE throughout the state because of their contact with the criminal legal system are longtime residents with deep ties to their families and communities. Many of their convictions are years, even decades, old. And many of those convictions are not grounds for removal under federal immigration law. But ICE doesn’t care. Their tactics are aggressive, their targets broad, and their discretion virtually unchecked.

If we continue to draw a line between “innocent” immigrants and “criminal” ones, we cede ground to a system that was never just to begin with. We validate the idea that deportation is a fair consequence in the criminal legal system. We ignore the racial and economic disparities that drive that system. And we forget that redemption, rehabilitation, and belonging are core American values.

The answer is recognizing that every immigrant, every person in our society, deserves due process, dignity, and the opportunity to stay rooted in their community.

When we accept deportation as a natural extension of a criminal conviction, we are punishing entire communities, turning courtrooms into trapdoors, and undermining the very idea of justice.

Public defenders, immigrant rights organizations, and community members have been sounding the alarm for years: ICE’s presence in our courts is a threat to public safety and the very foundation of equal justice. It’s time we listen—and act—not only to stop these raids, but to challenge the false hierarchy of human worth they represent.

Levit is being held at the Dodge Detention Center in Juneau, Wisconsin, according to ICE records.

Newsweek reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security via email for comment.

Why It Matters

Levit's case spotlights the Trump administration's broader illegal immigration crackdown, which includes apprehending non-violent individuals who lack the proper credentials to remain in the United States.

His family claims he was never provided with green card interviews for the majority of the last decade.

In February, a lawsuit was filed against ICE representing 276 immigrants from ex-Soviet countries, including Russia, Georgia and Kazakhstan, who claimed that they were detained and locked up for extended periods of time, violating federal law and internal policies, according to the Louisiana Illuminator.

In June, ICE reported its arrest of a 39-year-old, Tajikistan-born Russian national in Philadelphia who was wanted overseas for being suspected of being a member of the Al-Qaeda terrorist organization.

What To Know

Levit and his Slinger, Wisconsin-based family, which includes his wife and four children (ages 8, 6 and 4-year-old twins), fled Russia over eight years ago to seek asylum in the U.S. due to Levit ""facing persecution for refusing to participate in corrupt practices,"" according to a GoFundMe started by his wife. As of Wednesday morning, $1,650 had been raised of its goal of $5,500.

The husband and father has been detained for over three weeks. Photos show him wearing a hard hat and safety gear as part of his job. The job title was never mentioned.

""As a dedicated public servant, he always upheld the values of honesty and integrity,"" the GoFundMe states. ""However, this commitment came at a devastating cost. Our family was forced to leave behind a life we cherished, filled with love and hope, as threats, searches and even an assassination attempt made it clear that our safety was in jeopardy.

""The fear for our lives pushed us to start anew in a foreign land, without connections and with limited English. We faced countless challenges, losing everything multiple times, yet we persevered.""

The crowdfunding campaign alleges that Levit was taken into custody ""in handcuffs and chains, without explanation"" as he left for work one day. It also alleges that Russian authorities issued an Interpol request for his arrest, seeking to deport him back to a country ""where he would face certain death or imprisonment for his beliefs.""

""The Russian government is relentless in its pursuit of those they deem undesirable, and they have taken away my beloved husband and the father of our four young children,"" says the GoFundMe. ""Throughout our time in the U.S., we had an attorney who was supposed to guide us and represent us, but on that fateful day he abandoned us, leaving us without support when we needed it most.

""We lost all the money we had paid him, and now we find ourselves in desperate need of funds to hire a new attorney.""

They added that ""without legal representation, the odds are stacked against us,"" saying that individuals in his position who lack counsel ""almost always lose.""

The Trump administration is restoring an immigration policy that was last used under former President George H.W. Bush's tenure to conduct neighborhood investigations related to immigrants applying for U.S. naturalization, according to a policy memo released Tuesday by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

""U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is resuming personal investigations of aliens applying for naturalization in accordance with section 335(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" the memo, dated Aug. 22 but released publicly Tuesday, states.

The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act abolished immigration quotas and championed welcoming ""those who can contribute most to this country — to its growth, to its strength, to its spirit,"" according to President Lyndon B. Johnson's remarks at the time of him signing the act into law.

The administration's revitalization of personal investigations, also called ""neighborhood checks,"" will include U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services requesting information from immigrants seeking naturalization, such as ""testimonial letters from neighbors, employers, co-workers, and business associates who know the alien and can provide substantiated information about the alien, including any of the requirements for naturalization.""

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is an office under the Department of Homeland Security's umbrella that oversees the nation's legal immigration processing.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO VET LEGAL IMMIGRANT APPLICANTS FOR 'ANTI-AMERICANISM' AND ANTISEMITISM

The memorandum stated that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ""generally waives the requirements for neighborhood investigations"" under the 1965 law and historically had relied instead on FBI background checks to determine an ""applicant’s good moral character and eligibility for naturalization.""

The personal investigations will now include interviewing a naturalization applicant's neighbors and employment history stretching back at least five years before an individual applied for naturalization, according to the memo. The checks are to ensure ""scrutiny of an alien’s residency, good moral character, attachment to the U.S. Constitution, and disposition to the good order and happiness of the United States.""

TRUMP ADMIN TO WEIGH US CITIZENSHIP APPLICANTS' 'POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS,' GOOD MORAL CHARACTER

Such investigations were last conducted in 1991 during the first Bush's tenure, according to the memo. Similar investigations were carried out on immigrants applying for naturalization as far back as 1802, the memo added.

""From 1802 to 1981, petitioners for naturalization were required to present two witnesses who could testify to their qualifications for citizenship,"" the memo stated. ""In 1981, Congress eliminated the requirement for witnesses, a change justified in part by the fact that a petitioner’s character could be better determined by an investigation, including a neighborhood investigation, if necessary.

""However, by 1991, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service had essentially stopped conducting neighborhood investigations.""

TOP DHS OFFICIAL CALLS CITIZENSHIP TEST 'TOO SOFT,' URGES MAJOR OVERHAUL OF NATURALIZATION PROCESS

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services celebrated the return of the personal investigations.

Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in comments provided to Fox News Digital Wednesday that the office ""is working to ensure that only the most qualified applicants receive American citizenship.""

""The Immigration and Nationality Act directs USCIS to conduct personal investigations, and incorporating neighborhood investigations will help enhance these statutorily required investigations to ensure that we are meeting congressional intent,"" he continued. ""Americans should be comforted knowing that USCIS is taking seriously its responsibility to ensure aliens are being properly vetted and are of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States and well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.""

The invitation, which came in an email sent last week by DHS to North Carolina’s GOP-controlled election board, appears to signal the administration’s latest step to encourage states to use data managed by the federal government to hunt for noncitizens on the rolls.

In the August 21 email, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) official invited North Carolina to participate in the limited rollout, which the official called “an exciting opportunity.”

The email was sent to the North Carolina board’s associate general counsel and posted online as part of the agenda for a Wednesday board meeting.

“This soft launch is by invitation only—we are not announcing its availably [sic] for widespread use at this time,” wrote the USCIS official, Timothy Benz. “SAVE needs to throttle the intake of these cases at the outset, as we know the demand will be high and want to ensure the system’s ability to meet the increased demand. We are prioritizing your state due to prior participation and engagements between our agencies.”

At Wednesday’s regularly-scheduled public meeting, the North Carolina State Board of Elections tabled discussion of participating in the DHS soft launch after returning from a lengthy closed session.

After returning to public session and voting on other matters, board chair Francis X. De Luca (R) said the board would “skip” the SAVE agenda item.

“We are going to put that off for another day. We’re not dealing with that issue,” De Luca said. “We discussed some of the [legal] details in closed session and decided that we weren’t ready to deal with that issue.”

The email requested North Carolina upload their citizenship confirmation request to SAVE on Wednesday, and provide in advance the number of registrations the Board would upload in bulk for verification.

By tabling the matter, the Board effectively declined the offer to test the system’s new capabilities, although the email did say rescheduling may be possible.

President Donald Trump ordered DHS in March to make the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program available for free to state election officials for confirming the citizenship status of registered voters. SAVE uses various federal databases to flag whether someone is a non-citizen, and was originally developed to check eligibility for federal benefits programs through one-by-one queries.

Since the order, CIS integrated data from the Social Security Administration and added the ability to perform citizenship checks in bulk. The latest upgrade allows election officials to use just the last four digits of a social security number — rather than requiring all nine — along with the individual’s name and date of birth when submitting a citizenship check request.

Under the federal Help Americans Vote Act, when someone registers to vote, state election officers must ask for either their driver’s license number or the last four digits of their social security number. Allowing election officials to use SAVE with just the last four social security number digits, rather than all nine, would let them rely on readily available data to use SAVE.

State election officials were invited to the White House last month where CIS officials pitched them on an untested solution for a nearly nonexistent problem. Before that, the administration provided a briefing on using SAVE to the Election Integrity Network, a far-right anti-voting group founded by lawyer Cleta Mitchell.

Using SAVE for purging voter registration rolls has led voting-rights groups and Democratic officials to question whether DHS has complied with federal data laws, which generally require federal agencies to give public notice before using personal data in novel ways.

The expansion also comes amid renewed concerns about the Trump administration’s cybersecurity lapses. The Department of Government Efficiency uploaded a database with every American’s name, date of birth and social security number to an unsecured cloud server in June, according to a recent whistleblowing complaint filed by the Social Security Administration’s chief data officer.

According to CIS records, twenty states, as well as a few dozen local election offices, are currently registered to use the SAVE program for voter roll maintenance.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration’s attempt to work with North Carolina’s elections board comes as no surprise.

After the GOP lost the North Carolina gubernatorial race in 2024, the Republican-dominated legislature transferred the power to appoint members of the elections board from the Democratic governor to the Republican state auditor. That maneuver led to Republicans controlling three of the Board’s five seats.

The Republicans on the board quickly ousted its longtime executive director, a respected nonpartisan election administrator, and replaced her with Sam Hayes, a GOP operative who was serving as chief counsel to the House Speaker.

Under Hayes, the board coordinated with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in response to a lawsuit filed by the DOJ aiming to require the state to tighten its rules on what identifying information votes must provide. Voting advocates have expressed concern that the board’s new requirement that some voters provide additional information could lead valid voters to be removed from the rolls and disenfranchised.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/North-Carolina-State-Capitol-in-Raleigh-AdobeStock_161544367-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 18:57:44.133738

Mayor Muriel Bowser on Wednesday said ""masked ICE agents"" have ""not worked"" and called National Guard troops sent from other states inefficient under President Trump's federal takeover.

The big picture: Despite the critique, Bowser's 20-day review of the crackdown was overwhelmingly positive — a significant tone shift for the mayor, who suggested she and Trump are on the same page when it comes to ""priorities around safety and investment in infrastructure.""

Driving the news: Bowser pledged support for Trump's $2 billion request to Congress to ""beautify"" D.C. parks, fountains, streets and more.

She also praised what she calls the ""federal surge"" for reducing crime in D.C. Bowser said having more federal law enforcement on city streets has helped tamp down on illegal guns, carjackings, and homicides.

""We think that there's more accountability in the system, or at least perceived accountability in the system, that is driving down illegal behavior,"" Bowser said at the Wednesday press conference.

By the numbers: There's been an 87% drop in D.C. carjackings over the 20-day period compared to the same time last year, per the mayor.

D.C.'s data also shows a 15% decline in overall crime from the same period in 2024.

Yes, but: While the mayor painted a Trumpian gold lining on much of the enforcement, she specifically targeted masked ICE agents and out-of-town National Guards members as examples of ""what's not working.""

She also called out ""a break in trust between police and community,"" as federal officers team up with D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

What they're saying: ""I am devastated by people living in fear,"" Bowser said, acknowledging that ""there's tremendous anxiety in the District.""

Between the lines: D.C.'s sanctuary city status has come under question, amid a spike in noncriminal ICE arrests and MPD's cooperation with immigration authorities.

Bowser clarified: ""There's been no change to the law,"" nor ""sanctuary values.""

Bowser also noted D.C.'s small but ""highly visible"" homeless encampment population, which has been targeted in clearings under the federal takeover.

She plans to take a census later this week to quantify and locate homeless individuals, and connect people to shelters and services.

Zoom out: Bowser, who had previously called federalizing D.C.'s police force an ""authoritarian push,"" was notably deferential toward Trump days after he issued a warning shot from the Oval Office:

""Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won't be mayor very long because we'll take it over with the federal government, run it like it's supposed to be run,"" the president said Friday.

Bowser held Wednesday's press conference after speaking with Trump, a meeting she compared to one during his first days in office, ""where we discussed shared priorities for the District.""

Bowser noted that Trump's ""knowledge of D.C. had significantly increased from the first time he was in the White House.""

What we're watching: Bowser highlighted more long-term solutions for effective local control: more MPD, prosecutors, judges, and effective prevention programs.

A big priority: recruiting 500 new MPD officers over the next few years.

The bottom line: What the Trump administration calls a takeover, Bowser is framing as an investment in D.C.'s future.

Take Union Station. On Wednesday, the Department of Transportation took control of its management.

Bowser said a ""total transformation"" of the station would be an ""amazing initiative,"" and told Trump it could be ""a very significant and good investment for this region.""

In its holding, the Seventh Circuit emphasizes “flexibility” because “a plaintiff is not automatically entitled to notice” even if a “material dispute” exists.
Other circuit courts have departed from Lusardi and established their own approaches.
The Seventh Circuit declined to adopt either approach in Richards.
Consequently, the Seventh Circuit’s decision marks a shift in how collective actions are evaluated, and it offers a better opportunity for employers to challenge whether a proposed collective is truly similarly situated.","In a recent decision, the Seventh Circuit favorably revised the standard for defendant employers faced with a putative collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). In Richards v. Eli Lilly & Co., the court departed from the widely-adopted lenient standard used to analyze a plaintiff’s request to send notice to putative collective action members set forth in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. The Seventh Circuit, which governs district courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, has instead adopted a balanced approach that requires district courts to consider evidence from both sides with respect to similarity and allows them to issue notice to potential plaintiffs only when there is “at least a material factual dispute” of whether individuals are indeed similarly situated.

The Basics

Section 216(b) of the FLSA allows employees to bring wage actions against their employer on behalf of themselves or other “similarly situated” employees, and the ADEA incorporates this provision to allow employees to form collective actions when suing an employer for age discrimination. However, without a national standard from Congress or the Supreme Court, district courts have been left to decide how and when to permit notice to go out to other potential plaintiffs. This vacuum gave rise to the two-step approach from Lusardi.

In Lusardi, a 1987 decision from the District Court in New Jersey, the court split the collective action into two steps. The first step requires a plaintiff seeking to send notice to make a “modest factual showing” that they and the potential plaintiffs were subject to the same unlawful plan or policy by their employer. Once a plaintiff has met this low burden, the court then authorized notice to those individuals, who could then opt into the collective action. The second step occurs once discovery is complete, when the employer typically challenges whether the collective is indeed similarly situated by moving to decertify the collective action.

The New Seventh Circuit Approach

In declining to follow Lusardi, the Seventh Circuit held that a plaintiff must at least show that a “material factual dispute” exists as to whether the proposed collective is similarly situated. This is viewed as a higher evidentiary burden on the named plaintiffs, who must demonstrate that they and the proposed collective were subject to the same unlawful plan or policy. Additionally (and crucially), district courts must now permit defendants to submit evidence rebutting a plaintiff’s claim that a collective is appropriate. By doing so, courts will evaluate the extent to which plaintiffs engage with and respond to opposing evidence.

This differs from the Lusardi standard in two ways. First, plaintiffs must now cross a higher evidentiary threshold to justify issuing notice to a potential collective. Second, courts will consider evidence by both parties—not just a “modest” showing by the plaintiff—before deciding whether notice is appropriate.

In its holding, the Seventh Circuit emphasizes “flexibility” because “a plaintiff is not automatically entitled to notice” even if a “material dispute” exists. District courts may still use the two-step approach and issue notice to the proposed collective if they believes that necessary evidence is in the hands of potential plaintiffs. Alternatively, if a court believes that a similarity dispute can be resolved before authorizing notice, it may allow limited discovery to decide whether or not notice is appropriate.

Other circuit courts have departed from Lusardi and established their own approaches. For example, the Fifth Circuit demands plaintiffs prove by a “preponderance of the evidence” that the individuals are similarly situated before the court permits notice to issue. This means the plaintiff bears the burden from the outset of a case to definitively prove that certification is warranted. The Sixth Circuit, on the other hand, requires a “strong likelihood” that the potential plaintiffs are similarly situated, and a court may expedite discovery to decide whether notice is appropriate. The Seventh Circuit declined to adopt either approach in Richards. With a range of approaches emerging, this could set the stage for resolution by the Supreme Court.

Conclusion

Before Richards, defendants were left with very few options, while plaintiffs were permitted to form potentially oversized collectives that may have included both eligible and ineligible plaintiffs. As the Seventh Circuit admitted, this meant defendants were susceptible to higher discovery costs, premature settlements, and an influx of potential claimants who may choose to bring their own individual lawsuits.

Consequently, the Seventh Circuit’s decision marks a shift in how collective actions are evaluated, and it offers a better opportunity for employers to challenge whether a proposed collective is truly similarly situated. Employers who respond strategically could see reduced litigation and/or settlement costs and increase the odds of defeating the certification of a collective action. Affected Employers should reach out to their employment counsel with any questions or explore this development further.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15069_1440.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 18:57:56.249320

In turn, foreign students have taken advantage of U.S. generosity and have become “forever” students, perpetually enrolled in higher education courses to remain in the U.S.
Under President Trump’s proposed rule, the federal government would set the authorized admission and extension periods for foreign students and exchange visitors up to the duration of the program they are participating in, not to exceed a 4-year period.
The rule would set the initial admission period for foreign media representatives at up to 240 days.
This proposed rule was first proposed under President Trump in 2020 but was withdrawn by the Biden Administration in 2021 much to the detriment of U.S. citizens and taxpayers.","New rule will limit the amount of time that foreign students, professors, physicians, and other visa holders are allowed to remain in the United States without additional screening and vetting

WASHINGTON, DC – Wednesday, the Trump Administration announced a proposed rule that, if finalized, would limit the length of time certain visa holders – including foreign students– are allowed to stay in the United States, thereby curbing visa abuse and increasing the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to properly vet and oversee these individuals.

“For too long, past Administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the U.S. virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amount of taxpayer dollars, and disadvantaging U.S. citizens,” said a DHS spokesperson. “This new proposed rule would end that abuse once and for all by limiting the amount of time certain visa holders are allowed to remain in the U.S., easing the burden on the federal government to properly oversee foreign students and their history.”

Since 1978, foreign students (F visa holders) have been admitted into the U.S. for an unspecified period known as “duration of status.” Unlike other visas issued, those with a “duration of status” designation are allowed to remain in the U.S. for an indefinite amount of time without further screening and vetting.

In turn, foreign students have taken advantage of U.S. generosity and have become “forever” students, perpetually enrolled in higher education courses to remain in the U.S.

Under President Trump’s proposed rule, the federal government would set the authorized admission and extension periods for foreign students and exchange visitors up to the duration of the program they are participating in, not to exceed a 4-year period. The rule would set the initial admission period for foreign media representatives at up to 240 days. Foreign media representatives would be eligible for an extension period of up to 240 days, but no longer than the length of the temporary activity or assignment.

Additionally, admitting foreign students, exchange, and foreign media classifications for a fixed period of time would require said aliens to for apply for authorization to extend their stay with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), therefore requiring regular assessments by DHS for the alien to remain in the U.S. for a longer period.

This would allow DHS to conduct proper oversight as part of SEVP and SEVIS by making access to necessary information more accessible and reducing the number of individuals here on visas.

This proposed rule was first proposed under President Trump in 2020 but was withdrawn by the Biden Administration in 2021 much to the detriment of U.S. citizens and taxpayers.

Marshals and can hold up to 1,064 people overall — is only contracted to hold a maximum of 250 ICE detainees per day.
At its peak this fiscal year, the center had exceeded its ICE capacity by more than 200 at 462, making it among the 10 most-overcrowded immigration facilities out of the nation's 180 ICE detention centers, according to TRAC.
“This increase in law enforcement personnel will obviously raise the level of individuals arrested and the requirement for detention capacity.” CoreCivic already entered a new contract in February to increase capacity at the Nevada Southern Detention Center.
Local officials, however, said the cost of holding ICE detainees was too much for the county to bear.","As President Donald Trump ramps up immigration enforcement efforts and arrests multiply statewide, Nevada's main immigration detention center has become one of the most over-capacity immigration facilities in the nation.

As of April 2025, the Nevada Southern Detention Center, located in Pahrump, exceeded its contractual capacity with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by more than 40 people per day, according to data obtained by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). The facility — which houses a mix of detainees from ICE, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals and can hold up to 1,064 people overall — is only contracted to hold a maximum of 250 ICE detainees per day.

At its peak this fiscal year, the center had exceeded its ICE capacity by more than 200 at 462, making it among the 10 most-overcrowded immigration facilities out of the nation's 180 ICE detention centers, according to TRAC.

Contractual capacity measures the number of detainees a private prison agrees to hold — so it doesn’t necessarily mean an entire building is physically crowded. ICE also doesn’t release capacity figures in real time, so TRACs data lags behind current conditions. And TRAC’s latest measure showed that across all facilities nationwide, ICE is only using about 76 percent of its contractual capacity.

But the situation in Nevada could be part of the rationale for creating more detention facilities in the state.

The findings were released a few weeks before The Washington Post revealed that ICE was eyeing creating a new facility in Nevada, called a “soft-side” facility, which is a makeshift structure composed of tents. Such a facility would double detention capacity in Nevada, adding space for an additional 450 people, per documents obtained by The Washington Post that The Nevada Independent has not been able to independently verify.

Arrests, detention spending on the rise

Officials from CoreCivic, the private company that oversees the Nevada Southern Detention Center, have said that ballooning immigration arrests have increased demand for detention space. They said they expect demand to increase even more with the passage of Trump’s budget bill, which pumps more than $45 billion into expanding detention capacity nationwide and $29.9 billion towards the agencies’ enforcement operations through 2029.

Already in the first six months of Trump’s term, immigration arrests in Nevada have jumped nearly 300 percent compared with the same time period in 2024. Seventy percent of those people had not committed a violent or sex crime.

“The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill has changed dramatically the activity of ICE and securing bed capacity,” Damon T. Hininger, the CEO of CoreCivic, said during an Aug. 11 earnings call. “This increase in law enforcement personnel will obviously raise the level of individuals arrested and the requirement for detention capacity.”

CoreCivic already entered a new contract in February to increase capacity at the Nevada Southern Detention Center.

In a recent earnings report from CoreCivic, company officials said they had several “soft-side” contracts in the works, although they did not provide details about where and when the contracts would take effect.

“We are in various stages of negotiation on multiple idled facilities to provide additional bed capacity to ICE,” Hininger said during the August earnings call.

The number of ICE detainees at the Nevada Southern Detention Center marks a dramatic increase from the number of people detained during former President Joe Biden’s administration. At the end of 2023, 163 people were detained at the facility, according to an ICE end-of-year report.

The other facilities to most exceed daily detention capacity are the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami, the Clay County Justice Center in Indiana, and Kandiyohi County Jail in Minnesota.

CoreCivic referred The Indy to ICE for additional information on any contracts and said in a statement that it stays ""in regular contact with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and all our government partners to understand their changing needs, and we work within their established procurement processes.”

ICE responded “acknowledging receipt of your query. Thank you.""

Elected officials raise questions

Officials have recently raised concerns about access to resources at the detention center. Last week, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV) put out a statement calling for increased oversight of the facility after being denied a visit, and the Latino Legislative Caucus, which visited earlier this summer, raised concerns about access to legal services. Last year, more than 30 reports of medical negligence, racial discrimination and verbal assault prompted a federal investigation into the facility.

“I spoke with nine detainees today, and what they shared with me is deeply concerning,” Horsford said in a statement. “Medical treatment can take weeks; detainees do not have reliable access to immigration attorneys or resources; and many have been moved across state lines in the dead of night without advanced notice or understanding of where they were going.”

Discussion of a new facility comes as local jails have struggled to keep up with the fiscal demands of supporting ICE operations. In November, the Nye County Detention Center in Pahrump terminated a contract in place from 2019 to house ICE inmates alongside the county’s other inmates. Before the contract ended, it was the state’s second largest ICE holding facility. Local officials, however, said the cost of holding ICE detainees was too much for the county to bear.

“I don’t think it's to anyone’s advantage except ICE,” former Republican Commissioner Donna Cox said about the contract during a county meeting.

The Henderson Detention Center, which also holds a mix of local detainees and people arrested by ICE, has only seen a slight uptick in people detained by the agency. At the end of fiscal year 2023, 69 people were held there on behalf of ICE, in comparison to the 76 people held by the fiscal year 2025 to date, according to ICE data.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/07/fcc17134-nllc-ice-visit-1-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-27 20:57:04.789171

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has denied the allegations.
If Abrego Garcia is sent by passenger jet, it would be unusual if he were the only deportee on the flight, he says.
More than 250 Venezuelans were repatriated following detention in the same Salvadoran prison that housed Abrego Garcia.
It's unclear what would happen to Abrego Garcia once in Uganda, says Nelson Kasfir, an emeritus professor of government at Dartmouth who studies Africa.","The Trump administration says it intends to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia — the man who was wrongfully sent to El Salvador in March before being returned to the U.S. — to Uganda, a country with which he has no connection, in what experts describe as a costly, complex and legally questionable move.

A federal judge in Maryland has set a next hearing for Oct. 6 and blocked his deportation before then. In the meantime, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said Wednesday that he wants to seek asylum in the U.S. as part of a new claim based on a fear of persecution.

In a statement on Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem justified the administration's targeting of Abrego Garcia by repeating allegations against him. ""President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator, to terrorize American citizens any longer,"" Noem said.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, has denied the allegations. He has not been convicted of any crimes and has not been formally charged with being a gang member.

Abrego Garcia, who has a family in Maryland, returned to the U.S. in June, after spending several weeks in El Salvador's notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo prison — known as CECOT. He was then immediately detained, after being indicted on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. Last week, he was released from pretrial detention but then was re-arrested by ICE agents on Monday in Baltimore.

U.S. officials said they would send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica if he pleaded guilty and served any sentence in the U.S., but he declined the offer.

For now, he's being held at a detention center in Virginia. But his ultimate fate remains unclear.

If the courts ultimately approve his removal, here is the process by which that might occur.

An escorted flight

Abrego Garcia would likely be placed on a chartered passenger plane or military transport, accompanied by ICE agents who are part of the agency's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) unit, according to César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at the Ohio State University who studies immigration.

""He would be physically shackled — most likely at the ankles, sometimes also handcuffed — for the entire length of the flight, which could be many, many hours,"" García Hernández says.

If Abrego Garcia is sent by passenger jet, it would be unusual if he were the only deportee on the flight, he says. ""Most of the aircraft ICE uses are large passenger aircraft — Boeing 737s — and that's why we typically do not see ICE deport one person at a time. These flights are simply too expensive.""

Jacqueline Stevens, a political science professor at Northwestern University, says that when people were deported to South Sudan, some were flown as far as Djibouti on a private jet, and then from Djibouti to South Sudan on a military plane. (However, those flights also faced legal challenges and may not be indicative of what happens on future flights.)

She says the optics of sending Abrego Garcia on his own wouldn't be good, especially for an administration that has billed itself as using taxpayer money wisely. ""That's not going to be a good look"" for ICE, she says.

Earlier this year, immigration officials admitted that deporting Abrego Garicia to El Salvador was due to an ""administrative error."" It occurred in violation of an immigration judge ruling in 2019 that he was deportable, but not back to El Salvador, where he had a ""well-founded fear"" of gang persecution.

Uganda's foreign ministry said last week that it reached a ""temporary"" agreement with the U.S. to accept deportees, saying it was meant for people ""who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin.""

It said as a condition of the agreement, ""individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted."" It also said that Uganda ""prefers"" to take individuals from other African countries.

NPR reached out to the Ugandan embassy and the Department of Homeland Security for specific information about how Abrego Garcia's removal and transfer might occur. Ugandan officials did not immediately reply. DHS referred back to Noem's original statement without providing details.

Although Abrego Garcia's case is still being adjudicated, he wouldn't be the first migrant to be deported to a third country in recent months. In July, the U.S. removed five migrants to Eswatini, a landlocked kingdom in Southern Africa formerly known as Swaziland. That same month, eight men were sent to South Sudan, only one of whom was from there. More than 250 Venezuelans were repatriated following detention in the same Salvadoran prison that housed Abrego Garcia.

Anwen Hughes, director of legal strategy for refugee programs at Human Rights First, says that it isn't illegal for the U.S. to try to deport a person to a third country, but the law ""requires them to run through a hierarchy of countries before deciding to send, for example, a Vietnamese person to South Sudan,"" she says. ""They do not seem to be operating that way.""

Hughes is part of a legal team that filed a motion for a class certification and a temporary restraining order in March challenging ICE's policy on removing individuals to third countries without notice.

""It's highly unusual for the United States to deport someone to a country to which they have no ties,"" says García Hernández. ""Almost always, deportations are to a person's country of citizenship or prior residence.""

Handover upon landing in Uganda

Once the plane carrying Abrego Garcia and his ICE escorts lands in Uganda, the agents will likely hand over paperwork attesting to his identity, criminal history and medical records, according to García Hernández. ""At that point, the U.S. is essentially done.""

From there, it would be up to Uganda to decide what to do, he says.

""Any claims of criminal activity are fair game for Ugandan officials,"" he says, adding that ""it's a tough sell for a foreign government to welcome into their community someone the U.S. president and his Cabinet have repeatedly described as horrifically dangerous,"" despite Abrego Garcia's lack of criminal record.

It's unclear what would happen to Abrego Garcia once in Uganda, says Nelson Kasfir, an emeritus professor of government at Dartmouth who studies Africa. ""I do not think they would detain or harm him,"" Kasfir says. ""I also doubt they would promptly re-deport him, but that's harder to say.""

Kristof Titeca, a professor at Antwerp University in Belgium who studies African governance, notes that it's not the first time Uganda has hosted ""failed asylum seekers"" from other countries. In 2018, for example, it hosted Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers deported from Israel. In that instance, they were allowed to stay in a Kampala hotel for a few nights, ""then left to their own devices,"" he says. ""Contrary to what they were promised, they also didn't get a residence permit. Many of them decided to flee to Europe.""

Opposition figures in Uganda pushed back on the scheme, saying parliament in the largely authoritarian country had not been given a say in the agreement with the U.S. Details remain largely unknown about the deal brokered between President Yoweri Museveni — who is seeking to extend his nearly 40-year rule in next year's elections — and the U.S.

""We don't know the exact arrangement, the circumstances, who is being brought, how many are being brought,"" Joel Ssenyonyi, the leader of opposition in parliament, told NPR. ""If these are being considered misfits in the U.S., what makes them fit to be here in Uganda?""

García Hernández thinks that by sending Abrego Garcia to Uganda, ""the Trump administration is trying to circumnavigate an immigration judge's order barring deportation to El Salvador by triangulating — sending him to Uganda first.""

Sandoval-Moshenberg, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, tells NPR that Uganda has given no assurances that his client can stay in that country and ""not be quickly re-deported to his country of citizenship.""

As the administration aggressively pursues its immigration enforcement agenda, it is creating a crisis in the nation’s education system—one that’s leaving thousands of children behind academically and emotionally.

Short-Term Impact: Absenteeism and Fear in the Classroom

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has significantly increased enforcement through workplace raids, neighborhood sweeps, and community targeting, including near schools and places of worship. Policies that once protected these “sensitive locations” were revoked in January 2025. As a result, the second half of the 2024-2025 school year saw a chilling effect where families were pulling their children out of school, terrified that a parent, family member, or child could be detained or deported as some students and families have been.

When students are too afraid to go to school or are too distracted by the threat of family separation to focus, their education suffers. And these aren’t isolated cases. As of 2023, approximately 5 million children in the U.S. live with at least one undocumented family member. The scale of the impact is national.

Long-Term Consequences: A Threat to the Right to Education

Another insidious threat lies in how Trump-era policies and rhetoric have emboldened some states to go further and challenge the very right of immigrant children to receive an education. This year, lawmakers in states like Oklahoma and Tennessee proposed legislation that would require school districts to report undocumented students, charge them to attend school, or deny enrollment to children without legal immigration status. Neither of these efforts passed, yet other threats persist.

These efforts are a clear attack on the landmark 1982 Supreme Court case Plyler v. Doe, which ruled that all children, regardless of immigration status, have the right to a free public education. If these state efforts were to succeed, hundreds of thousands of children (there were about 1 million undocumented children aged 5-18 in 2023) could be barred from education, creating devastating cycles of poverty, social exclusion, and growing inequality.

Community Resistance and Local Advocacy

In the face of these threats, many states, local school districts, community organizations, and grassroots leaders continue to show up for their students and their families. Across the country, states like Illinois have passed legislation that preserves access to education, regardless of immigration status. School districts like Los Angeles have introduced policies to protect immigrant families. Teachers can also undergo training on how to support undocumented students and respond if enforcement actions occur.

The dedication of local leadership and grassroots mobilization sends a clear message: schools should be safe spaces for learning, not sites of fear and exclusion.

The Role of AI in Surveillance and Deportation

Adding another layer of complexity is the increasing use of artificial intelligence in immigration enforcement. Under contracts with tech companies, ICE has gained access to powerful AI tools that aggregate data from sources such as IRS records, Social Security files, passports, and license-plate readers. These systems often operate without transparency or oversight and can disproportionately impact immigrant communities.

There are growing concerns that AI-driven surveillance could be used to track migrants, refugees and asylum seekers who engage with public services, including school enrollment. AI is already being used to track and revoke the visas of international students across the United States.

Though the full impact of the technology is still being assessed, its usage and reach are expanding rapidly. Without safeguards, these tools risk deepening mistrust in public institutions and further alienating vulnerable families.

Moving Forward: Protecting Every Child’s Right to Learn

Trauma, disrupted schooling, and the erosion of trust in institutions have long-term consequences for both individuals and the broader society. But hope remains in the resilient and compassionate responses from communities across the country, dedicated to keeping schools as safe spaces where everyone can learn.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-impact-learning-classroom-shadows-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 16:56:54.409377

Officials in Gaza say that only 14% of essential food items were allowed into the enclave last month. At least 76 Palestinians have also been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since dawn, including 18 people seeking food. This comes as Al Jazeera reports Israeli forces are leveling entire blocks of Gaza City.

The Israeli government is claiming Monday’s deadly strike on Nasser Hospital targeted a camera used by Hamas for surveillance, but Israel provided no evidence to back up the claim. The double-tap strike killed 21 people, including five journalists.

In media news, a Reuters photojournalist has resigned over her outlet’s response to Israel’s killing of journalists in Gaza, including Reuters cameraman Hussam al-Masri, who was killed in the Nasser Hospital attack. In a statement, Valerie Zink said, “By repeating Israel’s genocidal fabrications without determining if they have any credibility … Western media outlets have made possible the killing of more journalists in two years on one tiny strip of land than in WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine combined.”

Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch is saying that U.S. forces and personnel can be held liable for Israeli war crimes for “providing intelligence for Israeli strikes and conducting extensive coordination and planning.”

In Israel, nationwide protests are continuing. On Tuesday, more than 350,000 people gathered at Tel Aviv’s public plaza calling on the government to accept a ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza. Large protests were also held in Jerusalem. This is Michal Gomel Blank, a protester in Jerusalem.

Michal Gomel Blank: “We are here demonstrating in front of the Cabinet, the government meeting that is supposed to discuss a deal, a deal for returning the hostages and end the fighting and the war. And we are here to remind our government that the deal needs to be sealed. All the hostages need to come back home, and we need to stop the war in order to do this.”

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces are conducting a raid on Nablus. At least 80 Palestinians have been injured. This comes a day after Israeli forces raided Ramallah and al-Bireh. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, 58 people were injured, eight by live fire and 14 by rubber-coated bullets. The Palestinian Ministry of Health said that a child had to receive surgery after being hit by live fire. Israeli forces detained three Palestinians in the raid.

Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley visited the West Bank Tuesday and stopped at a Palestinian church in Taybeh that was attacked by Israeli settlers. Senator Van Hollen called for an end to settler violence.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen: “Well, we’re here, overall, because we want to focus on the really terrible situation throughout this area, including the war in Gaza. And one of our messages, we need to end the war in Gaza and bring the hostages home. But we also need to end this continued settler violence on the West Bank, which people here in this town of Taybeh witnessed and experienced firsthand.”

A coalition of 100 human and civil rights groups are calling on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to secure the release of Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian American who has been held in Israeli prison for six months. The coalition includes the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the Center for Constitutional Rights and Pax Christi USA.

In a joint letter, the groups say, “Mohammed is suffering from scabies and has not received any medication; he has also lost over 30 pounds due to Israel denying him food and medical treatment.” He was abducted from his family home in the West Bank over allegations of rock throwing and is currently being held in Israel’s Ofer Prison, known for its human rights abuses. Mohammed Ibrahim is the cousin of Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old Palestinian American who was beaten to death by Israeli settlers in July.

A Democratic National Committee panel has rejected a resolution calling for an arms embargo on Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza. The vote came during a DNC meeting in Minneapolis. A second resolution on Israel was initially approved but then withdrawn by its author, DNC Chair Ken Martin. Martin then called for a task force to be formed to help build party unity on the issue. We will speak to the sponsor of the arms embargo resolution later in the program.

A group of current and former Microsoft workers occupied the office of Microsoft’s President Brad Smith on Tuesday to protest Microsoft’s work with the Israeli military in Gaza. The tech workers accused Microsoft of “powering the genocide in Gaza and the mass surveillance of Palestinians.” Seven protesters were arrested. This comes as Bloomberg reports Microsoft has asked the FBI for help tracking pro-Palestinian protests targeting the company.

The Trump administration is making major changes to the U.S. citizenship application process by reinstating “neighborhood checks” to vet immigrants. In a memo obtained by CBS News, the administration detailed plans to interview neighbors and colleagues of citizenship applicants, reviving a procedure last used by the George H.W. Bush administration. The government had previously waived neighborhood investigations, instead relying on the FBI to conduct background checks of immigrants. The investigations would focus on the moral character of applicants and whether applicants are “well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.”

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has asked a federal appeals court to put on hold a judge’s ruling last week that could force the closure of a new immigration jail in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge had ordered the Trump administration to stop transferring immigrants to the jail. Meanwhile, weekly vigils are continuing to be held outside the immigration jail to protest what organizers have described as the inhumane treatment of people detained inside.

On Tuesday, during a three-hour Cabinet meeting, President Trump said that his administration will seek the death penalty in all murder cases in Washington, D.C. He failed to provide any details on the policy, considering the fact that the District of Columbia does not authorize capital punishment.

President Donald Trump: “Anybody murders something in the capital, capital punishment. Capital? Capital punishment. If somebody kills somebody in the capital, Washington, D.C., we’re going to be seeking the death penalty.”

During the Cabinet meeting, President Trump also said the U.S. would accept up to 600,000 Chinese students — an announcement that quickly drew backlash from his MAGA base, including from Steve Bannon and Laura Loomer. Trump said he liked having Chinese students in the U.S.

President Donald Trump: “But I like that their students come here. I like that other countries’ students come here. And you know what would happen if they didn’t? Our college system would go to hell very quickly. You’d have — and it wouldn’t be the top colleges. It would be colleges that struggle, on the bottom. And you take out 300,000 or 600,000 students out of the system.”

The president’s comments are a shift from his administration’s policy. Back in May, the State Department announced that it was vetting Chinese students for connections to the Chinese Communist Party.

Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook says she will file a lawsuit against President Trump’s attempts to remove her from her post. Cook is the first Black woman to sit on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. Trump is claiming, without evidence, that Cook committed mortgage fraud. Cook’s attorney says the president “lacks any factual or legal basis” to fire her. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been pressured by the president to lower interest rates. We’ll have more on this story after headlines.

Lebanese journalists are demanding an apology from Tom Barrack, the U.S. envoy to Syria, for demeaning comments he made at a press conference in Beirut.

Tom Barrack: “The moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we’re gone. So, you want — you want to know what’s happening? Act civilized, act kind, act tolerant, because this is the problem with what’s happening in the region.”

The Union of Journalists in Lebanon called for a boycott of all future events with Barrack unless he apologizes for his comments, saying, “the content of his remarks reflects ingrained colonial arrogance towards the peoples of the region and constitutes a blatant violation of basic diplomatic etiquette and the values that diplomacy should represent — chief among them respect for press freedom and the people’s right to knowledge.”

FEMA is suspending staff members who signed a letter criticizing the Trump administration for gutting the agency’s ability to handle natural disasters. The letter came just days before the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, one of the deadliest and costliest hurricanes in U.S. history. At least 36 employees have signed their full names to the letter, titled the “Katrina Declaration,” and about 150 others have signed the letter anonymously. On Tuesday, FEMA told the staffers that they were put on administrative leave in a “non-duty status while continuing to receive pay and benefits.”

The Social Security Administration’s chief data officer has said the personal information of hundreds of millions of Americans was uploaded onto a vulnerable cloud server by members of DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency. The claim appears in a whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday.

U.S. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer made the remarks during a televised cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump.

“Thank you for what you are doing with your agents on ICE, and thank you for the prosecution, and I hope you will come to Portland, Oregon and crack down,” Chavez-DeRemer said.

Seated nearby were Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who controls the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has touted the arrest of cartel members in Oregon.

“We are expecting a crackdown,” Chavez-DeRemer added, glancing at the two other officials.

So far, ICE activity has largely focused at the agency’s base in South Portland, where black-clad protesters have appeared on a nightly basis, leading to several clashes.

ICE agents detained four farmworkers during a traffic stop in Marion County earlier this month. Others have been detained immediately after their immigration hearings at the federal courthouse. ICE officials also arrested a 38-year-old chiropractor originally from Iran outside his child’s Montessori school last month.

Bondi memorably crossed swords with U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, in June when Merkley peppered Bondi with questions about Trump’s cryptocurrency and the risk of influence peddling.

The former mayor of Happy Valley, Chavez-DeRemer rose to prominence when she was elected to the U.S. House representing Oregon’s 5th District in 2022.

Janelle Bynum entered the race two years later and unseated Chavez-DeRemer by just over 10,000 votes. Chavez-DeRemer was then confirmed as head of the U.S. Labor Department in March.

Trump held court for over three hours Monday, exchanging effusive praise with many top officials. Chavez-DeRemer spent most of her five minute exchange discussing an ongoing 50-state tour of American industry and workplaces.

“There are still good people” in Oregon, she said. “I was able to visit Buckeye Pacific, really a trading floor for the timber industry.”

“You’re doing a fantastic job,” Trump replied.

In response, the Trump administration did what any responsible government would do.
Last month, about 140 employees at the EPA who signed an opposition letter were placed on administrative leave.
It remains to be seen what other actions could come as a result of the FEMA employees' letter.","Reports that the Trump administration placed some employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on leave after they signed an open letter of dissent earlier this week has sparked criticism on social media.

More than 180 current and former FEMA employees signed the letter sent to the FEMA Review Council and Congress on Monday, critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs and warning that FEMA's capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished. Only 36 signed their names, while others withheld their names for fear of retribution.

The Washington Post first reported that by Tuesday evening, some of those employees had received letters informing them that they were being placed on paid administrative leave, effective immediately. About 30 employees were told they were being placed on leave, according to The New York Times.

Stand Up for Science, the advocacy group that helped publicize the letter, told Newsweek that ""many"" of the FEMA employees who publicly signed the letter have been placed on administrative leave, including some who were responding to July's deadly floods in Texas.

Newsweek has contacted the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees FEMA, for comment via emails sent outside regular business hours.

Why It Matters

The letter raised concerns about FEMA's ability to respond to disasters, which can mean life or death during such emergencies.

While the administration has said its decision to place some FEMA employees on leave was not meant as a punishment, the action has raised concerns over whistleblower protections. When employees face consequences for speaking out, it may prevent others from doing so in the future and erode public trust in leadership.

What To Know

According to the Associated Press, it has confirmed that at least two of the signatories received notices on Tuesday evening informing them that they would be placed on indefinite leave. The notice said the decision was ""not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.""

In a statement to Newsweek, Stand Up for Science said the government was retaliating against the employees ""for whistleblowing—which is both illegal and a deep betrayal of the most dedicated among us.""

On social media, some also called it an act of retaliation.

Podcast host Brian Allen said, ""Whistleblowers are being purged for trying to protect disaster response.""

Ron Filipkowski, the editor-in-chief of MeidasTouch, commended those who ""had the courage to sign their names to it knowing the consequences of a highly vindictive Trump.""

In their letter, sent ahead of the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the current and former FEMA employees listed six ""statements of opposition"" to current policies at FEMA, including an expenditure approval policy by which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem must approve contracts exceeding $100,000. The signatories said the policy reduces FEMA's ability to perform its mission.

The letter also critiqued the DHS's decision to reassign some FEMA employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the failure to appoint a qualified FEMA administrator as required by law, and cuts to mitigation programs, preparedness training and FEMA's workforce.

The signatories wrote that they hoped their warnings would ""come in time to prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.""

What People Are Saying

Stand Up for Science said in a statement to Newsweek: ""This situation is developing, but this decision underscores the many issues these public servants described in their declaration and their bravery in standing up for Americans in need.

""Once again, we are seeing the federal government retaliate against our civil servants for whistleblowing—which is both illegal and a deep betrayal of the most dedicated among us. DHS said that these employees are simply 'afraid of change' which is an insult to anyone working at FEMA, the agency directly responsive to rapidly intensifying and changing circumstances. Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the FEMA 36.""

Podcast host Brian Allen wrote on X: ""This isn't governance. It's retaliation. Whistleblowers are being purged for trying to protect disaster response.""

Richard Hanania, the president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, wrote on X: ""36 FEMA employees put their names to a letter to Congress saying we were underprepared for future emergencies. In response, the Trump administration did what any responsible government would do. It put them on paid leave.""

FEMA spokesperson Daniel Llargues told the Associated Press on Monday that the Trump administration had ""made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help.""

He added: ""It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard.""

What Happens Next

Employees at other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency, have issued similar statements against the Trump administration's policies. Last month, about 140 employees at the EPA who signed an opposition letter were placed on administrative leave.

It remains to be seen what other actions could come as a result of the FEMA employees' letter.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.
It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It’s putting a spotlight on Trump’s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats Ramping Up Visits to Detention Centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It’s a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president’s deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump’s administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans Hold Firm Even as Public Opinion Shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump’s success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We’ve never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it’s one of the most secure southern borders we’ve had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they’re out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump’s approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There’s Still a Search for Consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America’s security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration’s handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we’ll see if now’s the time.”",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Trump_Congress_Deportations_25221593402141-1568x1048.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 17:56:32.757126

Reform have done none of this work and needless to say Labour voted against all our proposals.
Besides disapplying the Human Rights Act from immigration matters, Conservatives have already launched a full review of the ECHR and the associated treaties, led by Lord Wolfson KC.","Firstly, they have no idea what follows once the Human Rights Act and associated treaties are disapplied. It is easy to talk about leaving, but far harder to build the framework that comes after. Without this work being done, it risks the system being left even weaker than before.

And second, they run the risk of shattering public trust, when people vote for plans that don’t work in practice. If a plan collapses on contact with reality, it hands victory to those who say the crisis cannot be solved at all. Dangerous amateurism could discredit the entire cause of immigration control.

The contrast could not be sharper. Earlier this year, the Conservatives introduced the Deportation Bill – a detailed, workable plan to end this illegal immigration crisis. Our Deportation Bill will take back control of our country’s borders and, importantly, would ensure that every single illegal immigrant would be automatically deported. It would also disapply the Human Rights Act in immigration cases, double the residency requirement for Indefinite Leave to Remain and impose a binding annual cap on legal migration, set each year by Parliament at very low levels.

We laid amendments to legislation that would have raised salary thresholds, capped family visas, mandated age testing and removed foreign criminals as a matter of course. These were carefully worked provisions drafted as primary legislation. Reform have done none of this work and needless to say Labour voted against all our proposals.

We began a new approach in government with the Rwanda plan, backed by a permanent ban on re-entry for anyone entering illegally. But I will honestly say that the last government should have gone a lot further and a lot faster. Under new leadership, we now will. The Conservatives will restore deterrence. If an illegal arrival cannot be removed to their home country, they will be immediately removed to a safe third country. Without returns there is no deterrence, and without deterrence the boats will never stop.

And this is only the beginning. Besides disapplying the Human Rights Act from immigration matters, Conservatives have already launched a full review of the ECHR and the associated treaties, led by Lord Wolfson KC. That review is examining in precise detail how Britain can reassert sovereignty in ways that do not leave us trapped in endless legal quagmires or open to destabilisation. It is easy to talk about a “Bill of Rights”, but easy slogans can create new dangers, handing judges sweeping licence to reinterpret vague concepts of “liberty” and “freedom” against the will of Parliament. We will not risk compounding failure with shortcuts.

Real work means drafting clauses, forcing votes, designing enforcement, and standing ready to deliver on day one of government. It means commissioning an eminent KC to look at the legal challenges so that easy slogans and promises don’t fall apart on contact with reality.

That is what the Conservatives have done. We are not waiting for Nigel Farage to catch up with the detail, we are not waiting for Labour to discover courage, but we will keep pressing for the measures Britain desperately needs.

That is the choice that will be before Britain. A weak Labour Government that won’t do the tough things needed. A Reform party who talk tough but haven’t done the details. Or a changed Conservative Party that has both the willpower and the plan to fix this crisis.

As soon as they take off from the Panamanian coast, there is a sigh of relief. Surrounded by 30 other Venezuelan migrants, packed inside an overloaded midsize speedboat, Edinson holds on tightly to the edge. The 37-year-old is tall and slender and has a presence that stands out as he towers over everyone. Over the past couple of weeks, he’s become the de facto captain of a group of migrants making their way back to Venezuela.

At this point in their long journey, they sit in silence under blue skies and a blazing morning sun. The end is in sight. Sporting a black Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap and a blue T-shirt, Edinson stares out to the crystal clear Caribbean Sea. He knows these waters can be deadly. A couple of months ago, a boat carrying 19 migrants capsized not too far from here, but Edinson tells himself he has survived worse.

The boat is being piloted by two local operators, also known as lancheros, who constantly scoop water to avoid flooding. Dressed in black from head to toe, these lancheros now make a living transporting migrants from Panama’s Colón province in the central, northern part of the country to La Miel, a small town close to the Colombian border. This 12-hour sea route is the only way for migrants to bypass the dense, swampy, deadly Darién jungle that connects the two countries — the only spit of land linking North and South America via Central America. Each person making the voyage had risked their lives once to trek north through the jungle in their attempt to reach the United States. This time, on their way back to Venezuela, they want to avoid it at all costs, even if it means facing those rough Caribbean waters.

It’s 9:19 a.m. by now, the warm water splashing into the boat as it travels parallel to the shoreline, where you can still see lush tropical rainforests in the distance. While Edinson grabs onto the metal handles, one woman in a light-blue plastic poncho, hair flying with the wind, locks arms with her young daughter. In front of them, a young father holds his five-year-old son in his lap, squeezing him tightly as we slam through the big waves. Everyone on board manages to suppress their fear with the simple prospect of returning home. “Solo pienso en llegar, llegar, llegar (I’m just thinking of arriving, arriving, arriving),” Edinson says.

Unbeknownst to him, Edinson is part of a growing trend of “reverse migration” emerging throughout the American continent. A year ago, this movement would have been unimaginable. In 2024, during the Joe Biden administration, more than 300,000 north-bound migrants traversed the Darién Gap. After Donald Trump effectively dismantled the asylum-seeking process during his first administration, hundreds and thousands of migrants, precipitated by the pandemic and critical conditions in their homelands, headed toward the U.S. Those numbers plummeted once Trump took office again and began doubling down on his anti-immigrant agenda. According to the United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner, only 2,831 people crossed the Darién between January and March 2025, representing a 98 percent decrease compared with 2024. In March, Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino declared that the Darién Gap was effectively closed, proudly noting that his country’s migration crisis was over. Yet that statement overlooks a new, invisible crisis slowly forming in plain sight, miles away from the Darién. Migrants are still risking their lives; they are simply doing it on their way south, not north.

As Reuters first reported in March, more than 2,800 U.S.-bound migrants in Mexico requested assistance from the United Nations International Organization for Migration (IOM) to return to their homelands in January and February, just weeks after Trump stepped into the White House. Many of those migrants had been waiting in limbo to enter the United States. By June, the IOM estimated that approximately 7,696 southbound migrants had traveled from Panama to Colombia since February. While tracking this data is challenging, the movements on the ground point to a monumental new chapter in the history of migration: the disintegration of the American dream.

“By turning a refugee population into priorities for enforcement, it’s ending a chapter the United States aspired to. It aspired to be a place of refuge,” Andrea Flores, vice president of Immigration Policy and Campaigns at FWD.us, a bipartisan immigration-advocacy group, tells me. “The American dream meant that, regardless of background, our Constitution protected all of these identities and believed that, through our immigration system and the concept of naturalization, you could become an American. That idea of the American dream is ending.”

So, what happens when migrants stop looking north?

Starting Over in the U.S.

Seven months ago, Edinson never imagined he’d be returning to Venezuela.

Like millions living under President Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian regime, Edinson, who is the father of two young boys, struggled to provide for his family as a street-market seller of secondhand goods. For decades, Venezuela has undergone a sociopolitical crisis that has stripped citizens of basic civil rights and economic opportunities. Since 2014, close to 8 million Venezuelans have left the country, making it the largest recorded forced-displacement crisis in the Western Hemisphere, and one of the largest in the world.

Edinson watched neighbors pack their bags and flee to the United States, but the idea of leaving his children behind kept him anchored in his hometown of Caja Seca, a small, rural community. He was at peace with the idea of leading a simple life and found joy in the small things — playing basketball with his kids, taking his eldest to practice, and eating dinner with his mother every night. Miles away from Caracas, surrounded by forests, Edinson managed to stay away from the capital’s political turmoil, even as massive protests against Maduro’s crackdown erupted in that city.

But in the summer of 2024, Edinson’s three-year-old son got sick. To help pay for hospital visits and medicine, Edinson traveled to the capital, almost nine hours away, where he sold used clothes and sneakers for quick cash. A couple of weeks and many trips later, Edinson’s savings were gone and he could barely afford to buy groceries. Blaming Madu­ro’s regime, Edinson recognized that the only way for his family to survive was for him to leave Venezuela and go north.

Jorge, one of Edinson’s childhood best friends, had left Caja Seca a couple of years ago and, after receiving humanitarian parole under the Biden administration, ended up working at a tire shop in Indianapolis. Jorge told Edinson about what better opportunities looked like, what it could feel like for Edinson to have enough money in his pockets to help his son. Things weren’t perfect in Indiana, Jorge would tell Edinson, but that sense of suffocation and paranoia was gone, and that was enough to inspire Edinson to start planning. Suddenly, the motivation wasn’t just economic, but the realization that life could be different — free of misery and oppression. He would join Jorge, send cash to his family and, eventually, bring them to America. “That’s the only solution I could find,” Edinson says.

On Oct. 1, 2024, Edinson left Venezuela, beginning a trek north as the United States was in the midst of a heated presidential election with Vice President Kamala Harris’ lead over Trump slowly shrinking. The day Edinson left, Trump held a campaign rally in Milwaukee, warning the crowd about a “mass migrant invasion.” By that point, Trump calling Venezuelan migrants “criminals” and “gang members” had become a core part of his stump speech.

While Trump bet on his nativist, anti-immigrant rhetoric to mobilize voters, Edinson held onto the hope that Americans would be able to see past the fearmongering and baseless attacks. “A lot of people in Caja Seca told me not to go [to the U.S.], and to wait until the election results,” Edinson says. He was convinced that, like previous generations of Venezuelan migrants, he would eventually find a pathway to legalization. Regardless of the political outcome, Edinson trusted the American system.

During 2024, at the height of the migration wave toward the U.S., an average of 3,000 people trekked through the Darién Gap each day. Known as “the world’s most dangerous jungle,” millions of migrants and refugees risked their lives and attempted to cross it during the Biden years, despite the administration’s attempts to restrict asylum. Still, Edinson thought he would have the chance to start a new life in the U.S.

The American Dream

In October, it took Edinson almost four days to cross the Darién Gap by foot, passing four corpses during the last stretch of the jungle: the emaciated remains of a mother and daughter who died hugging; a woman who looked like she’d just been shot in the head; the decomposed body of what appeared to be an elderly man; and many, many human bones and skulls lined the edges of the swampy, overgrown paths.

As soon as Edinson emerged from the Darién Gap and reached the small Panamanian town of Bajo Chiquito, he called his mother back in Caja Seca. “Don’t ever do this,” he told her. He rested for a few days in the town’s makeshift migrant camp full of asylum seekers who had just braved the jungle and were in dire need of urgent care. From there, Edinson would take several buses through Central America to Mexico, where he would begin the process to request asylum in the United States.

Back in 2021, a couple of days after Biden’s inauguration, I spent a week reporting from the Darién Gap. What haunted me wasn’t what I could see and hear around me — the dangerous wildlife, the gasps of pain from Haitian mothers as they carried their weeping children through the hills on bloody, blistered feet, the trails of abandoned backpacks — rather, it was everything I couldn’t see. What haunted me the most was migrants’ blind loyalty to the ideals that pushed them toward the U.S. Their capacity to face any risk — even death — in the pursuit of freedom, justice, and liberty. Having lived through authoritarianism, gang violence, and/or poverty, they understood how sacred America’s rights were, how vital our Constitution was, and the privilege our democracy represented. “Is the American dream worth this?” I’d ask along the trek. The answer was always a resounding yes.

In 1931, author and historian James Truslow Adams was one of the first to introduce the concept of the American dream in his book The Epic of America. Adams, who was born into a wealthy Brooklyn family, originally explained it as a “dream of a better, richer, and happier life for all our citizens of every rank.” Many scholars took issue with this limited characterization, pointing to its materialistic and capitalistic nature. Since, generations of ordinary Americans, presidents, politicians, and historians have continued to redefine the term, using it as an anchor to unify our perpetually polarized nation. For decades, the American dream has been framed as an open-ended quest that had yet to be fully realized.

Historically, immigrants trekking to the U.S. each day have carried the aspiration of that dream. From the more than 30 million Europeans who arrived between 1815 and 1915 to the birth of the Chicano movement and the rise of Cesar Chavez’s farmworkers to the mass mobilization of Dreamers, generations of immigrants have shaped America’s own commitment to that vision. But as hundreds of migrants begin to self-deport and as thousands of asylum seekers turn away from the southern border, choosing new paths for themselves, it seems that Adams’ American dream was just that — simply a dream.

Edinson came to that conclusion shortly after he arrived in Mexico, now just miles away from the U.S. After surviving the Darién jungle and crisscrossing through Central America, Edinson arrived in the Mexican city of Tapachula on Oct. 14, 2024, less than three weeks before the U.S. presidential election. He applied for asylum through CBP One, a controversial mobile application allowing migrants at the southern border to schedule appointments at designated U.S. ports of entry. This process became one of the only ways to legally enter at the U.S.-Mexico border under Biden, as the administration attempted to handle a surge of new arrivals.

Based on a lottery system, migrants would sometimes wait months for their appointment in extremely dangerous conditions. The cartels often run these border towns and have historically subjected migrants to kidnappings, extortions, and sexual violence. Yet, once migrants were screened and vetted by immigration officers, many were eventually released on parole in the U.S.

“In Mexico, you live in fear every single day,” Edinson says. “There’s no peace of mind there. But the plan was always to wait and get to the U.S.” As Edinson waited in limbo, he got a job as a tire repairer. He shared a tiny two-bedroom apartment with 14 other Venezuelan migrants. Each night, he slept on a thin foam mattress on a floor, surrounded by strangers connected by the hope that America would reject Trump’s vision. Paralyzed by fear from Tapachula’s cartel violence, Edinson barely left that apartment.

By Nov. 5, Edinson understood that the land that lured him didn’t want him there. Like his roommates, Edinson found out about the election results through social media, as he anxiously scrolled Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. In the immediate aftermath of the election, Edinson received conflicting advice. His friend Jorge encouraged him to continue his journey, even if it meant paying coyotes to get smuggled through the southern border. Edinson’s mom urged him to go back home to Caja Seca. With Trump in power, she no longer saw a pathway for her son.

Edinson stayed the course. He wasn’t alone. As the Associated Press reported, more than 2,000 migrants in southern Mexico began walking toward the U.S. the morning Trump was sworn in. By the time the sun set, his administration had declared a national emergency at the border, shut down the CBP One application, revoked key humanitarian parole programs, attempted to repeal birthright citizenship, and laid the groundwork for its mass-deportation machine. A couple of days later, as millions of immigrants went back into the shadows, American military planes started deporting dozens of migrants to Guatemala. As FWD.us’ Flores says, “Trump’s unique targeting of Venezuelans during the 2024 campaign was the preview of everything you are seeing now.”

From Indianapolis, Jorge kept Edinson abreast of the news. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids were picking up, more deportation flights were taking off, and local police were starting to act like federal immigration agents. Even though Jorge had legal status, it felt like a matter of time until someone came knocking on his door. By mid-March, Jorge’s tone changed when the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act and deported 137 Venezuelan men to El Salvador without due process, accusing them of being gang members and national-security threats. Haunted by the demeaning photo ops of Venezuelan men paraded around El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s mega-prison, Jorge told Edinson he was scared to leave his house and end up behind bars in a foreign country.

Few things can quell an immigrant’s determination. Some will hide in corners, others will walk with more caution, many will perpetually wait in limbo until better opportunities arise. I’ve met Cuban migrants who have waited more than two years along the southern border for a chance to enter the U.S. Immigrants have historically held on to a form of unwavering hope that dissipates only when their luck runs out.

While Edinson watched the way Jorge’s life was at the mercy of immigration officials, however, he decided the chance for a new life in America wasn’t worth it. “When I saw that they [the U.S. government] were taking away my own people, the same anxiety I felt in Venezuela started to sink in,” Edinson says. “To leave a dictatorship only to walk into that? It’s preferable to leave that behind.” After waiting in Mexico for six months, Edinson decided to turn back.

As Edinson thought through the logistics of his return home, he had one condition: No matter what, he wouldn’t go through the Darién Gap again. Dead people. Hills. Wild animals. Criminals preying on migrants. As he planned another way back, he came across a small group of Venezuelans also plotting their return. They spent weeks hustling for money around Tapachula. During the days, some worked as street vendors, construction workers, or in factories, packing mangoes. In the evenings, they came together to talk about the different routes around the Darién Gap. Through word of mouth, they learned migrants were boarding small boats by Panama’s Caribbean coast and taking a long sea route to Colombia that allowed them to bypass the jungle. They also heard that back in February, an eight-year-old Venezuelan child died after one of those boats sank. But Edinson suddenly felt the same way he did as he migrated north: The risk was worth it.

Against the Tide

On April 19, 2025, at 9 p.m., Edinson boarded a bus in Tapachula and began the first stretch of his trip, a three-day journey that would take him all the way to Costa Rica.

In Spanish, contracorriente means to go against the tide. The word perfectly captures Edinson’s journey through Central America on roads paved for migrants who fled in the other direction. From Mexico, there were those who rushed to California for gold or to the Texas farmlands for work throughout the 19th century; from Guatemala and Honduras, countless asylum seekers searched for new beginnings in Florida after escaping the maras and dangerous mudslides; from Nicaragua, its war-torn populous sought American democracy during the Cold War.

By April 22, after days on the road, Edinson made it to Costa Rica. That night, I met him for the first time, by a bus stop in Paso Canoas, a small town on the border between Costa Rica and Panama. Smoking a cigarette as he paced back and forth, he was surrounded by a group of Venezuelan men he had met on the bus ride to Paso Canoas. They were all young dads in their twenties and thirties who traveled solo to the U.S., now on their way back home to their kids.

“When the border with the U.S. closed, everyone’s dreams stopped existing,” says Edinson, whose tall silhouette covers the street lights shining over us. “One tries to forget about that, but the feeling remains.”

Luis, a 30-year-old father of three young kids, chimes in: “We’ve been talking about this the whole way here.… I think we are the beginning of a new wave. If they closed the door on us, we have to find a new horizon.”

That night, Edinson and his friends will rest in a nearby hostel mostly occupied by migrants and pay smugglers $40 each to be transported by charter bus from Paso Canoas into Panama in the late hours of the night, when Panamanian immigration authorities are more likely to turn a blind eye.

Paso Canoas has always been an important transit town for northbound migrants. During peak migration periods in 2023, the Costa Rican government, along with aid groups on the ground, implemented a relatively sound protection system that allowed for safe passage, opening a temporary migrant care center, adopting busing programs to transport migrants from its southern border to its northern one, and working closely with the United Nations to coordinate humanitarian assistance. During those years, the streets were bustling, there was a robust presence of aid workers, and local business owners kept their fresh-fruit stands open all day. Then, shortly after Trump took office, an eerie quiet took over the town. By the second week of February, aid workers noticed asylum seekers were coming through from America, instead of the south.

Today, locals estimate that more than 100 southbound migrants pass through Paso Canoas each day. The majority are Venezuelans who left Mexico after waiting in limbo following the 2024 election. There are also a significant number of migrants who either self-deported or were turned away by immigration authorities at U.S. ports of entry.

Every afternoon, Sister Claudia Cuadra, a nun from Chile, posts up by the bus station and waits for migrant buses to arrive. She escorts as many people as she can back to a small church turned dining hall offering free meals and basic services. Paso Canoas is now mostly run by nuns. The Trump administration’s foreign-aid freeze suspended crucial regional programs that offered shelter, food, hydration, hygiene, and legal aid to migrants, forcing some aid groups to exit the region altogether. As Refugees International recently reported, in just four months, the Trump administration dismantled Costa Rica’s protection infrastructure. This spurred a number of faith-based organizations to fill the void.

One rainy afternoon, I see the nuns in action, opening their doors to a group of about 20 migrants lined up outside the church. Some nuns pass out lunch boxes, while others play with the fidgety children and offer single mothers an extra hand. While Sister Adriana Calzada Vazquez Vela hands out food, she tells me migrants arriving here from the north are often hungry, exhausted, and resigned. “There’s a sadness,” she says. “There’s disappointment because there was a dream that became lost or broken.”

Humanitarian experts say reverse migrating is a traumatic experience, perhaps even more so than going north. Caitlyn Yates, an anthropologist at the University of British Columbia and a volunteer with Refugees International, explains that grappling with the end of hope is the most difficult part. At this point in their journey, still operating on adrenaline and survival instinct, they’ve barely processed what they’ve seen along the way. “They carry the grief and trauma of having crossed through the Darién,” says Ivan Aguilar, a humanitarian coordinator for Oxfam. “Almost all of them have seen someone die or disappear … and now they have to return.”

When I ask these experts if there is anything comparable, a similar pattern of reverse migration that has taken place in another part of the globe, they struggle to come up with an answer. Aguilar points out that after living in the U.S. for 30 or 40 years, some migrants choose to retire in their home countries. But this is different, he stresses: “The reverse migration we are seeing is due to the impossibility of reaching a final destination.”

A New Beginning

Sitting in the church’s dining hall, just miles away from the foot of the jungle, migrants weigh the same question Edinson had been pondering: how to avoid the Darién Gap.

Barajas Marquez, a 39-year-old Venezuelan playing with his son inside the church, doesn’t have the cash to pay for the boat. He’s trying to save enough money to give his family options. He says he knows of those desperate enough to consider going back through the jungle by foot. Edinson spent weeks working at the tire shop in Tapachula so he could afford the sea route, which is a little less than the $330 Edinson paid back in October 2024 to be smuggled by foot through the Darién jungle by the Gulf Clan, a Colombian paramilitary group. “It’s dangerous,” Edinson admits. “It’s unclear what can happen to us during so many hours.… What if the sea is choppy?” Luckily, he knows how to swim.

I meet Edinson at 2 a.m. by the same bus stop he had arrived at earlier that day. I knew this was the time that his group planned to make moves, when the town was asleep. Edinson and three other men walk briskly toward the border crossing with Panama, just a couple of feet away. A larger group of about 25 migrants quietly emerges from the surrounding streets and joins Edinson’s pack. They all move silently through a back alley that allows them to circumvent the Panamanian immigration authorities.

In the daytime, this intersection, which sits on the Pan-American Highway, is one of the busiest land crossings in Central America, as it’s a major hub for commercial traffic. Truck drivers sometimes wait in line for more than five hours just to get processed by immigration authorities. But at night, Panamanian immigration officials have mostly grown accustomed to looking the other way as migrants quietly tiptoe around the system.

A couple of minutes later, already on the Panamanian side, the group congregates by a charter bus stationed by the sidewalk, engine turned on, luggage-compartment hood wide open, ready to go. The silence turns into chaos as migrants frantically put their bags inside the bus and reach out with their cash — $25, the cost of being smuggled across Panama. I ask Edinson if he knows anything about the bus driver — who he is, who he works for, why he’s there. He doesn’t. The bus pulls away, taking the migrants to David, a city in western Panama. From there, Edinson will take several buses until he reaches the country’s eastern coast. That’s where the boats await.

Every day, hundreds of migrants like Edinson take off from the Panamanian province of Colón as they embark on their final stretch home. This may feel like a win for a Trump administration that prides itself on pressuring people into self-deporting and turning around. From up close, though, the act of leaving looks, for many, more like an act of freedom. That’s particularly evident in Colón, where there’s an emotional shift, when even those who feel defeated and terrified to return to the homelands from which they fled, begin to see more opportunities back in the south than up north. Perhaps it’s that their journey is almost over, that they are hours away from hugging their loved ones, or that they’ve had enough time to self-reflect. The region of Colón has a deep history of liberation.

This port played an important role during the transatlantic slave trade, when European colonizers forcefully brought millions of enslaved Africans to Panama. The enslaved people later revolted and eventually established settlements along the coast. Centuries later, the province of Colón is now inhabited by a majority Afro-Panamanian population.

Surrounded by rainforests, old colonial towns are filled with churches, squares, and ancient structures covered in a chipped, colorful, bright paint. Here, time moves slowly. After 24 hours on the road, cruising full speed toward the east coast, Edinson finally makes it to Palenque, a tiny beach town in Colón.

The morning of April 24, I meet Edinson by Palenque’s wooden dock. He’s still with the other young Venezuelan dads he’d met up with in Tapachula, but he’s now part of another, newly formed group of migrants waiting to board the two-engine boat. There’s Genesis, a 31-year-old woman who’d spent months in the Mexican border town of Matamoros, right by McAllen, Texas. She doesn’t know how to swim and is petrified to get on the boat, especially after hearing that one of them capsized in February. There’s Alessandro, also in his early thirties who, 10 days prior, self-deported from Ohio. His arms covered in tattoos, Alessandro is scared DHS would label him as a gang member and send him to El Salvador.

As we talk near the dock, I ask Edinson the same question I asked migrants in 2021 when we trekked north through the Darién jungle — was the American dream worth it? “I wouldn’t go back to the United States,” he says with certainty.

Edinson stuffs his backpack into a plastic bag. He puts on a life vest handed to him by one of the local Afro-Panamanian men organizing the boat rides. These men — coyotes of some sort, part of a well-oiled informal migrant-transportation machine — are collecting $280 per person. It will take about 12 hours to reach La Miel, Panama. From there, Edinson will get onto another boat to Colombia and continue his journey to Venezuela by bus. He hopes to be in Caja Seca in less than 48 hours. “Are you nervous? Anxious?” I ask him. “No, just anxious to get home,” he says.

Edinson knows Venezuela’s conditions haven’t gotten any better with Maduro still in power. He cannot wait to hug his boys, but what worries him most is not being able to buy his 12-year-old everything he needs for his basketball games. He’s not sure how long he’ll last in Venezuela. As soon as he gets home, Edinson will plot his next journey.

The migrants form two lines along the dock. Men on the right, women and their children on the left. The women enter the boat one by one and sit in the back, followed by the men, a couple of whom move closer to the engines to join their wives and squeeze their kids. Edinson and his friends sit by the tip of the boat, packed in with 30 people who are all part of a new chapter of history, the beginning of a new “Great Reverse Migration.” When they get home, they will tell their children, their grandchildren, and generations to come that America didn’t live up to its ideals, that the dream could be chased elsewhere. They will get out a map and look for new horizons. In turn, James Truslow Adams’ Epic of America could come to an end.

Right before the lancheros take off from the dock, a local Afro-Panamanian woman approaches the boat. She kneels down and prays out loud for them. The migrants begin cheering from the boat. The woman gets on her feet and yells “Hoy es un dia que se va a desatar algo” — “Today is a day when something will unleash.”

As the boat takes off, going against the tide, Edinson sighs as if a weight has been lifted.

A few weeks later, he’s back in Caja Seca with his family, making $50 a week as a delivery person, trying to save enough money to move to Chile. “I have life, health, and, more than anything, peace of mind,” Edinson says. “No one can take that away from me.”

Krome Processing Center’s average daily population has climbed from less than 600 at the start of the Trump administration to 900 in July according to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement – and that’s likely a significant undercount. In April, Krome’s population reached three times its capacity with more 1,800 detainees, according to data gathering organization Transitional Records Action Clearinghouse, which obtained additional public records from ICE to provide a fuller picture beyond the average population data ICE regularly publishes.

As Krome burst at the seams with new detainees, emergency calls have risen faster than the detainee population.

From January to July, 911 calls made from the detention center doubled compared to the same time period the year before, according to records released from the Miami-Dade Sheriff’s Office. More than 170 calls were made this year until July 15, compared to 86 in the same time period the year before. This year, about half of the calls have been related to a sick or injured person, compared to just 25% of the calls last year. Other common reasons for the calls were an arrest or investigation.

That tracks with a similar trend at ICE’s Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, where 911 calls are also on track to double from last year, according to data obtained and analyzed by The Tributary last month.

But at Krome, Florida’s largest detention center, the problems are particularly acute: Interviews with lawyers and detainees’ relatives, 911 call logs and recordings, and ICE’s own records show that overcrowding and medical neglect have run rampant at Krome since Trump took office. The detention center has also been the deadliest this year, with at least three deaths.

As the Trump administration has ramped up its deportation machine and Gov. Ron DeSantis has wielded the full force of the state’s law enforcement to help, no ICE detention center has exceeded its capacity more than Miami’s Krome, according to a report by TRAC.

“It is absolutely horrendous,” said Chelsea Nowel, a Tampa-based immigration lawyer with multiple clients who have been detained at Krome. “It’s not something that I’ve ever experienced before in practicing detained immigration for almost 10 years.”

Ramped up enforcement

Since President Donald Trump took office, immigration enforcement has intensified, targeting immigrants at their workplace, courthouses, and immigration check-ins. With Gov. Ron DeSantis as an eager partner, Florida’s immigrant communities have borne the brunt of ramped up ICE activity.

With most Florida law enforcement agencies required to collaborate with ICE, a routine traffic stop now can lead to detention without so much as a citation — let alone a criminal arrest. Changes to mandatory detention have also meant that immigrants without a criminal record and with ties to their community who may have been released on bond under past administrations are now spending months in ICE detention. More than half of the people detained at Krome have no criminal record, according to the latest ICE statistics on the detained population.

“What we’re seeing is how politicians across the political spectrum have sold us that immigration is a public safety issue, but it’s not,” said Florida-based senior organizer for the Detention Watch Network Nery Lopez. “In reality, we’re seeing that people are being incarcerated, being detained and deported and having no due process.”

As the largest detention center in the state, Krome has been the site of many of these detentions and the population quickly surged.

Within a month of Trump’s inauguration, 44-year-old Ukrainian immigrant Maksym Chernyak died in custody after being transferred to the hospital after having a seizure. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner determined the cause of death as a stroke. In August, his family filed a wrongful death complaint under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Overcrowding only increased at Krome in the following months. In April, Democratic lawmakers in Florida called the conditions at Krome “alarming” and demanded more oversight. In June, detainees used their bodies to spell out SOS to protest the conditions and prolonged detention.

Even ICE has noted overcrowding at Krome. In the latest ICE inspection conducted from April 29 to May 1, the agency documented 14 instances when the facility failed to comply with national detention standards, compared to 6 during the last inspection in September 2024. Most of the issues were related to the holding rooms or medical care.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment.

Ron Smock, who often visited his friend Vangelis Ricardo Dos Anjos Gomes, a Brazilian immigrant who was detained at Krome from October 2024 to April 2025, watched as more and more people crowded the facilities during his visits. In the spring, he saw detainees eating and sleeping in a room meant for lawyer visits.

The overcrowding climbed steadily until June, which saw the largest 911 call volume since January 2024 with 53 calls. That same month, 75-year-old Isidro Perez died in ICE custody after reporting chest pains and being transferred to the hospital, according to ICE. The medical examiner has not yet released an autopsy or report on his death.

A 36-year-old Cuban immigrant, whose wife spoke to The Tributary on condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation, got to Krome in June after being detained at an ICE check-in in Tampa. By then, according to the immigrant’s wife, the intake process was so overwhelmed that detainees were forced to sleep on the floor for days and weeks at a time.

“He was there for a whole week in horrible conditions, where you couldn’t shower and had the same clothes on all week, with a toilet in the same room where you were,” the immigrant’s wife said in an interview. “The capacity was supposedly for 25 people, but there were up to 60 people there.”

Mich González, a lawyer for Sanctuary of the South who represents clients in Krome, said the overcrowding has created inhumane conditions.

“People were held in processing for over a week and in processing, you don’t get regular access to meals, bathroom, potable water. You have to ask to go to the bathroom,” González said.

“There’s no beds. You have to sleep on the floor. People were so cold, they were sticking cardboard in the vents and trying to hold them in place with plastic forks.”

At least four 911 calls regarding medical emergencies mentioned that the person was a new arrival who had not yet been booked into Krome, stuck instead in a limbo in which the facility’s medical staff were not yet authorized to attend to them.

“I have a detainee over here that’s complaining of chest pains,” one caller said on May 24. “Nurse staff told me to call 911 because they can’t see him because he’s not all the way booked in yet.”

In its latest inspection report, ICE documented that at least two out of six holding rooms at Krome exceeded the 25-person capacity and three exceeded the 12-hour wait time in the holding room. It also documented a failure of all the holding rooms to document detainees held there, meal times, and security concerns. Krome staff also failed to provide proper mental and medical health screenings upon arrival, the report found.

When Rep. Carlos Gimenez visited, the 36-year-old Cuban immigrant said ICE staffers took steps to get the facility more in regular order: All the men were moved out of the intake center, he later told his wife.

Gimenez told media after his visit that he did not witness any overcrowding or detainees sleeping on the floor and that the medical care was adequate.

“It’s not the Ritz, but I can tell you that there’s nothing going on in there that would be cause for alarm,” Gimenez told the media after his visit.

The office of Rep. Gimenez did not respond to a request for further comment.

Issues with medical care

Once inside Krome, overcrowding persisted and detainees reported having to request a medical appointment but waiting days to receive care, according to lawyers, relatives, a wrongful death complaint and a report by Human Rights Watch.

Smock said that Gomes, the Brazilian friend he’d regularly visited at Krome, relayed that there were 120 people in his pod, which was only supposed to hold 60 people. He spent two months in solitary confinement, which he preferred to the overcrowding and abuse he endured with the general population.

“When solitary is a better option, that shows how horrible things are,” Smock said.

The 911 calls reflect a general deterioration of the conditions at Krome and the issues with medical care, which is provided by ICE Health Service Corps. They document head injuries, chest pains, stroke symptoms, and multiple seizures.

The wife of Maksym Chernyak, the Ukrainian man who died in February, alleges that he sought medical treatment multiple times but was denied care, according to a wrongful death complaint shared with the Tributary.

Chernyak reported feeling sick and was seen by doctors on Feb. 9. Despite complaining of the same symptoms, he waited 6 days for another medical visit. His blood pressure rose by this second visit, but nothing was done, the complaint alleges. When he began vomiting and having seizures in the early hours of Feb. 18, Krome staff waited nearly four hours before calling for emergency medical care.

Smock also reported that Gomes experienced long wait times for critical medical care. It took a week to see a doctor after he fell in the courtyard and scraped his leg, which became infected with flesh-eating bacteria, Smock said.

“They kept refusing him to get treated. They finally sent him to the hospital and the hospital filed notice about how bad his condition was. He was only hours away from having his legs amputated,” Smock said.

Injuries inside Krome were common for Gomes because he was repeatedly targeted and attacked by other detainees and guards for being gay, according to Smock.

Gomes was indicted in March on two charges of forcibly assaulting a federal officer, a case that Smock believes is retaliation for filing a complaint with DHS after guards forcibly restrained and beat Gomes.

Delays in receiving medical care at Krome were common, according to interviews and a Human Rights Watch report.

One man spent a week asking for medical care for a cough, the HRW report said. He only received treatment when he showed his bloody tissue. Another waited three weeks for treatment for flu-like symptoms. A nurse wrote off his issues as marijuana withdrawal symptoms.

Another complained of abdominal pain, according to the report. An officer said that did not warrant a medical emergency. The in-house doctor said it was probably just gas. When he was finally taken to the hospital, the doctor said he had arrived just in time before his intestines ruptured from a strangulated abdominal wall hernia.

A transgender detainee who became friends with Gomes fell and lost her teeth without receiving care, Smock said. A Guatemalan woman told Smock that her husband had been attacked and fell and started having seizures, even though he was only in his 30s. The 911 calls report multiple seizures of inmates in their 30s.

All these issues could be avoided, or at least mitigated, if the government used its discretion to release people with serious health issues, family responsibilities and no criminal record as was customary in the past, according to Nowel, the Tampa immigration attorney. But instead detention only seems to be increasing.

“It’s so much worse than we’ve ever seen before and all for nothing,” Nowel said. “There is no reason for any of this to be happening.”

PHILIPSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA – Early on Sunday morning, members of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL) gathered in the parking lot in East Liberty to go to Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, an old coal mining town in Central Pennsylvania. The coal mines have closed, and the town’s largest employer is ICE’s Moshannon Valley Processing Center, operated by the private prison contractor GEO Group.

The Moshannon Valley Processing Center is the largest ICE facility in the Northeastern United States and is considered one of the most inhumane.

On average, 147 immigrants per month have been locked in solitary confinement, nearly twice the national average for an ICE facility. The conditions are so brutal inside the prison that one detainee, Chaofeng Ge, killed himself in 2025. The suicide has helped bring attention to the facility’s problems.

Members of the group are excited, but some are nervous to protest in a small town like Philipsburg, deep in Trump country.

“A lot of people are scared and don’t know what to do, but we can point them in the right direction,” says June Wearden as the bus attempts to leave the parking lot in Pittsburgh. But then the bus gets stuck, and the driver is unable to navigate the turns to leave the parking lot.

Members of the PSL hop out of the bus to help it navigate around. At one point, the bus driver exclaims, “I don’t think I can get it out of this parking lot.”

Eventually, the PSL members help the bus driver to navigate, driving the charter bus over a median and, after 20 minutes of trying, escaping the parking lot to get on the road to the Moshannon Valley.

“I was nervous that we wouldn’t even get out of the parking lot,” says Wearden.

After a three-hour drive through the Appalachian mountains, the bus arrives at a lakeside park in Moshannon Valley. There are hundreds of protestors, who traveled from all over the state, some even waving Mexican flags as some truckers drive by honking their horns in solidarity. In contrast, Trump supporters drive by yelling at the protestors.

“I wanted to show that I was proud to be Mexican,” says Angelica Medina, carrying a Mexican flag and dressed in a large traditional Chiapaneco dress. “I wanted to show that I’m not afraid to be Mexican in a place like this.”

The rally is held at the Cold Stream Dam and Memorial Park, a picturesque lakeside setting in the mountains. Local residents fish from the lakeshore, looking on with amusement at the rally.

Philipsburg’s Republican mayor, John Streno, even showed up with a cigar in hand to take in the spectacle.

“I don’t agree with the protestors,” says Streno between puffs on his cigar. “But I support their right to protest.”

Not everyone is as nice or friendly as Streno.

“Fuck you, fuck you,” yells one person as they drive by. As protestors attempt to cross the highway into the park, one driver attempts to barrel through the crowd, but is stopped as protestors fail to yield.

“This is a Trump town though and I’m putting my neck out to say it, because I could be firebombed tonight,” says Philipsburg town councilman Luther Gette, who helped to organize the protest. “I already had a rock thrown through my window, but I’m taking that risk because I think it is definitely time for people to speak up.”

Luther Gette is 87 years old and the only Democrat of the seven members of the town council. He says that he’s never seen a protest this big before in Philipsburg.

“I never imagined that I would see a protest this big in Philipsburg,” says Gette.

Before the protest, there had been little discussion of the ICE facility located in their community. But now with activists from all over the state descending on Philipsburg, there has been much debate over the facility, with the local newspaper doing stories on allegations of abuse at the prison. Clearfield County Commissioner John Sobel has even had to take to the press to defend his decision to keep the facility open.

“Opinions are divided, and the main sticking point is the fact that there are jobs,” says Gette. “Old coal mining towns basically have no income,” says Gette. “A prison is a good source of jobs at any point. And I wouldn’t want to say that the people who work in these prisons are necessarily criminals, but there are better ways to make a living.”

But with debate raging over the ICE facility in Philipsburg, Gette says that some former guards have come forward to denounce conditions in the facility.

“We’ve had a quick education on this in the last couple of weeks. I knew for a long time that that prison was out there, that detention facility, but I wasn’t aware of the alleged abuses,” says Gette.

Many townspeople object to out-of-town people coming to Philipsburg to protest the facility. However, activists say that their communities are intricately linked to Philipsburg, as immigrants from their communities are being sent there.

Jamie Martinez is a community defense organizer with the Pittsburgh-based immigrants’ rights group Casa San Jose. He says that many immigrants detained in Pittsburgh, over three hours away, get sent to Moshannon Valley. A few weeks ago, Martinez visited a detainee in the facility and, even as an experienced immigrant rights organizer, found himself horrified. He says that he visited a friend who was detained for nine days without any prison official speaking to him.

“He would bang on the door for hours to be able to speak on the phone for somebody,” says Martinez. “And time and time again, like nobody explained anything in a language he could understand. And there was no clear process where he would be met without answers. He spent weeks like that.”

Equally troubling, the man was only given one change of underwear.

“When I arrive at this visitation area and see him come out, he’s wearing a red jumpsuit,” says Martinez. “And he begins to tell me that that’s the only jumpsuit that he had, that he couldn’t wash his clothes, wash his underwear, in his cell in solitary confinement, where he had been for nine days, and he pulled his collar forward like this, and he showed me the yellow sweat stains.”

ICE often pressures people to sign self-deportation papers by treating them poorly while in detention. Martinez says that immigrants in detention are aware of the protests that give them hope. Each night, the immigrants not in solitary confinement gather in their pods to praise and try to encourage one another to keep their spirits up.

“The inmates in there, they give me hope,” says Martinez. “They tell me that every night, they gather their chairs in a large circle in one of the pods, and they pray together for hours, and they build community among each other. And that’s the way in which we’re able to realize, even through the darkest of times, we can do something good. We can find that hope, that light.”

Chris Rabb, a Black state representative in Philadelphia, who is running for US Congress, says the movement against the Moshannon Valley ICE detention center inspired him to travel nearly four hours to speak at the protest. He says that it’s crucial to bridge the urban-rural divide in connecting movements in Pennsylvania.

“If you’re so arrogant to think that all the best ideas and all the best people come from places that you live in and look like, you’ve already lost,” says Rabb. “It takes us out of our physical comfort zone, also our cultural comfort zones. I don’t feel comfortable coming to these parts of Pennsylvania as a Black man alone, but this is what we need to do to build the movement.”

Interestingly, Rabb tells the crowd that some Democrats in his own party don’t feel comfortable with backing protests like these.

“There’s a lot of Democrats who wish I wasn’t here. I make it difficult for them to remain silent,” Rabb tells the crowd. “But I’m not going to be silent, particularly when I look across this amazing group of humanity and you inspire me, I know that as a public servant, there’s a responsibility for me to inspire you, but in this moment, you inspire me to do the work that all elected officials should do.”

The energy of the protests is helping mobilize some Democrats to speak out. When she found out about the rally in Philipsburg, US Congresswoman Summer Lee of Pittsburgh decided to coordinate a surprise visit to the facility on Monday to keep attention focused on the facility.

However, Lee was denied the right to enter the facility despite being the ranking Democrat on the US House Oversight subcommittee on federal law enforcement, including ICE. Lee says that not allowing her to enter the facility is a violation of the Constitution since she has direct oversight over it.

“Last year, Congress passed a law that explicitly prohibits DHS from preventing members of Congress from entering any facilities operated by them. The law also clarifies that members of Congress are not required to provide prior notice before entering any such facilities for oversight purposes,” said Lee in an interview with Payday Report. “Denying us entry is another example of [the] Trump administration’s executive overreach.”

Congresswoman Lee says that the protest movement against Moshannon is helping to put pressure on ICE.

“Of course, [these protests] have an effect, because they’ve reached the attention of members of Congress, they’ve garnered the attention of the press who are now shining a light on this facility and others like it,” said Lee.

As abuses of immigrants get more attention, polling shows that Americans have solidly turned against Trump’s immigration policies. According to a Gallup poll, disapproval of Trump’s immigration approach outweighs approval by a record 27 points.

Lee says that her Congressional office has been contacted by local townspeople who worked in the ICE detention facility, who are upset about conditions.

“We have also heard reports of a number of people leaving that facility, of quitting. There is information that trickles out from the facility itself,” says Lee. She says that right now, the key is to keep attention focused on the Moshannon Valley ICE detention center.

Activists plan to continue protesting the facility and have erected billboards around Philipsburg to draw attention to the abuses within the facility. These billboards also provide information on ways local people can get involved in organizing efforts against the facility.

“So I hope, and especially in light of our inability to get in, that there is still pressure that’s coming in from the press,” says Lee. “We expect that pressure to come from folks in the town, from folks who are impacted or who are doing advocacy.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/23430/download/Payday%20Report%20082725%20teaser.jpg?cb=566b4c3f32c365c68b7ff306dc26bbe2&w=1024,N,,2025-08-27 16:56:49.605212

She also reportedly said she would not order Ábrego released from immigration custody, leaving that decision for an immigration judge.
In court documents in April, the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation had been due to an “administrative error”.","A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Kilmar Ábrego García, who was already wrongfully deported once, cannot be deported again until at least early October, according to multiple reports.

CNN reported that the US district judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over the case, scheduled an evidentiary hearing for 6 October, and said that she intends to have Trump administration officials testify about the government’s efforts to re-deport Ábrego.

At the same hearing, Ábrego’s lawyers informed the court that he plans to seek asylum in the United States, according to the Associated Press.

Ábrego’s case has drawn national attention since he was wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador in March.

Following widespread pressure, including from the supreme court, the Trump administration returned him to the US in June. Upon his return, however, he immediately faced criminal charges related to human smuggling, allegations that his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”.

Ábrego, who is 30 years old and a Salvadorian native, was released from criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday while awaiting trial.

But over the weekend, the Trump administration announced new plans to deport him to Uganda.

Then on Monday, Ábrego was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) during a scheduled immigration check-in in Baltimore, which was one of the conditions of his release.

He is currently being held in a detention center in Virginia.

Ábrego’s legal team swiftly filed a lawsuit on Monday, challenging both his current detention and his potential deportation to Uganda. In court filings, they argued that the government is retaliating against Ábrego for challenging his deportation to El Salvador.

“The only reason he was taken into detention was to punish him,” said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney representing Ábrego, on Monday. “To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.”

Later on Monday, Xinis issued a ruling temporarily barring the government from deporting Ábrego until at least Friday. On Wednesday, she extended her order until Ábrego’s current deportation challenge in court is resolved, according to ABC News.

It added that Xinis said she would issue a ruling within 30 days of the 6 October hearing, and also ordered that Ábrego must remain in custody within a 200-mile (320km) radius of the court in Maryland.

She also reportedly said she would not order Ábrego released from immigration custody, leaving that decision for an immigration judge.

Ábrego entered the US without authorization around 2011 as a teenager. According to court documents, he was fleeing gang violence.

In 2019, a federal court granted him protection from deportation to El Salvador. Despite that ruling, in March, he was mistakenly deported there by the Trump administration.

In court documents in April, the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s deportation had been due to an “administrative error”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac5761cc070ae1b4e708933e5619c1c70cc4d082/14_0_2915_2333/master/2915.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe59649ccdd2d5cf86c88e317d0d454f",N,,2025-08-27 15:56:46.369917

Hot Topics: DEI, Higher Education, Online Censorship, and China

Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Since day one, the Trump administration has prioritized investigating DEI programs in both the public and private sectors, and congressional oversight has followed suit. Shortly after President Trump took office, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), Chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, initiated an investigation into federal funding awarded by the National Science Foundation for DEI-related initiatives. More recently, on June 25, 2025, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing entitled “Sacrificing Excellence for Ideology: The Real Cost of DEI.” Members have further mirrored this policy agenda in their legislative efforts, introducing bills to eliminate DEI practices in the federal government and other entities, such as institutions of higher education.

Higher education. Congress and the Trump administration remain focused on colleges and universities, particularly with regard to DEI initiatives, tuition pricing, hiring practices, and antisemitism on campus. On April 8, 2025, the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to various universities requesting information on alleged collusion on tuition pricing. The Committee has since followed up with multiple institutions by issuing subpoenas for related documents and communications. Leadership of the House Committee on Education and Workforce also sent letters on March 27, 2025, to five universities demanding answers regarding their efforts to address antisemitism. As students return to campus this fall, this oversight activity may intensify.

Online censorship. The House Judiciary Committee is continuing its years-long investigation regarding censorship of conservative voices online. As part of the Committee’s investigation into the impact of foreign laws on free speech in the United States, on February 26, 2025, the Committee sent subpoenas to eight tech companies seeking communications with foreign governments regarding compliance with foreign censorship laws, regulations, and judicial orders. On July 25, 2025, the Committee issued its latest censorship report, titled “The Foreign Censorship Threat: How the European Union’s Digital Services Act Compels Global Censorship and Infringes on American Free Speech.”

China. China remains an area of bipartisan interest with members on both sides of the aisle focused on issues such as export controls, tariffs, bulk data transfers, and semiconductor and chip manufacturing. For example, on July 25, 2025, Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI), House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security Chairman Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), and Rep. Keith Self (R-TX) sent a letter to several major U.S. technology companies probing whether the subsea cable systems that each company maintains contain components produced, maintained, or repaired by entities affiliated with China. Earlier this month, senators on both sides of the aisle sent letters raising concerns about U.S. chip manufacturers selling chips in China and links to the Chinese government.

On the Rise: Parallel Executive Branch and State Attorneys General Investigations

Fundraising platforms. On April 24, 2025, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum “to crack down on illegal ‘straw donor’ and foreign contributions in American elections, following reports and congressional investigations regarding potentially unlawful activities through ActBlue and other online fundraising platforms” and directing the Attorney General to investigate and take action as appropriate. On June 22, 2025, multiple House committees—including the Judiciary Committee, Oversight Committee, and Committee on House Administration—sent a series of letters and subpoenas that also target ActBlue for its fundraising activities.

President Biden’s cognitive capabilities. On June 4, 2025, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum “directing an investigation into who ran the United States while President Biden was in office.” The memorandum asserts that President Biden’s “repeated use of an autopen raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of his actions” and seeks to determine who, in fact, signed presidential documents during Biden’s tenure. That same day, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) issued letters to former Biden administration officials seeking to compel their testimony regarding “President Biden’s cognitive state and who was calling the shots.” Both actions followed a May 22, 2025, announcement by Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Chair Ron Johnson (R-WI) stating that he sent letters to 28 former Biden cabinet members on the same topic.

Climate action. On August 1, 2025, a federal court in the Eastern District of Texas ruled that a group of Republican state attorneys general may proceed with a lawsuit that accuses three of the world’s largest investment companies of violating both state and federal antitrust laws based in part on their participation in climate initiatives. This lawsuit builds on inquiries initiated in 2022 by Republican state attorneys general, as well as a 2023-2024 House Judiciary investigation into the same three investment companies (as well as several other investment industry actors) regarding “the sufficiency of existing antitrust laws to address collusive agreements to promote and adopt progressive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals.” The Committee released its report on December 13, 2024.

Shadow of the Future: Democratic Members Target Entities that Cut Deals with the Trump Administration

Big Law. On April 24, 2025, minority members on the House Judiciary Committee sent letters to nearly a dozen major law firms following reports that the firms had made deals with the Trump administration in response to or in anticipation of being targeted by Executive Orders challenging the legal practices and hiring decisions at various large U.S. law firms. The Democratic congressmembers sought information on the “enforceability of these agreements, how each agreement was formed, what promises were made, and how the agreements will be implemented.”

Paramount-Skydance. On May 19, 2025, several Democratic members of the House and Senate sent letters to the chair of Paramount Global (“Paramount”) about the company’s apparent attempt to settle the lawsuit filed by President Trump against CBS, a Paramount subsidiary. The members expressed concern that Paramount was contemplating the settlement only because of the company’s announced plan to merge with Skydance Media—a merger that required the review and approval of the Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission (FCC). On July 2, 2025, Paramount announced that it would pay $16 million to settle the CBS lawsuit with President Trump, and on August 7, 2025, the merger was completed. In response, Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) sent a letter to the FCC Chair on August 18, 2025, and ranking members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Judiciary Committee initiated an investigation into the Paramount-Skydance merger on August 21, 2025.

Trump filed the defamation lawsuit against the Pulitzer board, the group that decides who wins Pulitzer prizes, after it bestowed a joint award in 2018 to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their reporting on alleged Russian interference in Trump’s first election.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller reported in 2019 that his investigation uncovered insufficient evidence of collusion between the Russians and Trump’s campaign, “despite multiple efforts from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.” Mueller left unresolved whether Trump committed obstruction of justice.

The Pulitzer board argued that halting the case would avoid constitutional conflicts that could arise from Trump serving as plaintiff in a case that could involve official acts as President. Trump argued the case should carry on. Both courts sided with Trump.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It’s putting a spotlight on Trump’s agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration’s actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado’s House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It’s a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president’s deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump’s administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans hold firm even as public opinion shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump’s success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We’ve never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it’s one of the most secure southern borders we’ve had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they’re out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump’s approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There’s still a search for consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America’s security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn’t mean that we can’t have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration’s handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we’ll see if now’s the time.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/4c4d3cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5166x2906+0+273/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F44%2F79%2F0f2485217376ef07aa0bbc698ff0%2F2f3d4a8ef2b749b3adddc2c099a23b68,N,,2025-08-27 18:58:00.530735

Judge Lynn Adelman of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin denied Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah C. Dugan’s motion to dismiss a federal indictment. The indictment charges Dugan under 18 U.S.C. § 1071 with concealing a person from arrest and under 18 U.S.C. § 1505 with obstructing removal proceedings conducted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Federal prosecutors allege that in April 2025, Dugan confronted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents outside her courtroom, told them they needed a judicial warrant to arrest a noncitizen defendant, and directed them to leave the area. According to the indictment, she later allowed the individual and his attorney to exit through a non-public jury door, advising that he could appear remotely at his next court date.

In her motion to dismiss, Dugan argued that the alleged conduct constituted official judicial acts shielded by absolute immunity, that the prosecution violated the Tenth Amendment by intruding on state court authority, and that the statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional conflicts. Judge Adelman rejected these arguments, ruling that while judges enjoy immunity from civil suits for damages, the Supreme Court has never recognized absolute judicial immunity from criminal liability. He emphasized that judicial acts may serve as the means of accomplishing an unlawful end, and that immunity does not bar prosecutions alleging corrupt intent.

The court further held that the Tenth Amendment and federalism claims required factual development inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss, and found no ambiguity in the federal charging statutes that would justify narrowing them under the constitutional avoidance doctrine.

Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia announced Wednesday that he is seeking asylum in the US, according to media reports.

The move comes in the wake of Abrego Garcia, 30, being detained Monday by immigration officials in the state of Maryland, after being released from a jail in Tennessee on Friday, where he is scheduled for a January 2027 trial in an alleged human smuggling case.

The Trump administration said it intends to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, claiming he is part of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang, an allegation that he denies.

Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to his home country of El Salvador in March during a nationwide immigration crackdown conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, which targeted alleged MS-13 and Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members.

Under a 2019 court order in a separate case, Abrego Garcia was prohibited from being deported to El Salvador due to threats of violence against him by gang members. The order, however, allowed deportation to a different country, which places him in his current situation to be deported to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers are fighting those deportation efforts, arguing he faces persecution and torture in Uganda, which has documented human rights violations.

Abrego Garcia filed a Notice of Fear of Removal to Uganda to the court in which he stated his concerns.

""I, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia … hereby state that I fear persecution in UGANDA on account of my race, nationality, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group,"" he said. ""I also fear torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official in that country ... (and) that country will (re-deport me) to EL SALVADOR, where I also fear persecution on account of the above-mentioned protected grounds and torture by or at the acquiescence of a public official, and where I have been tortured in the past.""

US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the US cannot deport Abrego Garcia before she decides the underlying case. She also ruled that he must remain within a 200-mile (320-kilometer) radius of the Maryland court while he is in ICE custody.

Xinis scheduled an Oct. 6 hearing for the lawsuit that Abrego Garcia's attorneys filed Monday to challenge his deportation.

She is overseeing Abrego Garcia's case to ensure he can exercise his constitutionally protected rights during a process that his lawyers said should include immigration court proceedings and appeals. Xinis will not rule on whether Abrego Garcia receives asylum or is deported.

Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign said the government will comply with the order, even though he disagrees with the court's decision not to remove Abrego Garcia while the lawsuit is pending.

Abrego Garcia's lawyers said if he must be deported from the US, he has requested to be sent to Costa Rica.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/08/27/thumbs_b_c_8d4b9e72d0fb71a73828683151182e6d.jpg?v=203507,N,,2025-08-27 14:57:21.171728

The SUVs were in small business parking lots and dotted along rural highways. By day’s end, the immigration enforcement raids had begun. More than 70 people were arrested and taken into Border Patrol custody.

In Kern County, immigration enforcement is typically handled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Even then, arrests are usually targeted at specific individuals. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), on the other hand, rarely operates outside its 100-mile zone near the U.S.–Mexico border. Kern County is almost 300 miles away from that area. But on January 7th, Border Patrol agents cast a far wider net. They didn’t go after individual people. Instead, they stopped people of color, especially those who agents believed were farmworkers. Their tactics were aggressive and unprecedented.

For many, the raid — dubbed “Operation Return to Sender” — felt like more than a one-time sweep. It marked the start of a troubling new chapter in immigration enforcement.

“This Was Racial Profiling at Its Most Basic Level”

For Bree Bernwanger, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, the morning of January 7th started just like any other: then the calls began. Reports flooded in from Kern County that immigration agents were spotted in strange places throughout the county.

“They were slashing tires, smashing car windows,” Bernwanger recalls. “They pulled over cars, they grabbed people in parking lots, and there really didn’t seem to have any reason to do it except that people were brown. This was racial profiling at its most basic level.”

At first, everyone assumed these agents were ICE officers. But late one night, as Bernwanger checked the government’s detainee locator, she saw something unexpected. The people that had been arrested during the raid were in CBP custody. Border Patrol, which typically operates near the U.S.-Mexico border, had driven 300 miles into the Central Valley for a massive raid.

Agents targeted predominantly Latine neighborhoods and worksites, detaining people indiscriminately. People abducted were taken to a makeshift processing site in Bakersfield, then bused to an “icebox” in El Centro — freezing, windowless rooms with no beds, limited food, and no access to lawyers. Border Patrol coerced many into signing “voluntary departure” forms, misleading them about the consequences, which could include a 10-year ban on reentry.

Roughly 40 people were summarily expelled to Mexico without a hearing. Others, including U.S. citizens and longtime green card holders, were released but left shaken. Families and communities now live with the aftermath — fear, separation, and the knowledge that, as Bernwanger put it: “Everyone subjected to it is now picking up the pieces.”

“These folks’ rights are being violated. This should be concerning for all of us.”

Maricela Sanchez, an investigator with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, has lived her whole life advocating for our liberties and investigating civil rights abuses in the Central Valley. But on the morning of Operation Return to Sender, her social media feed showed something she’d never seen before: Border Patrol vehicles cruising down Highway 99 in Bakersfield.

“I haven’t seen that happen ever,” she recalls.

Through the Kern County Rapid Response Network — a coalition with a hotline and volunteers trained to document enforcement actions — and other partners, Sanchez helped interview dozens of people caught in the raids. Border Patrol foricibly reached into someone’s pocket to grab their ID from them. Another woman was driving home from work when she was pulled over by unmarked agents who never identified themselves. The next day, she was across the border in Mexico, separated from everything she had built in Bakersfield.

The stories Sanchez heard stayed with her: “Whenever I think about that week, I just think about how scary it was, how terrorizing it was. Just how much it affected our community.”

For Sanchez, these stories weren’t just case notes. They were the lives of her neighbors and friends. “So many children just stopped showing up to school. A lot of people didn’t feel comfortable coming to work. Folks completely stopped going to the store. How could that not impact you as a community member? Everyone should be concerned about this.”

“They thought no one would push back. But we did — and we’re not going anywhere.”

In Bakersfield, Rosa Lopez had been preparing for something like this for years. As a senior policy advocate with the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, she’d helped build the Kern County Rapid Response Network during the first Trump administration.

When the first calls came in on January 7, Lopez didn’t hesitate. She and her team dispatched volunteers across the county to record what they saw: license plates, uniforms, the way stops were conducted. Reports came in of canines, weapons drawn, and officers breaking windows — a level of aggression she’d never seen before.

This raid wasn’t routine. Border Patrol had set up a tent office, busing people straight to the border without legal access. Later, Lopez learned the raid had never been approved by the Department of Homeland Security. It was a rogue operation carried out by agents who thought they could act with impunity.

But the community was ready. Years of organizing meant people knew their rights, had red “Know Your Rights” cards in their pockets, and were willing to speak out. Lopez watched neighbors and community members step forward not just to report what they’d seen, but to stand beside those targeted, offering food, rides, and moral support.

“This is a moment that is going to test all of us,” Lopez said. “You can be afraid and hide, or you can be afraid and still stand up. We chose to stand up.”

The Stakes Beyond Kern County

The ACLU, United Farm Workers, and Bakersfield residents took Border Patrol to court for its unlawful and discriminatory actions during Operation Return to Sender. Agents operated far outside their legal jurisdiction, targeted people based on race, and denied them basic due process — all in violation of the Constitution. In April, in a major win for civil rights, a federal district court in California blocked the U.S. Border Patrol from using stop-and-arrest practices, which has led to zero warrantless arrest since the decision.

The ACLU and our partners will keep fighting in court and pushing for reforms that protect immigrant communities from racial profiling and abuse. We’ll also continue to work alongside residents, organizers, and labor groups to ensure no one has to live in fear of unlawful raids. We know this fight is about more than one county in California — it’s about defending the rights and dignity of people across the country.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/08/kern-county-social.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 14:57:01.427491

Allison Bustillo, now 20, said she is being forced to leave, alone.

Bustillo decided on Tuesday in court to withdraw her asylum case and self-deport back to Honduras.

Bustillo graduated as an academic scholar from Crest High School two years ago.

“I am going to ask for mercy,” Bustillo said.

Channel 9’s sister station, Telemundo Charlotte, spoke with Bustillo exclusively last weekend from the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia where she’s been held since late February.

ICE agents arrested Bustillo in her east Charlotte apartment where she lived with her mother and three brothers, one of whom has autism.

Channel 9 couldn’t find a criminal record for Bustillo.

She told Telemundo she is a nursing student on scholarship at Gardner-Webb University.

“I’m not a criminal,” Bustillo said. “I literally came here when I was 8 years old to look for a better life, and this is how they are treating me.”

Bustillo’s mother, Kelly Chinchilla, said her daughter was desperate after being imprisoned for more than six months.

“We have fought all this time so that she could be released and return home, but as a mother, I also understand her, because she is at a point where she is desperate,” Chinchilla said.

Bustillo’s attorney, Martin Rosenbluth, was able to get her a voluntary departure despite not qualifying for it.

“Technically, under the law, she wasn’t eligible,” said Rosenbluth.

That means she will leave the country without a deportation order.

Her mother said that’s not justice and her daughter going to Honduras would be terrifying.

“The only memory my daughter has of Honduras is when someone put a gun to our heads,” the mother said.

Telemundo said Bustillo will now leave the country on a commercial flight.

Bustillo said ICE agents arrested her after officers came to her house looking for someone who wasn’t living there anymore.

The head of ICE has said agents will arrest anyone they find in the country who is undocumented even if they don’t have a criminal record.

The Homeland Security secretary said 1.6 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. in her first 200 days on the job.

In a speech at London Oxford Airport on Tuesday, Mr Farage said his party would be prepared to deport 600,000 migrants over five years if it won power at the next election.

But Calum Miller, MP for Bicester and Woodstock, said the proposals were ""empty slogans"" which were ""not a substitute for serious policy"".

In a letter to Farage, Miller added that Oxfordshire was a ""community interested in solving problems, not fuelling conflict"".

""You came here to talk about 'mass deportations' but made no effort to understand the people or challenges of this community,"" he wrote to the Reform UK leader.

""If you return, I would be glad to show you Oxfordshire's real story: businesses thriving thanks to home and overseas talent, health and care services desperate for staff and residents supporting refugees with compassion.""

""He spent his career grappling with difficult truths and forging alliances in our national interest,"" the Liberal Democrat wrote.

""Instead of sowing division, we should build on that legacy.""

The BBC has contacted Reform UK and Nigel Farage for a response to Calum Miller's letter.

During Tuesday's speech, Farage said his party would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, under plans announced earlier.

The party says it would make £2bn available to offer payments or aid to countries like Afghanistan to take back migrants, with sanctions potentially imposed on uncooperative countries.

It doesn't mean that we can't have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month.","Washington — Democrats were plunged into political crisis, especially splintered on immigration and border security, after their thorough defeat last year in an election in which President Donald Trump made hard-line immigration action a centerpiece of his campaign.

That may be changing.

From New York to California, Democratic lawmakers are talking more about their immigration plans, showing up at detention centers to conduct oversight on the conditions and at times getting into confrontations with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. It's putting a spotlight on Trump's agenda to deport millions of people, suggesting Democratic lawmakers are feeling emboldened to push back. Still, they have a ways to go before advancing a unified agenda of their own.

Yet their actions show how the ground is shifting in the American immigration debate — away from border policies to questions about the future for millions of people who are already in the country without permanent legal status.

“Is there an opening for Democrats? Yeah,” Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who has pushed his party for years to emphasize border security, told The Associated Press. “Say strong on border security, focus on criminals and all that, but do not deport the folks with good records.”

Democrats are ramping up visits to detention centers

Across the country, Democrats have shown up — sometimes unannounced — at immigration detention centers to check on reports of unsanitary and unsafe conditions and draw attention to the Trump administration's actions. Congressional Democrats have sued the Department of Homeland Security for blocking them from making unannounced site visits, saying they have a right to do so under federal law.

“Transparency matters. Oversight matters. Accountability matters,” said Rep. Joe Neguse earlier this month after he and other Colorado Democrats visited a detention center in Aurora, near Denver. “You certainly can expect to see the Democratic members of Colorado's House delegation continue to lean in on all fronts.”

It's a change of focus for some within the Democratic Party even from the beginning of the year, when many lawmakers were arguing that the party needed a new approach on immigration that emphasized stronger enforcement. Some Democrats even helped advance several Republican bills aimed at migrants who are accused of crimes.

Yet as the Republican president's deportation efforts ramped up this year and ensnared people without criminal backgrounds who were caught up in the fervor to remove noncitizens, Democrats began to mobilize.

“Hardworking, middle-class individuals — all us just looking to earn the American dream,” said Rep. Lou Correa, a California Democrat, referring to Alejandro Barranco, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran whose father was arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents in southern California, where he lived for decades.

Barranco was at the Capitol for a July event organized by Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee where they decried Trump's administration as “unaccountable, unlawful and unconstitutional.”

Republicans hold firm even as public opinion shifts

Still, Republicans believe they continue to have the upper hand in the immigration debate. They are already pointing to Trump's success in deterring migrants from coming to the U.S. border with Mexico.

“We've never seen such — first of all — a horrible situation with the border as we saw under President Biden and the Democrats, only to see all that reversed after the election. Now it's one of the most secure southern borders we've had in years,” said Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican.

Daines charged that Democrats are “rudderless, they're out of ideas, and the ideas they do have are out of touch with where I think most Americans are at, particularly hardworking middle-class Americans and our Hispanic community as well.”

But there are signs that public support is slipping for Trump's approach. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found in July that only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.

A poll from Gallup that was circulated widely among Democrats that month found that almost 8 in 10 Americans say immigration is “a good thing” for the country, an increase from 64% a year ago and a high point in the nearly 25-year trend.

“I do think the American public is seeing this administration for what it is,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat.

“It’s not just targeting dangerous, violent criminals. The vast majority of people being arrested, being detained, being deported even, many without due process, have no criminal convictions, no violent history,” he added. “They’re actually people who the first Trump administration designated as essential at the outset of the COVID pandemic. So that cruel irony is not lost on people.”

There's still a search for consensus

Democrats are trying to seize the moment with a flurry of proposals on immigration. Broadly, the proposals move away from policies that have allowed large numbers of migrants to enter the country, such as asylum and temporary protected status, in favor of expanding visas and other means of legal immigration.

The Center for American Progress, a leading liberal policy organization, has released an immigration framework that starts with the imperative to “safeguard America's security.” The New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group of more than 100 House Democrats, also released a plan that calls for toughened border security while “expanding safe, legal avenues for immigration.”

“What we really need to do is overall fix the broken immigration system. It doesn't mean that we can't have border security.” Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, said at a town hall this month. “We have crossings at almost zero, and I think there should be credit given to the president for that, but why not use this opportunity to pass immigration reform?”

Gallego, who won a Senate seat in Arizona last year while Trump also carried the state, has released a plan that calls for tightening restrictions on asylum and pushing other countries in the region to accept asylum seekers.

Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, are still forming their own plans as they try to win over more liberal members who are concerned about changing the asylum system.

Other Democrats are looking for more immediate ways to aid immigrants who have been in the country for years but face an uncertain new reality under the Trump administration.

Padilla said he hopes Republicans can get behind his legislation that would open a pathway for a green card to people in the country under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, and others who have lived in the country for at least seven years.

He said Republicans are starting to hear the public backlash to the Trump administration's handling of deportations “and maybe think differently, so we'll see if now's the time.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/25/PDTN/85816129007-ap-25237406801430.jpg?crop=4677,2632,x0,y311&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-27 14:57:05.296749

More than 180 current and former Fema employees signed the letter sent to the Fema Review Council and Congress on Monday critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs, and warning that Fema’s capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished.
“Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the Fema 36,” the person added.

Among those facing potential retaliation are staff who were directly responsible for relief efforts in Kerr county, Texas, which is still reeling from the deadly floods it faced last month, according to Stand Up for Science, the advocacy group that published the Monday letter.

“This situation is developing, but this decision underscores the many issues these public servants described in their declaration and their bravery in standing up for Americans in need,” said a Stand Up for Science spokesperson.

More than 180 current and former Fema employees signed the letter sent to the Fema Review Council and Congress on Monday critiquing recent cuts to agency staff and programs, and warning that Fema’s capacity to respond to a major disaster was dangerously diminished.

Thirty-six signed their names while 141 signed anonymously for fear of retribution. Some reports say that up to 30 signatories have been placed on leave.

Though Stand Up for Science could not confirm that number, “it seems likely they’ve retaliated against all public signers”, a spokesperson said.

“Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the Fema 36,” the person added.

The Associated Press confirmed that at least two of the signatories received notices on Tuesday evening informing them they would be placed on leave indefinitely, with pay, and that they must still check in every morning confirming their availability. The status of other signatories was unclear.

The notice said the decision “is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive”.

Fema did not respond immediately to questions about how many staff members received the notice and whether it was related to the letter.

The Washington Post first reported that some Fema employees were being put on leave.

Called the “Katrina Declaration” by signers, the letter references the much-criticized Fema response to Hurricane Katrina, which struck the Gulf coast 20 years ago this week.

Jeremy Edwards, former spokesperson for Fema and the White House under Joe Biden’s presidency, who signed the letter, said the agency had been “completely unprepared for Katrina because of where they were positioned within the federal government at the time”.

He said the Trump administration was failing to comply with the 2006 Post Katrina Emergency Response Act (PKEMRA) passed to prevent future botched disaster responses.

“As an example, PKEMRA required Fema to be led by someone with disaster management experience. This administration failed that test,” he said. “It requires that the secretary of homeland security not reduce the capacity or ability of the agency. They failed that test. And it requires them to provide training and preparedness measures for state and local partners, and they’ve rolled back a lot of those trainings, or put them on pause.”

The dissent letter contained six “statements of opposition” to current policies at Fema, including an expenditure approval policy by which the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, must approve contracts exceeding $100,000, which the signatories said reduces Fema’s ability to perform its mission.

It also critiqued the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to reassign some Fema employees to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the failure to appoint a qualified Fema administrator as stipulated by law, and cuts to mitigation programs, preparedness training and the Fema workforce.

Edwards said the Trump administration could immediately appoint a new acting Fema administrator with more disaster management experience, and end new policies requiring Noem to sign off on agency spending.

But at least one anonymous current staffer was skeptical of the letter’s ability to deliver change.

“I appreciate where their heart is but not a lot of upside for folks who work here to sign on to something like that,” the anonymous staffer said.

In an email on Monday, a Fema spokesperson said: “It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform.

“Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo, who have forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy.”

The statement was “an insult to anyone working at Fema, the agency directly responsive to rapidly intensifying and changing circumstances”, said a Stand Up for Science spokesperson.

The letter follows reports that the Department of Homeland Security, Fema’s parent agency, has administered lie detector tests in response to leaks about how the agency is being run.

“There is a huge culture of fear and intimidation that the secretary of homeland security has imposed upon the agency, and that David Richardson [Fema’s acting administrator] is also imposing,” said Edwards.

He said he had known people who were “unceremoniously fired on the spot” after failing polygraph tests.

“They refute the results, mind you, and these aren’t legitimate exercises, but they were walked out of the building,” he said. “The fact that the people who signed on to this letter saw all that happening, knew that that very same thing could happen to them, and they still took the risk because they thought it was important to put their name on this thing, I think speaks to an immense amount of courage on behalf of these people.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b0babd9f82754fc4d8b36f078ffd24857b777e/62_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fe3dafd41c98a07594f7e264522aee2a",N,,2025-08-27 14:57:09.951239

He went to elementary school, high school and college in the Beehive state, graduating from Utah State University, before going on to play on some of the biggest stages, including a stint with the Utah Symphony and Ballet West.

On Tuesday, Shin’s wife Danae Snow, an American citizen, told ABC4 News that she got a heartbreaking phone call from him on her birthday Wednesday, August 20.

“That morning he was texting me ‘happy birthday, I love you so much’ and then by that afternoon, I got the phone call ‘honey, I’ve been detained by ICE, I love you and the kids and they’re sending me to a detainment center,” Snow said behind tears. “I just thought, oh my gosh, I don’t know how this can happen.”

Snow described Shin as a charismatic, selfless person, who not only contributes to society in a big way, but also to her family.

“They say that there’s stepdads and then there’s dads who step up and he’s really the dad who stepped up and he’s loved my kids just as his own,” Snow said.

According to Crayk, ICE arrested Shin because of Shin’s impaired driving charge several years ago, while he was struggling with the death of his father.

“It looks like John back in 2019 was charged with a DUI, but ultimately resolved his case in 2020 with an impaired driver [charge],” Crayk said. “He has successfully completed all of his probation, completed treatment classes, everything he was ordered to do … everything was completed.”

Shin had his driver’s license reinstated and was able to drive on Utah roads again with insurance.

“The problem that you have though, is as someone who is coming to the United States and who doesn’t currently have proper documentation because when you get a DUI, DACA gets taken — immigration will not let you have DACA with a DUI,” Crayk said. “He becomes a priority, especially under the current administration — so, he was taken into ICE custody because he accepted and did an agreement in Tooele County for an impaired driver, which caused ICE to take him into custody.”

Crayk is aiming to get Shin out of the ICE detention center in Aurora, Colorado during Shin’s first court appearance next Tuesday.

Costa Rica and plea negotiations The idea to deport Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica was borne of weekslong negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys in his human smuggling case.
Abrego Garcia is accused of taking money to transport people who were in the country illegally.
There were nine passengers in the SUV and Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in cash on him.
The Trump administration could just send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, which already said it would accept him, the lawsuit said.","NASHVILLE (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who has become the face of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, is in a Virginia detention center facing deportation to the east African country of Uganda.

The Maryland construction worker, 30, was detained Monday in Baltimore by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement after leaving a Tennessee jail on Friday. Administration officials have said he’s part of the dangerous MS-13 gang, an allegation Abrego Garcia denies.

The Salvadoran national’s lawyers are fighting the deportation efforts in court, arguing he has the right to express fear of persecution and torture in Uganda. Abrego Garcia has also told immigration authorities he would prefer to be sent to Costa Rica if he must be removed from the U.S.

It’s the latest twist in a long and complicated legal saga under the administration’s hardline deportation policies.

As his deportation proceedings and a related lawsuit move forward, here’s what to know:

Why does the government want to deport him?

Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. without documentation when he was 16. He settled in Maryland, worked construction, married and started a family.

A U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for deportation in 2019, but not to his native El Salvador where he faces credible threats of violence from local gangs.

The Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March, in violation of the 2019 order. His American wife successfully sued to bring him back in June, and on his return he was charged with human trafficking in Tennessee — charges his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The Trump administration is trying to deport him again — before his trial — saying he’s a danger to the community. Confidential plea negotiations in his criminal case have become an opportunity for mudslinging on both sides.

Lawyers: Uganda is punishment

After the Trump administration was forced to bring Abrego Garcia back in June, ICE officials vowed to deport him to a unnamed third country. Within minutes of his release from criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday, ICE said he would be deported to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia notified the U.S. government Saturday that he fears deportation to Uganda, where he believes he could be tortured. He said he also worries that Uganda will send him to El Salvador, where he said he’s been tortured before.

In a separate notice, he said he would prefer to be deported to Costa Rica.

The notices were included in the lawsuit filed Monday. It says the U.S. is punishing Abrego Garcia for successfully fighting his deportation to El Salvador, refusing to plead guilty to the smuggling charges and for seeking release from jail in Tennessee.

Meanwhile, opposition figures and others in Uganda have criticized the agreement with the U.S. to receive deported migrants, questioning the lack of parliamentary approval and saying the deal eases political pressure on the country’s authoritarian president.

Without parliamentary oversight, “the whole scheme stinks,” said Mathias Mpuuga, until recently the leader of the opposition in Uganda’s national assembly.

He said Uganda is already struggling to look after refugees fleeing violence in neighboring countries. It’s unclear what Ugandan authorities are getting in return for accepting deportees.

Costa Rica and plea negotiations

The idea to deport Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica was borne of weekslong negotiations between prosecutors and defense attorneys in his human smuggling case.

Abrego Garcia is accused of taking money to transport people who were in the country illegally. He has pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, saying it was filed to punish him for challenging his deportation. Trial is set for January.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop for speeding in Tennessee. There were nine passengers in the SUV and Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in cash on him. While officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling, he was allowed to drive away with only a warning.

A Homeland Security agent testified that he didn’t begin investigating until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys began confidential discussions about a possible plea agreement in mid-July, according to court filings. Abrego Garcia was only interested in a deal in which “he is deported to a Spanish-speaking third country in North or Central America — like Mexico — where he can live freely and safely” after serving his sentence in the U.S.

Working with the State Department, the U.S. Attorney’s Office was able to secure a pledge from Costa Rica that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed there as a legal immigrant and not detained or re-deported to El Salvador. Prosecutors believed the two sides were very close to an agreement last week.

But within minutes of Abrego Garcia leaving jail on Friday, ICE informed his attorneys that it intended to deport him to Uganda.

Abrego Garcia’s defense attorneys publicized details of the plea negotiations in a Saturday court filing. They said the threat of deportation to Uganda was more proof of the vindictive nature of the criminal case and more reason to dismiss it.

Prosecutors shot back on Monday, defending their handling of the plea discussions and accusing defense attorneys of “twisting the Government’s good-faith efforts into something sinister.”

Reasonable fear interview

In his lawsuit, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers asked the court to ensure that he can exercise his constitutional rights, including immigration court proceedings and appeals.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s lead immigration attorney, told reporters Monday that he is entitled to a reasonable fear interview, when he can express fears of persecution or torture in Uganda.

If officials determine Abrego Garcia lacks reasonable fear, he should be allowed to ask a U.S. immigration judge to review that decision, his lawyer said. And if the immigration judge upholds the determination, Abrego Garcia should be able to bring it to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

The Trump administration could just send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, which already said it would accept him, the lawsuit said. But the administration chose Uganda “to punish him.”

They may come to the emergency room, bringing in someone who’s suffering a medical crisis while being detained. They may wait in the lobby, as agents did for two weeks at an L.A.-area hospital waiting for a woman to be discharged. Or they may even chase people inside, as federal agents did at a Southern California surgical center.

The sight of these agents — often armed and with covered faces — makes many wary and may keep people from seeking care.

Existing hospital policies guide operations when law enforcement brings in a person under arrest, hospital officials say.

“This is nothing new to hospitals,” said Lois Richardson, vice president and counsel at the California Hospital Association. “We get inmates, detainees, arrestees all the time, whether it's police, sheriff, highway patrol, ICE, whatever it is.” The job for hospital workers remains to provide care, she added, and not to get involved in disputes over why a person is in custody.

Yet immigration attorneys, advocates and health workers have expressed concerns over the handling of some of these cases, both by immigration officers and by some administrators at medical facilities.

Specifically, they’re worried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.

“We have a level of privacy that we owe to patients and their families, and that has just been completely demolished with all of the involvement of ICE coming into hospitals,” said Kate Mobeen, an ICU nurse at John Muir Medical Center in Concord. “It creates just a huge sense of fear, not only in our patient population, but in our employee population and our nurses.”

Patients' rights, policies face new tests

Sometimes when ICE has shown up at medical facilities with a detained patient, the result has been conflicting messaging about the rules.

On July 29, ICE agents took a man to John Muir Medical Center in Concord because he suffered an unspecified medical emergency while being detained outside the Concord immigration court, according to Ali Saidi, an attorney and the director of Stand Together Contra Costa, a local rapid response and legal services organization.

When Saidi arrived at the hospital as part of the response network, he said hospital staff told him that he was not allowed to see the detained patient, but that the man’s family would be allowed. Then, when the man’s wife arrived, “The rules had somehow changed, and they said no family visit,” Saidi said.

In a statement shared by the Contra Costa Immigrants Rights Alliance, the detained man’s wife, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, Maria, said that when she later talked to her husband, he told her that he was so terrified that he passed out.

“My family and I went to the emergency room and we asked to see him and talk to him to make sure he was okay,” Maria said, in the statement. “The hospital staff would not let us see him and they would not give us any information about what was happening to him. They wouldn’t even answer my questions.”

John Muir officials would not comment on the incident, citing privacy laws. But in an email, Ben Drew, a spokesperson for the hospital, said general policy is that “If a law enforcement agency indicates that visitation presents a safety or security concern, [the hospital] may limit or deny visitation to protect our patients, staff, and visitors.”

Saidi said that when the wife insisted on getting information about the man’s condition, hospital security called the police.

“We understand that emotions are high whenever a family member or friend is in the emergency department or hospital,” said Drew. “The hospital only involves local police in circumstances when a patient or visitor’s behavior becomes abusive, disruptive, or threatening, and cannot be resolved through our own security team.”

Saidi denied that the family was being disruptive, saying that conversations with hospital staff and administration were respectful and no voices were raised.

“The atmosphere in that emergency bay was something like I’ve never seen before in my career,” Saidi said. “There was a chilling effect. Everyone was averting their eyes. You could tell the staff felt bad.”

Multiple emergency department nurses told Mobeen, a local California Nurses Association leader at John Muir, that ICE officers were “very aggressive with staff” and staff were afterwards “emotionally and physically upset” by what happened, she said.

“It’s horrifying to not be able to tell patients’ family members how they are, what their status is,” Mobeen said.

Part of the issue, Mobeen added, is training. Staff were not given adequate training on how to respond to any kind of immigration enforcement action that may occur at the hospital, she said.

Drew, the spokesman for John Muir, countered that the hospital has given guidance on its longstanding law enforcement policy and answered multiple questions since January about what to do if ICE agents show up at their facilities.

Limits for ICE access, sometimes murky

Last month, immigration agents occupied the lobby of Dignity Health’s Glendale Memorial Hospital, even standing behind reception desks, as photos that circulated online showed. Protestors gathered outside the hospital hosting rallies and press conferences.

They were all there because agents had previously brought in Milagro Solis-Portillo, an immigrant from El Salvador, for medical care following her detention. They spent 15 days in the hospital waiting for Solis-Portillo’s discharge before transferring her to another hospital and then taking her into custody, according to local news reports.

In a statement, officials from Dignity Memorial Hospital said they could not legally prohibit law enforcement from being in public areas.

That’s true, say legal experts: Waiting rooms and lobbies are considered public spaces in hospitals. But agents cannot move through hospitals without limits. Law enforcement officials are not allowed to search for people in exam rooms or other private spaces without a federal court warrant.

When agents bring in someone who is in their custody and needs medical care, the application of the law can be more murky.

According to Richardson at the hospital association, how far an agent can go into treatment areas with a detained patient may be decided on a case by case basis. In cases where a detained patient is struggling or resisting, that patient may need guarding, she explained.

And if law enforcement officers do go inside exam rooms, they may hear medical information while on guard. But that isn't necessarily a privacy violation, according to federal rules. The HIPPA Privacy Rule, the law that sets privacy standards for medical information, has a provision that allows for “incidental disclosures” of information as long as “reasonable safeguards” are applied.

“The hospital will, and the doctor will make reasonable attempts to protect the patient's privacy.” “What is reasonable is going to depend, again, on what's wrong with the patient, how the patient is behaving, the nature of the circumstances,” Richardson said.

HIPAA protects the disclosure of medical records, which include names, addresses and social security numbers along with health conditions. State law also requires health facilities to protect this information. According to guidance from the attorney general’s office, health facilities should consider a patient’s immigration status confidential.

At the same time, some disclosures are required if law enforcement can prove lawful custody or show an appropriate warrant. A federal court warrant signed by a judge grants law enforcement immediate access to information or to search a particular area, while an ICE administrative warrant does not require immediate compliance.

Health workers in 'precarious' situations

Health facilities generally direct frontline workers not to engage with immigration agents, but rather to immediately contact security or management.

One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers.

On July 8, federal agents targeted three landscapers who had parked outside of the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center. They chased one of the men inside on foot, according to a felony criminal complaint filed against two health care workers in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

In videos of the incident posted online, a masked agent wearing a vest labeled “POLICE ICE” on the back holds a weeping man by the shoulder inside the center while several workers in scrubs stand by. At multiple points in the video workers ask the officer for identification; one worker says, “this is a private business.”

Two workers, Danielle Davila and Jose Ortega, tell the officer to leave. Davila moves between the officer and the man, saying “Get your hands off of him. You don’t even have a warrant.”

Ortega puts an arm between Davila and the officer and says “You have no proper identification.”

The officer says to both workers “You touched a federal agent.” Then Davila responds, “I’m not touching you.”

Davila and Ortega were later charged with two felony counts of assaulting a federal officer and conspiring to prevent a federal officer from performing their duties.

Last week the felony charges were dismissed and both Davila and Ortega pleaded not guilty to a subsequent misdemeanor assault charge. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment on the charges.

Davila’s defense attorney Oliver Cleary said his client believed she was doing the right thing by asking for credentials and a warrant.

“You can’t just come in where people are getting medical care and whisk them away,” Cleary said. “She didn’t know who these people were. They didn’t tell her who they were, and as far as she knew this was a patient of the clinic.”

Carlos Juárez, Ortega’s defense attorney, said arresting and charging health workers with crimes for asking to see a warrant and identification puts them in a “precarious” and “dangerous situation.”

“They did what they needed to do and what they had a right to do,” Juárez said. “What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.”

Workers say additional training can help

Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace. Some workers are providing training themselves.

Adriana Rugeles-Ortiz, a licensed vocational nurse at Kaiser Permanente Modesto Medical Center, has been leading “Know Your Rights” sessions at her hospital and in her community as part of her union, SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. She said some of her coworkers have expressed anxiety over some of the situations they’ve seen play out in other hospitals.

“Because of my involvement with all the training that we have done to the workers and to the community, personally, I do feel prepared. I am not that confident that we have been able to reach the entire workforce within Kaiser to get them to the level of confidence to deal with it,” Rugeles-Ortiz said.

Dr. Douglas Yoshida, an emergency room physician at Stanford Health Tri-Valley in Alameda County, said additional guidance and training for workers at medical facilities could be of great value.

“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said. “I mean, personally, if someone comes in in ICE custody, within the limits of the law, I want to do everything I can to help [patients.]”

The hospital in Pleasanton that Yoshida works in is located near the county’s Santa Rita Jail; staff, he said, have been used to a law enforcement presence. But the recent incident at John Muir Medical Center, about 30 miles north, as well as the criminal charges filed against the southern California surgery center workers have set people on edge, Yoshida said.

“Normally, health care workers have no reason to fear law enforcement,” he added, “but we’re in uncharted territory.”

“The Supreme Court should see through that ruse.”","The Trump administration on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court for the second time to allow the government to freeze, for now, billions of dollars in foreign aid.

In an emergency request, the administration asked the justices to lift an order from a federal judge that requires the administration to spend funds Congress already budgeted for foreign aid.

The administration has moved aggressively to seize control of the executive branch and claimed broad authority to halt federal dollars appropriated by Congress for programs at odds with President Trump’s agenda.

The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has generally been receptive to the administration’s claims, handing the president a series of technically temporary victories that have nevertheless had broad practical consequences. In emergency rulings, the justices have allowed Mr. Trump to fire independent agency regulators, cut grants to teacher training programs and remove protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants.

But in an earlier iteration of the foreign aid case in March, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, along with the three liberal justices, rejected Mr. Trump’s request to freeze nearly $2 billion while the case continued in the lower courts.

Lower court judges have issued a series of conflicting rulings as to whether Mr. Trump can refuse to spend the funds.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order temporarily ending programs around the world to determine whether they were “fully aligned with the foreign policy of the president.”

The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition and the Global Health Council, both nonprofit groups, challenged the freeze as an unconstitutional infringement on Congress’s power of the purse.

Judge Amir Ali of the Federal District Court in Washington said in March that the administration had unlawfully delayed the money and required the administration to allow funds to flow, including nearly $4 million for global health and more than $6 million for H.I.V. and AIDS programs.

Then, earlier this month, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with Mr. Trump, finding that the global health organizations that challenged the freeze lacked grounds to bring the lawsuit. In a 2-1 ruling, the appeals court said that only the Government Accountability Office, an independent watchdog controlled by Congress, could challenge the administration’s withholding of funds.

Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, the office can sue to force the release of funds a president refuses to spend. But it has not yet taken that step.

A larger complement of judges on the D.C. Circuit then refused to allow the three-judge panel ruling to immediately take effect while the full 10-member appeals court decided whether to rehear the matter. (One judge has recused herself.)

That prompted Solicitor General D. John Sauer to race to the Supreme Court this week, telling the justices that lawmakers and the president — not a single federal judge in Washington — should resolve disputes over how or whether to disperse federal funds appropriated by Congress.

“Given the vast sums involved and the significance of the case to the separation of powers and U.S. foreign policy, the district court’s holdings, if allowed to stand, would clearly warrant this court’s attention, and those holdings would not survive review,” Mr. Sauer wrote, asking the justices for a decision by Sept. 2.

The district court’s ruling, he added, “would open the floodgates to suits by private parties who compete for appropriated funds and who seek to impose judicial oversight on executive spending decisions at odds with the process Congress prescribed.”

In response, the lead lawyer for the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition noted that the administration had waited months before asking the justices to block the lower court’s ruling.

“Now they are running to the Supreme Court, claiming at the last second that they would be harmed by compliance with the district court’s order,” Lauren Bateman, a lawyer at Public Citizen Litigation Group, said in a statement. “The Supreme Court should see through that ruse.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/27/multimedia/27dc-scotus-usaid-mfpk/27dc-scotus-usaid-mfpk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:03.936284

As lawmakers prepare to return next week from their August recess, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) wants them to get to work on immigration reform and bolstering federal safety net programs, among other issues, framing its advocacy work around protecting human dignity and supporting the most vulnerable.

“As a nonpartisan organization, the USCCB is engaged with members of Congress, their staff, and the White House and the administration to advance the common good for all and uphold the sacredness of human life and the God-given dignity of the human person,” Chieko Noguchi, the USCCB’s executive director for public affairs, told CNA.

“This means that the care for immigrants, refugees, and the poor is part of the same teaching of the Church that requires us to protect the most vulnerable among us, especially unborn children, the elderly, and the infirm,” Noguchi noted.

Addressing the conference’s ongoing public policy priorities, Noguchi referenced a letter to members of Congress earlier this year from USCCB President Archbishop Timothy Broglio that in addition to immigration reform called for legislation that supports vulnerable communities, especially children and low-income families.

But following this summer’s passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act spending package, Broglio faulted that measure for including “unconscionable cuts to health care and food assistance, tax cuts that increase inequality, immigration provisions that harm families and children, and cuts to programs that protect God’s creation.”

A recently emerging issue for the bishops is digital safety. In a joint letter this July with other faith-based and family organizations, the USCCB voiced support for the Kids Online Safety Act. The measure would place greater responsibility on technology companies to design platforms that protect minors from harmful content and addictive features. The bishops described the legislation as consistent with their commitment to safeguarding children and promoting environments where families can thrive.

This fall, immigration remains central to USCCB advocacy efforts. The bishops continue to press Congress to provide permanent protections for so-called “Dreamers,” referring to people who were brought to the U.S. as children.

“The continued uncertainty associated with the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program is untenable and unjust, depriving hardworking people the ability to be fully recognized members of our society,” the conference maintains.

The bishops also oppose changes to social safety net programs that would limit eligibility for mixed-status families (those with both legal and unauthorized members). They cite, for example, the Child Tax Credit, which currently only requires the benefiting child to have a Social Security number.

“This is consistent with the goals of such programs, which exist to empower families and to prevent them from falling into poverty,” the USCCB asserts.

Religious Workforce Protection Act

The bishops are also urging passage of the Religious Workforce Protection Act, which as of Aug. 22 had 10 Democrat and three Republican lawmakers cosponsoring the House bill and would authorize the continuation of lawful nonimmigrant status for certain religious workers affected by the current backlog for religious worker immigrant visas.

A similar bill in the Senate now has five Republicans and one Democrat cosponsoring. Numerous Catholic institutions such as parishes and schools depend on international clergy. In an Aug. 7 interview with EWTN, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration is committed to fixing the ongoing backlog of religious worker visas.

Despite the fact that earlier this year the USCCB ended its decades-long partnership with the federal government to resettle refugees due to funding cuts and suspended agreements that made the program unsustainable, the bishops continue to call for generous resettlement policies and humane border enforcement.

Housing is also an increasing policy focus. In an Aug. 8 letter, the bishops pressed Congress to strengthen funding for affordable housing and community development in the fiscal year 2026 appropriations process.

(Story continues below)

Meanwhile, the USCCB’s advocacy around health care policy remains linked to the Church’s pro-life stance. The bishops have been strongly supportive of congressional efforts to ensure that federal programs such as Medicaid do not fund abortion. In July, a federal judge blocked a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood for one year and ordered the federal government to resume Medicaid reimbursements to the abortion giant while litigation over the law continues.

The USCCB also supports expanding access to maternal health services, pediatric care, and palliative care. Broadly on fiscal policy, the USCCB has called for a federal budget that prioritizes the poor and reflects Catholic principles of solidarity centered on the common good.

The bishops also continue to press for robust support for international humanitarian aid. As global crises intensify, the bishops have asked Congress to provide funding for humanitarian and development assistance in the fiscal year 2026 budget. Funding for the current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. The USCCB frames these legislative priorities as connected parts of a single mission.

“The decisions you make in your important work on behalf of our nation will have a lasting impact on the well-being and common good of many people,” Broglio wrote.

“I would rescind his executive order, yes,” Spanberger told The Mercury in a lengthy policy interview earlier this month, referring to Youngkin’s Executive Order 47 issued in February.
Spanberger countered that Youngkin’s approach illustrates how immigration enforcement can pull local agencies away from their core responsibilities while pushing state agencies into federal civil enforcement.
She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.
Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law.","Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger says one of her first acts if elected would be to undo Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s February directive requiring Virginia law enforcement to help carry out federal immigration crackdowns — a policy she argues wastes local resources and undermines community trust.

“I would rescind his executive order, yes,” Spanberger told The Mercury in a lengthy policy interview earlier this month, referring to Youngkin’s Executive Order 47 issued in February. The order gave state police and corrections officers authority to perform certain immigration duties and also urged local jails to fully cooperate with federal deportation operations.

The governor said at the time the measure was meant to keep “dangerous criminal illegal immigrants” off Virginia’s streets. Spanberger countered that Youngkin’s approach illustrates how immigration enforcement can pull local agencies away from their core responsibilities while pushing state agencies into federal civil enforcement.

“Our immigration system is absolutely broken,” she said. “The idea that we would take local police officers or local sheriff’s deputies in amid all the things that they have to do, like community policing or staffing our jails or investigating real crimes, so that they can go and tear families apart … that is a misuse of those resources.”

Spanberger’s stance sets up a sharp contrast with her opponent — Republican nominee Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who has embraced the order and tied it to her own story as a legal immigrant from Jamaica.

The divide between the two candidates underscores how immigration has become one of the most combustible issues in Virginia’s 2025 campaign for governor — and how Youngkin’s policies continue to shape the race even as he prepares to leave office in January.

That influence stretches beyond Youngkin’s executive order. In late February, Youngkin also launched the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force, a sweeping federal-state operation staffed with more than 200 personnel from agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the FBI, state police and corrections, which has claimed hundreds to thousands of immigration and gang-related arrests in Virginia.

Keep enforcement federal, Spanberger says

Spanberger, who represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in Congress before launching her gubernatorial bid, argued that immigration enforcement should be handled by federal officials with judicial oversight, not by local police diverted from their own duties.

She said Democrats are often wrongly portrayed as opposing law enforcement when they object to policies like Youngkin’s that conscript local agencies into immigration sweeps.

“If someone has a criminal violation at the state level or at the federal level … local resources are required to arrest that person or put them in a local jail before transferring them to federal custody. Absolutely the locality should participate in that,” she said.

But Spanberger insisted the standard should be the same for immigration cases as for any other criminal matter.

“They have to have a warrant to pick somebody up off the street, so they meet that same standard,” she said. “And they can easily go get that detention order signed by a judge or a magistrate, if they want that local support.”

Without those safeguards, Spanberger argued, local cooperation with ICE undermines community policing, creates constitutional concerns and strains already tight budgets. She pointed to her former district of Prince William County, which she said spent more than $1 million housing detainees under a prior partnership with federal immigration authorities.

Earle-Sears emphasizes rule of law

Earle-Sears, who initially agreed to a similar policy interview with The Mercury but canceled minutes before it was to take place, has publicly and repeatedly defended Youngkin’s executive order.

“I am a legal immigrant and now a naturalized citizen. Working together, the governor, attorney general, and I have made Virginia safer,” she said in February when announcing the policy. “Now, working with President Trump, we can take on the scourge of dangerous and violent illegal immigrants.”

In December, while unveiling a “No Sanctuary Cities” budget proposal, she described the bureaucratic hurdles her own family went through when immigrating to the U.S. and argued that others should follow the same path.

“My father and I had to file documents and wait to be granted permission to enter the United States. Under Governor Youngkin’s leadership, Virginia stands firm: we are not a sanctuary state,” she said.

“The rule of law is not negotiable — it is the foundation of our safety, our freedom, and the promise of opportunity that defines America,” she added.

Earle-Sears’ broader ideas on immigration remain unclear, as she has not gone beyond a handful of public statements and her campaign website offers no issue page outlining her positions.

Dispute over Youngkin’s deportation claims

The candidates also diverge sharply on Youngkin’s claim in July that all 2,500 immigrants arrested and deported by the Virginia Homeland Security Task Force are “violent criminals.”

Spanberger said she has seen no evidence to support the governor’s sweeping assertion.

“If they were violent criminals, presumably, they were arrested on those charges for the violent crime that they committed, in which case, there would be clear documentation,” she said. “Frankly, as somebody who believes in upholding the law, I want people to be arrested for the crimes that they are committing.”

Civil rights groups have also raised alarms, arguing that Youngkin’s mandate is “playing politics with people’s lives.”

“For years, Virginia’s governor has been pushing the same dangerous, false narrative as the Trump administration that immigrants commit crime at higher rates than people who were born here, despite the fact that no data exists to support that conclusion,” the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia said in a statement.

Earle-Sears has not directly addressed the governor’s 2,500 figure but has frequently pointed to grim cases of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in arguing for tougher enforcement.

“We’ve seen too many tragic stories after dangerous criminals in this country illegally were put back on the streets, and this executive order will make sure we send them back to where they came from,” she said earlier this year.

The Laken Riley Act

The immigration debate has also touched on Spanberger’s record in Congress.

Earle-Sears has faulted her for initially voting against the Laken Riley Act, named for a Georgia college student killed by a Venezuelan national who entered the country unlawfully. The law, which eventually passed after Spanberger left Congress, requires federal authorities to detain immigrants accused of theft and burglary while their cases proceed.

Spanberger said she opposed the bill in its first iteration because it “was essentially putting incredible burdens on localities removing any form of due process” and would not have prevented Riley’s murder.

“As a mother of three daughters, I was deeply offended that they would utilize that young woman’s murder as a political talking point,” she said. “At the time of that vote, her father was in the press saying that he was deeply distressed by the fact that her murder was being utilized in the way that it was.”

David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said Spanberger has staked out a position that balances criticism of Trump-era immigration policies with support for reforms viewed as moderate.

“Spanberger has been fairly vocal in criticizing the Trump administration’s methods of dealing with undocumented immigration,” Richards said.

“Her voting record on bills centered around immigration has been mixed, supporting some of the more moderate bills, but voting ‘no’ on some key GOP bills like the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act. … It falls in line with her presenting herself as a pragmatic candidate.”

By contrast, he said, Earle-Sears has been relatively quiet on immigration, surfacing the issue primarily when it intersects with her biography or when amplifying President Donald Trump’s agenda.

“She did talk about the issue back in June, saying that she, as an immigrant, did things the ‘right way.’ But overall, she has skirted the issue,” Richards said.

“She may feel that the issue is not one she can really win with in Virginia, although, as more immigration related arrests happen in the commonwealth, she may have to start talking about this.”

The bigger picture

The fight over immigration in Virginia is inseparable from national politics. Youngkin has aligned himself closely with Trump on enforcement strategies, boasting of joint operations with ICE and staging press events around courthouse raids and “gang and immigration sweeps” that have drawn criticism from Democrats and civil liberties groups.

Spanberger, while denouncing Youngkin’s executive order, has also argued governors should play a more constructive role in pushing Congress to modernize immigration law. She cited bipartisan bills like the Farm Workforce Modernization Act and the Dignity Act as examples of incremental progress, even if they fell short.

“There are many places where the governors of states can bang on the table and tell Congress, ‘Stop making this such a political issue that you campaign on every two years and just fix it,’” she said.

She added that immigration is not only a humanitarian concern but also a pressing economic issue for Virginia, from hospitals seeking visas for foreign-trained nurses to seafood producers dependent on seasonal guest workers.

Earle-Sears, meanwhile, has emphasized border security and public safety, drawing a bright line between legal immigrants like herself and those who arrive unlawfully.

“Any local elected official who instructs law enforcement to defy efforts to keep Virginians safe abandons their duty and breaks the trust of the people they swore to protect,” she said last year.

Looking ahead

With polls showing immigration remains a top concern among Republican voters — and a complicated one among independents — the issue is likely to stay at the forefront of this year’s election cycle.

Spanberger is betting Virginians will see Youngkin’s executive order as overreach that diverts local resources and harms public safety by discouraging immigrant communities from reporting crimes. Earle-Sears is counting on voters to view strict enforcement as common sense, framed by her own story of navigating the legal immigration system.

“Maybe she is waiting for a Trump endorsement,” Richards said of Earle-Sears. “But if immigration remains in the headlines, she may not be able to avoid it.”

For now, voters face a stark choice between a Democrat who vows to unwind the governor’s crackdown and press Congress for broader reforms, and a Republican who pledges to double down on enforcement in the name of law and order.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4799.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:11.866218

The Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) and the Office of the Governor told KING 5 they’ve cut off the federal government’s ability to search a state database filled with vehicle licensing information.

The move comes after the KING 5 Investigators provided proof that ICE has misused state data to arrest undocumented residents. In Washington that’s against the law. The Keep Washington Working Act prohibits this kind of collaboration between state departments and ICE. The 2019 law states the federal government may not use state data to arrest and deport undocumented residents.

“I'm very concerned because this is explicitly what the Department of Licensing said it wasn't doing. Now we see that it is,” said Angelina Godoy with UW’s Center for Human Rights.

On Monday, officials at DOL told KING 5 the reporters were wrong – that ICE was not using the state’s database for immigration enforcement.

“The Department of Licensing has determined (the state database) was not used in {this} case. As part of (our information system), we can audit all searches made within the system. We confirmed no search was made,” wrote a DOL spokesperson.

On Tuesday night, state leaders changed their position. Representatives from DOL and the Office of the Governor told KING 5 further investigation found ICE did run an undocumented resident's license plate to verify he was the registered owner. That confirmation led to the man’s arrest.

“The terms of the agreement are very clear, as are the penalties for not following them. Even one violation is enough. It’s that important,” said Nathan Olson, DOL communications director.

DOL said it immediately took action and terminated ICE’s account. Both DOL and Governor Bob Ferguson’s Office thanked KING 5 for bringing it to their attention. They plan to notify legislators and community advocates of this breach of trust.

“Any entity using DOL data about our residents in a way we have expressly stated not to is counter to our mission and needs to be dealt with immediately,” Olson said.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/79533852-cd20-45eb-ad11-8a83ae1d9e78/20250827T060427/79533852-cd20-45eb-ad11-8a83ae1d9e78_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:42.877637

Last week, a federal district court in Tennessee denied an application to enjoin certain eligibility rules by plaintiff Derrin Boyd, a men’s basketball student-athlete. Boyd attended a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) institution for several years and argued that the inclusion of NAIA time in the membership’s “five-year” rule violated the antitrust laws. Rejecting Boyd’s request, the court noted how the facts here differed from those in the Pavia case, which was decided by the same Tennessee federal court (and judge):

“The major differences are: (1) Boyd has exhausted both the four years of intercollegiate competition and the five-year period of eligibility, whereas Pavia had one year remaining on the eligibility clock; (2) Boyd challenges the ‘counting’ of his years of attendance and competition at Georgetown College, a four-year degree granting institution that is a member of the NAIA whereas Pavia challenged the ‘counting’ of his years of competition at New Mexico Military Academy, a two-year junior college from which he could not earn a four-year degree; (3) Boyd challenges the Bylaw allowing waiver of the time-limits to eligibility; Pavia did not challenge that Bylaw.” (at 11)

Also last week, a federal court in West Virginia granted several football student-athletes’ request for a preliminary injunction enjoining the application of the five-year rule to the plaintiff student-athletes who had previously attended junior college institutions.

The varying court decisions on eligibility rules add weight to calls for a legislative response. Relatedly, time flies, and it’s been over a month since President Trump’s Executive Order regarding college sports, which included a direction to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission that action be taken in connection with “Legal Protections for College Athletics from Lawsuits” within 60 days of the order. We’ll keep you posted.

On August 22, a plaintiff initiated a class action lawsuit against SeatGeek, alleging that the popular ticket secondary market platform violated data privacy laws. In the complaint, the plaintiff argues that SeatGeek violated California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA)’s “trap and trace” provisions by installing trackers that provided user personal information to third parties without obtaining consent.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Wednesday that his department is taking management of Union Station, the main transportation hub in Washington, away from Amtrak.

Duffy said ahead of an appearance with Amtrak President Roger Harris at Union Station for the launch of the NextGen Acela, the rail service’s new high-speed train, that the building a short walk from the U.S. Capitol had “fallen into disrepair” when it should be a “point of pride.”

Duffy’s words echoed Trump, who said last week that he wants $2 billion from Congress to beautify Washington as part of his crackdown on the city.

As armed National Guard troops patrol the nation’s capital in an unprecedented federal takeover of Washington, D.C.’s police department, handling crime is now a relative strength for Trump, the poll found.

Americans are generally not happy about the Republican president’s handling of issues like immigration and the economy but are more positive about his tough-on-crime approach, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Indeed, the vast majority of Americans — 81% — see crime as a “major problem” in U.S. cities — a concern Trump seizes on with threats to expand National Guard deployments to cities across the country.

But the poll shows less public support for federal takeovers of local police departments, suggesting that opinions could shift, depending on how aggressively Trump pursues his threats.

The Danish Security and Intelligence Service responded to a request for comment by saying it believes that “particularly in the current situation, Greenland is a target for influence campaigns of various kinds” that could aim to create divisions in the relationship between Denmark and Greenland.

It said it “assesses that this could be done by exploiting existing or fabricated disagreements, for example in connection with well-known individual cases, or by promoting or amplifying certain viewpoints in Greenland regarding the Kingdom, the United States, or other countries with a particular interest in Greenland.”

The service, known by its Danish acronym PET, said that in recent years it has “continuously strengthened” its efforts and presence in Greenland in cooperation with authorities there, and will continue to do so.

“We are aware that foreign actors continue to show an interest in Greenland and its position in the Kingdom of Denmark,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a statement emailed Wednesday by his ministry. “It is therefore not surprising if we experience outside attempts to influence the future of the Kingdom in the time ahead.”

“Any attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of the Kingdom will of course be unacceptable,” Løkke Rasmussen said. “In that light, I have asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to summon the U.S. chargé d’affaires for a meeting at the Ministry.”

Cooperation between the governments of Denmark and Greenland “is close and based on mutual trust,” he added.

This isn’t the first time Danish leaders summoned the top U.S. diplomat for an explanation about alleged spying in Greenland. They did it in May, after the Wall Street Journal reported that high-ranking officials under Trump’s intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard had directed intelligence agency heads to learn more about Greenland’s independence movement and sentiment about U.S. resource extraction there.

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen spoke with The Associated Press the next day, saying “you cannot spy against an ally.” The embassy declined to comment on the summoning of Jennifer Hall Godfrey, acting head of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen.

Danish public broadcaster DR reported that government and security sources, which it didn’t name, believe that at least three Americans with connections to Trump have been carrying out covert influence operations in the territory.

One of those people allegedly compiled a list of U.S.-friendly Greenlanders, collected names of people opposed to Trump and got locals to point out cases that could be used to cast Denmark in a bad light in American media. Two others have tried to nurture contacts with politicians, businesspeople and locals, according to the report.

DR cited eight sources, who believe the goal is to weaken relations with Denmark from within Greenlandic society. DR said it had been unable to clarify whether the Americans were working on someone’s orders. The Associated Press could not independently confirm the report.

At 12:30 p.m. Eastern, the president is scheduled to have lunch with Vice President JD Vance at the White House.

Minneapolis student detained by ICE, deemed flight risk

What we know:

Lucero was detained while driving a car with several others inside, his attorney, Evangeline Dhawan-Maloney, tells FOX 9.

She said he did not appear to be the target, but was likely detained because he is not a U.S. citizen.

An immigration court judge denied his bond on the grounds that he is a flight risk because he does not have any relatives in the country who are here legally.

The decision means he will remain in custody at the Sherburne County Jail until his next court appearance, which could be months away, she said.

The backstory:

Lucero immigrated to the United States from Ecuador in 2020 when he was 14, Dhawan-Maloney said. She noted that he had applied for asylum, which is pending, and has a work permit, both of which she said allow him to stay in the country.

He is a student at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, where he studies international business on a full scholarship.

Demonstrators spread out around the building's perimeter to monitor each exit. They were there in hopes of slowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s ongoing efforts to detain migrants.

ICE has a field office in Eugene's federal building, and local immigration advocate say people have been being detained during regular check-ins.

""My friends and also family members have decided not to show up to their appointments because of being detained,"" said protestor Marbella Vasquez. ""Let it be known that we want ICE out of here—out of Lane County, out of Eugene, out of Oregon, everywhere.""

Just before 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, as protesters stood near the parking lot gates, a Department of Homeland Security vehicle began trying to exit to the street. Demonstrators initially refused to move.

A group of DHS officers then approached the crowd and told them to back up, before pushing some of them out of the way. KLCC captured that encounter on video.

Note: The video contains explicit language.

Less than an hour later, a law enforcement officer tried to exit the building in an unmarked car. Protestors demanded that person confirm whether there was anyone detained in the back seat, before letting the car proceed.

Rob Fisette, an organizer with the Lane County Immigrant Defense Network, said there's a back-and-forth between ICE and protestors, with each group adjusting their strategies week-after-week.

“When we're out here demonstrating, and we lose for the day, what that means generally, is that they take someone [into] the building and they kidnap them and they take them to Tacoma,"" said Fisette. ""And that's really visceral.""

Tacoma is home to a regional detention facility operated by ICE.

But Fisette said the the success of these protests is something that's harder to spot—the detainments that aren't happening.

""The real change is when ICE has to think harder about whether it's worth the trouble to try to detain people today,"" said Fisette. ""That's a larger benefit that we're bringing to the community.""

The number of ICE detentions in Eugene dropped sharply in July, after spiking the previous month, according to statistics cited by Lookout Eugene-Springfield.

Fisette said activists plan to be at the federal building the last Tuesday of every month, and whenever they receive word about a person facing deportation.

Also on Tuesday, protesters said DHS officials tackled and detained a person outside of the federal building. DHS didn't respond to a request for comment and clarification about the incident.

Monday's open letter to Congress — known as the ""Katrina Declaration"" — said it was signed by 191 current and former FEMA employees.
The ""Katrina Declaration"" was published as the United States marks the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.
The Trump administration has pushed for sweeping changes to FEMA.
""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said.","The Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday suspended more than 20 employees who signed an open letter arguing the Trump administration had undone years of post-Hurricane Katrina progress at the disaster relief agency, multiple sources told CBS News.

Monday's open letter to Congress — known as the ""Katrina Declaration"" — said it was signed by 191 current and former FEMA employees. Some 35 attached their names, while the rest said they withheld them over fear of retaliation.

Some of the current FEMA employees who used their names received emails on Tuesday night saying they had been placed on paid administrative leave ""effective immediately, and continuing until further notice,"" according to copies of the emails reviewed by CBS News.

""While on administrative leave, you will be in a non-duty status while continuing to receive pay and benefits,"" the letter read. The staffers were told not to visit FEMA facilities, access the department's telecommunication systems or carry out any of their official duties, aside from responding to inquiries from the Department of Homeland Security.

The agency also told staff that they must remain available to work during business hours.

The emails did not provide a reason for the decision. Staffers were told the move ""is not a disciplinary action and is not intended to be punitive.""

In a statement, FEMA called the signatories ""the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency"" and accused them of having ""forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy.""

""Our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems,"" FEMA continued. ""Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, FEMA will return to its mission of assisting Americans at their most vulnerable.""

The Washington Post was first to report on the suspensions.

The ""Katrina Declaration"" was published as the United States marks the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. The 2005 hurricane prompted major changes to the nation's disaster relief system — and Monday's letter argued many of those reforms could be reversed by the Trump administration.

The letter accuses President Trump of picking unqualified people to lead FEMA, and criticizes the administration for cutting the agency's workforce and terminating grants meant to help state and local governments harden their infrastructure to mitigate the impact of natural disasters.

The declaration said it hopes changes are made in time to ""prevent not only another national catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, but the effective dissolution of FEMA itself and the abandonment of the American people such an event would represent.""

The Trump administration has pushed for sweeping changes to FEMA. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested either ""getting rid of FEMA"" or ""fundamentally reforming"" the agency by pushing some of its duties to state governments. So far this year, the agency has lost roughly one-third of its staff through a combination of firings and voluntary departures.

FEMA acting press secretary Daniel Llargues responded to the letter Monday by defending the Trump administration's record of handling natural disasters and arguing FEMA was previously ""bogged down by red tape, inefficiency, and outdated processes.""

""The Trump Administration has made accountability and reform a priority so that taxpayer dollars actually reach the people and communities they are meant to help,"" Llargues said. ""It is not surprising that some of the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform. Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo. But our obligation is to survivors, not to protecting broken systems.""

“We need to keep our eyes on the nation’s prize and that’s a successful 2030 census that counts all communities equally well.
The Census Bureau needs the next four years to get that done.” Lowenthal warned that there’s been “radio silence” from the Census Bureau since the Trump’s administration’s return regarding a test scheduled for 2026 that will, in part, evaluate mailing and messaging strategies.
The experts also said how Congress resolves the Sept. 30 deadline to pass new government funding could impact 2030 Census planning.
Advocates who spoke during Tuesday’s briefing also expect that the Census Bureau will have more difficulties in getting the public to respond due to mistrust.","While President Donald Trump this month has suggested that he wants to have a mid-decade census that doesn’t include undocumented immigrants, census advocates are more concerned about the status of the government’s preparations for the decennial national population count in 2030.

“[Don’t] get distracted by these calls for a new census before the one that the law and the Constitution requires in 2030 because that proposal is neither feasible nor wise,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former Capitol Hill staffer and census expert, during a virtual briefing Tuesday that was hosted by the nonprofit the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “We need to keep our eyes on the nation’s prize and that’s a successful 2030 census that counts all communities equally well. The Census Bureau needs the next four years to get that done.”

Lowenthal warned that there’s been “radio silence” from the Census Bureau since the Trump’s administration’s return regarding a test scheduled for 2026 that will, in part, evaluate mailing and messaging strategies. She also said that community outreach and promotion for the test should have started this summer, but it’s unclear if the agency has done that due to a lack of public briefings and the elimination of its advisory committees.

“My census antennas are up, and I’m a bit worried about what we might see,” she said.

The experts also said how Congress resolves the Sept. 30 deadline to pass new government funding could impact 2030 Census planning. Steve Jost — a consultant for the Census Project, a network of organizations that rely on census data — cautioned that if lawmakers pass a long-term continuing resolution that funds agencies at their current levels, then that could hurt preparations.

“If it's a full-year CR, there are serious consequences to the planning for the 2030 operations,” he said. “We don't want to repeat what we had in the 2020 census when funding levels were delayed, frozen, CR-level flat lines, and that caused the Census Bureau to cancel their field tests and their dress rehearsals, which probably helped lead to some of those undercounts because the Census Bureau couldn't fully test its operations.”

The agency found that in 2020 it undercounted people who are Black, American Indian or Alaska Native living on a reservation, Hispanic or Latino or reported being another race.

Advocates who spoke during Tuesday’s briefing also expect that the Census Bureau will have more difficulties in getting the public to respond due to mistrust. Jost highlighted the Department of Government Efficiency’s access to and use of individuals’ government data as a possible source of distrust. Multiple speakers warned that ongoing attempts to ask about citizenship on the census, which Trump unsuccessfully tried to do during his first term, would lead to fewer people participating.

“Even though there was no citizenship question on the 2020 questionnaire, the debate around it raised significant doubts that we saw a significant decline in response rates among immigrant households and households with immigrant and mixed-status families,” said Arturo Vargas, who was the chair of the 2030 Census Advisory Committee before it was axed. “This contributed to a dramatic national undercount of the U.S. population. So continuing this conversation into 2030 will only solidify that wound in the Census Bureau's reputation and undermine its ability to be a credible agency to the public.”",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2025/08/26/082625_Getty_GovExec_Census/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 11:56:35.128464

Cullen and Wilkinson haven’t been the only GOP appointees to do so.","President Donald Trump’s second term has been marked by his administration’s attempts to bend or break the law and lashing out at judges who stand in the way. The administration’s remarks against judges led one of Trump’s own judicial appointees to speak out in a published opinion on Tuesday.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen noted that in recent months, executive officials and their spokespeople “have described federal district judges across the country as ‘left-wing,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘activists,’ ‘radical,’ ‘politically minded,’ ‘rogue,’ ‘unhinged,’ ‘outrageous, overzealous, [and] unconstitutional,’ ‘[c]rooked,’ and worse.”

Cullen, whom Trump appointed to the federal bench in Virginia during his first term, acknowledged that there has always been “some tension” between the branches of government.

But he wrote that “this concerted effort by the Executive to smear and impugn individual judges who rule against it is both unprecedented and unfortunate.”

The rebuke came in a footnote to his opinion rejecting an unusual lawsuit from the administration, which it filed against federal judges in Maryland for issuing orders preventing immigration officials from immediately deporting people who file habeas corpus petitions challenging their confinement.

Cullen’s ruling comes amid the administration’s latest attempt to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom it illegally sent to El Salvador in March.

“Much as the Executive fights the characterization, a lawsuit by the executive branch of government against the judicial branch for the exercise of judicial power is not ordinary,” Cullen wrote in dismissing the case, adding: “Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns.”

Cullen’s ruling comes amid the administration’s latest attempt to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom it illegally sent to El Salvador in March and only returned him to the U.S. in June after resisting court orders to do so. His latest litigation is now playing out in Maryland.

Notably, Cullen cited the Abrego case in his ruling Tuesday. Specifically, he cited an opinion from April by appellate Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a Reagan appointee who has likewise called out the administration’s actions.

Cullen and Wilkinson haven’t been the only GOP appointees to do so. It’s unlikely they’ll be the last.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/25-826-ice-agent-ch-1117-b6bb08.jpg",N,,2025-08-27 13:02:57.111957

But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk and the court itself.

“This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision.
Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.","A federal judge Tuesday threw out what he called a “novel and potentially calamitous” attempt by the Trump administration to sue the entire federal court bench in Maryland over an order that put a two-day pause on deportations.

When a party disagrees with a court action, there is “a tried-and-true recourse,” wrote Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia — file an appeal. But the Trump administration, when faced with a standing immigration order it didn’t like, instead sued all 15 federal district court judges in Maryland, the court clerk and the court itself.

Given recent conflicts between the White House and the courts, “it’s no surprise that the Executive chose a different, and more confrontational, path entirely,” wrote Cullen, who was nominated by Trump in 2019. “Instead of appealing any one of the affected habeas cases or filing a rules challenge with the Judicial Council, the Executive decided to sue—and in a big way.”

But judges enjoy broad immunity for judicial acts, wrote Cullen in a 37-page ruling, adding that when co-equal branches of government are involved, “there is no right—express or implied — to litigate that grievance in this manner.”

“Whatever the merits of its grievance with the judges of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the Executive must find a proper way to raise those concerns,” wrote Cullen, who was assigned the case because of the conflict of Maryland judges hearing it.

Abrego Garcia detained by ICE; judge orders delay of deportation to Uganda

The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Judge George L. Russell III, the chief judge of the Maryland district and the prime target of the administration’s lawsuit.

It was Russell’s order in May that sparked the lawsuit. Faced with a flood of habeas corpus petitions from immigrants facing deportation under the administration’s amped-up immigration enforcement, Russell ordered that deportations of those petitioning the court would be put on hold for at least two days, so that judges could schedule and review their cases.

On June 25, the Justice Department announced that it filed a complaint against the Maryland District Court judges, arguing that they had exceeded their authority with the 48-hour freeze on deportations because it interefered with the administration’s exclusive right to enforce immigration law.

“President Trump’s executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a written statement at the time. “The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.”

But Cullen agreed with the Maryland judges that the Trump administration chose the wrong avenue to raise its issues with Russell’s order.

“If these arguments were made in the proper forum, they might well get some traction,” Cullen said. “And under normal circumstances, it would not be surprising if the Executive raised these concerns through the channels Congress prescribed — that is, by challenging the orders as applied to a particular habeas proceeding through a direct appeal to the Fourth Circuit or, as expressly authorized by federal statute, by petitioning the Judicial Council of the Fourth Circuit, which has the authority to rescind or modify local court rules.”

“All of this isn’t to say that the Executive is without any recourse; far from it,” Cullen wrote. “If the Executive truly believes that Defendants’ standing orders violate the law, it should avail itself of the tried-and-true recourse available to all federal litigants: It should appeal.”

Mark Graber, regents professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, believes that the case was more of a stunt than an earnest legal challenge from the Trump administration.

“Issuing an injunction against judges is a guaranteed loser,” he said. “What the Trump people were trying to accomplish may simply to have been noise and publicity … Whether they really thought they could ever win this case is doubtful — and if somebody thought that they should ever win that case, that person should be fired for incompetence.”

Graber said that allowing the case to move forward would have “fundamentally changed the way our judicial system works.”

“The implications would be startling,” he said. “This is the executive branch suing the federal judges in Maryland because they don’t like a decision. That’s not the way the separation of powers works. There’s a judicial system; it has a way of correcting errors – it’s called appeals.”

Graber compared the case to being charged for a crime in Maryland and then asking a judge in another state to issue an injunction against the judge who handed down the sentence.

“This is Law 101 — it is Law 101 to the point where virtually all non-lawyers know this,” he said.

Ironically, he noted, the Trump administration could appeal the decision to dismiss, or could go back and appeal the original standing order.

“What the Trump administration is claiming – and this is not a horrible legal argument – is that the court could only issue orders with respect to the people before the court,” Graber said.

“There’s a legitimate debate on this, and if they appealed it, who knows what the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court would have done?” he said. “The problem is they didn’t appeal it in the normal way.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-2048x1720.jpg,N,,2025-08-27 13:02:24.909841
