Lawyers Weekly Staff,,,,,https://masslawyersweekly.com/2025/12/29/immigration-asylum-small-business-owner/,"… “We turn first to the petitioners’ asylum applications.
The petitioners cannot establish that their past persecution or fear of future persecution is on account of a protected ground, so their asylum claims must fail.
The petitioners’ proposed group — ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ — is not meaningfully different from prior groups we have rejected that are defined by economic status or perceived wealth.
Instead, Lopez argues that her identity as a small business owner is an immutable characteristic core to her identity because it allowed her to escape the discrimination she suffered due to her dismembered finger and because the hardware business was a family business.
Because we affirm the BIA’s holding as to the asylum claims, we also reject the petitioners’ withholding of removal claims.","Where the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed an immigration judge’s order denying applications for asylum, the BIA’s decision should be upheld because the petitioners cannot establish that their past persecution or fear of future persecution is based on a protected ground.

“Edwin David Ramos-Hernandez, his wife Sheyly Cristabel Lopez, and their minor daughter D.Z.R.L. petition for review of a December 11, 2024, decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (‘BIA’), which affirmed an Immigration Judge’s (‘IJ’) order denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (‘CAT’). … We deny the petition and explain why the agency’s ruling was supported by substantial evidence and committed no error of law. …

“Ramos-Hernandez, Lopez, and D.Z.R.L. are citizens of Guatemala who entered the United States on September 8, 2021. …

“We turn first to the petitioners’ asylum applications. …

“Substantial evidence supports the IJ’s determinations against the petitioners. The petitioners cannot establish that their past persecution or fear of future persecution is on account of a protected ground, so their asylum claims must fail. …

“The BIA did not err in affirming the IJ’s determinations that ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ is not a cognizable [particular social group (PSG)] and that the petitioners had failed to show a nexus between the harm they experienced and their second proposed PSG, ‘the Lopez-Ramos-Hernandez nuclear family.’ …

“This court has held that proposed PSGs similar to ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ are not cognizable because they are overly broad and do not implicate an immutable characteristic. …

“We reject the petitioners’ arguments that they fall into exceptions to these rulings. The petitioners’ proposed group — ‘Guatemalan small business owners’ — is not meaningfully different from prior groups we have rejected that are defined by economic status or perceived wealth. The petitioners do not address this caselaw. Instead, Lopez argues that her identity as a small business owner is an immutable characteristic core to her identity because it allowed her to escape the discrimination she suffered due to her dismembered finger and because the hardware business was a family business. However, the record does not compel the conclusion that being a small business owner was fundamental to Lopez’s identity because she studied to be and initially sought employment as a teacher in Guatemala, and she has since worked at a daycare and as a house cleaner in the United States. The petitioners further argue that if their identities as small business owners were not immutable, they ‘would not have operated the business, even as the extortion demands and threats began.’ This argument is circular and, in any event, they testified that they did close down the business shortly after the extortion began.

“Substantial evidence also supports the IJ’s determination that the petitioners failed to establish a nexus between their experienced harm and their membership in the ‘Lopez-Ramos-Hernandez nuclear family.’ The record reflects that the family was extorted because they operated a successful hardware business, not because of kinship itself. Lopez’s own testimony confirms this point, as she was concerned about returning to Guatemala because there ‘have been a lot of attacks happening’ and ‘there is a lot of violence’ — not because of her status as a Lopez-Ramos-Hernandez family member. As our caselaw has repeatedly established, the mere fact that members of the same family were harmed does not establish that the family connection was a central motivation for the suffered harm. …

“Additionally, the agency did not err in finding that the petitioners had not been targeted on account of their anti-gang political views. …

“The BIA also did not err in affirming the IJ’s determination that petitioners failed to establish past persecution. …

“Here, the evidence consists of two to three relatively vague threats and one physical attack that may or may not have been connected to those threats. The IJ had reason to believe that the attack against Ramos-Hernandez was not necessarily related to the prior extortion, particularly given the inconsistency in the record over when the incident occurred and the lack of evidence regarding motive. This court has found that even more severe situations did not constitute persecution. …

“Similarly, substantial evidence supports that the petitioners failed to establish a well founded fear of future persecution. … Given that the petitioners closed their store and remained in Guatemala for approximately two years after receiving the threats with no further incidents, they have not presented credible, direct, and specific evidence supporting a fear of individualized future persecution. Because they have not established membership in a PSG, the petitioners also have not shown a pattern or practice of persecution of a similarly situated group on account of a protected ground. …

“… The petitioners here have not presented additional specific evidence explaining why they cannot relocate, beyond general conditions of corruption and violence in Guatemala. …

“The burden of proof required for withholding of removal is higher than that for asylum. Therefore, ‘a noncitizen who cannot meet the lower asylum standard will necessarily fail to make out a counterpart claim under the higher standard for withholding of removal.’ López-Pérez v. Garland, 26 F.4th 104, 111 (1st Cir. 2022). Because we affirm the BIA’s holding as to the asylum claims, we also reject the petitioners’ withholding of removal claims. …

“As to their CAT claims, the agency correctly determined that the petitioners did not meet their burden of presenting a preponderance of the evidence showing that if they returned to Guatemala, they ‘would be subject to torture by or with the acquiescence of a government official.’ … Substantial evidence supported the IJ’s conclusion that there was no objectively reasonable basis to believe that the petitioners would be harmed at all upon their return to Guatemala, given that they lived peacefully without incident for more than a year after closing their business. In light of that finding, the record does not compel the conclusion that the petitioners would face torture by anyone upon their return. Similarly, the IJ’s factual finding in the context of the petitioners’ asylum claims that they had failed to establish that relocation in Guatemala would be unreasonable also supports denial of their CAT claims. …

“For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the decision of the BIA is denied.”

While community defense efforts in large urban metropolises such as Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, and Portland have attracted the most media coverage, anti-ICE activity is also thriving in Republican-controlled states like Texas and North Carolina.

Many grassroots groups in conservative-leaning states are documenting their own work on Instagram, using social media accounts as hubs to update local communities on ICE activity, recruit volunteers, and announce trainings. They may face a more challenging terrain than those organizing in Democratic-controlled states, given the active collaboration of law enforcement agencies with ICE.

While red state anti-ICE organizing may be less likely to feature whistles, bullhorns, and other confrontational tactics seen in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, common themes are emerging, consistent with organizing in liberal cities. The anti-ICE playbook in red states involves creating a hotline for residents to report ICE activity, “Know Your Rights” sessions that give people legal advice on what information they should withhold when confronted by ICE, and ICE-watch trainings for observers documenting arrests. Many groups are also ensuring that the families of those arrested and detained have legal and financial support.

This non-comprehensive roundup of anti-ICE activities is an indication of how widespread resistance to fascism became in 2025.

North Carolina

In North Carolina cities such as Raleigh and Charlotte, a grassroots organization called Siembra NC is leading efforts to protect community members from ICE. Siembra NC was founded in 2017 in direct response to the first Trump administration and offers a hotline for residents reporting ICE arrests, as well as abusive employers and landlords. If ICE agents attempt to enter people’s home or car, Siembra NC advises locking the door and starting a livestream on social media to document the interaction.

In an Instagram post in mid-November, Siembra NC also documented its members showing up outside grocery stores in Charlotte when ICE agents arrested shoppers. Volunteers who were trained as part of Siembra NC’s “Safe to Work, Safe to School” patrols ensured that those being arrested were informed of their right to remain silent and knew not to sign any documents.

In a piece for Teen Vogue, Siembra NC’s co-executive director Nikki Marín Baena explained how her organization began training people in the parking lots of immigrant neighborhoods on how to identify ICE agents. “After a volunteer confirmed an officer’s identity, they would alert neighbors to the agent’s presence, and our dispatch team would send a text message to our contacts in the area,” she wrote. Siembra NC’s efforts are effective. According to Baena, “in every case we worked on, when the agents realized they were being watched, they abandoned their stakeout.”

Having learned how to respond to anti-immigrant attacks in Trump’s first term, Siembra NC has published a downloadable playbook as part of its “Defend and Recruit” campaign, and on July 23, held a virtual event specifically designed for organizers in red states engaged in ICE-watch activities.

Pennsylvania

The People’s Defense Front (PDF) in Northern Appalachia, which is located in central Pennsylvania, offers community defense trainings against “police violence, landlord cruelty, white supremacists and abusive bigots.” Its Instagram account documents the August 19 arrests of 26 workers by ICE agents and state troopers. Labeling the effort as “Know Your Enemy,” PDF published photos of those armed agents and asked community members for help in identifying them.

PDF offers a Centre County Rapid Response Network hotline for community members to report ICE activity, and recruits volunteers to sign up for and get trained in conducting anti-ICE patrols. “We patrol every morning and night,” said the group in an online post, and “maintain close contact with workers and the community.”

PDF is also collaborating with the Student Committee for Defense and Solidarity (SCDS) in State College where Penn State’s campus is located, and where ICE activity was documented in July 2025. SCDS explained in a post that, “In confronting ICE through our patrols, we raise the cost of ICE’s violence with the aim to undercut their power and deter their presence in the area.”

Texas

In Dallas and Fort Worth, Vecinos Unidos DFW is holding “Know Your Rights” and ICE-watch trainings, and organizing people by neighborhoods. “People who know both how to defend their rights and how immigration agents are operating nearby are less likely to be separated from their families,” said the group on Instagram. Like many other organizations, they have a community defense hotline that people can call to report ICE activity.

Vecinos Unidos DFW also began a court watch program after immigrants were arrested when they showed up to their court dates. The grassroots organization is calling on local residents to be present at immigration hearings. “With ICE activity picking up in our area,” said Vecinos Unidos DFW on Instagram, “it’s crucial to stay vigilant and learn our rights to protect ourselves and our neighbors.” The group is also organizing people to prevent Dallas police from cooperating with ICE agents, and raising funds as mutual aid for immigrant families who have been separated by detention and deportation.

Alabama

The Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, along with other organizations local to Birmingham, has set up an ICE-watch program called Bham Migra Watch, alerting local communities of the locations, times, and dates of ICE arrests.

In September 2025, after dozens of people were arrested in Russellville, Franklin County, on their way to work, the group urged people to call their hotline with any information or requests for legal and other help.

Bham Migra Watch also informs residents of their rights if they are approached by ICE agents, and recruits volunteers to sign up for trainings for “all Birmingham friends interested in fighting against ICE aggression,” and for those located in Montgomery and Montevallo to “fight for the community around you.”

Florida

Defensa Gulf Coast is a Florida-centered effort in and around Pensacola, describing itself as a group “formed to defend our immigrant neighbors against the racist deportation machine.” Operating out of the “Pensacola Liberation Center,” Defensa Gulf Coast has participated in efforts to shut down the notorious immigrant jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” and, like other groups, established a hotline to report ICE sightings.

Tennessee

An effort centered in Nashville called Music City Migra Watch is encouraging local residents to carefully document ICE activity and send it to them. The group conducts ICE-watch and court-watch trainings “meant to empower our community, build safety, and support those who need it most.” It also supports trainings in surrounding localities including Springfield, Murfreesboro, and Mount Juliet. Beyond local community defense, Music City Migra Watch is leading a boycott of Avelo Airlines, a company known for collaborating with ICE to transport arrested immigrants.

Looking Toward Resistance in 2026

Given the increasing number of U.S. citizens caught in ICE’s dragnet, organizers are warning that attacks on immigrants are just the beginning. Siembra NC’s Baena issued a challenge to those who want ICE out of their communities, saying, “How many of us would it take to put the focus on the attacks that will touch nearly every American, not simply those terrorizing immigrants?”

After a year of ICE violence, groups like hers are bracing themselves for increased staffing at the federal agency and a greater armed presence on city streets. The 2025 “Know Your Rights” sessions and trainings on anti-ICE defense offer a strong foundation for local communities to ramp up activism in many forms. “We are more ready than ever if ICE accomplishes its goal of hiring 600 percent more officers,” said Baena.

And readiness means expanding activities from the streets to the halls of power. “In 2026 we are going to switch from ‘defense’ to ‘offense,’ ensuring we don’t simply watch out for ICE agents but create the conditions necessary to hold elected officials accountable for guaranteeing dignity for everyone in our state,” Baena promised.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2246351093.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 13:57:12.372348

Shortly after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Doan, a staunch Democrat, lost his job as a software engineer with a company that produces video game competitions.","How has President Trump done over the course of 2025?

For some voters, 2025 was a great year for the country. For others, it was a depressing, unaffordable slog. And one person definitely regretted his vote.

The Times asked voters whom we have followed over the last 18 months just what they thought of the last year.

Almost everyone agreed that the year was big and chaotic. After that, they splinter in some interesting and surprising ways.

The mayor of the small border town of Roma, Jaime Escobar Jr. said he believes Mr. Trump has made strides in his first year in office to control border crossings.

Mr. Escobar, a longtime Democrat, voted for Mr. Trump after years of what he described as chaos at the border.

“I think Trump is doing a good job,” he said. “He just needs more time.”

When it comes to the economy, he said he is confident that Mr. Trump can improve affordability if Republicans can keep control of Congress after the midterms. Gas prices, he said, have already come down.

“I see steady progress,” Mr. Escobar said.

Mr. Escobar is not without criticism.

“I’ve always been very pro-law enforcement,” he said. But he added that he is troubled by some of the videos and photographs of ICE agents aggressively detaining migrants. He hopes to see more humane treatment of migrants with long ties to the United States who do not have criminal records.

“The only thing that matters to him is himself.”

Erwin McKone, 55, Flint, Mich.

Erwin McKone, who works in agribusiness sales, voted for Mr. Trump last November, a bit reluctantly. He describes himself as a moderate who felt Democrats had failed to control the southern border.

But he is alarmed over Mr. Trump’s actions in 2025.

Mr. McKone said he thinks the administration’s approach to border security has been needlessly draconian.

His top concerns, however, are the president’s rhetoric, narcissism and the transactional nature of his politics, he said. “The only thing that matters to him is himself,” he said. “And then maybe the people who pay the bills.”

He worries about what the years ahead may bring. “There are times that I struggle to remain positive when I look at this administration and how the United States and our Constitution and Congress and the Senate are changing,” he said.

— Ernesto Londoño

Matthew Dugie, a union construction worker, agonized over his vote before casting his ballot for Kamala Harris. He regretted it almost immediately.

“I wasted a vote,” he said.

He is a rare voter — a 2020 Trump supporter who voted for Ms. Harris in 2024.

But he is largely happy with Mr. Trump’s approach to his second term. He gives Mr. Trump credit for imposing tariffs to try to bring back domestic manufacturing, and said he feels that a bold chief executive is now running the country.

“He’s got answers, and he’s got direction, and he’s more of a leader,” Mr. Dugie said.

He disagrees with Mr. Trump’s strikes on boats in the Caribbean and does not want to see the United States start a war in Venezuela.

But he has plenty of construction work from hospitals and data centers, and says his retirement account is up about 11 percent since last year.

And this year, he said, he even indulged in a four-day trip to Las Vegas.

— Jack Healy

“I think it’s going to be a long three years.”

Sharon Reed, 78, with her husband, Bob Reed, 79, Central Pennsylvania

For Bob and Sharon Reed, both retired schoolteachers, the issue with Mr. Trump all along has been less about what he plans to do and more about how he does it.

They are Republicans, and mostly agree with the president’s goals, like shrinking the government and strengthening the border. That is why they voted for him, with reservations.

But it’s Mr. Trump’s bulldozing style that is their problem: the scale and speed of his actions, the rhetoric that accompanies them and the turmoil that inevitably follows.

The Reeds, for instance, support weeding out government fraud, but Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency “didn’t go after the fraud,” Ms. Reed said. “They just fired people.”

They support strengthened immigration enforcement, but not ICE’s aggressive tactics that meant “some innocent people get swept up with it,” Mr. Reed said.

Their list goes on.

Still Mr. Reed is, on balance, pleased enough. “I think he’s trying to work for the betterment of the country,” Mr. Reed said.

Ms. Reed is not so pleased.

She does not regret her vote, given her options, but she just keenly hopes for better choices the next time around.

“I think it’s going to be a long three years,” she said.

— Campbell Robertson

Though she voted for Kamala Harris, Veronica McCloud believed Mr. Trump deserved support from all Americans and she was willing to give him a chance.

Ms. McCloud, a retired English teacher, said she even found herself agreeing with some of the president’s decisions. But his manner was the issue. Ms. McCloud, for instance, supported trimming government waste, but thought the widespread firing of federal employees was callous and reckless. She believes in securing the country’s borders and deporting criminals, but the images of ICE agents aggressively rounding up immigrants, including children, left her heartbroken.

“So much fighting and pointing fingers,” she said. “And the president is always blaming Biden, always looking backward.”

“I am disappointed, particularly with the way he speaks to women and women of color,” she added. “The name calling has to stop.”

She said she has been most affected by the rising cost of food. She rarely buys beef now.

“Going to the grocery store is miserable,” she said. “I find myself going aisle by aisle and saying ‘I will wait on this for the next paycheck.’”

— Audra D. S. Burch

“I wish we could have a president that is doing what Trump is doing, but one that is not so divisive.”

Perry Hunter, 56, Sellersburg, Ind.

Perry Hunter, a high school teacher who voted for Mr. Trump, has been pleased with nearly all of the president’s decisions, including the aggressive way he has handled deportations, his demolition of the East Wing of the White House and his attacks on Venezuelan boats allegedly carrying drugs.

And he said that Democrats just don’t want to agree with Mr. Trump on anything.

“If he said drinking Drano was bad for you, there would be people going on to drink Drano, just to prove him wrong,” he said.

But he doesn’t like that Mr. Trump has been rude — especially when commenting about the killing of the filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.

“I wish we could have a president that is doing what Trump is doing,” he said, “but one that is not so divisive.”

— Juliet Macur

Annabelle Collins, an independent who supported Ms. Harris, has mixed feelings about the past year. “Not every aspect was horrible,” she said.

As a Venezuelan immigrant who moved to the United States as a child, she is against the Trump administration’s tactics for detaining undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for decades.

“There has to be a better way to do those things,” Ms. Collins, 37, said.

At the same time, she said, President Trump’s aggressive immigration policy has helped her husband, who is a border patrol agent.

“I know he’s in a safer place,” she said.

— Christina Morales

“It’s been slow change.”

Charles Vaughters, 25, Laramie, Wyo.

Charles Vaughters, a Marine veteran and college student who considers himself conservative, says that the country has improved — but just “marginally.”

“It’s been slow change,” he said. “It takes a long time to steer the ship.”

He said Mr. Trump could do a better job at deporting migrants who arrived in the country illegally and that ICE “needs to ramp up its numbers.”

He also does not support Mr. Trump’s decision in September to continue H-1B visas, meant for foreign workers who fill specialized roles, even with a new $100,000 fee per worker.

He thinks the program should be ended. His friends who are computer science majors, he said, are worried about finding jobs.

“I don’t think Trump’s ever going to do that,” he said, “because he has a lot of friends in big tech who benefit immensely from that program.”

— Juliet Macur

When asked what words sum up the first year of the second Trump term, Sam Consiglio did not hesitate.

“Uncertainty, confusion and disorderly,” said Ms. Consiglio, 22, a moderate Democrat who voted for Kamala Harris in 2024. “In the past year, we don’t really know what to expect as citizens.”

On top of that, she added, “a lot of the problems that we had a year ago are still problems today,” citing the price of groceries.

But the tone from the White House troubles her most. To Ms. Consiglio, a president should be a steadying force: “One who calms those nerves,” she said.

Mr. Trump’s behavior, however, is “very different from what you would expect from a president.”

— Kurt Streeter

For Thien Doan, there is no doubt that life feels much worse than it was a year ago. Shortly after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Doan, a staunch Democrat, lost his job as a software engineer with a company that produces video game competitions. To save money, he rented out his condo and moved in with family. It took him about six months to land a new position, but he still has not moved back into his own home.

“The job market out there is just really, really bad.”

The lawmakers warned that the proposed rule would create widespread fear and confusion within immigrant communities, leading families to avoid medical care, nutrition assistance and housing support even when they qualify under federal law.
The lawmakers cited recent legislation, including the 2025 reconciliation law, which deliberately preserved access to key public programs for specific immigrant populations.
For these reasons, the legislators urged the Trump administration to abandon the proposed rule and retain the 2022 regulations that align with congressional intent, protect public health and ensure that families are not punished for accessing lawful, life sustaining assistance.
Several New York City agencies have also publicly condemned the proposed rule, citing concerns about its potential impact on public health, housing stability and immigrant well being.","Senior immigration leaders in the United States Senate and House of Representatives have strongly criticized a proposed rule by President Donald Trump that would penalize Caribbean and other immigrant families for lawfully accessing health care, food assistance and housing support.

In a formal regulatory comment submitted to the United States Department of Homeland Security, the lawmakers opposed the proposed Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility rule, warning that it unlawfully rewrites longstanding immigration law and would discourage immigrant families from using essential public benefits to which they are legally entitled.

The comment was submitted by Congressman Jamie Raskin, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security and Enforcement, Congressman Robert Scott, Ranking Member of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Senator Dick Durbin, Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Alex Padilla, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration, and Senators Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden.

The lawmakers argued that the proposal seeks to bypass congressional authority by altering the definition of public charge, a term that for more than one hundred and thirty five years has applied only to individuals who are primarily dependent on government assistance for subsistence. They warned that a public charge determination can directly affect an immigrant’s eligibility to enter or remain in the United States.

According to the legislators, the Trump administration’s proposal would penalize immigrants for using supplemental benefits such as health care, nutrition assistance and housing programs that Congress intentionally made available to support working families. They stated that the Department of Homeland Security is attempting to administratively redefine public charge in violation of congressional intent, despite repeated legislative decisions rejecting such changes.

The members noted that Congress has revised immigration law multiple times without ever expanding the definition of public charge to include the lawful use of non cash benefits. They emphasized that federal agencies have long recognized programs such as Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and housing assistance as tools that promote public health, food security and housing stability, enabling families to remain economically self sufficient.

The lawmakers warned that the proposed rule would create widespread fear and confusion within immigrant communities, leading families to avoid medical care, nutrition assistance and housing support even when they qualify under federal law. They noted that the Department of Homeland Security itself acknowledged in the proposed rule that the policy could result in poorer health outcomes, increased poverty, housing instability and greater reliance on emergency rooms for basic care. These impacts, they said, would extend beyond immigrant households to affect communities across the United States.

They further stated that Congress has consistently determined immigrant access to public benefits through eligibility rules rather than by penalizing individuals for adjusting their immigration status based on lawful benefit use. The lawmakers cited recent legislation, including the 2025 reconciliation law, which deliberately preserved access to key public programs for specific immigrant populations.

For these reasons, the legislators urged the Trump administration to abandon the proposed rule and retain the 2022 regulations that align with congressional intent, protect public health and ensure that families are not punished for accessing lawful, life sustaining assistance.

Zachary Segal, a BU undergraduate student, became the target of harassment after posting on X that he contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to report what he believed to be violations of federal immigration law.

There is nothing unlawful about reporting suspected violations of federal law. Yet, thousands of individuals, including fellow BU students, sent Mr. Segal threatening messages and covered campus with posters labeling Segal a “racist and fascist.” One poster displayed across the campus states that people like Segal have “no place” on BU’s campus.

Mr. Segal received multiple death threats, including messages stating, “If I ever see you i’m [expletive] killing you and leaving ur dead body on the sidewalk”; “I’ll be waiting outside your little event tonight”; and “We’re coming for you.” One message referenced the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, threatening, “Here’s to hoping you’re the next to get Kirked.”

Rather than defend Segal, Boston University instructed Segal not to attend classes and placed the burden on him to arrange academic accommodations himself, effectively admitting it could not ensure his safety on campus. At the same time, BU officials issued critical public statements and refused to condemn the threats or announce concrete safety measures.

Boston University’s response violates its duty of care under Massachusetts law and contradicts its own published commitments to protect free expression and protect students from harassment. Because the University has acknowledged it cannot safely accommodate Mr. Segal in Boston, AFL has demanded a reasonable accommodation — allowing him to transfer to Boston University’s Washington, D.C. program for the remainder of his education.

“Universities cannot claim to support free speech while allowing students to face death threats for expressing political opinions,” said Emily Percival, Senior Counsel at America First Legal. “Boston University must protect its students, not force them into hiding.”

A state court in Tennessee ruled in favor of Democratic officials who sued to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis.
The Trump administration has appealed the California and Oregon rulings to the 9th U.S.","The Supreme Court last week decided not to overrule a lower court decision that blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area.

Justices on Dec. 23 declined the Trump administration’s emergency request to overturn the earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge April Perry. In her ruling, Perry said the Trump administration had no power to use troops to support its immigration crackdown.

Last Tuesday’s ruling was the second defeat for the president’s effort to send troops to assist in its anti-immigration campaign. An appeals court earlier also refused to overturn Perry’s ruling.

Justices heard arguments in the case more than two months ago. The high court order is not a final ruling but it could affect other lawsuits challenging President Donald Trump’s efforts to deploy the military in other Democratic-led cities.

“At this preliminary stage, the government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the high court majority wrote.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, said he narrowly agreed with the decision to keep the Chicago deployment blocked.

Three conservative justices — Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — publicly dissented.

The outcome was a rare Supreme Court setback for Trump, who had won repeated victories in emergency appeals since he resumed residence in the White House in January.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker applauded Tuesday’s decision as a win for the state and country.

“American cities, suburbs, and communities should not have to face masked federal agents asking for their papers, judging them for how they look or sound, and living in fear that the President can deploy the military to their streets,” he said.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson defended Trump’s decision to activate the National Guard to protect federal personnel and property from “violent rioters.”

Alito and Thomas said in their dissent that the court had no basis to reject Trump’s contention that the administration needed the troops to enforce immigration laws. Gorsuch said he would have narrowly sided with the government based on the declarations of federal law enforcement officials.

The administration originally sought the order to allow the deployment of 300 troops from Illinois and 200 from Texas.

The Trump administration argued that the troops were needed “to protect federal personnel and property from violent resistance against the enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

In her ruling, Perry wrote that she found no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois and no reason to believe the protests there had gotten in the way of Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Perry initially blocked deployment for two weeks. But in October, she extended the order indefinitely while the Supreme Court reviewed the case.

The Illinois case is the first one of several state legal challenges over National Guard deployments to be ruled on by the high court.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb is suing to halt the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen in the nation’s capital.

A federal judge in Oregon has permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there, and all 200 troops from California were being sent home from Oregon, an official said.

A state court in Tennessee ruled in favor of Democratic officials who sued to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis.

In California, a lower court judge in September said deployment in the Los Angeles area was illegal.

Our Investment Funds Team breaks down the potential impact of the Court’s decision on funds and market participants.

The ruling could increase litigation risk for funds and fund sponsors

Investors could challenge a wide range of fund contracts, including governance and advisory arrangements

The lack of clear time limits could expose older agreements to renewed challenges

On December 10, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in FS Credit Opportunities Corp. v. Saba Capital Master Fund Ltd. to resolve a circuit split over whether investors have a private right of action under Section 47(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The case centers on closed-end fund bylaws adopting Maryland “control-share” voting limitations and has broad implications for funds that fall, directly and indirectly, under the 1940 Act.

The Supreme Court granted certiorari to decide whether Section 47(b) of the 1940 Act includes an implied private right of action allowing private litigants to seek rescission of contracts that allegedly violate the 1940 Act. The question comes to the Court following decisions in the Second Circuit that recognize a private right of action, in contrast to decisions from the Third and Ninth Circuits, which have found no private right of action under Section 47(b).

By resolving this circuit split, the Court’s decision could materially affect investors’ ability to sue funds directly over allegedly unlawful contracts.

Litigation Background

The dispute stems from challenges brought by Saba Capital to several closed-end funds organized under Maryland law. Those funds adopted bylaws opting into certain voting rights provisions under the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act (MCSAA). Under the MCSAA, once a shareholder acquires at least 10% of a fund’s shares, the shareholder is prohibited from voting shares above that threshold unless two-thirds of the remaining shareholders affirmatively approve the additional voting rights.

Saba Capital filed a declaratory judgment action in the Southern District of New York, asserting that the voting rights provisions violated Section 18(i) of the 1940 Act, which requires that every share of stock issued by a fund subject to the Act be a voting stock with equal voting rights.

Before Saba’s suit, the Second Circuit held as an issue of first impression in Oxford University Bank v. Lansuppe Feeder LLC that the 1940 Act contains an implied private right of action for rescission under Section 47(b). Relying on that precedent, the district court granted summary judgment in Saba’s favor, rescinded the challenged contracts, and found that the voting rights provisions violated the 1940 Act. On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed, creating a split with the Third and Ninth Circuits.

Key Legal Issues Before the Court

The Supreme Court granted review to decide whether Section 47(b) of the 1940 Act contains an implied private right of action for rescission.

Recent Supreme Court precedent has closely scrutinized statutory language and required unambiguous congressional intent to create a private right of action. The Court may also address the applicability of its decision in Transamerica Mortgage Advisors v. Lewis, which found an implied right of action for rescission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, a statute enacted with the 1940 Act.

The parties and amici have advanced competing views on whether Section 47(b) supports a private right of action.

Potential Implications for Market Participants

A decision recognizing a private right of action under Section 47(b) could materially expand funds’ litigation exposure. As amici, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have argued to the Supreme Court, with an implied private right of action, private litigants would likely have the opportunity to challenge a vast array of an investment company’s contracts, including governance documents and bylaws, advisory and sub-advisory agreements, securities issuances, and contracts with service providers and other third parties.

The decision could also affect shareholder engagement dynamics for closed-end funds and business development companies (BDCs) and could indirectly affect private fund structures if 1940 Act provisions are implicated. Because Section 47(b) does not contain a statute of limitations, there is a significant risk that companies could face retrospective rescission and related collateral consequences. For long-standing companies, assessing this risk may require examination of its internal structures, investment history, and contractual arrangements.

Bottom Line

The Supreme Court’s decision in FS Credit Opportunities could significantly reshape the enforcement landscape under the 1940 Act by either opening or closing the door to private rescission claims under Section 47(b). Registered funds, BDCs, private fund complexes, and their counterparties should consider proactively assessing contractual portfolios, governance frameworks, and disclosure practices to prepare for either outcome and be ready to implement responsive measures once the decision is issued.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15546_5043.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:58:26.329973

Amid heightened levels of immigration arrests, many Filipino healthcare workers say they are providing essential care while in the grips of anxiety over their own safety.

By the 1970s, Filipino healthcare workers were being trained and exported to the US as skilled labor, said Valerie Francisco-Menchavez, a sociology professor at San Francisco State University and author of Caring for Caregivers: Filipina Migrant Workers and Community Building During Crisis.
‘We care about people’ Healthcare workers know better than anyone what it means to live on borrowed time.","In the Philippines, she spent three years providing end-of-life care for a family’s grandmother. When the grandmother died, family members told the healthcare worker to arrange her own way to the United States, where they operated home healthcare facilities.

In California, they promised, she would have a place to stay and a stable job. They would look after her just as she had cared for their grandmother.

In 2018, the caregiver – who asked to be identified as Bella – arrived in Los Angeles on a tourist visa. She imagined herself working in healthcare facilities tucked in verdant hills or in beach communities.

Instead, Bella, 57, said she landed in a shadow network of home healthcare jobs. She was shuttled among multiple facilities to avoid compliance checks and paid a fraction of a living wage. One job lasted eight months, she said, and paid $30 a day for 24-hour patient care.

“I’m thinking: ‘How could I live with that situation?’” said Bella. In Filipino culture, the concept of utang na loob, or a deep-seated sense of obligation to repay kindness, kept Bella tied to the family that she said ultimately exploited her labor and left her undocumented in the US.

To break free, Bella lived in a church for months. Many in the same situation fall deeper into the cracks of a system ripe for abuse, but Bella eventually joined a workers’ rights group that provided immigration and social services. She now earns just enough as a part-time independent home caregiver to pay taxes and rent a small room with a one-window view.

That fragile sense of stability has been shaken by news of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arresting people who look like her at workplaces and at immigration check-in appointments.

“It’s too much,” Bella said about the anxiety of the ICE arrests. She limits trips outside of home for essentials – which include work – because patients rely on her care.

In the US healthcare system, Filipinos make up a large percentage of the workforce – 4% of registered nurses are of Filipino descent, which is more than double the Filipino American population, according to National Nurses United.

The large number of Filipinos in healthcare work includes undocumented people, who fill workforce gaps and care for ailing people. Approximately 2% of undocumented immigrants in the US are from the Philippines, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.

Amid heightened levels of immigration arrests, many Filipino healthcare workers say they are providing essential care while in the grips of anxiety over their own safety.

ICE agents have walked past Veronica Velasquez, a physical therapist, in the hallways of the Los Angeles hospital where she works. Her heart raced each time. The Philippines native was brought to the US when she was 11 years old and granted temporary protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. She understands intimately the fear and vulnerabilities of the undocumented community.

“This is a hospital that’s supposed to be for the community, and it does not feel safe,” said Velasquez, 33. “This is supposed to be a healing space. This is supposed to feel like a space where I should feel safe. This is my place of work, and it 100% does not feel that way.”

A history written in care

The presence of Filipinos in the US healthcare industry is part of a centuries-long history tracing back to the US occupation of the Philippines.

In the mid-20th century, nursing education exchange programs were set up between the US and the Philippines. By the 1970s, Filipino healthcare workers were being trained and exported to the US as skilled labor, said Valerie Francisco-Menchavez, a sociology professor at San Francisco State University and author of Caring for Caregivers: Filipina Migrant Workers and Community Building During Crisis.

Many schools and universities in the Philippines today offer nursing programs that help graduates find healthcare jobs in other countries. In the US, Filipino caregivers are part of the backbone of a healthcare system facing critical labor gaps, said Aquilina Soriano Versoza, founder and executive director of the Pilipino Workers Center of Southern California.

“[Caregivers] wouldn’t be coming here if there weren’t the need for the labor,” said Versoza.

Some immigrate on skilled worker visas or, like Bella, overstay tourist visas. Both paths leave caregivers vulnerable, especially since many support families back home.

Christina Fadriga knows the trade-offs. To provide for her four children, she made the solo journey to the US in 2006 to work as a caregiver.

“I’m proud to be a caregiver in America,” said Fadriga, 60. But lately, the ICE raids have put her caregiving community on edge. As a green card holder, Fadriga is required to split her time between the US and the Philippines to maintain her permanent resident status. Her children are grown now, but she always feels torn about her nomadic existence – especially now.

There’s a lot of fear in the community, said Fadriga. Fed by news and social media posts about ICE arrests and detentions – which have included permanent residents and US citizens – friends advised her not to return to the US.

Others urged her not to be afraid.

“But how can you not be afraid?” said Fadriga.

‘We care about people’

Healthcare workers know better than anyone what it means to live on borrowed time.

“Today you’re sick. Tomorrow, it could be someone else. The next day, it could be my mom or me,” said Angelica Mateo, a licensed vocational nurse and a contract specialist with SEIU-UHW at Kaiser Permanente’s Los Angeles area clinics.

Mateo, who immigrated as a child and became a US citizen in 2021, said her immigrant background made her especially attuned to patients’ anxieties.

“We got into this career because we care about people,” said Mateo, 39. “We never did it with the mentality of, like: ‘I’m going to be the best nurse for citizens only.’”

Almost 60,000 people are in ICE detention, according to federal data. In one case, a longtime green card holder was detained at a Seattle airport after visiting the Philippines.

Such stories ripple quickly through the Filipino American community, where being undocumented has its own unofficial name in Tagalog: “TNT” – tago ng tago, or “always hiding”.

Velasquez, the LA physical therapist, tries to be a reassuring presence for this community in hiding. She posts videos explaining patients’ rights and how to seek support if treating patients under ICE detention.

“We are human beings, just like any other citizen or non-citizen,” said Velasquez. “We are just here trying to survive, just like everyone else.”

Living and working in the grips of heightened immigration enforcement has taken a toll on Bella’s mental health, especially in hiding. Sometimes she imagines speaking directly with leaders in charge of immigration policies.

In those times, she imagines asking a simple question: do you have elderly parents or children who need care?

If so, chances are, in those homes, domestic workers just like her are performing most of the household care duties.

So, where is the utang na loob or sense of obligation to repay kindness for this kind of essential work?

“Most of the caregivers who are here, we are not here to harm America,” said Bella. “We are a help in this country.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80f0cecb67b81c6ae7571782c25a19e4a1884cf8/0_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=71bf6fe789bd4050bf4797aa7227cee8",N,,2025-12-29 11:12:10.457576

Much recent commentary has suggested that the Roberts court is overly deferential to executive power – especially under President Donald Trump. The Niskanen Center, for example, contends that the court “is enabling Trump’s executive authority,” while the Brennan Center argues that the court has given “the president the power of a king.” But is this narrative supported by the empirical record? At the very least, is the Roberts court more deferential to presidential power than past courts? Our preliminary answer, like much else having to do with this court, is that it’s complicated.

What we looked at

The Supreme Court’s treatment of cases involving the presidency has long interested scholars of separation of powers. Indeed, research shows that justices who were appointed by the current president tend to favor that executive at higher rates than other justices. Other work examines how the court responds to perceived presidential overreach, finding that institutional constraints on executive power vary with the court’s composition.

This is in line with what is known as the attitudinal model, which suggests that judicial behavior reflects ideological preferences rather than neutral legal reasoning; in other words, that justices vote in favor of presidents with whose political ideology they agree. Along those lines, recent empirical work has demonstrated that partisan polarization affects judicial decision-making, with the justices increasingly dividing along party lines in politically salient cases.

This analysis builds on these foundations by examining support for the United States as a party on the merits docket. Support rates are calculated as the percentage of votes cast in favor of the United States’ position based on underlying data from the Supreme Court Database. Specifically, the analysis examines these rates across chief justice eras, by the political party of the appointing president, and by individual justices through the end of the 2024-2025 term.

Historical patterns: the long view

Figure 1, below, shows the number of cases involving the United States per term from 1803 through 2024. The pattern reveals dramatic growth through the early 20th century, peaking at 79 cases in the 1891 term during the court of Chief Justice Melville Fuller (1888-1910). This expansion reflected the growing reach of federal power and the court’s expanding docket. The mid-20th century saw continued high volumes, with the court of Chief Justice Earl Warren (1953-1969) often having over 40 such cases per term. Since the early 1980s, however, the overall number of cases has declined substantially as the court has reduced its total docket, although cases involving the United States remain a significant portion of the court’s work.

Figure 2, below, displays the total number of cases involving the United States by chief justice. Fuller’s dominance reflects both his relatively long tenure (of over two decades) and, again, the explosion of federal litigation in the late 19th century. The Warren court comes second with 619 cases, followed by the court of Chief Justice Edward Douglass White (1910-1921) with 526. Among recent chief justices, William Rehnquist (1986-2005) presided over 330 cases while John Roberts has seen 250 such cases through the 2024 term. As noted above, however, the Roberts court’s lower count likely reflects the court’s generally smaller docket rather than any reduced federal government presence.

Support for the United States by chief justice era

The next figure presents support rates for the United States across chief justice eras. The modern pattern shows considerable variation. The courts of White and Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase (1864-1873) led with 70.4% and 70% support for the United States, respectively, followed by the court of Chief Justice William Howard Taft (1921-1930), himself a former president, at 66.33%. Fuller, despite deciding the most cases, supported the government at 64.74%. Among more recent courts, that of Warren E. Burger (1969-1986) supported the United States 64.09% of the time, while Rehnquist’s was at 63.01%.

The famously liberal Warren court is notable for its 52.74% support rate – among the lowest of any chief justice era. This makes some sense: this relatively low rate came during a period of significant expansion in individual rights and skepticism toward government power. The Roberts court falls even nearer the bottom, however, at 49.39%.

Finally is the court under Chief Justice John Marshall (1801-1835). Given Marshall was generally considered a proponent of federal power, it is of some surprise that his court shows a historically low 40.74% support rate for the United States. That said, this may reflect the limited scope of federal authority in the early republic and the nascent state of executive power during that era more than anything else.

The partisan dimension

The next chart breaks down support for the United States by chief justice and the party of the appointing president. The analysis is limited to chief justices since 1900 in order to focus on the modern era of more developed executive power.

As the data reveals, when one party held a durable edge in appointments, the court’s support for the United States tended to be higher. For example, in the early 1900s (the Fuller, White, and Taft courts), the bulk of the justices were Republican appointees, reflecting that party’s dominance of the presidency for long stretches around the turn of the century. It’s thus unsurprising that the court frequently voted in favor of the administration during this period. What’s more striking is how high the U.S. win rate was under Democratic administrations even with a Republican-appointed bench, such as in the White court era – an indicator that, during this period, the court’s general receptiveness to federal power often outweighed any simple party alignment.

These percentages decreased during the court of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (1930-1941). This era began with a bench still heavily shaped by earlier Republican administrations, but which rapidly became a Roosevelt-appointed court after the late 1930s (and FDR’s successive terms). By the time of the courts of Chief Justices Harlan Fiske Stone (1941-1946) and Fred M. Vinson (1946-1953), the story is more straightforward: the overwhelming majority of the justices were Democratic appointees (almost all entirely appointed by FDR, in Stone’s case), during Democratic terms.

That brings us to the Warren era. Although the Warren court is remembered as liberal, its roster was mixed – containing many Roosevelt/Truman appointees, but then supplemented by Republican Eisenhower appointees (including Warren himself) alongside later Kennedy/Johnson picks.

For the Burger and Rehnquist courts, the figure shows a clearer correlation between the party of the appointing president and the court’s support for the presidency than is present in the early-mid century: Both eras feature higher pro–U.S. rates under Republican administrations than Democratic ones. That pattern is broadly consistent with the reality that, over the long run of each court, Republican appointees held a durable edge in the voting coalitions that most often formed majorities. But the gap is also modest, especially under Rehnquist, where even a court with a Republican-appointed tilt still delivered substantial executive wins under Democratic presidents.

By the time Roberts became chief, the partisan structure is clearest. The bulk of the court is Republican-appointed and has been so since Roberts’ appointment as chief justice. There, a noticeably higher win rate for the United States under Republican administrations is consistent with the conventional wisdom about a Republican-appointed majority court.

Stepping back, the trend looks like a shift from weak partisan sorting to stronger partisan sorting over time. In the early 1900s and much of the mid-century, appointing-party composition helps explain some variation, but high United States win rates under both parties point to a court whose baseline posture toward federal power often dominated partisan alignment. Over time – especially by the late 20th century and then more sharply in the Roberts era – the relationship between the party of the appointing president and differential success for Republican versus Democratic administrations becomes more pronounced. The most plausible interpretation is that the docket and the parties’ legal agendas became more ideologically sorted: Modern Democratic and Republican administrations more often defend positions that map onto the court’s ideological cleavage, so the appointing-party composition has come to increasingly predict which administration will fare better in contested, high-salience government cases.

Individual justices and the current Roberts court

The voting patterns of current Roberts court justices deserve closer examination given contemporary debates about executive power. The following figure shows the overall top and bottom 15 justices by their support rate for the United States among those with at least 25 votes in such cases.

Among the current justices, none appear in the top 15. At the bottom there is a mix of the court’s conservative and liberal wings. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, often viewed as part of the court’s liberal wing, voted for the government 43.16% of the time. This places her just a touch above fellow liberal Justice Elena Kagan, who voted in favor of the government 42.29% of the time and significantly ahead of Justice Neil Gorsuch, one of the more conservative justices, who supported the government’s position less than 37% of the time, perhaps in line with his libertarian instincts. (The average support for the government across all justices with 25 or more votes was 55.82%.)

Further focusing on the current justices we see the following:

With the exception of Gorsuch, the conservative justices, led by Justice Samuel Alito, provide the highest support for the government. Roberts is right in the middle at 51.43%.

Moving to support for Republican versus Democratic administrations, across the Roberts court every justice shown is more likely to vote for the United States when a Republican administration is in office, though the size of that gap varies, as demonstrated by the chart above. The largest partisan swings appear for Kagan (a Democratic appointee with a relatively low pro-United States rate under Democratic administrations but, interestingly, a much higher rate under Republican ones) and Gorsuch (a Republican appointee whose pro-United States rate jumps sharply under Republican administrations). Roberts and Sotomayor also show sizable gaps favoring Republican administrations.

At the same time, the chart underscores that party alignment isn’t a complete explanation. Alito, who is a Republican appointee and considered strongly conservative, is highly pro-United States under both parties, just markedly more so under Republican administrations – consistent with a justice who is broadly receptive to government authority or law enforcement positions but especially aligned with conservative stances. The votes of Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas, also all Republican appointees, reflect a baseline willingness to side with the government but less so than Alito. (Jackson, a Democratic appointee, appears only under Democratic administrations here.) While the pattern may fit conventional expectations for a court with a durable Republican-appointed majority in which Republican administrations benefit more often, the magnitude depends on each justice’s jurisprudential commitments and the ideological content of the government’s positions in the cases that actually reach the merits docket.

So what does this tell us?

The data present a more nuanced picture than recent commentary might suggest, and especially those who contend that the Roberts court is overly deferential to executive power. Indeed, this court’s 49.39% support rate for the United States is below the historical average and substantially lower than the courts led by Fuller, Taft, Warren, Burger, and Rehnquist – that is, all the courts since 1900.

The partisan analysis also reveals some interesting patterns. Republican-appointed courts since 1900 have generally supported the government at higher rates during Republican presidencies, though the Roberts court shows lower overall support rates than its predecessors regardless of which party controls the White House. This could reflect polarization in case selection, with more controversial executive actions reaching the court, or genuine changes in judicial philosophy about executive power.

That said, several important limitations must be acknowledged. First, and perhaps most significantly, this analysis excludes the shadow docket. Emergency applications and stays have become increasingly important in recent years, particularly for cases involving significant issues relating to immigration, pandemic response, and other executive actions. The shadow docket may tell a separate story about deference to executive power, and analyzing it requires accounting for different legal standards and procedural postures.

Second, we have excluded cases involving agency deference where the United States was not directly a party. We have also not examined cases where the president or a cabinet member’s name is in the case caption instead of the United States (such as those over presidential immunity) or where other government officials may be a named party. I plan to do so in a follow-up study.

Third, the analysis does not distinguish between Trump’s two presidencies. During Trump’s first term, the Roberts court decided numerous cases involving his administration. The current term remains in its early stages with limited data. Separating these periods might well reveal different patterns.

Fourth, the analysis treats all cases involving the United States equally, without accounting for issue area, case importance, or the strength of the government’s legal position. Criminal cases, civil litigation, and constitutional challenges might present different voting patterns, and a more granular analysis could reveal that the court is deferential in some domains but not others (and might also help explain why even certain Democratic-appointed justices favor the United States in Republican versus Democratic administrations – something quite notable but beyond the scope of the current article).

Finally, examining whether support is Trump-specific or party-specific requires additional work. The clustering of current justices around similar support rates suggests that partisan differences may be less pronounced than in earlier eras, but this could also reflect the types of cases reaching the court or the strength of legal arguments presented. Additionally, since the sample size for the current court composition is still relatively low, comparisons between this court and previous eras will become clearer as the justices work through more cases.

The bottom line

Despite claims to the contrary, the Roberts court, rather than showing exceptional deference to executive power, actually falls below the historical average in its support for the federal government when it appears as a party on the merits docket.

But perhaps what most emerges from a historical analysis is a complex picture that resists simple narratives. The court’s relationship with executive power varies across eras, reflects changing understandings of federal authority, and appears influenced by both partisan considerations and broader jurisprudential trends. At the very least, this initial analysis provides a foundation for deeper examination of these patterns and their implications for the separation of powers in these politically fraught times.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PXL_20231002_1955025892-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:58:33.511303

A WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis of ICE detention data made available by the Deportation Data Project through mid-October finds the number and rate of self-deportations among detainees booked into Broadview appears to have soared during the first five and a half weeks of Operation Midway Blitz.
The analysis focused on detainees who were initially booked into the Broadview facility, which appears by name as “Broadview Service Staging” in the data.
However, a department spokesperson strongly denied that there are “subprime conditions” or barriers to legal counsel for detainees at Broadview.
The analysis indicates recent arrestees who began their ICE detention at Broadview were sent to facilities all over the country, more than 57 facilities in 14 different states.","In just a few months, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in west suburban Broadview has transformed from an immigration holding center that rarely booked more than 10 people a day to a de facto detention center processing dozens of detainees during almost all hours of the day.

People held there have described a litany of inhumane conditions: overcrowded and unsanitary holding cells; not enough food and water; and freezing conditions at night.

They were also signing a form to voluntarily leave the country — to self-deport — at alarmingly high rates, according to a WBEZ and Chicago Sun-Times analysis of recently released federal data. Legal experts said, in many cases, detainees at Broadview were coerced into signing paperwork before even speaking to a lawyer.

“They’re agreeing to voluntary departure, but the voluntary part is not accurate,” said Samuel Cole, chief immigration litigation counsel at ACLU Illinois. “They’re not knowingly and truly voluntarily agreeing to give up the rights to fight their case.”

Cole said some detainees sign the voluntary departure form to escape difficult conditions in Broadview and don’t understand what legal options are available to them.

A WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis of ICE detention data made available by the Deportation Data Project through mid-October finds the number and rate of self-deportations among detainees booked into Broadview appears to have soared during the first five and a half weeks of Operation Midway Blitz.

From Sept. 8 through Oct. 15, at least 154 people who were initially booked into Broadview have self-deported, more than nearly every other ICE detention facility in the nation during that time.

That’s about 36% of all detainees booked into Broadview during that period who were no longer in ICE detention as of Oct. 15, faster than the 11% self-deportation rate during Trump’s second term before the immigration blitz began and much faster than a rate of 6% during the last year of the Biden administration.

The self-deportation rate among those booked into Broadview during the first five and a half weeks of the Chicago-area immigration enforcement campaign was also faster than it was nationwide. Among all detainees initially booked into any ICE facility from Sep. 8 to Oct. 15, the rate of self-deportations was about 19%, nearly half of what it was for those initially detained at Broadview.

WBEZ and the Sun-Times defined individuals as self-deportees if the data indicated they had left ICE detention, had a date they departed the country and had “3-Voluntary Departure Confirmed” as their case status. The analysis focused on detainees who were initially booked into the Broadview facility, which appears by name as “Broadview Service Staging” in the data.

Questions about DHS provided data

Data released this month was a result of a lawsuit won by the Deportation Data Project and offers the first detailed data about those detained at Broadview during the first five and a half weeks of the feds’ Chicago-area immigration enforcement blitz. ICE collects data on every person it arrests, detains and deports, but the agency stopped regularly publishing metrics in January.

Still, some advocates are also concerned about the accuracy of data published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency for ICE.

“Some data on the number of people who were detained in Broadview just doesn’t match, for example, how many sandwiches were ordered,” said Cole with the ACLU. “There are significant differences.”

Why are self-deportations up?

Cole, who served as a federal immigration judge for nearly 10 years before formally stepping down this fall, said the use of voluntary departure has significantly shifted under the Trump administration.

Before, an immigration judge would determine if a person was “removeable,” and then offer the option of voluntary departure. Now, people are getting arrested and almost immediately “coerced” into signing voluntary departure paperwork, Cole said.

People are presented with forms before even talking to a lawyer and often in a language they don’t understand, Cole said. And these could be people who have valid ways to stay in the country but do not know it.

They’re told their options are to sign the papers and leave or wait in detention, potentially for weeks, until a judge can hear their case, according to Cole.

“The end result is people feel that they’re being forced to take voluntary departure without having an ability to talk to a lawyer, without having their case presented to an immigration judge,” Cole said.

By design, the conditions inside Broadview have also forced some to quickly self-deport, according to Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office.

“The administration’s deportation machine was built with cruel intentions and complete disregard of humanity,” said Van Brunt in a written statement to WBEZ and the Sun-Times.

“By subjecting detainees to intolerable conditions and by using tactics of coercion and misrepresentation, people are self-deporting instead of being held in ICE facilities. It’s clear that this administration is more interested in meeting its arbitrary, self-imposed deportation quotas instead of giving detainees an opportunity to make their case in U.S. courts,” wrote Van Brunt.

DHS did not respond to a request to clarify the data. However, a department spokesperson strongly denied that there are “subprime conditions” or barriers to legal counsel for detainees at Broadview.

“All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in an email to WBEZ. “No one is denied access to proper medical care. There is a privacy wall around the toilet for detainees.”

Last week, DHS also announced a $3,000 stipend and a paid one-way plane ticket for people who chose to self-deport through a government app before the end of the year.

“We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right legal way to live American dream. If not, you will be arrested and deported without a chance to return,” McLaughlin wrote.

Detainees held at Broadview increased sharply during the blitz

During the first five and a half weeks of Operation Midway Blitz, 1,854 people were booked into Broadview, more than almost every other facility in the country. Only hold rooms in Dallas and Montgomery, Ala., took in more detainees during that time.

Broadview was never designed to serve as a detention center. The processing center, which contains four holding rooms, was intended to hold people picked up by immigration authorities for no more than 12 hours.

In late June, ICE quietly expanded the maximum time people could be held in processing centers like Broadview to 72 hours, or three days.

But a Sun-Times and WBEZ investigation found officials were often holding immigrants at Broadview beyond the 72-hour mark.

The MacArthur Justice Center and Roger Baldwin Foundation of ACLU filed a class action lawsuit against the Trump administration in October, alleging Broadview was a “black box in which to disappear people from the U.S. justice and immigration systems.”

Former detainees testified that 100 people were crammed into a holding room at one time. They also said they were given no hot meals or places to sleep. One former detainee broke down explaining how he’d have to wake people up to go to the bathroom at night because they were sleeping beside the toilet.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman issued a temporary restraining order requiring ICE to provide people bedding, “sufficient space to sleep,” adequate hygiene supplies and three full meals with water. Gettleman also ordered ICE to ensure detainees had access to lawyers and a phone.

A WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis shows the number of people held at Broadview at 5 a.m. each day, based on detainee book-in and book-out times, increased sharply after Operation Midway Blitz began in September, and exceeded 100 people on more than a dozen days.

Under the Biden administration, people detained at Broadview were typically sent to detention facilities in the Midwest. In 2024, the last full calendar year of the Biden administration, more than 90% of people detained at Broadview were sent to the Clay County Justice Center in Brazil, Ind., or the Dodge County Jail in Juneau, Wis., according to a WBEZ and Sun-Times analysis of federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project.

In a written statement to WBEZ and the Sun-Times, a DHS spokesperson said the agency makes facility determinations based on bed space to ensure detainees’ “presence for immigration proceedings or removal from the United States.”

But the facilities to which detainees are sent often are far from where they were arrested and many are likely outside of the court jurisdiction where their cases are being heard, advocates said. The analysis indicates recent arrestees who began their ICE detention at Broadview were sent to facilities all over the country, more than 57 facilities in 14 different states. “[It’s] undoubtedly because of how many people are detained right now,” Cole said. “They’re constantly battling crowding at facilities, and they’re moving people around because of it.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c37b82b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7716x4405+0+371/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2Fd4%2F17fad7f340f5b78e207651c24a18%2Fbroadviewcurfew-111425-01.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 10:58:38.481381

Similarly, the author writes, today has seen the rise of mutual aid and activism, including whistleblowing, filming enforcement actions and sustained support for families affected by immigration enforcement, offering a counterweight amid ongoing humanitarian concerns.","CHICAGO — An opinion piece published on SCOTUSblog on Dec. 23, 2025, sheds light on the constitutional and human consequences of contemporary immigration enforcement operating under the Trump administration, drawing connections to historical cases such as the Supreme Court’s 1842 decision in Prigg v. Pennsylvania.

The article, “The worst Supreme Court case you’ve never heard of, and what it tells us about Trump’s immigration enforcement,” recounts the 1837 case of Edward Prigg and other slave catchers who, under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, kidnapped Margaret Morgan, a free Black woman, and her children from Pennsylvania and took them to Maryland.

In the years that followed, Pennsylvania enacted a “personal liberty law” requiring slave catchers to appear before a state magistrate before removing alleged fugitives from the state. Under this law, Prigg initially brought the Morgan family before a magistrate but was denied authorization to remove them because Jerry Morgan was “clearly free,” while Margaret’s legal status was disputed.

Pennsylvania later prosecuted Prigg after he returned while Jerry was away, abducted Margaret and the children, and transported them to Maryland without authorization. Despite the prosecution, the Supreme Court struck down the statute. Justice Joseph Story, writing for the court, ruled that states could not impose restrictions on slaveholders reclaiming enslaved people under the Constitution’s fugitive slave clause, except to prevent a “breach of the peace or any illegal violence.”

The SCOTUSblog article emphasizes how this ruling left Black people in free states unprotected from abduction, violence and other humanitarian harms, including those who were legally free. The author writes, “We don’t know what happened to Margaret and her children,” adding that Jerry Morgan never learned their fate despite desperately trying to find them. This decision, which stripped states of the power to protect their residents, is presented as a parallel to present-day immigration enforcement.

The article cites reports of families separated during immigration actions, noting that the author “cannot look at that picture without thinking of Jerry Morgan,” referring to an image of a man crying outside a Chicago-area ICE facility after his wife was taken. One need not equate immigration enforcement with slavery, she writes, “to recognize the inhumanity of what is occurring.”

Approximately 6 million children — about 82% of whom are U.S. citizens — have at least one parent who is undocumented, with more than 14 million U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents also living with an undocumented immigrant. These figures support the article’s reference to reports that the Trump administration set a quota of 3,000 detentions per day.

With people being “seized by armed and masked men” and denied the chance to establish their legal status, contact loved ones or say goodbye, the article critiques the reasoning and implementation of the civil laws the administration uses as a framework. The author argues this approach “devastates families, communities, and businesses, and spreads massive fear.”

The piece also notes that President Donald Trump ordered agents to focus on Somali communities in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area and describes Somali immigrants as “garbage.” This language raises concerns about racial profiling in immigration enforcement, with the article pointing out that federal agents have relied on factors such as apparent Hispanic ethnicity, speaking Spanish, location and type of work to establish “reasonable suspicion” of unlawful presence.

According to the article, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has endorsed this reasoning by writing that U.S. citizens and lawfully present noncitizens would be only “briefly detained” long enough to establish their status, citing Noem v. Perdomo Vasquez. In contrast, the article notes that U.S. citizens in ICE custody have been held “sometimes for extended periods and sometimes repeatedly,” with agents refusing to accept proof of citizenship or lawful status.

The article also cites findings by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis in her examination of “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, which documented immigration agents firing pepper balls at unarmed protesters and journalists, deploying tear gas into crowds and vehicles without warning, and physically assaulting observers and demonstrators. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit later stayed Ellis’ injunction, the author notes, though “not because they doubted her factfinding.”

These incidents, along with the shooting of two individuals in Chicago, one of whom died, underscore the extent to which the author argues federal agents are exercising power beyond their roles. The article further cites an instance of law enforcement rappelling into an apartment building at night and removing residents without warrants.

Detainees have reported being held in “filthy and overcrowded spaces” without adequate medical care, bedding, food or access to lavatories. The article states that detainees are sometimes pressured, under threat or physical force, to sign “voluntary” deportation papers without lawyers and that many are unable to read the documents, which are often only in English.

Critiquing the immigration court system and its placement within the Department of Justice, the opinion piece describes the situation as one where “the boss of the prosecutor” is also “the boss of the judge.” Several immigration judges have been fired under the administration, the author writes, despite a backlog of roughly 3.8 million cases.

Those judges include individuals who grant asylum at higher-than-average rates, a context the article says makes Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s posting for a “Deportation Judge” particularly troubling. The SCOTUSblog piece emphasizes that “there is in fact no such job” in federal law.

In concluding, the author reflects on historical and contemporary forms of resistance. In the 19th century, slave-catcher watches and community rescues helped advance protective efforts even when courts struck down laws. Such actions, described as “acts not only of protest and solidarity, but also of constitutional vision and commitment,” are framed as part of a tradition that eventually led to the Reconstruction Amendments.

Similarly, the author writes, today has seen the rise of mutual aid and activism, including whistleblowing, filming enforcement actions and sustained support for families affected by immigration enforcement, offering a counterweight amid ongoing humanitarian concerns.

The reduction follows a trend in immigration courts nationwide and constitutes, critics say, an attack on the rule of law that will lead to yet more delays in an overburdened court system.

The reduction in immigration judges has come as the administration scaled up efforts to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Trump administration officials have described the immigration court process, in which proceedings can take years amid a backlog of millions of cases, as an impediment to their goals.

Nationwide, there were 735 immigration judges last fiscal year, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the arm of the Justice Department that houses immigration courts. At least 97 have been fired since President Trump took office and about the same number have resigned or retired, according to the union representing immigration judges.

California has lost at least 35 immigration judges since January, according to Mobile Pathways, a Berkeley-based organization that analyzes immigration court data. That’s down from 132. The steepest drop occurred at the San Francisco Immigration Court, which has lost more than half its bench.

“A noncitizen might win their case, might lose their case, but the key question is, did they receive a hearing?” said Emmett Soper, who worked at the Justice Department before becoming an immigration judge in Virginia in 2017. “Up until this administration, I had always been confident that I was working in a system that, despite its flaws, was fundamentally fair.”

The administration intends to fill some judge positions, and in new immigration judge job listings in Los Angeles, San Francisco and elsewhere seeks candidates who want to be a “deportation judge” and “restore integrity and honor to our Nation’s Immigration Court system.”

The immigration judges union called the job listings “insulting.”

Trump wrote on Truth Social in April that he was elected to “remove criminals from our Country, but the Courts don’t seem to want me to do that.”

“We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,” he added.

The National Assn. of Immigration Judges said it expects a wave of additional retirements at the end of this month.

“My biggest concern is for the people whose lives are left in limbo. What can they count on when the ground is literally shifting every moment that they’re here?” said Amber George, who was fired last month from the San Francisco Immigration Court. “Our government institutions are losing their legitimacy.”

Because immigration courts operate under the Justice Department, their priorities typically shift from one presidential administration to the next, but the extreme changes taking place have renewed longtime calls for immigration courts to become independent of the executive branch.

The Trump administration recently added 36 judges; 25 of them are military lawyers serving in temporary positions.

This summer, the Pentagon authorized up to 600 military lawyers to work for the Department of Justice. That took place after the department changed the requirements for temporary immigration judges, removing the need for immigration law experience.

The Department of Justice did not respond to specific questions, but said judges must be impartial and that the agency is obligated to take action against those who demonstrate systemic bias.

Former judges say that, because terminations have happened with no advance notice, remaining court staff have often scrambled to get up to speed on reassigned cases.

Ousted judges described a pattern: In the afternoon, sometimes while presiding over a hearing, they receive a short email stating that they are being terminated pursuant to Article II of the Constitution. Their names are swiftly removed from the Justice Department website.

Jeremiah Johnson is one of five judges terminated recently from the San Francisco Immigration Court.

Johnson said he worries the Trump administration is circumventing immigration courts by making conditions so unbearable that immigrants decide to drop their cases.

The number of detained immigrants has climbed to record levels since January, with more than 65,000 in custody. Immigrants and lawyers say the conditions are inhumane, alleging medical neglect, punitive solitary confinement and obstructed access to legal counsel. Requests by immigrants for voluntary departure, which avoids formal deportation, have surged in recent months.

Many of those arrests have happened at courthouses, causing immigrants to avoid their legal claims out of fear of being detained and forcing judges to order them removed in absentia.

“Those are ways to get people to leave the United States without seeing a judge, without due process that Congress has provided,” Johnson said. “It’s a dismantling of the court system.”

The judges in San Francisco’s Immigration Court have historically had higher asylum approval rates than the national average. Johnson said grant rates depend on a variety of circumstances, including whether a person is detained or has legal representation, their country of origin and whether they are adults or children.

In November, the military judges serving in immigration courts heard 286 cases and issued rulings in 110, according to Mobile Pathways. The military judges issued deportation orders in 78% of the cases — more often than other immigration judges that month, who ordered deportations in 63% of cases.

“They’re probably following directions — and the military is very good at following directions — and it’s clear what their directions are that are given by this administration,” said Mobile Pathways co-founder Bartlomiej Skorupa. He cautioned that 110 cases are a small sample size and that trends will become clearer in the coming months.

Former immigration judges and their advocates say that appointing people with no immigration experience and little training makes for a steep learning curve and the possibility of due process violations.

“There are multiple concerns here: that they’re temporary, which could expose them to greater pressure to decide cases in a certain way; and also they lack experience in immigration law, which is an extremely complex area of practice,” said Ingrid Eagly, an immigration law professor at UCLA.

Immigration courts have a backlog of more than 3 million cases. Anam Petit, who served as an immigration judge in Virginia until September, said the administration’s emphasis on speedy case completions has to be balanced against the constitutional right to a fair hearing.

“There are not enough judges to hear those cases, and this administration [is] taking it upon themselves to fire a lot of experienced and trained judges who can hear those cases and can mitigate that backlog,” she said.

Complementary bills introduced in the U.S. Senate and House this month by Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Rep. Juan Vargas (D-San Diego) would prevent the appointment of military lawyers as temporary immigration judges and impose a two-year limit of service.

“The Trump administration’s willingness to fire experienced immigration judges and hire inexperienced or temporary ‘deportation judges,’ especially in places like California, has fundamentally impacted the landscape of our justice system,” Schiff said in a statement announcing the bill.

The bills have little chance in the Republican-controlled Congress but illustrate how significantly Democrats — especially in California — oppose the administration’s changes to immigration courts.

Former Immigration Judge Tania Nemer, a dual citizen of Lebanon and the U.S., sued the Justice Department and Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi this month, alleging that she was illegally terminated in February because of her gender, ethnic background and political affiliation. In 2023, Nemer ran for judicial office in Ohio as a Democrat.

Bondi addressed the lawsuit in a Cabinet meeting.

“Most recently, yesterday, I was sued by an immigration judge who we fired,” she said Dec. 2. “One of the reasons she said she was a woman. Last I checked, I was a woman as well.”

Other former judges have challenged their terminations through the federal Merit Systems Protection Board.

Johnson, of San Francisco, is one of those. He filed his appeal this month, claiming that he was not given cause for termination.

“My goal is to be reinstated,” he said. “My colleagues on the bench, our court was vibrant. It was a good place to work, despite all the pressures.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b4474f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6051x3177+0+430/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F28%2F87bc0f50449f9db96dc4ba93022b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2219062487,N,,2025-12-29 08:56:46.982499

Federal immigration officers have detained thousands of people in Massachusetts this year, part of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policies. About 70% of the immigrants detained nationwide between January and October had no criminal record, according to government data. While some people have been deported and some remain in custody across the country, others have been released, seen their cases dropped, or are out on bond while they await future court hearings. Today we have four stories from people detained locally and released back to their New England communities, as reported by GBH News’ Sarah Betancourt, who has been following these cases all year.

After detention: What life’s been like for four immigrants in New England

GBH News reporter Sarah Betancourt has been following the cases of immigrants detained in Massachusetts this year. Here are the stories of four people detained and released, and how they’re doing now.

Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts graduate student detained on the street outside her apartment in Somerville and kept in federal custody for 45 days — sometimes without access to her asthma medication — is now working on her Ph.D. dissertation, her attorney said. “Really, it’s an example of how she is really dedicated to her Ph.D. related to child study and human development,” her attorney Mahsa Khanbabai said on GBH’s Boston Public Radio. Öztürk still has ongoing legal cases: an immigration court case through which the U.S. government attempted to deport her and a case in federal court in which she challenged her detention.

Khanbabai noted that Öztürk’s case shows the vast power the U.S. government has over immigrants: the Trump administration revoked Öztürk’s student visa without her knowledge and detained her after she co-wrote an op-ed for the Tufts student paper about Israel’s war in Gaza. “Essentially it means Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio can say, ‘I don’t like that person for whatever reason. And I’m going to revoke their visa,’” Khanbabai said.

Marcelo Gomes da Silva, the Milford High School student detained while driving to volleyball practice over the summer, said he’s focusing on his senior year of high school and thinking about college. “In the beginning it was obviously hard because my parents were super nervous. They were really scared,” Gomes da Silva told Betancourt. “But after time it slowly started getting better because we were able to do things that have to do with our documentation, like apply for asylum and things like that. So slowly things have been getting better.”

He said his memories of the ICE detention center in Burlington, where he slept on concrete in one room with 35 other men and did not have access to hygiene supplies, “will never go away.” He’s been advocating for other immigrants in detention. “I wanna go to college for political science and hopefully go to law school. I’m really interested in being a politician and I feel like if I educate myself more and more, I will be able to help others around me,” he said.

Lucas Dos Santos Amaral has welcomed a son, Theo, since his release from ICE custody. He’s also been singing gospel in churches across New England and has a valid work permit. His next court hearing is two years away, in the winter of 2027. “We are ending another year united and stronger, because I believe that this battle I faced will serve the benefit of all of us immigrants,” Dos Santos Amaral said in a message to Betancourt. “Our Christmas will have a taste of victory and gratitude.”

The ICE agents who pulled him over in January were looking for a different person, and local elected officials at the time said it appeared they pulled over Dos Santos Amaral because they had racially profiled him. He was taken to ICE detention in Plymouth, then moved to Texas. After a judge ordered him released, ICE let him out without his identification, so friends flew to Texas to bring him documents so he could travel back to his family — his pregnant wife and their first daughter — in Massachusetts.

“My life has never been the same — those were frightening and traumatic days, hope was scarce, but my faith in God never wavered,” he said.

March 24: Marlborough father recalls ‘nightmare’ of ICE detention as he adjusts to life back in Mass.

Fabian Schmidt, a New Hampshire resident and Green Card holder, was detained at Logan airport in March, where he says he was violently interrogated and denied the ability to contact his family, an attorney, or the embassy for his home country, Germany. Federal authorities kept him in custody for two months, then dropped his case and released him.

The weekend of his release, Schmidt proposed to his partner. They’ve since gotten married and Schmidt returned to work. “I love this country so much. My daughter, my wife, my whole life is here,” he told Betancourt. “So I’m trying to become an American as soon as possible. And if there was some kind of magic trick to make that happen now, I would totally sign my paperwork.”

He said he feels the trauma of the experience. He’s developed stomach ulcers because of the stress.

“Honestly, I don’t think that’s gonna fade for quite a while. I think about it every day. Every day, I think about my own pain — It still makes an impact on me for sure,” he said.

The judge says Carlitos Ricardo Parias, who goes by Richard LA online, was denied access to his lawyers while being held in detention.

He also cites the government's failure to meet discovery deadlines, including the timely release of body camera footage of the shooting.

ORIGINAL REPORT: TikToker shot by federal agents, deputy US marshal hit by ricochet bullet during South LA operation

The shooting happened in the 400 block of East 20th Street near Trinity Street around 8:52 a.m. Federal officials said it began as a targeted enforcement traffic stop on an undocumented immigrant who had previously avoided capture.

Agents accused Parias of ramming his car into their vehicles after they boxed him in, but video from the scene raises questions about their claims.

In a statement back in October, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said Parias ""weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee. Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots.""

Parias was accused of ramming his Toyota Camry into law enforcement vehicles in front of and behind him after they boxed him in. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said Parias spun the car's tires, spewing smoke and debris into the air and causing the car to fishtail, ""causing agents to worry for their safety.""

Essayli said an agent broke into his side window, but it wasn't enough to subdue Parias. That's when an agent opened fire.

Parias was shot once in the elbow, and a deputy U.S. marshal was shot in the hand by a ricochet bullet, according to DHS.

His trial was supposed to start on Tuesday. He was charged with assault on a federal officer.

The judge dismissed the indictment with prejudice, preventing prosecutors from refiling the same charges.

It’s the most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history, experts in immigration policy told States Newsroom. The Trump administration curtailed legal immigration by terminating Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million immigrants and ending Humanitarian Parole protections for half a million more individuals.

“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary Protected Status?

A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, Venezuela

Immigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela – make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021 memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian Parole program

Separately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting last month in Washington, D.C., allegedly by an Afghan national granted asylum, the program is under increased scrutiny and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influential

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.",https://ottumwaradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/johann-teran.avif,N,,2025-12-29 09:58:33.072847

At the time, Parias’ car did not appear to be moving.","Days ahead of trial, a federal judge has dismissed an indictment against a TikTok streamer shot by ICE earlier this year, citing constitutional violations by the government.

In a Saturday order, U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin cited the deprivation of Carlitos Ricardo Parias’ access to counsel while held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention and the government’s failure to comply with discovery deadlines — including the timely release of body worn camera footage that captured the shooting.

Federal authorities had accused Parias, a well-known TikTok streamer of local breaking news, of ramming his car into agents’ vehicles after they boxed him in and tried to arrest him during an immigration enforcement operation in South L.A. in October. An ICE officer opened fire, striking Parias in the arm and injuring a deputy U.S. marshal with a ricochet bullet.

That same day, prosecutors charged Parias with assault on a federal officer. In November, he was indicted by a grand jury. Parias was scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, previously told the Times that Parias had “weaponized his vehicle” and said “fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots.” But newly obtained body worn camera footage raises questions about that claim.

The video captures an ICE officer holding a gun in one hand and using the other to break open the window of Parias’ car. As the officer shouts at Parias to turn off the car, Parias raises his hands in the air and asks why he is being detained. The officer repeatedly tries to open the passenger side door, before moving the gun to his left hand, right before firing.

At the time, Parias’ car did not appear to be moving.

“Oh,” the officer said, sounding surprised. “F—.”

“Who shot?” someone asked.

“I shot, I shot,” the officer responded.

In his 28-page order, Olguin dismissed the indictment with prejudice, meaning prosecutors cannot refile the same charges of assault on a federal officer using a deadly or dangerous weapon and depredation of government property.

“In short, because the deprivation of Mr. Parias’s access to counsel during the critical period prior to his trial caused him actual and threatened prejudice, and because no other remedy could adequately cure his deprivation, the court agrees with defendant that dismissal of the indictment is warranted,” Olguin wrote.

A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Federal Public Defender Cuauhtemoc Ortega and Deputy Federal Public Defender Gabriela Rivera, who represented Parias, said in a statement that they were “pleased that the court dismissed the charges against their client.”

“While we remain quite confident that a jury would readily acquit Mr. Parias, the government prejudiced his right to a fair and speedy trial by denying him meaningful access to his defense team and failing to timely disclose the evidence they claimed supported the charges,” they said in the statement. “We are grateful that Mr. Parias’s constitutional rights were vindicated.”

Although the criminal charges against him have been dismissed, Parias could remain in ICE detention as his immigration case proceeds.

Federal authorities sought to arrest Parias on Oct. 21 on an administrative arrest warrant in conjunction with a federal immigration proceeding, according to a criminal complaint filed against him. Homeland Security officials have said Parias is in the country illegally.

An official with the Department of Homeland Security accused Parias of having “previously escaped from custody,” although video obtained by the Times appears to show the federal agents letting him go during a June incident.

In the recent incident that ended with a shooting, Parias was leaving his home and driving down the street, when federal agents — including from ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service — used their vehicles to box him in, according to the criminal complaint.

Body worn camera footage captures the ICE officer approaching Parias’ passenger side door and stating that he’s going to “break the window.” As the officer smashes the window, the car begins to rev and smoke billows up from the spinning tires. The officer pulls out his gun soon after, holding it in his right hand as he smashes the window at the same time.

The complaint alleges that when the rear of the car began to “fishtail,” it “caused the agents to fear that PARIAS may lose control of the Camry and hit them.” A Homeland Security Investigations agent wrote that Parias’ acceleration of the Camry “caused debris (likely rubber being shed from the tires themselves) to fly into the air, which struck some of the agents.”

“Bajate, te vamos a disparar,” the ICE officer warns in the video. “Get out, we’re going to shoot you.”

Once the wheels stopped spinning, an officer reached in through the broken window of the passenger door, “brandishing a gun in one hand while attempting to open the door with the other,” the judge wrote in his order.

As the officer shouts at him to turn off the car, Parias says in the body cam footage that he doesn’t have anything and asks why he’s being detained. An agent appears to say that if Parias moves, they’ll shoot.

“Mátenme, mátenme,” Parias says. “Kill me.”

In the video, the ICE officer can be seen firing shortly after and Parias begins to scream: “Mi mano.” My hand.

Shortly after the shooting, the officer opens up his phone and sends a message. The content of the message is not visible in the footage.

Parias was hospitalized for nearly a week after the shooting, before being transported to jail.

Although a federal judge later ordered Parias released on bond, once he was released from the custody of the U.S. Marshals, he was immediately transferred to ICE custody on Nov. 24, pursuant to a detainer. He’s being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center.

Olguin wrote in his order that “the government’s decision to administratively detain Mr. Parias in Adelanto is when and where the constitutional violations began in this case.”

By placing Parias in immigration detention, Olguin wrote, the government “has jeopardized this court’s ability to try Mr. Parias in compliance with the demands of the Sixth Amendment” — which provides for a fair and speedy trial.

Parias’ attorneys filed a declaration citing challenges to Parias’ access to counsel resulting from his detention in Adelanto, which is at least a two hour drive from the defense counsel’s office in downtown L.A.

With less than three weeks before trial, Parias’ defense team had been unable to schedule any legal visits with Parias since the beginning of his ICE detention, Ortega said in a court filing. He cited the distance and difficulties scheduling a video-telephone conference with their client.

“Here, defendant’s detention in Adelanto has effectively denied him access to his counsel for nearly the entire month preceding trial,” Olguin wrote in his order. “In short, the obstacles and roadblocks that ICE has put in place at Adelanto make it difficult, if not impossible, for defendant to meet with his attorneys, and have caused defendant to suffer demonstrable prejudice or a substantial threat thereof.”

Olguin also noted that the government did not produce any discovery to the defense until Nov. 26, nearly a month after the initial request. He said the government “has continued to produce discovery to the defense well beyond the discovery cutoff.”

“Moreover, the prejudice to Mr. Parias has been exacerbated by the government’s conduct especially as it relates to meeting deadlines and producing discovery,” he wrote.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a3aa72d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/786x413+0+3/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2F52%2Fb91d35b640329afd7afcb972477a%2Fus-california-immigration-shooting-60708.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 04:57:15.308654

Here are the top immigration storylines from 2025:

February: A sweeping anti-illegal immigration bill becomes law

Gov. Ron DeSantis in February signed a comprehensive anti-illegal immigration package into law just hours after GOP lawmakers muscled it through the Legislature.

The law, SB-4C, created state-level penalties for entering Florida without proper documents, mandated the death penalty for a non-citizen convicted of a capital crime, nixed in-state tuition for undocumented college students, and demanded that all counties partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

DeSantis signs immigration bills less than an hour after lawmakers passed them

Despite the Legislature’s Republican supermajority, and repeated insistence that all GOP members wanted to carry out newly inaugurated President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, the legislation didn’t have an easy road.

The 2025 session under the leadership of Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Danny Perez, both Republicans, was marked by rare strife between legislative Republicans and the governor, who’d enjoyed vast power over the lawmaking branch throughout his time in office.

But, as DeSantis came off a brutal loss to Trump in Iowa and entered his final years as governor, Florida Republicans began to stray. This was illustrated first when Albritton and Perez unceremoniously adjourned the special session DeSantis called to debate immigration just 15 minutes after it began — killing all of his proposed legislation.

Then, during a second special session, they passed an anti-illegal immigration package called the TRUMP Act. This drew DeSantis’ ire in part because it handed chief immigration authority to the agriculture commissioner, prompting the governor to veto it and call a third special session.

This time, having integrated both the TRUMP Act and DeSantis’ original asks, the governor signed SB-4C into law just hours after it passed both chambers.

April: A U.S. citizen is arrested

Even after his mother begged while a supporter waved his U.S. birth certificate in court, 20-year-old U.S. citizen Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez was held for more than 24 hours in Leon County Jail under charges of illegally entering Florida.

Lopez-Gomez, who was born in Grady County, Georgia, was arrested by a Florida Highway Patrol trooper in April during a traffic stop for allegedly being a non-citizen who crossed the state border.

U.S.-born man held for ICE under Florida’s new anti-immigration law

This was false.

Although a Leon County judge examined the birth certificate and declared that she found no probable cause for the charge, made possible by SB-4C passed two months earlier, the state prosecutor insisted the court lacked jurisdiction over Lopez-Gomez’s release because ICE had formally asked the jail to hold him.

ICE is the federal agency in charge of immigration within the United States. Immigration is a federal power, although state and local authorities may assist in detention efforts.

Lopez-Gomez was a passenger in a car pulled over by Florida Highway Patrol for going 78 mph in a 65 mph zone. He was on his way to work from Cairo, Georgia, to Tallahassee.

The provision he was charged under — illegally entering Florida — has since been temporarily blocked by a federal judge.

June: A federal judge holds James Uthmeier in contempt

For the first time in recent history, a federal judge in June found Florida’s attorney general in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking the new state immigration law as illegitimate and unlawful.

Instead of footing James Uthmeier with fines or jail time, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered the state’s chief legal officer to submit biweekly reports on how many people were being arrested under the immigration law she’d blocked in April. Williams believed it should be zero.

Uthmeier had taken a slightly different view.

Federal judge holds AG James Uthmeier in contempt of court

Days after her initial ruling blocking police and prosecutors from arresting or charging undocumented immigrants for illegally entering the state, Uthmeier mailed letters to law enforcement agencies, sheriffs, and police chiefs. He wrote that he couldn’t stop them from making arrests under SB 4C for illegal entry to the state.

Gov. Ron DeSantis had signed SB 4C on Feb. 13, but Williams blocked its enforcement temporarily after the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state.

Still, law enforcement carried out arrests after Williams barred them from doing so. A Florida Highway Patrol trooper’s arrest of Juan Carlos Lopez-Gomez, a U.S. citizen from Georgia, garnered international attention after it was first reported by the Florida Phoenix.

An investigation by the Tampa Bay Times found that police, mostly other troopers, arrested 25 people on April 4, but didn’t find evidence of arrests after April 18. The second date is important because that is when Williams issued a second order clarifying that her suspension of the law applied to cops, which the state argued against, claiming that Uthmeier lacked authority to stop the arrests.

Uthmeier has since appealed the contempt ruling.

July: ‘Alligator Alcatraz’

President Donald Trump made a rare appearance alongside DeSantis and a host of Republican leaders in July to celebrate the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz,” Florida’s sprawling new migrant detention facility in the heart of the Everglades.

Built atop the near-defunct Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, with its 10,000-foot runway and remote location, “Alligator Alcatraz” became the nation’s first state-run detention center.

Trump says he wants other states to build migrant detention centers after Everglades tour

The federal government will reimburse up to $608 million of costs to construct and maintain the center and its up to 3,000 detainees.

The center quickly drew concerns from environmental activists, human rights groups, and Democrats, worrying that the facility harmed the surrounding fragile ecosystem, provided poor health care, and was operated largely in secrecy.

The Everglades center inspired other state-run centers to crop up nationwide, including Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer,” Nebraska’s “Cornhusker Clink,” and Louisiana’s “Louisiana Lockup.”

Later, Florida opened the “Deportation Depot” in Baker County and announced plans for a “Panhandle Pokey.”

October: DeSantis asks to “pull the plug” on H-1B visas

DeSantis in October directed Florida’s top higher education board to prevent state universities from hiring foreign specialty workers on H-1B visas.

He wanted the Board of Governors to fully “pull the plug” on these visas, which allow foreigners in specialty occupations to temporarily work in the United States.

DeSantis orders Board of Governors to ‘pull the plug’ on H-1B visas in universities

This came a month after President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee for future H-1B visa applications and amid his administration’s broader efforts to stop illegal immigration and roadblock non-Americans from working in the United States. It signaled Republicans’ push to not only crack down on illegal immigration, but to also stop certain legal immigration avenues.

As of June 30, more than 1,900 Florida employers sponsored more than 7,200 H-1B visa-holders, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. There were a total of 78 employers and 677 beneficiaries in the education sphere, with the University of Florida with the most H-1B beneficiaries at 156, followed by the University of Miami with 90 and the University of South Florida with 72.

H1-B visas have become a flashpoint in Republican circles, as party leaders like Trump and DeSantis urge less reliance on foreign labor while others insist that businesses need workers.

November: The visa for extraordinary talent is used by influencers and OnlyFans

The highly exclusive O-1B visa, reserved for foreigners with “extraordinary” artistic talents, has begun to be used by social media influencers, content creators, and even OnlyFans models.

OnlyFans is a pornographic website allowing users to directly engage, pay for, and request photos or videos of sex workers.

In 2018, immigration lawyer Jacob Sapochnick noticed that a massive influx of overseas social media influencers were trying to obtain these visas. But it wouldn’t be until 2020 that the San Diego attorney was contacted by an OnlyFans model.

The O1 visa is for ‘extraordinary’ talent: Among its users? Influencers and OnlyFans models

At first, he was skeptical.

Then he saw her monthly salary.

“She said, ‘Let me show you the backend of my platform.’ I looked, and she was making $250,000 a month,” Sapochnick told the Florida Phoenix in a zoom interview.

“I was like, oh my god. Okay. I can use that.”

She became Sapochnick’s first OnlyFans client to obtain the O-1B visa. In the next two years, Sapochnick represented influencers from places like China, Russia, and Canada — many of whom were fitness influencers “dabbling” in OnlyFans.

Sapochnick’s story isn’t unique — at least, not anymore. According to five other immigration lawyers across the country who spoke with the Phoenix, the immigration sphere began to slowly shift toward the digital world a decade ago before exploding amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

December: Human rights group alleges torture at Alligator Alcatraz, Krome

Two Florida migrant detention centers may have violated international standards by imposing conditions that could amount to torture of detainees, a human rights organization claimed in a December report.

Amnesty International, which operates in 150 countries, alleged in a 48-page report that the federal Krome North Services Processing Center in Miami and — to a greater degree — the state-run Everglades site the DeSantis administration calls “Alligator Alcatraz” have engaged in practices that could violate international law.

‘Copy of Guantánamo’: Human rights group alleges torture, inhumanity at ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’ Krome

Their accounts paint a disturbing picture of extended solitary confinement at Krome, a 2-by-2-foot punishment “box” — compared to a lion’s cage at a circus — complete with shackles in the Everglades, and poor medical conditions at both South Florida centers.

One detainee claimed there was a death at the Everglades site, although it “went unreported” because “there’s no way to know what actually happened to the person because we’re not registered in ICE’s system,” AI said.

The Florida governor’s office and the Department of Homeland Security deny wrongdoing and the existence of any non-compliant standards at the facilities. They insisted the report was a “fabrication” or a “hoax” that could rile up anti-ICE sentiment.

Refugee streams, in this framework, are not incidental outcomes of conflict but durable instruments embedded in it.
Weaponised refugee streams function as a standing system: one that does not require activation to retain effect.
[25] Refugee streams cross borders carrying obligations that liberal democracies cannot refuse without violating their own identity.
[26] Once refugee movement is weaponised, it ceases to be a humanitarian by-product and becomes a managed resource.","Human suffering scales efficiently when it is managed.

The weaponisation of refugees is a low-cost, high-leverage instrument for states able to tolerate ambiguity and export instability. Public vocabulary treats refugees as a humanitarian outcome. In practice, they are an operational resource. In modern conflict, displacement is not incidental; it is functional. When refugee movement is controlled and timed, it becomes a pressure vector that Western systems cannot neutralise without harming themselves. Not metaphorically. Not rhetorically. Practically. [1]

Refugees are increasingly easy to weaponise, to great effect and at a low cost. This is not because the refugees themselves are distressed assets, but because the systems that are targeted by those that wield refugees as weapons are constrained. The modern liberal democracy has a firm set of legal obligations, moral self-image, media exposure, and electoral sensitivity to ensure that the cost of displacement is absorbed internally by the receiving state. A good crisis should never be wasted. It is useful. If none exists, one can be produced. [2][3]

This logic depends on unresolved conflict. Frozen conflicts are particularly suited to it, preserving leverage while avoiding the obligation to decide. When a conflict does not conclude, refugee streams do not disappear. They are held in suspension. People remain abroad on temporary permits. Others live near ceasefire lines without security, property rights, or legal clarity. Return is discussed, but deferred. Integration is partial by design. Over time, this produces populations that can be mobilised again quickly and in large numbers, without coordination. The conflict itself does not need to resume. The pressure is already stored. [4][5]

This dynamic is particularly well understood in Moscow. Russian strategy has long favoured frozen conflicts precisely because they preserve leverage without incurring the cost of resolution. Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, Donbas, and Nagorno-Karabakh all functioned not merely as territorial disputes, but as reservoirs of instability, including controlled refugee and displacement flows that could be activated, redirected, or merely implied as circumstances required. Refugee streams, in this framework, are not incidental outcomes of conflict but durable instruments embedded in it.

Viktor Orbán required that his ally, the Slovak populist Robert Fico, secure victory. The objective was straightforward and time-bound. Orbán therefore selected one of the most cost-efficient instruments available in his hybrid activities toolbox: the deliberate creation of controlled refugee streams directed toward the Hungarian–Slovak border in the weeks preceding the vote. [6][7]

Hungary occupies a critical transit position on the Western Balkan route. Control over that position does not require constant enforcement. It requires discretion over when enforcement is applied and when it is relaxed. In early 2023, the Hungarian government released more than 1,500 convicted people-smugglers from Hungarian prisons, citing cost and overcrowding. Most were foreign nationals. They were instructed to leave Hungary within seventy-two hours. No credible mechanism ensured that they did. Trafficking capacity was returned to circulation at scale. [8][9]

At the same time, Hungarian authorities increasingly opted to issue temporary documentation to migrants rather than detain or return them. Enforcement remained rhetorically strict and operationally uneven. Movement followed deliberately relaxed enforcement, as it reliably does. [10]

Relocation required neither coercion nor formal instruction. It required permissiveness, direction, and the provision of false hope. False hope is useful, and eases logistics.

In the months preceding Slovakia’s election on 30 September 2023, migrant presence became increasingly visible in southern Slovak border communities. Groups appeared with regularity. The visibility was new. The timing was precise. Slovak authorities later recorded the scale: more than 27,000 irregular migrants detained in 2023, a ninefold increase from the previous year. The majority were young men travelling north along the Balkan route, transiting Serbia through Hungary and into Slovakia. [11][12]

Migration had already been identified as a decisive political issue. Robert Fico’s SMER-SSD party campaigned explicitly on restoring order and opposing immigration, framing the sitting government as incapable of border control. The sudden, localised visibility of migrants supplied confirmation rather than argument. The crisis did not need exaggeration. It merely needed to exist. [13]

The physical movement was reinforced with an information operation. During late summer 2023, Hungary’s Prime Minister’s Office placed approximately 1.6–1.8 million anti-migration video advertisements into Slovakia via YouTube, a country of 5.5 million inhabitants. The ads depicted migrants breaching fences and Hungarian forces “defending Europe”. Formally categorised as non-political issue messaging, they reached Slovak audiences at scale while refugee streams were being created on the ground. [14][15]

Slovak officials recognised the sequence. Former defence minister Jaroslav Naď publicly stated that Hungary had interfered in Slovakia’s electoral process by deliberately elevating migration as a political issue. Others reached the same conclusion privately. No documentation was required. The sequence was sufficient. [16]

The election produced the intended result. Fico formed a government. Within days, police and military units were deployed to the Hungarian border and routine Schengen procedures were suspended. Within weeks, the situation was declared resolved. Migrant visibility diminished accordingly. Hungary simultaneously tightened its own enforcement once the political objective had been achieved. The controlled refugee streams were throttled. The operation concluded without residue. [17]

Viktor Orbán did not invent this method, but he applied it with discipline.

The receiving state absorbed the cost: public anxiety, municipal strain, media saturation, and electoral pressure. Hungary absorbed none of it, while continuing to present itself as Europe’s defender. The intervention required no secrecy, no escalation, and no formal coordination. It relied on timing, permissiveness, and a neighbouring system structurally incapable of externalising humanitarian pressure. [18]

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan operates the same instrument at continental scale, with an added refinement: availability on demand. [19]

Turkey hosts several million refugees, primarily from Syria. This alone does not constitute leverage. The leverage lies in Ankara’s ability to weaponise refugee streams on demand by controlling onward movement and signalling when that control may be withdrawn. Erdoğan does not need to relocate refugees. He needs only to regulate permeability, and to make credible that such regulation can cease at will. [20][21]

This has been demonstrated repeatedly. At moments of political friction with the European Union, Ankara has allowed refugee movement toward Greece to accelerate, slowed it when concessions were secured, and threatened its release when negotiations stalled. Sometimes movement followed. Sometimes it did not. The outcome was largely the same. European governments adjusted funding, softened criticism, and recalibrated policy to reduce domestic exposure. [22][23]

The pressure was never framed as coercion. No ultimatums were issued. No formal demands were tabled. Instead, it was presented in humanitarian terms: capacity limits, fatigue, financial burden. Turkey did not describe refugee streams as a political choice. It described them as inevitability. The streams themselves performed the argument, while European political systems processed the consequences internally. [24]

From Ankara’s perspective, this is a near-ideal instrument. It is controllable, reversible, and deployable on demand. No treaty is formally violated. No military threshold is crossed. Yet policy shifts repeatedly in Turkey’s favour. The key point is not the absence of coercion, but the absence of any need for it. Weaponised refugee streams function as a standing system: one that does not require activation to retain effect. The credible availability of movement is sufficient to shape policy inside European states without Turkey having to cross any formal threshold at all. [25]

Refugee streams cross borders carrying obligations that liberal democracies cannot refuse without violating their own identity. Courts intervene. Media amplifies. Municipal budgets strain. Coalition politics fracture. Elections polarise. The enabling actor remains external to consequence, while the receiving state disciplines itself.[26]

Once refugee movement is weaponised, it ceases to be a humanitarian by-product and becomes a managed resource. Controlled refugee streams can be stored, released, paused, resumed, or merely signalled. They do not need to be activated to retain effect. They need only to remain unresolved and available. [27]

In this context, crises are not anomalies to be avoided, but conditions to be governed. Some are prolonged because they continue to generate leverage. Others are stabilised just enough to prevent resolution. A crisis that already exists and produces pressure is a good crisis, and good crises should never be wasted. [28]

When no such crisis is available, one can be produced without fabrication. Conditions are adjusted rather than events invented. Enforcement is relaxed selectively. Movement is redirected. Visibility is increased at moments of political sensitivity. The crisis does not need to be large or continuous. It needs only to be legible to systems that cannot refuse to respond. [29]

This is why the weaponisation of refugee streams is so effective. It produces consequence without escalation and pressure without violation. It allows one actor to remain formally compliant while another absorbs cost internally through law, media, administration, and electoral politics. Nothing illegal is required. Nothing dramatic needs to occur. The burden is carried entirely by the receiving system. [30]

Nothing about this is new. Those who see refugees as useful instruments will weaponise them, and if no crisis exists to enable it, one will be created.

Happy New Years.

You include a wealth of detail about the life of a migrant worker in Dubai. What inspired you to write the story, and how did you go about researching it?

I lived in Dubai as a child and took ice-skating lessons there. I was so terrible at it that the instructor actually recommended to my mother that I give it up. I’d repressed this, naturally, until I went skating again as an adult in late 2022. I was still terrible, but my then partner was an excellent skater, and I loved watching him zip around the rink. Around the same time, the FIFA World Cup was being held in Qatar. I began to see stories in the news about the many laborers who’d died in the Gulf while working on infrastructure projects ramping up to the World Cup. The causes of death spanned from heatstroke to suicide. From there, I began to imagine two lives, two men—one who spent his time in the cold and the other in the heat. For research, I watched investigative documentaries and videos on YouTube that had been uploaded by men who lived in worker accommodations. I read whatever I could find about illegal recruitment fees and the other labor-related binds that migrant workers often find themselves in. I also went skating a few more times, with a friend who very kindly held my hand as we made our rounds. I often write stories in a burst, all at once, but this story came slowly, line by line.

The two men meet different fates, not so much thanks to luck but because one man has a greater awareness of the risks of the job and knows what to ask in advance. The narrative addresses the idea of predestination and, in a way, debunks it. Was that part of your plan for it from the beginning?

I can see where the next paragraph will go only when I’m standing on the precipice of it. So, no, I didn’t have much of a plan when I started, though I was drawn to the image of an inexperienced skater holding on to the side barrier of a rink and watching, mesmerized, as an experienced skater speeds across the ice. I was writing toward that scene, which, now that I’m thinking about it, might itself have the motif of two different fates: mobility and stasis, confidence and shame. I had also been reading Anne Carson’s translations of Euripides’ tragedies at the time. There is a line from “Herakles” that still haunts me: “In an instant, luck changes. / In an instant, children die.” I say this to point out all the ingredients on the counter.

Though the men are both manual laborers, they come from different circumstances. Yogan is from outside Lucknow, in northern India, and has a more provincial background; Samar, who is more worldly, is from Mumbai, to the south. Do those distinctions hold or become irrelevant once they reach Dubai?

I have always felt that distinctions between people from the same country fade when they come to a new place. What you have in common, as outsiders, is greater than what initially set you apart. What Yogan and Samar recognize in each other early on is a desire to better the conditions of the women they love, their families. They’re men in their twenties, just stepping into a new stage of life. They’re excited to talk about their wives, their dreams, their clothes! That is so much more interesting to them in that moment of meeting than where they’ve come from.

Yogan and Samar and their roommates arrive in Dubai with a limited sense of what awaits them, much of it gleaned from vloggers online. Their visions of their lives and their potential futures seem to draw more on what they’ve seen in Bollywood movies, which are a driving force in the story. Does Bollywood have that degree of influence?

Oh, yes! I am thinking particularly about the slate of films that came out in the late nineties and early two-thousands. The Bollywood dimension of this story took me by surprise, since I was never a film person and used to feel embarrassed by the big musical numbers, which were always about two people finally coming together in a large, familial display of affection and acceptance. I used to watch these movies with my parents, and something about their overly chaste rituals of romance felt even more suggestive to me than an onscreen kiss would have. I suppose I also didn’t want my parents to know how much I actually enjoyed watching these saccharine love stories! Which is to say that these films got into my bloodstream despite my resistance. In writing Yogan and Samar, who are both so earnest, I began to wonder how their lives would be different if, unlike me, they’d wholeheartedly embraced these films and their sentimentality, taking cues from the screen heroes to fuel their own courage and ambition and courtships. Where else do we learn what our lives could look like if not from movies (and books, of course)?

This is very rich territory for fiction. Did you consider writing a novel-length version of this story, or was it always intended as a short-form piece?

I think it was always going to be a story, though I definitely worried when it seemed to keep getting longer.

You have been working on your first novel. Does it relate in any way to “The Ice-Skater”? How challenging was it to make the leap from writing short fiction to a book-length narrative?

My novel, which I’ve just finished, unfolds over a few days in an apartment in Mumbai where two women—a college student and her childhood nanny—meet again after many years apart. The novel explores the strange, intimate relationship between them, a complicated kind of love; their bond is almost like that of a mother and daughter, but in a much more latent way. The book is divided into two parts, one told from the perspective of the student and one from the perspective of the former nanny. In order to make writing the novel seem less daunting to myself, I thought of it as two novellas side-by-side. Having the narrative take place within a limited time frame helped with that, too. After having written stories for so long, I’m still getting used to the roominess of a novel, how both characters and author have so much space in which to breathe. As I work on edits, I catch myself jumping through time the way I would in a story, in a single clause or with a line break, and then I realize that I can slow down, I can show the weather changing—such luxury! The substance of the novel is very different from “The Ice-Skater,” but I can see that it engages with similar ideas about immigration and what we might owe to those we’ve left behind in our home countries. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/694984ae17a442d99f43a62d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TNY_This_Week_In_Fiction_Kanak-Kapur.jpg",N,,2025-12-29 04:57:19.870859

ADA

Special Needs Children; Pro Se Litigation

Plaintiff appealed the dismissal of her pro se complaint seeking relief under the ADA regarding the education received by her special needs children.

Where Title II did not permit individual liability and where parents could not litigate such claims on behalf of their children pro se, the district court correctly dismissed plaintiff’s complaint.

Judgment is affirmed.

Criminal Law

Assault

Accessory After the Fact; Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to being an accessory after the fact to a fatal assault. After defendant pled guilty, the district court varied upward from the Guidelines range.

Where the district court properly applied the statutory sentencing factors and justified its upward variance based on the circumstances of defendant’s offense, there was no abuse of sentencing discretion.

Judgment is affirmed.

Assaulting a Federal Officer

Multiplicity; Sufficiency of Evidence

Defendant appealed his conviction on one count of assaulting a federal officer. Defendant faced five counts, with each count involving a different federal officer. Defendant argued that his charge on one count was redundant because his contact with that victim arose from his assault of two other officers. The district court denied the motion, arguing that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant took separate actions against each officer.

Where the record evidence showed that defendant assaulted each officer separately and successively, there was no error dismissing one of defendant’s charges.

Judgment is affirmed.

Attempted Sex Trafficking

Admission of Officer’s Lay Testimony; Denial of Downward Variance

Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for attempted sex trafficking of a child and destruction of evidence, challenging the district court’s admission of the undercover officer’s lay opinion testimony, the denial of defendant’s motion to contact a juror, and the denial of a downward variance based on defendant’s claims of sentencing manipulation.

Where the undercover agent had testified about her text message conversations with defendant and based her testimony on her law enforcement training and knowledge of child sex-trafficking, such testimony was permissible lay opinion testimony to help the jury determine whether defendant believed he was conversing with an underage girl. Furthermore, defendant’s allegations about potential outside influence on the jury was mere conjecture. Finally, there was no sentencing manipulation by law enforcement in making the fake profile 13 years old to target individuals who preyed on younger children.

Drug and Money Laundering Offenses

Plea Agreement; Appeal Waiver

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following her guilty plea to drug offenses and money laundering pursuant to a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver.

Where the appeal waiver was valid and enforceable, defendant was barred from raising sentencing challenges. Defendant also could not assert ineffective assistance of counsel claims due to her failure to move for substitution of counsel.

Appeal is dismissed.

Felon in Possession of Firearm

Career Offender Classification; Sentencing Enhancement

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm, challenging the district court’s imposition of a sentencing enhancement after classifying defendant as a career offender. Defendant contended that the current Guidelines violated his constitutional rights.

Where past and present versions of the Guidelines included attempt in their definitions of crimes of violence, there was no error in designating defendant a career offender.

Firearm Offense

Voluntariness of Plea Agreement; Appeal Waiver

Defendant appealed his conviction for a firearm offense pursuant to a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver, challenging the voluntariness of his plea.

Where defendant was precluded from challenging his plea due to his failure to seek to withdraw it, the court was constrained to dismiss the appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.

Interstate Transport of Stolen Property

Upward Variance; Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to interstate transport of stolen property, arguing that the district court’s upward variance imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence.

Where the uncontested facts supported the district court’s characterization of defendant’s crime as “well-planned,” and where the district court cited defendant’s prior criminal history, there was no abuse of discretion in varying upward.

Judgment is affirmed.

Murder for Hire

Deceased Witness’s Statements; Hearsay

Defendant appealed his conviction for murder for hire and conspiracy, challenging the district court’s denial of his motion to question police about the statements of a deceased witness, which the district court had ruled were inadmissible hearsay.

Where the record contained overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt, any error in failing to permit the requested questioning was harmless.

Judgment is affirmed.

U.S. v. Cutler (MLW No. 84133/Case No. 24-2324 – 4 pages) (U.S. Court of Appeals, 8th Circuit, per curiam) Appealed from U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, White, J.

Sentence Reduction

Eligibility; Mandatory Term of Imprisonment

Defendant appealed the denial of his request for a sentence reduction. Defendant was convicted of federal crimes in Montana and South Dakota, with his sentences set to run consecutively. After amendments to the First Step Act, defendant requested a reduction of his South Dakota sentence. The district court ordered briefing on whether defendant had served at least ten years “of the term of imprisonment.” After briefing, the district court concluded that he had not and thus was ineligible for a sentence reduction.

Where defendant had been sentenced to consecutive sentences and thus had only just started his South Dakota sentence, which was imposed after his Montana sentence, the district court correctly determined that he had not yet served at least ten years of the South Dakota sentence he wished to reduce, as eligibility focused on the term which a defendant wished to reduce, not how long they had spent incarcerated on their aggregate sentence.

Judgment is affirmed.

Supervised Release

Revocation; Substantive Reasonableness of Sentence

Defendant appealed the sentence imposed following the revocation of his supervised release, challenging the substantive reasonableness of the revocation sentence.

Where the district court properly considered the statutory sentencing factors and imposed a below-Guidelines sentence, there was no abuse of sentencing discretion.

Judgment is affirmed.

Immigration

Asylum

Withholding of Removal; Administrative Exhaustion

Petitioner sought review of the BIA’s order upholding an IJ’s denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.

Where petitioner had failed to exhaust her claims of past persecution, the BIA properly deemed them waived, and petitioner’s future persecution claims also failed where she failed to exhaust the issue of whether internal relocation in Guatemala would be reasonable.

Petition for review denied.

Municipal

Business Closure

Fourteenth Amendment; Regulatory Taking

Plaintiffs appealed the grant of summary judgment to defendants. Defendants closed plaintiff’s inn due to various fire code violations that had not been remedied despite multiple warnings and a fire at the property. Plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that the closure order violated their Fourteenth Amendment rights and alternatively constituted an uncompensated regulatory taking.

Where plaintiffs failed to show a deprivation of their procedural due process rights because the municipal regulations were sufficiently specific and provided for adequate post-deprivation due process due to the imminent danger posed by the code violations, there was no procedural violation, and the closure constituted a lawful exercise of the city’s police powers.

Judgment is affirmed.

Negligence

Plane Crash

Negligent Maintenance; Covenant Not to Use

The government appealed the district court’s denial of summary judgment. The plaintiff’s decedent was conducting an FAA checkride when his plane crashed, killing him. His spouse filed, suit, alleging that the government negligently maintained the plane. The government moved for summary judgment, invoking a covenant not to sue that the decedent had signed as an independent contractor to use government airplanes. The district court invalidated the covenant as against public policy.

Where the decedent was familiar with the covenant and, as an independent contractor, was not obligated to use government airplanes, and where the provision of airplanes was not a public or essential service, the district court erred in concluding that the covenant violated public policy.

(This story is part of an ongoing series on TiE New York by Darmin Bachu, a community activist with expertise in nonprofit governance and entrepreneurship.)

By Darmin Bachu

A lawsuit alleging governance failures, fiduciary breaches, and misconduct within TiE New York was filed in Queens County Supreme Court more than a month before the organization’s annual gala, according to newly reviewed court records. The filings raise fresh questions about what TiE New York’s leadership knew — and when — amid an escalating internal dispute that has now moved firmly into the judicial arena.

Court documents show that the lawsuit, brought by charter member Kesav Dama both individually and derivatively on behalf of TiE New York, was formally filed on November 11, 2025, and entered into the court system by November 14, 2025, weeks before the organization’s high-profile gala event.

According to individuals familiar with the matter and confirmed by service records referenced in the court filings, 10 of the 12 named defendants were served with legal papers at the TiE New York Gala.

The defendants include current and former board members and officers, among them then-President Jignesh Patel, Secretary Vaibhav Parikh, and multiple directors. TiE New York itself is named as both a nominal and direct defendant.

The gala — typically a celebratory fundraising and networking event — thus became the backdrop for the formal notification of litigation alleging that TiE NY’s board failed to act on repeated warnings about misconduct and governance violations.

Legal experts note that while service at a public event is unusual, it is not improper if defendants are otherwise difficult to serve or regularly appear together at scheduled functions.

Nature of the claims

The verified complaint asserts multiple causes of action, including breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, defamation, tortious interference with business relationships, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The claims center on allegations that TiE NY leadership:

Failed to investigate or discipline alleged misconduct by its president despite repeated written complaints;

Issued what the plaintiff characterizes as an improper and demeaning demand for evidence as a delaying tactic;

Allowed internal communications that allegedly defamed a charter member to remain uncorrected; and

Continued governance and election activities while litigation was imminent or already underway.

The lawsuit is brought in part under New York Not-for-Profit Corporation Law §720, which governs director and officer fiduciary duties.

Order to Show Cause

Alongside the complaint, the plaintiff filed an Order to Show Cause, seeking immediate court intervention. The requested relief includes:

Prohibiting TiE New York from spending organizational funds to defend the lawsuit;

Halting board elections or changes to election rules;

Preserving and producing board minutes and governing documents; and

Staying major governance actions pending judicial review.

Justice Karina E. Alomar of the Queens County Supreme Court signed the Order to Show Cause, initially setting a hearing for December 18, 2025, according to the court’s docket.

Court records further show that Jignesh Patel requested an adjournment of the December 18 hearing, which was subsequently delayed to December 22, 2025. The reason cited was the need for additional time following service and to prepare a response to the requested emergency relief.

The adjournment came as questions mounted about whether TiE NY leadership continued routine operations — including board activity and event planning — after the lawsuit had been filed and served.

The litigation marks a significant escalation from what began as an internal governance dispute. As previously reported, the complainant had submitted formal written complaints and demand letters weeks earlier, urging the immediate suspension of the president and warning of potential legal exposure if the board failed to act.

Newly reviewed records indicate that the complainant, through counsel, complied with requests for evidence within a compressed timeframe — yet the board allegedly declined to take disciplinary action prior to the lawsuit being filed.

By the time defendants were served at the gala, the dispute had already shifted from internal review to judicial oversight.

Governance transparency under scrutiny

Nonprofit governance specialists note that derivative lawsuits, especially those seeking to halt elections and restrict use of organizational funds, are among the most serious legal challenges a nonprofit board can face.

“Once an Order to Show Cause is granted, the court is signaling that the allegations merit immediate attention,” said one nonprofit governance attorney not involved in the case. “It also raises legitimate questions about whether directors are acting independently or protecting incumbents.”

The timing of service at the gala, combined with the delayed hearing request, may now become part of a broader factual record examined by the court.

TiE New York and the individual defendants have not publicly commented on the litigation. Requests for comment were not returned by press time.

As the case unfolds, it places renewed focus on transparency, accountability, and fiduciary responsibility within one of the region’s most prominent entrepreneurial nonprofit organizations — now facing scrutiny not only from its members, but from the courts.

(WFLA) — The Pinellas-Hillsborough Interfaith Coalition, a branch of the Florida Interfaith Coalition, along with other groups, is calling for changes to immigration enforcement across the state and the nation.

The groups have been holding weekly vigils to bring attention to their cause.

Reverend Wesley Snedeker of the Church of the Isles, United Church of Christ, is one of the organizers of the weekly vigils. He said the coalition’s most pressing request is to provide pastoral care to those being detained at Alligator Alcatraz, the migrant detention center near the Everglades.

“We’re seeing the separation of families,” Snedeker said.

“There have been reports of human rights abuses in state detention facilities, especially the one that has been called Alligator Alcatraz,” he said.

In mid-July, some migrants told The Associated Press they were being held in what they described as “zoo cages,” adding they were given toilets that would not flush, along with insects surrounding them and worms in their food. Shortly after, Florida Division of Emergency Management officials said those claims were false.

Protesters such as Brandt Robinson are also calling for an end to the detainment and deportation of non-violent criminals.

“The vast majority of undocumented immigrants to our country are doing the kinds of things that, frankly, a lot of us American citizens don’t want to do for a living,” Robinson said. “If you’re harvesting fruits and vegetables, if you’re processing our nation’s meat supplies, if you’re building the homes.”

Snedeker added to Robinson’s concern.

“Many of those folks end up living here in the United States as island citizens, working and paying taxes, who don’t have run-ins with law enforcement,” Snedeker said. “And these are some of the same folks that we’re seeing, who are detained.”

Since the beginning of President Trump’s second term, the White House has said entering the country illegally is the initial crime.

“If you are an individual, a foreign national who illegally enters the United States of America, you are by definition a criminal, so therefore you are subject to deportation,” a White House official said.

Lieutenant Governor Jay Collins has also been open about his stance on assisting the federal government.

“That doesn’t mean we don’t have empathy,” Collins said. “That means we have to follow through it, which we told them we were going to do. People ran on the ballot to solve these problems, and if they aren’t putting those actions, those words into action, what are they doing?”

A Turkish man who pleaded guilty to alien smuggling in a US federal court has exposed the growing reach of Turkish-run syndicates moving migrants into the United States through both the Mexican and Canadian borders.

The criminal complaint against Serkan Gökce, a Turkish national with prior US immigration violations, reveals a structured network relying on handlers in Canada, digital coordination via WhatsApp and prearranged pick-ups along remote border roads in upstate New York.

According to the complaint filed in the Northern District of New York, US Border Patrol agents detected movement near the Canadian border shortly before 3 a.m. on April 18, 2025. Remote sensor imagery captured several individuals walking through the woods toward the intersection of Scriver and Bush Road in Mooers Forks, an isolated crossing point known for frequent smuggling activity.

When agents arrived, they found three Turkish nationals who immediately admitted they had crossed into the US without legal documents. All three were taken into custody.

As the migrants were being processed, an agent observed a dark sedan behaving suspiciously near the same intersection. The vehicle slowed as if anticipating a rendezvous, then sped away. Agents followed and stopped the driver, identified as Gökce, who claimed he was trying to get to Plattsburgh, a statement inconsistent with his location, which matched the migrants’ description of the planned pick-up point.

The criminal complaint filed against a Turkish national for smuggling migrants into the United States:

At the Border Patrol station, one of the migrants, identified as D.C., agreed to a search of his phone. WhatsApp messages revealed he shared live GPS coordinates with Gökce throughout the crossing. D.C. also identified a Canada-based facilitator named T.Y., who arranged the smuggling operation and instructed migrants to look for a waiting Honda Civic, the same model Gökce was driving.

The three men apprehended with Gökce were not newcomers to illegal border crossings. Homeland Security records showed that all had previously been arrested for entering the United States illegally, two in Tecate, California, after crossing from Mexico in 2023, and one in El Paso, Texas, who later moved to Canada before attempting re-entry.

D.C. admitted he had earlier entered the US illegally from Mexico, lived there, then moved to Canada, from which he sought to re-enter the United States through an organized smuggling route run by Turkish nationals in Montreal and across the Quebec–New York border. He told investigators he paid $1,500 to T.Y. in Canada, and another $1,500 was to be paid to Gökce after the successful pick-up.

The arrangement mirrors patterns US authorities have increasingly documented since 2023: Turkish migrants paying large sums to well-organized cross-border facilitators who exploit the relative openness of the US–Canada frontier and the heavily trafficked Mexico routes.

Gökce himself had a known history with US immigration authorities. He was previously arrested in El Paso in 2022 and issued a Notice to Appear after entering the United States unlawfully. The new complaint shows he later became involved in transporting migrants, serving as a driver instructed to retrieve border crossers based on real-time digital location updates.

The case, signed by US Magistrate Judge Gary L. Favro and sworn by Border Patrol Agent Chase D. Beatty, offers a rare inside look at how Turkish smuggling networks operate with logistical hubs in Mexico, Canada and Turkey and use US borderlands as staging grounds for coordinated, technology-enabled crossings.

Gökce pleaded guilty to federal alien-smuggling charges, a felony that carries significant prison time. His cooperation, according to sources familiar with similar cases, may assist investigators in mapping a broader transnational smuggling structure that has moved thousands of Turkish nationals into the United States in recent years.

US immigration enforcement data reveal a dramatic rise in the number of Turkish nationals entering the United States over the past five years. The shift reflects a fundamental change in Turkey’s outward migration patterns, driven by political repression, economic instability and the rapid expansion of transcontinental smuggling pipelines stretching from Istanbul to Mexico and Central America.

US Customs and Border Protection data show that encounters with Turkish nationals at US borders surged to 18,986 in fiscal year (FY) 2023, which runs from October 2022 to September 2023, before easing to 13,311 in FY 2024 and then falling further to 5,192 in FY 2025. In FY 2026 encounters with Turks stood at 304 so far.

In fiscal year 2024, according to official data, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 37 Turkish nationals on criminal convictions, pending criminal charges or other immigration violations. The figure for fiscal year 2025 stands at 10 so far. Detentions involving Turkish nationals totaled 707 in FY 2024 and rose to 1,198 in FY 2025. In terms of removals, ICE deported 547 Turkish nationals in FY 2024, compared with 151 removals recorded in FY 2025.

The trajectory points to a sharp spike in irregular migration by Turkish citizens in 2023, followed by a marked decline over the subsequent two years, a shift that coincides with tighter border controls, changing smuggling routes and evolving US enforcement practices, while still leaving Turkish nationals as a visible component of non-traditional migration flows at the border.

Meanwhile, the Turkish government’s crackdown on human smugglers under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has remained largely ineffective. Most investigations have ended in dismissals, acquittals or the release of suspects, including individuals who profit from migrant smuggling in partnership with international criminal syndicates, underscoring the persistent failure to hold key actors accountable.

Publicly, Turkish authorities continue to boast about the number of detentions, prosecutions and court cases involving migrant smuggling. In practice, however, convictions remain rare, and the criminal justice system appears to have failed to stem the flow of illegal migration.

According to Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya, who briefed lawmakers in parliament on November 17, 2025, 3,627 migrant smugglers were arrested in 2025. In 2024 Yerlikaya announced a comparable figure, stating that 3,924 individuals were arrested in connection with migrant smuggling. The near-identical arrest numbers from one year to the next suggest that the government’s strategy of targeting organizers has failed to produce any meaningful deterrent effect.

Rather than declining, the caseload in Turkey’s judicial system continues to expand. According to the latest available data from the Justice Ministry, 26,314 prosecutions related to migrant and human smuggling were underway nationwide, involving 45,976 suspects. In 2024 alone prosecutors launched 13,140 new investigations, targeting 19,735 suspects.

Of these cases, 15,424 were brought before criminal courts, charging 32,538 suspects, while 7,776 new cases were filed in criminal courts in 2024 alone. At the appellate level, the dysfunction is even more apparent: More than 700 convictions were overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeals in the same year, further weakening the judicial response.

Taken together, the figures underscore a systemic failure under the government of President Erdogan. Despite thousands of arrests and a growing prosecutorial backlog, migrant-smuggling networks, often operating in coordination with international criminal syndicates, continue to function with near impunity, highlighting the gap between official rhetoric and meaningful enforcement.",https://nordicmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251105__83376G4__v1__MidRes__UsMexicoBorderSecurity.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 20:56:19.886997

The federal government, offering up to $280 million, has recently signed at least two contracts with private surveillance firms to hunt down immigrants at their homes and places of work, according to various reports.

One of the companies, BI Incorporated, is a subsidiary of GEO Group, a for-profit prison company that currently does business with the government jailing detained immigrants, according to The Intercept.

Trump administration proposals to use private tracking and investigative services have been circulating for months. Lawmakers in two states, Missouri and Mississippi, introduced legislation to create their own bounty hunter programs, but those bills stalled.

The new federal contracts broaden the administration’s use of the private sector in immigration enforcement. For instance, BI Incorporated has had past government contracts in immigrant surveillance with ankle monitor-based tracking.

The new contracts, one of which goes to a company called AI Solutions 87, mostly seek software and artificial intelligence investigative services, but the door is open for on-the-ground tracking. However, reporting by The Intercept and 404 Media suggests once the immigrant targets are pinpointed, federal agents would move in to detain and arrest them.

In requesting bids, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was looking for private “Skip Tracing and Process Serving Services using Government furnished case data with identifiable information, commercial data verification and physical observation services . . .”

In general, skip tracing is the process of tracking down people who are missing, unresponsive, or hard to find, according to Bosco Legal Services. Often, the practice is used to find individuals who have unpaid debts or failed to meet other obligations and may have “skipped” town.

ICE considered “performance-based incentives” for the contractors, but the final proposal for request apparently did not include bonus language or specific per-head bounties, according to Snopes, nor did it include the term “bounty hunter.”

But the contracts call for hunting down people for money.

“Under ICE’s proposed system, vendors would be given 10,000 noncitizens to identify, verify, and/or serve with documents, with a potential to receive ‘further increments of 10,000 aliens,’” according to the Immigration Policy Tracking Project.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., a senior member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has been an outspoken critic of the private tracking program, which he said “would effectively establish a ‘bounty hunter’ model.”

He sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing “grave concern” about the initiative, according to his office.

Krishnamoorthi warned the proposal would “outsource one of the government’s most coercive powers to actors who operate with little oversight and limited public accountability.” He wrote that such an arrangement “risks creating an enforcement apparatus that functions beyond the reach of ordinary checks and balances.”

“When citizens can no longer discern who acts in the name of government, trust gives way to fear,” he added. “A government that rules through confusion and coercion rather than law and consent erodes its own legitimacy and the freedoms it exists to protect.”

Some of the tactics of federal agents and officials have already come under fire at times as overly aggressive, lacking due process and failing to clarify who the enforcers work for. In some cases, U.S. citizens and immigrants with legal authority to be in the country have been jailed for days with little or no information as to why they were detained.

The bills in Missouri and Mississippi appeared to be bonified bounty hunter proposals, with a $1,000 reward for assisting in the arrest of an undocumented immigrant.

“I’m finding a tremendous amount of support. It’s actually gaining support across the country,” state Sen. David Gregory, a Republican from St. Louis, told Newsweek early this year.

That didn’t happen. The two bills, which were similar, went nowhere.

The legislation also had language that allowed law enforcement in the states to assist the federal government in enforcing immigration violations. Yet Gregory, the author of the Missouri bill, noted police departments are stretched thin.

“The federal government, ICE, has been asking, in fact, begging for support from the state and local law enforcement officers across the entire country,” Gregory said. “So, part of this bill is the framework that requires that cooperation, number one.”

“But number two, what we’re looking for is some sort of supplement, some sort of augmentation to the program, because a lot of major cities across the country are short on police. We’re already short. We’re already overwhelmed.”

The United States has had a checkered history deploying bounty hunters, who at times were compensated for capturing, or killing, individuals. This notably happened during the Civil War with enlistment bounties to track down deserters. Governments in the expanding country offered money for Native American scalps in the 16th through 19th centuries.

In recent and far less violent times, bail bondsmen have employed private detectives and bounty hunters to track down bail jumpers, and the U.S. Department of Justice has rewarded whistleblowers who uncover immigration violations in the workplace.

There are laws across the country that allow intervener lawsuits with potential payouts for the third parties, including a statute in Texas that “deputizes” citizens to sue people providing or aiding in an abortion.

The tracking contracts focus solely on immigrants. Right now, a lot of news media and citizens are monitoring immigration enforcement by federal officials.

No doubt that focus will be extended to this new high-tech immigrant tracking chapter.

A series of immigration raids across California in 2025 had one thing in common: Most of the federal agents detaining people wore masks over their faces.

In January, the state of California and its largest county will ban law enforcement officers from covering their faces, with a few exceptions, putting local and state police at odds with masked immigration agents.

The state law gives law enforcement officers a choice: If they cover their faces, they lose the ability to assert “qualified immunity,” the doctrine that protects officers from individual liability for their actions. That means they can be sued for assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest or malicious prosecution, and the law adds a clause that says the minimum penalty for committing those offenses while wearing a mask is $10,000.

Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Democrat who co-authored the law, said it was necessary to rein in anonymous federal agents.

“We initially were under the understanding that, oh, they’re only targeting folks who were not citizens,” Gonzalez said, “And then actually over time, you learn they don’t give a s— who you are, they’re attacking you no matter what, with no due process.”

The Trump administration has sued to block the bill, and more than a century of federal court precedent is on its side. An 1890 Supreme Court case provides that a state cannot prosecute a federal law enforcement officer acting in the course of their duties.

The Trump administration said in its brief to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that forcing agents to reveal their identities would put the agents at risk.

During Immigration and Customs Enforcement “actions, individuals can be heard threatening to doxx and find out who officers and their family members are and where they live,” the administration’s lawyers said in the Nov. 17 brief. “There are even public websites that seek and publish personal information about ICE and other federal officers to harass and threaten them and their families.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law, said the issue may not be as cut-and-dried as one or two Supreme Court cases. He pointed to a 2001 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that allowed the case of a federal sniper who killed a woman during the 1992 Ruby Ridge, Idaho, standoff to go to trial.

“It basically says that a federal officer can be criminally prosecuted for unreasonable actions,” Chemerinsky said. “Federal officers, by virtue of being federal officers, do not get immunity from all state civil and criminal laws.”

Brian Marvel, president of an organization that represents California police unions, said the law will make life harder for local cops and county sheriffs’ deputies. The organizations that represent police chiefs, sheriffs, agents in the Attorney General’s office and California Highway Patrol officers opposed the law too.

“I think that the state has put us in a tenuous position with this battle they’re having with the Trump administration,” said Marvel, of the Peace Officers Research Association of California. “We don’t want to be in the middle of this fight. But unfortunately, (with) the desire for higher name recognition and elections in 2026, they decided to create things that are much more political and not geared toward legitimate public safety issues.”

Marvel said another drawback of the law is giving “a false sense of hope to the immigrant community in California” that the law will force federal agents to leave the state.

Los Angeles County supervisors have also approved a local mask ban on law enforcement for unincorporated areas of the county, a measure that will go into effect in mid-January, unless a court decision comes sooner.

Gonzalez noted that masks have played a significant role in recent California history. First, during the pandemic, California temporarily made masks mandatory in public and at work. Then, a couple of years later, a rush of smash-and-grab robberies were harder to solve because the suspects all wore masks. Now, California finds itself in its third back-and-forth over face coverings.

The law provides exemptions for N-95 or medical-grade masks to prevent infection transmission, and permits undercover operatives to wear a mask.

“This is specifically aimed to federal agents because we gotta combat these kidnappings somehow,” Gonzalez said, “and this was our way in.”

The Supreme Court’s emergency docket is designed as a way for parties in lower court proceedings to seek a pause of that court’s ruling or injunction, and the justices typically reject most petitions they receive. Through the first 11 months of the second Trump administration, the high court has received more than 30 petitions to its emergency docket from the Justice Department and has sided with the DOJ all but three times.

Trump’s victories on the emergency docket span a variety of issues, including massive plans to trim the size of the federal workforce. In July, the high court granted stays in two petitions, allowing mass layoffs at the Department of Education, along with a more sweeping reduction-in-force effort at various federal agencies.

The Trump administration was also successful in a trio of emergency petitions over the firing of independent agency heads, beginning with a lawsuit over the firing of Democrat-appointed members of the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board. The May order in Trump v. Wilcox found that the president “may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents.”

The two later emergency petitions, dealing with firings of members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, respectively, were also granted by the high court. The FTC firing case, Trump v. Slaughter, was taken up by the justices on an expedited basis to the merits docket, with the justices appearing likely to expand presidential firing power within the executive branch based on December 2025 oral arguments in the case.

The other wins the Trump administration got on the emergency docket included allowing the policy of banning transgender people from the military, mandating that the gender listed on passports is that person’s biological sex, and allowing the deportation of illegal immigrants to countries other than their country of origin.

The decisions have largely been on ideological lines, with the six justices appointed by Republican presidents largely siding with the administration, while the three justices appointed by Democratic presidents generally said they would deny the emergency requests.

While the Trump administration has been overwhelmingly successful on the emergency docket, it has had a mixed track record on emergency petitions regarding immigration policy. Two key losses on the emergency docket for the Trump administration included the high court ordering the administration to “facilitate” the return of illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, after he was deported to El Salvador despite a withholding order against such action, and halting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in Texas in May.

Limiting universal injunctions is first win on the merits docket for Trump

While the Trump administration had dozens of cases on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, it only saw one case argued and decided by the justices on their merits docket in 2025. The lone ruling was a significant victory in the fight against universal injunctions.

One of the issues that emerged during the early months of Trump’s second term was lower courts’ prolific use of universal injunctions, which blocked administration policies and actions nationwide, instead of just the parties to the lawsuit. The administration brought to the Supreme Court a trio of universal injunctions blocking the president’s birthright citizenship order, asking for the high court to limit lower courts’ ability to issue these sweeping orders.

In the 6-3 ruling in Trump v. CASA, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, dismissed the idea that lower courts have the broad ability to issue universal injunctions, significantly limiting their ability to do so.

“The universal injunction was conspicuously nonexistent for most of our Nation’s history,” Barrett wrote in the June 2025 ruling. “Its absence from 18th- and 19th-century equity practice settles the question of judicial authority. That the absence continued into the 20th century renders any claim of historical pedigree still more implausible.”

“Had federal courts believed themselves to possess the tool, surely they would not have let it lay idle,” she added.

The ruling was celebrated by the Trump administration, but since the CASA ruling, lower courts have still found other ways to issue sweeping injunctions, including through class action lawsuits and through lawsuits where states are parties against the federal government. Despite the continued lawsuits and court-ordered pauses of policies post-CASA, the June ruling still marked a major win for the Trump administration.

2026 may be a mixed bag for Trump at the Supreme Court

While the Trump administration got a favorable ruling for the one case it brought to the merits docket, the upcoming cases the high court will consider could be unfavorable to the president.

At the end of 2025, the Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases brought against the Trump administration over two major issues: the president’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs and his ability to fire independent agency heads. Early in 2026, the high court is also expected to hear arguments over whether Trump’s executive order regarding birthright citizenship is constitutional.

Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University, previously told the Washington Examiner he believes the administration is likely to lose the tariffs case and the birthright citizenship case, but would likely prevail in the independent agency head firing case.

SUPREME COURT GRAPPLES WITH HOW MUCH EXECUTIVE POWER INDEPENDENT AGENCIES REALLY EXERT

During oral arguments over Trump’s tariffs in November 2025, the justices appeared skeptical of the president’s ability to levy sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Conversely, in oral arguments over Trump’s bid to fire independent agency heads without cause in December 2025, a majority of the justices seemed likely to side with the administration.

Oral arguments in the birthright citizenship case, Trump v. Barbara, are expected to occur sometime between February and April 2026, with decisions in all three major Trump cases expected by the end of June 2026.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25087712274742.jpg?resize=1200,683",N,,2025-12-28 15:56:40.160236

Leaning over Samar, Yogan saw that he was wide awake.
“I’m a dead man,” Samar said.
I’ve barely eaten today, man.” Yogan started to give Samar what he could.
It was Roshni that Yogan was thinking of that day with Samar, Roshni he imagined when their fingers were intertwined.","They were young men when they first met. Both of them in skinny jeans and American-branded T-shirts, purchased at a greater cost than either would have admitted to his family. Samar’s T-shirt read “GUESS?,” and Yogan’s “American Eagle.” The meaning of these inscriptions did not matter to them, though Yogan suspected that his had something to do with the American postal service, and this excited him. Samar’s T-shirt was tight around his chest in a film-hero kind of way, the polyester adhering to the curves of his boyish biceps, and he later admitted to Yogan that this elasticity, rather than the English word on his chest, was what had convinced him to make the purchase.

It was the T-shirts that had sparked their first conversation, each asking the other, “Do you speak English?” English was necessary in order to navigate the airport, and, they expected, life in this new city called Dubai, which was in so many ways an imitation of a major Western city. But English had come to both men only piecemeal, from the dazzling, incongruous lines in Bollywood films. The plots of those movies and their many twists had vanished; what Yogan and Samar recalled was Shah Rukh Khan, with his signature wide-eyed look, ordering Kajol to “take a chill pill!” And Kajol, mocking her hoity-toity London neighbors with “Would you like some tea?” Thanks to a joint effort drawing on both men’s vocabularies, they made it through immigration and baggage claim and out to the arrivals hall, where a red-haired woman with a laminated sign motioned for them to wait for the shuttle that would take them to their accommodations.

Only a few months earlier, Yogan’s wife had sent him out to look for more long-term work. His last construction contract had recently ended, and Roshni had suddenly vomited a hot stream of bile onto her bare feet after her morning tea. That afternoon, a drug-store test had informed them that she was pregnant with their second child. And so Yogan had been sternly dispatched to pass under a sign that read “KISMAT JOB AGENCY,” and into a roadside shop that smelled of a sporty, masculine cologne. Inside, another banner in lowercase English script read “quick overseas enquiry all welcome.”

Overseas, quick: the words themselves had a certain voltage.

The shop had a running air-conditioner, pristine white walls, and a statuette of Lord Ganesh attached to the plastic desk with a hardened dollop of liquid glue. Behind the screen of a laptop was a heavyset man, sitting as still as an oracle.

“Your name, your date of birth, your phone number,” the man said. He wore a thick gold chain over his collared shirt and repeatedly clicked one of two buttons on his wired mouse. Once Yogan had delivered the requested information, the man licked his index finger and handed him a sheet of paper setting out the conditions of his potential employment. The compensation, converted to rupees, was more than triple what he had made on his last contract.

“This is the only job I have available at the moment. You’ll go abroad?” the man asked.

Thanks to local gossip, Yogan already thought of the man as someone he needed to impress. He had worn his American Eagle T-shirt to the appointment. But the possibility of this new future made him aware of his own timidity. “What is it like over there, uncle?” he asked.

“Big, big buildings,” the man said, not once looking up from the screen of his computer. “And the roads are clean. Food and all is expensive, of course, but the quality is much better. Everything is imported, no? You’ll see, beta.”

It relaxed Yogan to be called “son.” He wondered if delivering this word, so affectionately, was part of the man’s training. But he felt disarmed enough to hint at his other question, which had been weighing on his mind since Roshni had broached the idea of his working in Dubai.

“My wife is expecting, uncle. Our second. We have one girl. I thought I should tell you that. I’ve heard the stories, you know.”

“What stories?” the man asked. Now he looked up from his computer and caught Yogan’s eye. No longer fatherly, Yogan thought, but shrewd, gruff.

“These men who hire us—I’ve heard they might arrange things so we can’t come back.”

“Rubbish!” the man said. Small, yellowish teeth appeared under the heft of his mustache; he was silently laughing. “If they did all that nonsense, then why would I have so many applications to process, hmm?” He pointed at a towering stack of folders behind him.

“Times have changed,” the man added. “Those stories are old. Bygone.”

Relieved, Yogan filled out his application and waited, over the next few weeks, for his phone to ring.

It had all happened differently for Samar.

Samar was from Mumbai, itself a big city, one that Yogan had always imagined as a sparkling place, the backdrop of his favorite movies, where A-list actors could be spotted sauntering through bazaars with their big sunglasses and hotheaded bodyguards. Samar wouldn’t have been as easily swayed by the hum of a working laptop and unstained white paint, Yogan guessed, for his new friend had laughed in a slightly superior way at these details of Yogan’s story.

“So why did you come then?” Yogan asked.

Sitting against a concrete wall outside the airport, using his duffel as a backrest, Samar told the story of the time he was hired to install a stripper pole in a Bollywood heroine’s Pali Hill flat. “The work order listed it as exercise equipment,” Samar said, “but I’ve seen enough movies. I know what people do with something like that.”

The actress was not there at the time of the installation, Samar said, but her home was decorated more extravagantly than he could have imagined. There, he saw furniture that he hadn’t known existed beyond film sets. A circular mattress, a crystal chandelier, lavender carpeting throughout. Samar had looked around not with envy, he said, but with reverence. The pole was to be installed in a third bedroom, which was also a dressing room, or so he guessed from the light bulbs around the mirrors and the many racks of frilly clothes. Later, in the chawl where he shared a single matchbox room with his wife, Samar began compulsively picturing the actress moving through her flat as he moved through his own. As he refilled the water drum at the communal taps for their morning tea, Samar imagined the actress draping her shoulders with the impossibly soft shawl that had been flung over the sofa, before dropping a tea bag into one of her many porcelain cups. In a moment of contemplation, she might hold the cup against her chest for warmth, he thought, for her air-conditioner would be rattling fiercely, set to a temperature of seventeen degrees Celsius.

“Seventeen degrees!” Samar said, bringing his hands together to clap at the number. “We were sweating and shivering at the same time as we worked!”

Yogan listened to his new friend with a dignified silence. He had never known anyone who had seen a stripper pole in person before. “Wow,” he said.

Samar appeared relieved to have told someone. He’d had to keep all this a secret, he admitted. He was newly married to a woman named Chanda, and it had been enough of a scandal that they’d met in a park and not through a relative’s introduction. The story of the actress’s apartment would have infuriated Chanda’s brothers, who had never liked Samar and, he predicted, would never try to.

It had been difficult not to talk to his wife about that day, how it had changed the way he looked at his life, Samar continued. The next morning, he had shaved his head to a greenish stubble in front of the bathroom mirror—a way of taking fewer trips to the barber. When Chanda saw him, her first reaction had been to howl for help. In their dimly lit room, she’d thought him a stranger. When she’d finally accepted that it was him, she placed her hands on his shoulders, his neck, the base of his skull, and, finally, his prickly scalp, which Samar rubbed now, sitting outside the airport. He wondered aloud if Chanda had been able to tell that there were desires in him that hadn’t been there before, if she had worried about what this could mean for her own life.

“I came home and really saw everything,” Samar said. “I saw where we lived, and it hurt me to see so clearly.”

What did he see? Cracks in the walls, rat pellets in the cupboard, a sudsy creep of water under the door, because the aunties outside were forever washing their saris and utensils. For once he was bothered by the many abuses that the warring grandfathers who lived above them hurled at each other through the night.

Chanda had unrolled her thin bedding on the floor, to sleep. Her long braid, tossed behind her when she turned, was held at the end with a knot made of her own hair. For months, Samar had heard her complain about her hips and knees, tender after her days of squatting in rich people’s flats with a wet rag, wiping their marble floors from end to end. He had always dismissed these aches as inevitabilities of their lot, but now he felt his wife’s pain under his own skin.

Samar had expected this new clarity to pass, the way drunken bouts of insight and sadness often did, but visions of the actress’s apartment continued to follow him. Nights when he got home, he could hear her blowing air-conditioner. He could see her silky two-piece pajamas, hanging from a crystal hook in the bathroom. Samar understood that Chanda and the actress were two women separated by money and luck. He had control over one of those things; he could find better paying work.

Some days later, he told Yogan, he woke up to his heart pounding with impatience, which told him that it was time to find a solution. He went to a recruiting agency down the road and signed a contract that very day. It was still early when he got home. In clouded morning light, he lay on Chanda’s mat with her and told her the news: soon he would start working for a construction company in Dubai.

Sixty or so men had flown in that day from Karachi, Kathmandu, and Mumbai. The red-haired woman appeared again a few hours later to usher them onto the bus that would take them to their camp, about an hour outside the city. But, before that could happen, some men were called by name and asked for their passports. The company needed to process their visas, the woman said, but Yogan already suspected that he’d got himself a different deal than the men obediently lining up before him. Could he, from where he sat, a flutter in his own chest, issue some kind of warning? Yogan silently watched as Samar placed his blue-black booklet into the woman’s outstretched palm.

On the bus, one or two men tried to broach the subject, curious as to whether the others had been made to give up their papers earlier, at immigration or baggage claim. No verdicts had been reached yet, but already the passports were a touchy subject. Those with elderly parents or young children put an end to the discussion: “Brother, if I keep thinking about this, I’ll fall into a depression.”

She wanted to know whether he’d arrived safely, if he could send her any pictures. He slipped his phone back into his pocket without responding. Watching the bright, silvery buildings, Yogan wanted to enjoy the solitary bolt of desire that was beginning to course through him. He imagined that this was how Samar must have felt as he walked around the actress’s flat—as if something divine and chemical were taking shape in his body, the birth of a new ambition.

Behind and in front of him, there were conversations about how clean the city was. Not a single crushed bottle of Coke or a billowing plastic bag, just miles and miles of pure asphalt. The men wondered where the poor without homes slept, where the stray dogs with bitten ears and tragic faces prowled.

“Maybe they bring out cleaners at night,” one man suggested. “They must have machines that do it.”

“I’ve heard they make the prisoners do it,” a voice from the back said.

The silver buildings grew smaller and smaller, until they became like motes of dust on the horizon. As the bus turned in to their accommodations, the men’s chatter began to slow. In their silence was the realization that the streets surrounding where they were going to live were as littered as the others had been spotless. Here, it seemed, were all the city’s tossed water bottles and flattened cartons. Rumbles coursed through the bus as the men understood this, one by one.

There were well-circulated rumors about the camps—the unlivable conditions, the filth. White men making documentaries had uploaded clips to YouTube. On his phone, months ago, Yogan had watched one of those men, retching at the smell of the camp bathrooms, fight his way past disgruntled security guards to an open courtyard where he could breathe fresh air. It was an old video, from the early twenty-tens, but it was still the one that had the most views. These days, a new generation of vloggers, armed with hair gel and smartphones, were uploading their own clips detailing their day-to-day lives inside the camps, as a way of encouraging other men to make the move. One vlogger, a man from Kabul, went live on Facebook once a month to counsel other men from the region on how to secure employment in the Gulf. Yogan and Roshni had spent hours, after their daughter was asleep, watching this man’s pixelated face as he walked the halls of his accommodations, answering questions.

Yogan suspected that everyone on the bus had watched the man from Kabul’s videos, and felt, as he had, their plans for another life coming joyously together. Though the man had been careful to temper his viewers’ hopes. Recently, he had begun signing off at the end of each of his videos with a disclaimer: “This is only one humble man’s experience, please remember. God has different plans for each of us.”

As Yogan disembarked from the bus, he recalled the man from Kabul’s warning. The sight of the accommodations heavied his chest. Here were stout buildings of cement, not shimmering glass; men already residing in some of the rooms had fixed yellowing newspapers to the windows, to block out the heat. Others had gathered to watch the slothful procession of newcomers file out of the narrow bus doors and into the courtyard, where fallen wickets lay from an abandoned game of cricket. Yogan leaned into Samar’s shoulder to try to put words to what they were both feeling: “You think we’ll ever see the inside of those nice buildings?”

Samar seemed to eye him with a twinge of anger. “I’m just here to work,” he said.

In the room, they agreed to share a bunk, Samar at the top, Yogan at the bottom. They’d known to expect it, but still, as the door kept opening and closing, and one man after another walked in with suitcases and basmati-rice sacks stuffed with clothing, with burners and steel pots, with statuettes of Krishna and leather-bound Qurans, they grew more and more disheartened, until the last man entered and looked at Yogan’s bottom bunk with entitlement, and Yogan knew to climb up and lie beside his new friend, too exhausted by then to care that their calves and elbows were touching.

In the dark, they looked at each other wordlessly, all the rapture of their stories blunted. The man from Kabul had warned about the number of men assigned to each room. “I won’t lie to you,” he had said. “You’ll be uncomfortable. You’ll have to adjust.” But Yogan had hoped—though he didn’t admit it—that this, too, was a story of bygone times. When Samar began to cry, a mewling, stifled sound, Yogan brought his friend’s head into his chest. He whispered that they’d arrived, not only to a big city but to a new country. They were abroad, and the sun would bring them a new start. He was sure of it.

“Listen, blokes, we’re on a tight schedule, everything is very tight, including my pants and my shirt, and as our time gets tighter we’ll be in tight shit.”

Scattered laughter.

It was late one night, almost a year after they’d arrived. Samar was impersonating his supervisor, a beer-bellied foreigner who, the men had decided, hailed from either Australia or New Zealand. They weren’t sure of his origins, in part owing to his confounding accent, which required him to repeat instructions five different times at five different speeds, but they had eliminated the possibility of England because of the supervisor’s coffee flask, a ceramic blue-lidded thing with the emblem of a crown on its front.

“No British person actually cares about the Queen,” one of the men declared, his legs dangling from his top bunk across the room. “To them, it’s just another loaded family living in a big house, running a family business.”

Samar said, “In one of the houses where Chanda does her cleaning, there’s a glass cabinet under lock and key. Inside there are plates of every size and color, with the Queen’s face on them. They are not for eating, her madam said. They are for dis-play.”

At night, the men usually returned to the accommodations in silence. Most of them worked construction in different sites across the city. Samar’s group, which included a couple of the other men in their shared room, was building a highly anticipated sporting stadium that was already six months behind schedule. This meant that their work was now proceeding at double speed, for there was some kind of televised event nearing, something glamorous and exclusive, that required tickets to be purchased months in advance. Under the new schedule and supervisor, the stadium was expected to open in just a year.

“You come to these places free, and then they put you in chains,” another man said, pursuing his own, separate line of thought.

The others were used to this man’s abrupt, tragic declarations. “Oh, tell Baldy to go write his poems elsewhere!” someone called.

Yogan had heard that the supervisor on Samar’s project had limited the men’s bathroom breaks to once a day. Twelve hours of work, with just one sliver of peace in which to piss. Some men had taken to climbing down to a basement floor, where there was no light, only rubble, to relieve themselves. Their previous shift manager had allowed them to use the bathroom to wash their hands before eating, but the Australian told them to use the water from their bottles to rinse off, and, when those bottles were empty, he said, they would make adequate vessels for holding urine. There was no refilling water bottles during work hours. Men who ran out had to wait until they got home. In just the last week, two men had fainted from heat stroke, and another had coughed up a smear of bloody phlegm.

The men speculated that the heat was making the Australian insane. The high temperatures must have overloaded the synapses of his brain; this was the only possible explanation for his howling and redness and reverence of the Crown.

Yogan listened to all this night after night, shaking his head when a show of disapproval was required. He had yet to encounter any such cruelty in his own working life.

Now Samar said, “You don’t come to places like this already free. You come looking for freedom.”

“Maybe the Australian’s wife left him,” the man with the dangling legs said. “Maybe one day he came home, his skin peeling everywhere, and she said, ‘Enough of this! You think I want to spend my life applying ointment to your red-red nose?’ ”

“Wife! You think a man like that ever had a woman waiting for him at home? Feeding him biryani?”

“Someone is keeping him well fed.”

Laundry was hung on lines across the room, blocking Yogan’s view of some of his friends’ faces. He was lying in his bed beside Samar, freshly bathed. In the next room, the air-conditioner was switched on, and the gentle vibration of it through the wall lulled him closer and closer to sleep.

Hours later, from the darkness of his dreams, Yogan was woken by the sound of cloth snapping against air, a quick, practiced swatting, the kind an overworked mother might deliver to the fat behind of her wailing child. “Shoo!” one of the men was saying, as if to a mosquito. “Go bother someone else.” Others in the room groaned at the noise.

It was difficult for the men to drop back into sleep when they awoke in the middle of the night like this; they became aware of the vivid odor of sweat hanging in the air, the white floodlights seeping through the broken blinds.

“Come fan me for ten minutes and I’ll give you a dirham,” a man on Yogan’s side of the room said.

His eyes now adjusted to the half-light, Yogan sat up and saw a figure cross the floor to where the voice had come from. After the room’s air-conditioning unit had broken weeks ago, the men had started collecting old newspapers to wave in front of their bedmate’s face at night. This way, at least one man in each bed could sleep decently in the heat. Yogan watched as the figure crouched to pick up a newspaper then hit his head on something metal, the railing of the bed, perhaps, on his way back up. “Ouuuch!” the man said. The clang reverberated like a gong, a sound that should have signalled the coming of sunrise or morning prayers, but only reminded Yogan that it was still night, and he’d have to find a way to return to sleep.

Yogan reached over to the other side of his bed, to alert Samar to the scene. This was the kind of incident they liked to feast on together in the daylight, drawing out the small animosities that grew among roommates. Gossip made them feel alive, childlike. Yogan’s hand found only a cool, empty patch of sheet. It took him a moment to understand that Samar was not in the bed, and that, if he wasn’t in the bed, it had to be Samar out in the middle of the floor with the newspaper, Samar getting swatted.

“What are you doing, you idiot?” he called into the dark.

“What do you bastards think this is, a fish market?” another voice said.

Yogan watched his friend drop the newspaper on the floor and return to their bunk. With a sharp breath, Samar hoisted himself up and collapsed beside Yogan, a palm on his forehead, as if he were checking himself for a fever. Countless nights over the past few weeks, Yogan had opened his eyes to the sight of Samar propped up on one elbow, holding a newspaper above Yogan’s bare chest, fanning committedly. “Go back to sleep,” Samar would urge. “Tomorrow it’s my turn,” his voice so sweetly nurturing that Yogan had wondered whether he’d forgotten to mention some secret child back in Mumbai. Now it was Yogan who propped himself up; he unfolded a newspaper from under their mattress and began to create a small wind for the two of them. “What were you doing?” he asked.

“Nothing,” Samar said. “Don’t make everything your problem.”

Yogan lightly smacked Samar’s forehead with the newspaper. “Oho, what drama!”

But Samar wouldn’t speak. Another voice in the room answered for him. “He was asking for spare change. What else does he ask us for?”

At this, Samar clicked his tongue, sending his reply to the middle of the room. “You’re a real son of a bitch, you are!”

“Why do you need their money?” Yogan asked.

Samar again clicked his tongue, that universal sound that meant, Leave it, leave me. Drop the conversation. He turned away from Yogan to sleep.

“Do you have any news?” Roshni’s voice on the phone was booming, blooming, both.

“News, how?” Yogan said.

“You know—news!”

His wife’s questions on the morning bus to work filled Yogan with energy. He bounced his leg without pause, as if he were once again balancing his older daughter upon his knee.

“Yes, yes, I have news,” Yogan said. Now he was whispering. “But we’ll have to talk later, O.K.? I’m on the bus. I can’t talk freely.”

Beyond Roshni, the cry of his infant child erupted like a shard of lightning. He jerked his phone away from his ear for a moment, then brought it back. His daughter’s voice—already hearty and strong.

“You can’t talk freely? Listen to what I have to deal with! I don’t care if all your friends are jealous. I’ve been waiting six full months for your news!”

“Roshni, please, my jaan. Six months is nothing.”

“Six months is nothing? Wait until you see your daughter and you find how little she looks like you!”

Yogan leaned his forehead against the window; he didn’t want the man sitting next to him to witness his pleasure. “So you’ve been naughty with someone else, have you?”

“Don’t start with me now,” Roshni said. “I haven’t even had my tea. Call me later, or else I’ll have to call my new men. Men, you understand? More than one!”

“You deserve nothing less.”

“You don’t know how your oldest child is eating my brains asking for news. But don’t worry, I’ll tell her that her father is a little social butterfly who is afraid of spreading his own good fortune.”

With a laugh, he said, “Maybe I won’t tell you then.”

“Don’t tell! I’ll find another husband! I have so much time to myself these days!”

“And you should spend it wisely. With me, well, you just let your parents decide.”

“Fine, I’m putting up posters to advertise my freedom then. This time, I’ll have a love marriage.”

“Nobody too handsome, O.K.? Two beautiful faces make an ugly duckling.”

Yogan hadn’t told anyone his good news yet, not even Samar. There seemed to be much, these days, that they kept from each other.

No longer did Yogan have any use for his mustard-yellow construction hat, though he walked out of the accommodations with it under his arm each morning. From where the bus dropped off the men, Yogan hailed a taxi to the metro station, then rode the train to a shopping mall at the center of Dubai—a sprawling, bluish structure, which housed the ice rink that Yogan had been contracted to build a year ago. At home in Lucknow, he had helped build football and cricket fields before moving up to glossy hotels and office buildings. Buildings paid more, but Yogan had been happier working on the sporting fields, seeing the skinny young boys swinging wooden bats, sauntering onto freshly rolled grass, adrenaline already running through them. Yogan and his brothers had had to make do with the frequently soggy pastures behind their house. When they ran to retrieve a lost ball, they were guaranteed to feel the splash of mud across their smooth calves. The splattering sound of a bare foot against wet earth was a pleasure Yogan would never forget. When he returned home, his mother would exhale decisively, ordering him to pour water over his legs before coming inside. What had then been an annoyance seemed now an ecstasy—the cold well water licking at his bony knees, sending rivulets of red dirt worming down to the ground around his toes.

Building an ice rink was different from installing a sports field, but the spirit behind it was similar, Yogan thought. He’d been part of the team that had laid the tarp and the ice mat, and opened the water supply to fill the rink. He had checked that the pink antifreeze had made its way through every single tube of the ice mat, a moving wonder that had reminded him of the disco floor he and Roshni had once danced on before their children were born, their arms daringly clasped around each other’s waists.

To make the ice, the men had used ninety thousand litres of water, which felt like more than he’d used in the entire duration of his childhood. The water Yogan had known growing up was trickling, soft, and unalarming, except for the seasonal rains that required his parents’ roof to be re-thatched. What he saw at the ice rink, in comparison, was the water of stories, of cinema. The blast came from a hole twice the size of Yogan’s head, with enough force to drown an encroaching army. As the water exploded out of the pipe, Yogan gave a shocked giggle that swept among the other men, some of whom cheered and clapped, while others quietly removed their hard hats and held them in their hands. Yogan felt as if he had seen a waterfall, the Swiss Alps, all those stills of Europe that were used as backdrops for the best romantic numbers. As he conjured these pictures, he closed his eyes to enjoy the delicate cold spray that hovered above the torrent.

The rink was completed almost three months ahead of schedule. Because the men were being let go on short notice, an opportunity of further employment was communicated through the rink supervisor. If a handful of men wanted to stay on as skating instructors, they would be trained for free.

In a locker room behind the rink, Yogan donned a pair of formal black trousers, a white dress shirt with a slight tea stain on the collar, and a shiny, satin vest with three pearlescent buttons down the middle. He sprayed himself with a strong oud cologne he’d bought on sale at the supermarket, then rolled on his thick woolen socks. The skates he’d been given were made of pristine, stiff leather; the blades were sharpened for him when he hung them up at the end of each week. Now he tottered across the rubber mat of the back room, and in a single, practiced gesture, he was off gliding across the fresh morning ice.

For a long time, like everyone in his family, Yogan had believed in fate, the old idea that the same souls were reincarnated into the same families in order to relive past mistakes, at least until one lucky fool broke the spell. When he was growing up, his mother had often said that she was living out the life of her own mother, so it was no coincidence that she’d encountered the same hardships—a lame foot, an abusive mother-in-law, a savage bout of cancer that would surely see her to the end. Because she had predicted her life so accurately, Yogan and his siblings were convinced that she was clairvoyant, and, in moments of privacy, they would fearfully ask her whether she could tell them anything about their futures. Her mood usually changed at this question, as if the idea of her sons outliving her, loving women and children of their own, meant that her life would be shortened. Bitterly, she would toss them futures so bleak and unappealing that, more than once, Yogan had to talk his youngest brother out of hanging himself.

“You’ll live your father’s life, what else?” his mother would start. “You’ll owe every neighbor a debt and spend every holy day at a brothel. What? Did you think you were going to become a king?” She laughed at the audacity suggested by her own question, then opened her arms to welcome her son, whom only she could comfort, for it was she who had opened the wound to begin with.

Yogan, too, had believed some of her predictions. How could his life turn out any different than his father’s? Those first few years with Roshni, he had kept himself at a comfortable and loveless distance, in order to protect both of them from whatever qualities he might or might not have inherited from his father. But Yogan had become living proof that his mother’s predictions were bullshit. Yogan, who now spent his daylight hours gliding across ice, teaching children and adults to spin like dancers—he had not grown up to resemble anyone he knew.

“Morning, gentlemen,” the instructor, Felix, had said at the start of each training session.

He spoke only in English, and Yogan had been surprised at how quickly he was able to catch on. “What do we say, chaps? Slow and steady is the way of the coward.” Felix had held his trainees’ hands as he guided them across the rink. He’d skate backward, observing every shudder and slip of Yogan’s inexperienced ankles. “Gliding, you’re just gliding,” Felix would coax, and Yogan, holding Felix’s hands, found the courage to move his hips forward, one and then the other. “Now back on your own,” Felix would say, trailing at a slight distance.

Arms raised in caution, Yogan had imagined that he was learning to skate just as his younger daughter would soon learn to walk. Every time he’d fall, every time another man’s bladed boot slid within an inch of Yogan’s fingertips or earlobe, he thought of his daughter’s waddling footsteps, the many tumbles she would take, and he believed that this vision of the child he had yet to hold in his arms somehow kept him lucky. He’d stand and dust the frost off his backside, and, with the muzzy picture of her in his mind, set off with more and more force, until he was able to make it from one end of the rink to the other without anybody’s support.

Now Yogan skated in an elegant, sinewy line around the rink, something his father never could have dreamed of, and he understood that he had been keeping his success to himself because there was no conceivable way to explain any of it.

“Morning, Yogs,” Felix said as Yogan swished past him.

“Good morning, sir,” Yogan said in English.

“You tell your wife yet?”

“No, sir,” Yogan grinned. “I am waiting.”

“You tell her soon, all right? Don’t let the lady get away.”

He had meant to tell his wife earlier that day: with his raise, he had managed to arrange a work visa for Roshni, who would be able to join him with their two daughters within the next few months. When they arrived, Yogan would move out of the accommodations and into an apartment on the other side of the city, in Karama. He would once again share a bed with his wife, their daughters in cots beside them.

“Yes, sir,” Yogan said. Out of respect, he had turned around so that he was facing Felix as they spoke. Now it was Yogan who skated backward, scanning the rink for anyone who needed his help.

Later that week, Yogan once again woke to the sound of a swat, but this time it was his own hand that was stinging. He sat up quickly and with little confusion; Samar wanted to know if Yogan would fan him.

Yogan found and unfolded the sodden newspaper they kept between their mattress and the bed frame. Leaning over Samar, Yogan saw that he was wide awake. He placed a palm on Samar’s forehead to indicate something he wasn’t sure how else to convey—his affection, or his willingness to listen.

“Will you tell me now what happened to you?” Yogan asked.

“Just let me sleep,” Samar said.

“Listen, I have something to tell you, too.”

“I need three lakhs,” Samar said. “Do you have that?”

Yogan laughed at the figure. It was about what Samar would make in a year. “What do you need that for?” He accommodated his own arm under the warmth of Samar’s neck in order to fan him more comfortably. Again, Samar went silent; he wore a calm expression that told Yogan he was not exaggerating. Then Yogan put down the newspaper and used his free hand to turn Samar’s face toward his own. “Are you sick? Do you need to pay for medicine?”

“It would be better if I was,” Samar said.

“You’re going mad without Chanda or what? Your moon’s been hidden.”

At the sound of her name, something between them seemed to crack. Samar shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands. His voice lowered in shame or remorse, he began to speak.

There had been an issue with the contract he’d signed, he said. He hadn’t read it. The contract was typed in English with an Arabic translation stapled to the back. Only when his most recent paycheck was withheld had Samar called the recruiting agency to complain and discovered what the conditions of his employment really were:

According to this contract, the EMPLOYEE (“SAMAR BOBAL”) accepts the terms of the EMPLOYER/SPONSOR (“AL KHATIB AND BROWN CONSTRUCTION LLC”) as put forth by the Recruiting Agency (“SILVER HAWK RECRUITING”) that the EMPLOYEE agrees to pay the Recruiting Agency a non-refundable fee of Three Lakh Rupees (Rs. 300,000) as facilitated through a standard loan by the Recruiting Agency in exchange for employment and visa services.

In the mail, they had sent him a version in Hindi that he had read so many times he had it memorized.

What the woman had made clear to Samar over the phone was that the recruiting agency had neglected to charge him for his loan over the past year. From now on, they would withhold his salary until he earned out the cost of his loan. They had no answer for how long this would take—the math was Samar’s to do.

“I’m a dead man,” Samar said.

The air of hope seeped out of Yogan. “Run away, then,” he said. “Take a flight back tomorrow. How will they find you?” He was trying to sound practical, unworried, but his voice broke.

“I don’t have my passport,” Samar said. He turned away, and Yogan could think of nothing to do but pick up his newspaper and wave it rapidly over Samar’s neck.

“Everything I made,” Samar said, “I’ve sent home. I have nothing on me. I’ve barely eaten today, man.”

Yogan started to give Samar what he could. A Lucknowi man he had befriended worked at the coffee shop near the ice rink and would give him sandwiches and airy bags of potato chips for free. At the end of the day, Yogan would carry these items home in his hard hat and stash them in their top bunk, along with whatever else he could spare: a spotted banana, a Tetra Pak of strawberry milk, a sleeve of Parle-G biscuits.

There were others like Samar in the city—trapped men, men who had signed the wrong papers, men who’d walked into cool roadside offices with the same idea as Yogan but emerged with a different fate. There were others in the accommodations, too, and everyone chipped in what they could to keep these men afloat.

With morning came the sound of men unrolling their carpets for prayer, the clang of steel tumblers of tea and coffee, and, through the blinds, the harsh orange glow of the day. Someone in the room always shared his cup of tea with Samar, who sat alone by the window, picking at his skin, trying and failing to phone Chanda, who had stopped answering his calls once she heard about his situation. Sometimes Samar would leave her soft, pleading monologues as voice mail: “How can your brothers say I’m a fool? I came here for you. Everything was for you.”

Later, as the men lined up for the buses that took them to their respective workplaces, Yogan squinted into the raw white light to follow the shape of Samar’s body as it approached the doors of his bus. What did he expect to see? A sign of endurance? Resolve? There was just the tall, skinny hook of his friend, thinner now than he’d ever been, his shoulders slumped, getting on the bus with a full water bottle in hand, the bright shine of his shaved scalp replaced by a thick mop of black hair.

Yogan remembered one of their first nights in the city, when the men in the room had jousted and jabbed at one another, laughing until their voices wavered with sleep, and then fell, one by one, to silence. Yogan and Samar were the last two awake, and talked late into the night about things Yogan could no longer recall, though he did remember the man on the lower bunk issuing a weak punch to their mattress at some point, urging them to go to sleep.

“Have you found some new boyfriends, then?” Yogan asked. “I’ve been thinking about you. You and your harem.”

“What dirty thoughts you think!” Roshni said. “Thank God your youngest daughter has another father.”

“He can also come. Tell him to pack his suitcase.”

“Why did you call me?”

“I’m just missing you!”

“Missing me? Why don’t you use your brain for something better!”

“What could be better than thinking of my beautiful wife?”

Yogan was full of happiness. Earlier that morning, he had selected the apartment they would move into, a one-room flat with enough space for all four of them and their small accumulation of objects. The bathroom had a pristine white tub that looked as if it had never been used before. Above the tub was a small window of pebbled glass that gave the ceramic sink a flickering shimmer. It was agonizing to hold all this in his mind, Yogan thought, to have to wait to share it with his wife.

He was skating along the side of the rink, his phone back in his pocket. He had called his wife to share this dart of anticipation, this pulsing in his jaw. Now he slowed his stride and watched a child with the same dark complexion as his older daughter gain confidence in her movements. The girl glided on jaggedly in a pair of purple skates, with Yogan following some distance behind. He gave her space until she began to skid, and then he happily skated over to ask if she needed help.

“Can you stay close?” the girl said in English. He continued to skate alongside her, in case she lost her footing again.

Most afternoons passed this way. Yogan skated the length of the rink, stopping whenever a child seemed to be attempting a particularly risky move, full of speed and reckless bravery. He’d wait, hoping, always hoping, that the child would pull it off and then try again.

He found it strange to see so many people who looked like him on the ice. People whose countries were rarely cold, people who had never seen a world caked in real winter. How brave they were to try to balance on two blades as thin as the tips of pencils, pushing off from the sides, hands outstretched for balance, their panicked eyes searching for a groove in the ice they could use, then flashing skyward to catch the glance of a proud mother or father watching from the stands. Look at my child, these parents would think. My child is doing the impossible. My child is dancing on ice in the middle of the desert.

He often imagined his daughters skating, their pleated skirts wrapping around them as they spun. For them, it would be as easy as walking on land, he thought. It was their inheritance after all, their father’s fate. But skating would not be a career for them. He would not allow that. It would be only a supplementary detail on applications, something that would win them admission into exclusive, wintry places. For once, he wished that all he’d believed about fate was true, for it would mean that his daughters would inherit his luck, that it would take them to far-off lands and give them impossible chances.

After his shift, Yogan changed into a T-shirt and new jeans that were faded and fashionably ripped at the knees, and took the metro to the Mall of the Emirates. A sensor pinged as Yogan stepped onto the shiny marble floor of the store. The man from Kabul sat behind a brightly lit display of gold and diamond jewelry, dressed in a crisp white shirt and sand-colored pants. The men in the accommodations had started referring to him as King Kabul, KK for short. This was because KK had recently chronicled the full story of his ascent on his YouTube channel.

He had first moved to Dubai to work construction, as they all had. Soon after, he was hired as a personal driver for one of his employers. When his employer began trusting him to pick up orders and mail confidential paperwork, he was given a laptop, a magical thing. A year later, having proved himself, King Kabul was instated as the general manager of the employer’s family jewelry store. These days, he spent each Eid with his employer’s family, eating meat and drinking sugary sherbet from the family’s expensive and fragile china. But the best part of all that had happened, KK had told the camera, was that he had been able to bring his family to the city. KK’s wife now worked as a cook for his employer’s family, who paid full tuition for his son to attend a rigorous international school.

“Look at you, brother,” Yogan said to KK now, his nervous hand flat on the cold display table. “I don’t want to invite the evil eye, but I need to tell someone. My Roshni is coming here, too.”

KK pointed at an amulet of a blue-and-white eyeball above the door of the shop. “There’s no evil eye here. Your good fortune is my good fortune. How old are your daughters? Maybe they can meet my son, Abas.”

“One is three. The other will be one soon.” Yogan inched his phone out of his pocket to show KK one of the photographs Roshni had sent. A selfie, with his youngest daughter sleeping in the crook of her elbow, swaddled in a pink blanket. “I hope we can put them in good schools,” Yogan said. “Like Abas.”

“There’s no end to what we hope,” KK said. He added that he and his wife had recently started thinking about sending Abas abroad for college. The boy was only twelve—he still had time to decide—but KK would need to begin saving, in case his employer became unable to sponsor Abas’s education. KK had heard of other children at his son’s school getting scholarships for colleges in London and America. “Imagine,” KK said.

“Inshallah,” Yogan said.

Behind the man from Kabul, a display case of gold and silver chains gave off small flashes of starlight.

“Hey, how much?” Yogan asked, pointing at one.

KK keyed open the glass case and held a delicate gold chain between his thumb and middle finger. From under the counter, he brought out a dark velvet tray, upon which he laid the chain gently, as if it were worth millions. Yogan touched the smooth gold clasp with the tip of his index finger; the metal was still warm from the powerful display light.

“When you’re ready,” KK said, “I’ll give you a discount. But not now. For now, you save all your change. There are lots of expenses coming for you.”

Yogan returned home to the accommodations that night a little dazed. He wanted to call Roshni again and tell her about KK’s hopes. He imagined that she would laugh, then fling an insult or two in his direction. “Abroad this, abroad that, it’s a mania these days,” she’d say. “If my girls are that smart, let them be smart near their mother. Why should I send them away?”

But she wouldn’t stay angry for long. After a moment, she would admit her own secret hopes. “Do you think if the girls go, we’ll ever get to visit?”

These days, no matter what Roshni was saying, the sound of her voice made Yogan part his lips in anticipation. How different this felt from his first few months in the city, when he had avoided her calls. Back then, the men had lined up with their phones and chargers at the two available outlets, some crying discreetly, others saying quick, important things like bank-account access codes and routing numbers, before cutting to the bye-bye.

Without fail, Samar had called Chanda each night before she went to sleep.

“Did you braid your hair?” he would ask her, and, if she said yes, it meant that she would be sleeping soon, and, if she said no, it meant that she could talk for another ten minutes.

The men had grown used to hearing Samar’s romantic conversations before bed. Sweetie, pinkie, and darling—all those sugary monikers that followed on the heels of “hello.” When the outpouring of such terms stopped, the men had noticed that, too.

“Where’s our Romeo these days?” they teased.

Four months had passed since Samar had learned about his debt. The men no longer mocked him; they were anxious to know if Chanda had responded to any of the hundreds of messages Samar had left her.

That night, as Yogan scrolled through his phone, another man approached Samar, who was sitting on the floor, gently peeling a banana. “Heard anything, or no? About Chanda?” the man asked.

Samar looked up and smiled a little crazily. “Don’t talk to me about that whore,” he said.

The following night, Samar returned from work and climbed straight up to his bunk without food or a shower.

Yogan came in from his own shower shortly after. “At least change into something clean,” he said. “I also have to sleep in that bed.”

Samar gave no response, only a kind of whimper that must have escaped accidentally.

“You want something to eat?”

Samar didn’t answer, but the other man in the room, hearing the question, looked at Yogan as if he were an idiot, as if he’d asked a fish if it wanted to swim.

Yogan went downstairs to the common kitchen with some cash in his pocket. He found one of the men he knew heating a bowl of lumpy yellow daal and a frozen paratha in the microwave. The man watched as Yogan counted out his asking price and placed the bills on the countertop. Only once the cash was secured in the man’s pocket did he hand over his warm plate of food.

In the room, the other men moved in silence as Yogan sat beside Samar on their bed, the plate in his hands. “Eat something,” he said. With his free hand, he traced the rope of Samar’s spine protruding from under his damp T-shirt.

“Did something happen?” Yogan asked. A question for anyone in the room.

“Nothing,” another man answered. “He’s just being dramatic.”

Then Samar sat up. His eyes were webbed with strawberry capillaries.

“How are you always home so early?” he asked Yogan. “Did you get fired, or what?”

“You should eat,” Yogan said.

Samar looked down at Yogan’s feet, on which he wore a pair of bright-red chappals. “Where did you buy those? Are they real Nikes?”

Yogan’s instinct was to jump off their bed and kick his slippers into the darkness under the bottom bunk. Just then, the plate of food, which he had rested on the bed beside Samar, went flying to the floor, the daal splattering across the linoleum.

“Sorry, I’m sorry,” Samar said. He held his own wrist, as if to discipline it. Then he eased himself onto the floor and began scooping the hot food into his cupped hands. His eyes had gone small and dark with tears, and he brought the inside of his elbow to dab at his wet nose.

A wave of misery and unease passed over the men, who regarded one another. Yogan crossed over to where Samar was crouched and placed a hand on his back. “Leave it,” he said, offering him a bath rag.

The other men began to collect the broken shards of the plate.

When Samar’s voice finally came, it was thick with phlegm. “Her brothers found someone to void our marriage. She’s marrying someone else,” he said.

“Shit.” It was all Yogan could say. He opened his arms for Samar to collapse into.

The metro ran mainly aboveground, but it was different from the trains in India because it did not rattle or jostle or violently assert itself. Rather, it slid to its stop. The doors opened with a gush of cool, sweetly scented air, and most of the seats inside shone in want of a patron. The train re-started with the rush of an airplane taking off, and within seconds it was speeding above the roads on cement beams tall enough to allow a panoramic view of the city. The number of skyscrapers had doubled since Yogan and Samar had first arrived in Dubai, almost two years earlier. Yogan had heard the other men saying that the towers were getting taller and more complex, and as he considered these rising obelisks of the future he thought of them not as a builder, evaluating materials and weight distribution, but as a father, anticipating the wonder of his daughters. Far beyond the skyscrapers, Yogan could see the still unfinished sporting stadium that Samar and others were working on. It was shaped like a disk, a silver mound.

It was National Day, a rare day off for all the men. Yogan was sitting beside Samar on the metro. It had been ages since he had seen Samar in his everyday clothes, and he noticed how the T-shirt his friend wore hung off his shoulders and neck.

When they’d first arrived in the station, Samar had seemed overcome with awe. He had never been inside a metro station in Dubai and couldn’t grasp how to read the digital maps that flashed on large screens above them. It was then that Yogan had admitted that he’d used the train before.

The day out was Yogan’s treat—an attempt to inject some life back into his friend, who hadn’t spoken to him since the news of Chanda’s engagement, other than to convey blank thanks for his rare acceptance of a nighttime meal.

Yogan also had to deliver his own news: he was moving out the following week.

At the mall, Yogan led Samar toward the sandwich shop. “Let’s have something? I’m hungry” was how he put it. Samar nodded his head thinly, as if he were doing Yogan a favor by agreeing to eat.

They ordered swarthy, buttered paninis full of ripe tomatoes and melted mozzarella. To Yogan’s surprise, Samar had an appetite. He appeared windswept by the ebullience of the mall, whipping his head left and right to examine the surrounding shop windows with their pedestals and handbags and slender, faceless mannequins.

“You’ve come here before?” Samar asked.

“This is what I wanted to tell you,” Yogan began.

He led the way to the ice rink, where the jaunty receptionist recognized him and allowed him access to the back room to get his skates. She handed Samar a pair of skates while Yogan paid for their day passes.

If Samar was confused, he did not show it. He had taken on, instead, the buoyant air of a dazzled child. “You want me to wear these?” he said, laughing. “I’m going to break my legs!”

“I’ll help you,” Yogan said. He already had his own skates knotted tight.

Yogan went down on his knees to fit Samar’s feet inside the skates, pulling at the laces to insure that his ankles were well secured. As he tied the knots, he explained that he’d been offered a job as a skater. He told Samar about the apartment in Karama.

Samar gave Yogan’s shoulder a brotherly punch, and said, laughing, “You bastard! This is your job?”

The laughter filled Yogan with relief. Holding his friend’s hand, Yogan ushered Samar onto the ice. Yogan suggested that he hold on to the side barriers, but Samar remained tethered to him, their damp fingers intertwined. The movements did not seem to come easily to Samar; he lifted his feet one at a time, as if he were marching. When they gained some speed, a wild, coy look appeared on his face.

“Try to lead with your hips,” Yogan said. “Let me show you.” He guided Samar to the barrier and pushed off alone, pointing down at his feet so Samar could understand what he meant.

“Do it again. Let me watch you,” Samar said when he returned. He was grinning. “Do you know any tricks?”

Again Yogan pushed off, swerving past the children and the teen-agers on the ice as Samar whistled at him from the side of the rink. “Look at this hero!” Samar called.

As Yogan skated, the chorus of an old Bollywood song began to ring in his pocket. Knowing that it was Roshni calling for their afternoon chat, he sent the call quickly to voice mail. Each time he heard that ringtone during this time of his life, he remembered how he and his siblings used to sit in front of the television with unbreakable focus, watching the finale of the movie in which the song featured. It was a declaration-of-love song, the hero and the heroine in their best clothes, dancing at the helm of a choreographed cast with clinking bangles and shimmying bellies. Finally, they were no longer bashful and had confessed their affection, which was too vast to convey in dialogue; it had to be set to music. Yogan remembered the great smile that Saif Ali Khan had worn as he danced. He had understood something about that smile even as a child. Where Yogan came from—a village outside Lucknow where sons were still preferred to daughters, most marriages were arranged, and a man out of work for a single week could render a family utterly damned—a dance number like that, in which the hero follows a girl in a shimmering blue lehenga, telling her that she looks like a piece of the moon, proved that somewhere in the world there was romance. It made life seem bearable.

Later, when Yogan looked back on this day with Samar, it was this song that he remembered, this song which became, over the years, a kind of engine for him. It unstuck him from himself when he needed it to, buoying him forward when he hesitated. That day at the rink he was moving inside a fantasy. In five days, his wife and his daughters would land in Dubai. In five days, he would hold his wife’s waist between his palms. He would cup the soft head of his new daughter, make a show of searching her face for traces of himself. It was Roshni that Yogan was thinking of that day with Samar, Roshni he imagined when their fingers were intertwined.

“Let me try,” Samar said when Yogan returned to him.

He made a few unsteady strides, his hands in front of him for protection, then gained confidence, his movements nascent but full of speed. Then Samar leaned back to avoid crashing into someone, and Yogan knew before it happened that he would correct himself by tilting too far forward too quickly, which would cause him to lose his footing. He watched his friend fall onto his knees; with his palms, he kept his body from hitting the ice.

Yogan skated over. Samar appeared more subdued than he had earlier, perhaps a little embarrassed. Yogan offered his hands to pull Samar up, and Samar took them awkwardly. He sent a crystalline wad of spit to the side.

“Why did you bring me here?” Samar asked. “To show off?”

“Come on, bhai,” Yogan said, urging him to the side of the rink.

“You want to watch me hurt myself so you can feel good?”

Yogan felt Samar’s hands grab his collar, and then he knew to anticipate the approach of knuckles, which flashed by his cheek like a pink ribbon, narrowly avoiding impact. Yogan glided backward to catch himself, one of his hands on his cheek, which had grown warm with shame. Then he heard a whistle that he recognized as the sound of his boss approaching. Yogan put up both his hands, as if in surrender. “There is no problem here, Felix,” he said in English. “This is my good friend. We are enjoying on our holiday.”

“I’m going to have to ask your good friend to get off the ice,” Felix said.

On the way home, Samar rested his head on Yogan’s shoulder. On the open plain of Samar’s neck, the skin appeared to have been shaved carelessly; there was a thin scabbed line across his Adam’s apple. Yogan lightly tapped his fingers against the healing skin, if only to show that he’d noticed it.

“You’re going to have to take care of yourself,” Yogan said. “When I’m gone, you’ll need to become close to someone else who can bring you food.”

“I’ll handle it,” Samar said.

“I’ll visit you. Every Sunday. Don’t forget.”

“Can you give me some money before you go? To tide me over until I find someone else?”

Yogan had prepared for this question, and also for its answer. Still, his throat swelled painfully, and he waited for the taut feeling to pass. Quietly, he managed to give his response: “I need the money for my girls. My oldest needs a school uniform. She needs textbooks.”

“I’ll manage,” Samar said.

He pointed at Yogan’s lap to ask whether he could use it to rest, and Yogan, with an open palm ready to catch his friend’s head, said, “Come.”

Some months after Yogan moved out, Samar disappeared from the accommodations one day, like a frame cut out of a movie. He didn’t get on the bus to the construction site. He wasn’t in his bunk when the other men came back.

The local news rarely picked up such a story; you had to dream of the dead, then wake up with a premonition. A text message received late at night, read over and over in the morning, would confirm what had happened. A young man had fallen—or jumped—in front of an oncoming train.

He had been only twenty-seven. His hands and feet were always colder than the rest of him, Yogan remembered, despite the incessant heat of those days. In bed, Yogan used to warm Samar’s rawboned fingers with his own, teasing him for his poor circulation.

There were no last rites; a ceremony would have been too expensive. No one went to claim the body. Samar’s clothes, his razor, his smartphone, and his charger were distributed among the men in the room. And, as for them, what could they do but line up for the morning bus, letting their thoughts wander, until someone issued an order, or asked sweetly, through the phone, what was new and had they eaten? ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6945786c7e37d02ed9be36dc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Title_helmet.jpg",N,,2025-12-28 13:57:10.639929

The Court’s order and three-page opinion establishes important limits on presidential authority to federalize state National Guard units under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, with implications extending far beyond the Chicago case.

The decision blocks the Trump administration from ordering the state-based military force to the Chicago area, where an immigration crackdown led to thousands of arrests and confrontations between residents and federal agents. State governors who have obtained similar injunctions in California, Oregon, and Illinois now have significant Supreme Court precedent supporting their objections to federal Guard activations.

Background: Presidential Call-Up of State Guard Units

On October 4, 2025, President Trump called 300 members of the Illinois National Guard into active federal service to protect federal personnel and property in and near Chicago. The following day, he called up the Texas National Guard for similar purposes. Both activations were executed under 10 U.S.C. Section 12406(3), which empowers the President to federalize members of the Guard if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

The key legal question: What does “regular forces” mean? The administration argued it referred to civilian federal agencies like ICE or the Federal Protective Service. Illinois and other states argued it meant U.S. military forces, triggering additional constitutional constraints under the Posse Comitatus Act.

The Posse Comitatus Act: Military Execution of Civilian Laws

The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, as amended, provides: “Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.”

This law was passed after Reconstruction to prevent federal military intervention in civilian law enforcement. As the Brennan Center for Justice explains, when National Guard are called into federal service, “they become part of the federal armed forces, which means they are bound by the Posse Comitatus Act until they are returned to state control.”

Congress in November 2018 issued a report: “The Posse Comitatus Act and Related Matters: The Use of the Military to Execute Civilian Law.”

“Case law indicates that ‘execution of the law’ in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act occurs (a) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to an organ of civil government, or (b) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to them solely for purposes of civilian government. Questions concerning the act’s application arise most often in the context of assistance to civilian police. At least in this context, the courts have held that, absent a recognized exception, the Posse Comitatus Act is violated when (1) civilian law enforcement officials make ‘direct active use’ of military investigators; or (2) the use of the military ‘pervades the activities’ of the civilian officials; or (3) the military is used so as to subject ‘citizens to the exercise of military power which was regulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory in nature.’ The act is not violated when the Armed Forces conduct activities for a military purpose.”

Supreme Court Majority Opinion

The Court’s 6-3 decision in Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. v. Illinois, et al. was issued on the emergency docket. The majority concluded:

“We conclude that the term ‘regular forces’ in Section 12406(3) likely refers to the regular forces of the United States military. This interpretation means that to call the Guard into active federal service under Section 12406(3), the President must be ‘unable’ with the regular military ‘to execute the laws of the United States.’ Because the statute requires an assessment of the military’s ability to execute the laws, it likely applies only where the military could legally execute the laws. Such circumstances are exceptional: Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the military is prohibited from ‘executing the laws’ ‘except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.’ So before the President can federalize the Guard under Section 12406(3), he likely must have statutory or constitutional authority to execute the laws with the regular military and must be ‘unable’ with those forces to perform that function.”

Practical Impact of the Ruling

The Court’s interpretation creates a two-step test for federalizing the National Guard under Section 12406(3):

First, the President must have statutory or constitutional authority to use regular military forces to execute the laws in question

Second, even with such authority, the President must be “unable” with regular military forces to perform that function

Since the Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits military execution of civilian laws except where expressly authorized, circumstances permitting Guard federalization under this provision are “exceptional.”

Dissenting Opinion: Presidential Inherent Authority

Three dissenting Justices (Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas) urged caution. They noted that because this case was decided on the emergency docket seeking a stay of an injunction, there had not been full briefing by the parties or oral argument before the Justices. Instead, the Court on October 29 had requested only letter briefs on what Congress meant by the term “regular forces.”

Justice Alito wrote: “On top of all this, the Court fails to explain why the President’s inherent constitutional authority to protect federal officers and property is not sufficient to justify the use of National Guard members in the relevant area for precisely that purpose.”

Justice Gorsuch emphasized procedural concerns: “Under these circumstances, caution seems to me key, and I would decide this application narrowly, based only on those few arguments the parties preserved and the evidentiary record as it stands.”

National Guard Activations: Understanding the Three Types

National Guard members serve under a dual-enlistment structure with three different active operational statuses:

State Active Duty: Guard members serve under state authority, typically for state emergencies like natural disasters or civil disturbances. The governor maintains command and control.

Title 32 Federal Active Duty: Guard members remain under state command but are federally funded. This status has been used for disaster relief, border security operations, airport security after September 11, and COVID-19 response efforts. Guard members in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act restrictions.

Title 10 Federal Active Duty: Guard members are federalized and come under direct federal command. In this status, they are subject to the Posse Comitatus Act and generally prohibited from domestic law enforcement activities.

The Supreme Court’s December 23 decision addresses Title 10 activations and establishes significant constraints on presidential authority to federalize state Guard units for domestic operations.

Other Guard Deployments and Legal Challenges

D.C. Circuit Ruling on Title 32 Deployment

The National Guard in the District of Columbia, along with State Guards from South Carolina, West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, and South Dakota, have operated since August 2025 under Title 32 status. On December 17, 2025, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the U.S. Government’s stay of an injunction that had blocked these deployments.

The different treatment of Title 32 versus Title 10 deployments reflects the distinct legal frameworks: Title 32 deployments keep Guard units under state command and avoid Posse Comitatus Act restrictions, while Title 10 deployments federalize the Guard and trigger constitutional constraints on military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

Prior State-Level Injunctions

Before the Supreme Court’s December 23 decision, governors in California, Oregon, and Illinois had already obtained federal court injunctions prohibiting Title 10 deployment of their state guards:

December 10, 2025 – Los Angeles: A federal judge ordered Trump’s National Guard deployment in Los Angeles to end.

November 8, 2025 – Portland, Oregon: A federal judge permanently blocked Trump from deploying National Guard to Portland.

October 16, 2025 – Chicago: An appeals court upheld a federal judge’s temporary order blocking National Guard deployment in the Chicago area. This is the injunction that the Supreme Court declined to stay on December 23.

These state-level victories now have the backing of Supreme Court precedent, significantly strengthening governors’ ability to resist unwanted federalization of their Guard units.

Implications for Emergency Management and Homeland Security

Impact on State-Federal Relations

The Supreme Court’s decision reinforces principles of federalism and state sovereignty over National Guard forces. State governors retain significant authority to resist federal takeover of their Guard units absent clear statutory authority and demonstrated inability of regular military forces to accomplish the mission.

For emergency management professionals, this decision clarifies the legal framework governing National Guard availability for state emergencies and disasters. While the Guard remains available for state active duty and Title 32 missions, federal authorities face substantial legal barriers to Title 10 federalization for domestic operations.

Future Legal Developments

The Court’s December 23 order is preliminary, decided on the emergency docket without full briefing or oral argument. Three dissenting Justices emphasized the need for more careful consideration. Several paths forward exist:

The Supreme Court may accept an appeal in another case for full briefing and oral argument (requires votes of four Justices to grant certiorari)

Congress could enact clarifying legislation defining “regular forces” and conditions for Guard federalization

The administration could pursue Guard deployments under different statutory authorities, including the Insurrection Act (10 U.S.C. Sections 331-335)

Until further clarification occurs, lower federal courts must follow this opinion. As Georgetown University Professor Marty Lederman, who filed an influential amicus brief in the case, explained in a November 13 podcast, the administration’s legal defeat represents a critical oversight in reasoning about presidential authority to deploy military forces domestically.

Conclusion: Separation of Powers and Guard Federalism

The Supreme Court’s December 23 decision represents a significant check on executive authority to federalize state National Guard units. By interpreting “regular forces” to mean regular military forces rather than civilian federal agencies, the Court established that Guard federalization under Section 12406(3) requires both statutory authority to use military forces for domestic law enforcement and demonstrated inability of regular military forces to accomplish the mission.

This decision reflects longstanding constitutional principles limiting military involvement in civilian affairs, rooted in the Posse Comitatus Act’s prohibition on using military forces to execute domestic laws. While the opinion is preliminary and three Justices dissented, it provides important protection for state sovereignty and the traditional federal-state partnership in National Guard operations.

As litigation continues and potentially returns to the Supreme Court for fuller consideration, state and federal officials must navigate a complex legal landscape. The decision underscores that National Guard forces remain primarily instruments of state authority, available for federal missions through cooperative arrangements that respect constitutional constraints on military power.

Maryland Democrats have so far not moved forward with a gerrymander, in part because of fears of an adverse decision from the state Supreme Court.
Because the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to limit partisan gerrymandering, some state supreme courts have also declined to impose limits.
“Across the country, we have seen advocates turn to state supreme courts, and state courts in general, for state constitutional arguments against gerrymandering or voter suppression more broadly.
The vote came after a floor debate where opponents raised concerns about limiting court involvement; the legislation included a provision sending any legal challenge directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, bypassing a jury trial.","After Missouri lawmakers passed a gerrymandered congressional map this fall, opponents submitted more than 300,000 signatures seeking to force a statewide vote on whether to overturn the map. But Republican state officials say they will use the map in the meantime.

Missouri courts now appear likely to weigh in.

“If we need to continue to litigate to enforce our constitutional rights, we will,” said Richard von Glahn, a progressive activist who leads People Not Politicians, which is leading the campaign opposing the gerrymandered map.

As some states engage in an extraordinary redraw of congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, state courts may decide the fate of the new maps. President Donald Trump has pushed Republican state lawmakers to gerrymander their states’ congressional maps, prompting Democratic state lawmakers to respond in kind.

Nationwide, state judges are poised to play a pivotal role in adjudicating legal challenges to the maps, which have been drafted to maximize partisan advantage for either Republicans or Democrats, depending on the state. Maps are typically only redrawn once a decade following the census.

While some state courts have long heard map-related lawsuits, the U.S. Supreme Court has all but taken federal courts out of the business of reviewing redrawn maps this year. On Dec. 4, a majority of the court allowed Texas’ new map, which seeks to secure five more U.S. House seats for Republicans, to proceed. A federal lawsuit against California’s new gerrymandered map, drawn to favor Democrats, hasn’t reached the high court.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s brief, unsigned majority decision voiced concern about inserting federal courts into an “active primary campaign,” though Texas’s primary election will occur in March. Critics of the court’s decision have said it effectively forecloses federal challenges to this year’s gerrymanders. The justices could also issue a decision next year that makes it more difficult to challenge maps as racially discriminatory.

State courts are taking center stage after gerrymandering opponents have spent decades encouraging them to play a more active role in policing maps that had been drawn for partisan advantage. Those efforts accelerated after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 limited the power of federal courts to block such maps.

“Basically, every one of the 50 states has something in its constitution that could be used to constrain partisan gerrymandering,” said Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project.

State constitutions, which are interpreted by state supreme courts, typically have language that echoes the right to freedom of speech and association found in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Wang said. They also include a right to equal protection under the law, similar to the 14th Amendment.

Some state constitutions guarantee free and fair elections, language that doesn’t appear in the U.S. Constitution. Thirty states have some form of a constitutional requirement for free elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

At least 10 state supreme courts have found that state courts can decide cases involving allegations of partisan gerrymandering, according to a 2024 review by the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

So far this year, California, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Utah have adopted new congressional maps. New maps also appear possible in Florida, Maryland and Virginia. A handful of other states — Alabama, Louisiana, New York and North Dakota — may have to change their maps depending on the outcome of court cases.

Some of those new or potential maps could face legal obstacles. Florida, New York and Ohio all have state supreme courts that have previously found problems with partisan gerrymanders. Maryland Democrats have so far not moved forward with a gerrymander, in part because of fears of an adverse decision from the state Supreme Court.

Four state supreme courts — including in Missouri — have determined that they cannot review partisan gerrymandering claims, though state courts may still consider challenges on other grounds, such as whether the districts are compact or contiguous.

In Missouri’s case, courts could also clear the way for a referendum vote over the new map, which is intended to force out U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who has represented Kansas City in Congress for the past two decades. Republicans currently hold six of the state’s eight congressional districts.

The map already faces a bevy of lawsuits, most notably over whether state officials must count some 103,000 referendum signatures gathered before the governor signed the map into law; at least 106,000 signatures are needed to send the map to voters.

Opponents of the new map have also filed lawsuits asserting the Missouri Constitution prevents redistricting without new census data and that an area of Kansas City was simultaneously placed into two separate congressional districts.

Missouri Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ decision this month (relying on an opinion from Missouri Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway) to implement the new congressional map, despite a submitted referendum petition, is expected to become the latest legal flashpoint. Opponents of the map argue it is now paused under state law.

Hoskins spokesperson Rachael Dunn said in a statement to Stateline that local election officials have until late July to verify referendum signatures — months after candidate filing ends March 31 and days before the Aug. 4 primary election. At that point, blocking the new map would be all but impossible, even if map opponents have gathered enough signatures to force a vote.

“Once signatures are all verified, the Secretary will certify the referendum based on constitutionality and verification,” Dunn wrote.

Hanaway’s office didn’t respond to questions.

Breaking out of lockstep

As federal courts limit their review of gerrymandering because of U.S. Supreme Court decisions, some state supreme courts are reluctant to wade into the issue because of a practice called “lockstepping.”

State supreme courts often interpret their state constitutions in line with — or in lockstep with — how the U.S. Supreme Court views similar language in the U.S. Constitution. Because the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to limit partisan gerrymandering, some state supreme courts have also declined to impose limits.

Gerrymandering opponents have used a variety of arguments over the years to try to prod state supreme courts out of lockstep. They have emphasized differences in wording between state constitutions and the federal one, and provisions in state constitutions — such as the free elections requirement — not found in the U.S. Constitution.

Sometimes these arguments work — and sometimes they don’t. The North Carolina Supreme Court in 2022 ruled against partisan gerrymandering. But after two Republicans were elected as justices that fall, the court reversed itself months later.

“Across the country, we have seen advocates turn to state supreme courts, and state courts in general, for state constitutional arguments against gerrymandering or voter suppression more broadly. And it’s been met with mixed success,” said Sharon Brett, a University of Kansas associate professor of law. In 2022 as litigation director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, she unsuccessfully argued a case before the state’s high court challenging Kansas’ congressional map.

In states where legislatures draw congressional maps, some lawmakers argue that state constitutions shouldn’t be interpreted to curb legislative authority over mapmaking. Court-imposed limits amount to violations of the traditional separation of powers, they say, with the judiciary overstepping its authority to interfere in politics.

“We expect them to be nonpartisan. We expect them to be unbiased. We expect them to be fair. We expect them to read the constitution and to protect or at least respect the separation of powers,” said Utah Republican state Rep. Casey Snider, speaking of Utah courts during a floor speech earlier this month.

In Utah, state courts waded through a yearslong legal battle over whether state lawmakers must adopt a non-gerrymandered map. After the Republican-controlled legislature repealed and replaced an independent redistricting process, the Utah Supreme Court last year ruled lawmakers had violated the state constitution.

A Utah district court judge in November then adopted a congressional map that will likely lead next year to the election of a Democrat. The state’s four congressional seats are currently all held by Republicans.

“What we would like is them to redistrict based on population — fairly,” Katharine Biele, president of the League of Women Voters of Utah, said of state lawmakers.

Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called the Utah legislature into special session earlier in December to respond to the judge’s decision. Lawmakers pushed back candidate filing deadlines in hopes that an appeal to the Utah Supreme Court will result in a decision overturning the judge’s adopted map.

They also passed a resolution condemning the judiciary.

Constitutional concerns

As the Indiana legislature weighed a gerrymandered map to boost Republicans this month, some lawmakers were reluctant to constrain state courts. Democrats currently hold two of the state’s nine congressional districts.

The GOP-controlled Indiana Senate voted down the map in a major setback to Trump’s national redistricting push. The vote came after a floor debate where opponents raised concerns about limiting court involvement; the legislation included a provision sending any legal challenge directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, bypassing a jury trial.

Indiana Republican state Sen. Greg Walker said the measure violated the state constitution, which guarantees an “inviolate” right to a jury trial in all civil cases. “In legal terms, ‘inviolate’ has the implication of being sacred, as opposed to being just a piece of the law,” Walker said on the floor.

State Sen. Mike Gaskill, a Republican who sponsored the map, said during a speech that Indiana residents would benefit from a quick process to resolve legal challenges. “Both sides, in any case, want them to be settled quickly so that they don’t cause chaos and interruptions in the elections process,” he said.

If the map had passed, opponents would have likely attacked the measure using a provision of the Indiana Constitution that requires “free and equal” elections.",https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.png?id=61685337&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C60%2C0%2C60,N,,2025-12-28 11:12:14.030189

Saydullo, a native of Uzbekistan, was later moved to the Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Centre County, where he remains.
Saydullo Akbarov and his wife emigrated from Uzbekistan in 2006.
My sister can’t run the business, my mom can’t run the business.
“He’s been instrumental in every community he’s been in,” Hsesh said.","On Dec. 10, Sayyid Akbarov was studying for his final exams when he heard something that made his stomach drop:

His father, Saydullo, was detained by federal immigration officials during a visit to Philadelphia.

Saydullo Akbarov, 42, who lives near Schuylkill Haven with his wife and four children, was at a Department of Homeland Security facility for an biannual checkup that morning, his son said.

What should have been a routine visit completed over a few hours led to him being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, according to Sayyid, 19.

Saydullo, a native of Uzbekistan, was later moved to the Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Centre County, where he remains.

Saydullo owns and operates a local trucking business, Wild Stallion LLC, which has stalled in his absence, Sayyid said.

Saydullo Akbarov and his wife emigrated from Uzbekistan in 2006. They have raised all four of their children in the county — Sayyid, a former wrestling star at Blue Mountain High School, and his three younger sisters.

It has been a tough two weeks for the Akbarovs as they navigate life without their patriarch, whom they describe as a devoted citizen and community member.

“It’s a surprise when a complying person like that — he’s not on the run, he’s not a fugitive, he’s a business owner, complies with all the rules, has no criminal history, no record — is detained like that,” Sayyid said. “It’s surprising to see something like that happen.”

Sayyid said he and his family are discouraged because there is no legal recourse they can seek at this point. The Akbarovs were advised by a lawyer that they must wait around six months before they can take action and try to have Saydullo released, he said.

“From what the lawyer is saying, we have to wait a minimum of six months before we can reopen the case and get him out,” Sayyid said. “We don’t want to wait that long. … That’s the question we’re all asking right now — what can we do to get him out?

“We don’t want him to sit in there for six months. We’re doing everything we can. We’ve reached out to congressmen, we reached out to people to see if they can get him out, see if they can take some action on their end. We’ve talked to many lawyers, we’ve talked to people, family friends to see if they can have any pull. But unfortunately, we’ve come up short.”

Sayyid said that his father, over the past 19 years, has built a life as “a perfectly good resident who pays his taxes, clean record, no criminal history, has a business, has four kids, productive citizen and community leader.”

“In reality, he is the picture perfect American person,” Sayyid said. “ … He was not given the American dream — he earned it, worked for it — and with God’s grace, he was able to get it and fulfill the American dream. Isn’t that what this is all about? Isn’t that why people immigrate to the U.S., so they can have a better life?

“They want to take it all away. Twenty years being in the country, for nothing. They want him to start from scratch all over again, in a different country. Not only that, they want to drag a family apart. They want to drag him away from the community. His shoes are too big to fill.”

Sayyid, a sophomore track-and-field athlete at Lehigh University, said he felt overwhelmed when his mother called him on Dec. 10 to tell him about his father’s detainment. Stressed out after a rigorous semester at school — and simultaneously fighting through an illness — Sayyid was studying for his finals in a cafe in Philadelphia when he heard the news.

“When he was detained, I was thrown into the fire,” he said. “It was during finals week — I had my first final the day after he was detained. So I couldn’t concentrate on the finals, I didn’t do as well as I hoped to — and at the same time, the business needs, when he was (detained), I had to run the entire operation. At the same time while studying, visiting lawyers, prepping the paperwork, processing all this information. Just a lot to do during a small period of time.”

After he was taken into custody at the DHS facility, Saydullo was processed at a Philadelphia detention center. Officials then moved him to long-term custody at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, Sayyid said.

Saydullo is active on the board of directors at the Islamic Society of Schuylkill County. Sayyid said his father has spearheaded the construction of many important amenities there, such as a parking lot and an accessible ramp that leads directly to the prayer hall.

He said his father orchestrates many other aspects of the mosque’s operations.

“He’s not just a business owner, not just a family member, but he’s also a community leader,” Sayyid said. “We rely on him here every day. … What he built and what he contributed to this mosque is really important.”

Sayyid said he and his uncle have helped out with Wild Stallion LLC, trying to “keep it somewhat open, somewhat alive,” but he said the business is unable to operate normally and stay solvent without Saydullo.

“We’re working with lawyers to see if we can get some sort of petition going for him,” Sayyid said. “There’s little to nothing we can do legally other than wait. … I can’t run the business, I’m a student athlete. My sister can’t run the business, my mom can’t run the business. People are going to lose their jobs.”

Beyond their personal relationship, Sayyid believes his father’s livelihood and his efforts for the community are too valuable to be removed all at once, after nearly two decades of positive contributions.

“Nothing positive is being gained,” Sayyid said. “Yeah, you removed a perfectly good resident, and there’s one less immigrant in the country. But is that really a positive to society? Is that what the country really wants for people? … It just doesn’t make any sense.”

Community leader

Those who know Saydullo Akbarov describe him as a hard-working, dedicated person who can be counted on to help out his community.

“People rely on him to get things done, for help, for everything,” Sayyid said. “That’s his place in the community.”

Dr. Mohammad Masood Akbar, a local ENT, said he was “really shocked” when he heard the news about Saydullo, whom he has known for several years.

“It’s going to be a big loss for our community,” said Akbar, who serves as vice president of the Islamic Society.

Among Saydullo’s many attributes, Akbar singled out his skill as a handyman, noting he can address any sort of community or mosque-related construction project.

“He is the ideal person you could have as a friend, a family member,” he said.

Alaedin Alamari, a longtime friend of Saydullo’s, said he is missed by everyone in the community.

“He’s a really good man,” Alamari said. “He’d give a hand for everybody. You miss him here. Everybody needs him here with us.”

Zachariah Hnesh, of Pottsville, said that Saydullo’s impact extends far beyond the mosque.

“He’s been instrumental in every community he’s been in,” Hsesh said. “He’s helped coach youth wrestling. He’s done all these different services for the community. He’s employed local people, he’s an entrepreneur, he’s raised a beautiful family. … Just an all-around stand-up guy. He’s helped in so many different capacities.”",https://www.republicanherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RHR-L-AKBAROV-1227-0-16x9-1.jpg?w=1024&h=575,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:51.686632

What makes this winter storm unique from previous ones this season will be the abundance of warm air aloft, melting snow into rain.
It’s areas north of Albany that have the best chance for over a quarter inch of ice accretion Sunday night into Monday.
Ice amounts will be lower south of Albany generally, where temperatures should rise above freezing prior to midnight.
Where exactly those zones of snow/sleet/freezing rain/rain set up, of course, are unknown at this time, but it’s a signal our team will be watching through this upcoming week.","The Latest Storm Tracker Forecast from Meteorologist Kevin Appleby:

After a chilly night, the daytime hours of Sunday will be rather cloudy, but dry & uneventful. Things change quickly Sunday night after 5 PM. Very warm air will be present aloft, but sub-freezing temperatures at the surface will create an environment ripe for ice, especially in northern areas into Monday morning. We then change years with a stretch of below average temperatures.

It will be frigid overnight thanks to partly clear skies, lack of wind, and a fresh snow pack in wake of Friday evening’s snow. Lows will be in the single digits, with some subzero readings expected in the hills and mountains.

Temperatures will gradually warm Sunday. But after such a cold start, temperatures regionwide will be below freezing at the onset of precipitation Sunday evening.

What makes this winter storm unique from previous ones this season will be the abundance of warm air aloft, melting snow into rain. However, with subfreezing temperatures locked in at the surface, this rain will freeze on contact with roads, walkways, powerlines, sidewalks – you name it.

Our storm is still getting its act together over the center of the country, but it will carry with it a strong cold front that, one is passes through Monday afternoon, will increase our winds and bring in much colder air for the remainder of the forecast.

Winter Weather Advisories are up across the board for the anticipated ice, but not all advisories are created equally! Mohawk Valley-southbound, the Advisory is in effect through 4 AM, when temperatures should be above freezing. However, in the North Country, the colder air at the surface will be a bit more stubborn, so the Advisory is in effect through 10 AM. It’s areas north of Albany that have the best chance for over a quarter inch of ice accretion Sunday night into Monday.

As mentioned, area-wide, this is almost entirely ice at the onset. There won’t be any sleet or any snow with this system. Temperatures will gradually warm thanks to an increasing south wind, allowing a changeover to plain rain generally form south to north.

By 6 AM Monday, the Capital Region and points south should be above freezing, with some even close to 40 degrees by then. However, sub-freezing temperatures may persist to the north. Beyond 10 AM, temperatures will be above freezing, and the rest of the daytime hours will feature scattered rain showers. Behind the cold front as temperatures at the surface and aloft plummet Monday evening and a gusty westerly wind kicks in, lake effect snow showers and flurries are expected.

Ice amounts will be lower south of Albany generally, where temperatures should rise above freezing prior to midnight. Locally, I think we see a tenth of an inch or more of ice accretion. Remember, with ice, it only takes a glaze to create hazardous driving conditions! But up north, where as much as a half an inch of ice is possible, that is where there is a growing concern for power outages into Monday morning. Highest confidence in these higher ice amounts exists over much of the Adirondacks, Mohawk Valley, and Saratoga Region, with some similar amounts possible within sheltered valleys of the Green Mountains in Vermont.

Temperatures should actually spike into the lower 40s Monday afternoon (mid to upper 30s in the areas with a higher ice accretion forecast), but will quickly drop Monday evening as another shot of arctic air filters in. On top of temperatures struggling to rise far above 20 degrees Tuesday afternoon, winds may gust as high as 50 MPH. That could also create for some power outages, but also keeps wind chill values in the single digits (below zero in the high spots). And, since these winds are off of the Great Lakes (specifically Lake Ontario), accumulating snow is expected, with plowable snowfall totals through Wednesday expected in parts of the Mohawk Valley and Adirondacks.

The breeze eases up Wednesday, but it will remain out of the west-northwest, thus continuing lake effect snow showers and flurries. Another wave of low pressure will slide near the region late Thursday, possibly producing a quick shot of light snow. Into next weekend, it will be colder than average, but dry conditions are favored both Friday and Saturday at this time.

Cannot say the same for next Sunday as some guidance suggests another winter storm is possible – one that would have all precip types associated with it. Where exactly those zones of snow/sleet/freezing rain/rain set up, of course, are unknown at this time, but it’s a signal our team will be watching through this upcoming week. Clouds hang around next Monday. More sun is possible by Tuesday, but that may be accompanied by colder temperatures.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2022/09/STORM-TRACKER_WEATHER-alert-snow-parking-dig-plow-3.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:58.795498

Because of how central the internet is to even these most basic functions, efforts to deliberately disrupt or terminate internet access reflect clear violations of human rights.
In 2016, the Human Rights Council of the United Nations formally declared access to the internet a human right.
To earnestly make internet access a human right, it’s important that we define precisely what constitutes access, having a clear focus on an internet that is reliable and sufficiently fast.
With digital connectivity increasingly determining access to basic needs, the case for earnestly treating internet access as a human right has never been clearer.","Even for the casual observer, it’s probably apparent that modern warfare, both domestic and abroad, is dramatically changing. Scenes this summer of a synchronized fleet of Ukrainian drones descending on a field of Russian warplanes punctuate just how far we’ve pivoted from classic artillery and infantry-based operations. It’s not only the methods that are changing, but increasingly the targets. What will come next will be clandestine, remote hacking attacks supercharged by AI and targeted (or errant) munitions that sever broadband lines and incinerate internet infrastructure. And with data center development and the internet’s reach continuing to quickly accelerate worldwide, this shift should worry us all — because the primary victims of new age digital warfare will be vast civilian populations, and the toll will be catastrophic.

One need only look at Gaza to understand just how damaging these disruptions can be. According to a report from Access Now, Gaza experienced at least 27 complete or partial internet and telecommunications outages since Israel’s assault on the territory began in October 2023. The most recent shutdown, this past September, preceded an Israeli ground invasion with tanks and infantry.

Whether due to intentional sabotage or negligence, these actions have greatly hindered emergency responses and the coordination and delivery of services and resources, including food and water for besieged Gazans.

Concerns about attacks via or against the internet aren’t isolated to active conflict zones. Seventy-five percent of Americans are concerned about the safety of the country’s internet infrastructure, and it’s not hard to understand why. In the roughly two decades that the internet has been more or less ubiquitous in the U.S., the technology has evolved from being a novelty to being critical in how we perform our work, socialize, manage our finances and stay informed.

For most of us, the idea of an internet outage is mildly panic-inducing, plunging us into an experience that feels akin to temporarily losing one of our senses. But compare that with people in countries confronted by this new era of cyber- and internet infrastructure attacks, where internet disruptions are a recurrent reality. Civilian life, if not the target, is frequently among the collateral damage.

Somewhere around 5.5 billion people, roughly 68% of the world’s population, now use the internet. That’s more than double the number from just a decade ago, with the internet essential to how contemporary society and its institutions function. It’s used by hospitals and nonprofits to deliver healthcare and social services. It’s used by the government to make commercial travel and traffic safer. It helps coordinate the byzantine supply chains that fuel our economies. It even helps monitor and upkeep our communities’ water and energy infrastructure.

Because of how central the internet is to even these most basic functions, efforts to deliberately disrupt or terminate internet access reflect clear violations of human rights. And in a growing number of cases around the world, the violations are a clear matter of life and death. Yet there has been little international response to the increasing use of attacks on internet infrastructure in regions that are embroiled in explicit and covert war.

At multiple points over the last decade, undersea cables have been deliberately severed or otherwise sabotaged by antagonist actors. Last year, two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, one linking Germany and Finland, were ruptured, presumably by Russian saboteurs. And this past March, the Peace Submarine Cable, connecting Africa, Asia and Europe, was cut, causing widespread internet outages in East Africa. No cause has been officially determined.

Last year, many Americans got a direct taste of just how much an internet blackout could affect our daily lives. A global internet outage in July 2024 caused by lapses from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, affected 26% of U.S. adults. The unintentional outage crippled financial services, delayed flights and led to disruptions of operations at hospitals and businesses across the world. So what happens when bad actors, including our own governments, intentionally, with even more precision and resources at their disposal, target our internet and threaten our ability to stay connected?

In October 2024, the Taliban instituted a broad internet shutdown in Afghanistan under the dubious pretext of addressing internet “misuse,” restoring it shortly after widespread condemnation. But this is far from the first instance of the internet being weaponized by internal forces. Following the example of Iran, Sudan, Bahrain, Egypt and Syria have cut off or suppressed internet access to stymie protesters, with varying degrees of success.

In a particularly troubling development that may signal broader trends, Russia has recently been testing a way to cut its territories off from the global internet as a way of building its own “sovereign” network — one that could allow the Kremlin to more directly surveil civilians and quash political dissent.

In 2016, the Human Rights Council of the United Nations formally declared access to the internet a human right. But like most of its pronouncements, enforceability and accountability aren’t guaranteed or widely expected. A handful of countries, each with deeply autocratic leanings — Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and India — have opposed UN amendments aimed at codifying the internet as a human right.

To earnestly make internet access a human right, it’s important that we define precisely what constitutes access, having a clear focus on an internet that is reliable and sufficiently fast. For example, although 5G was widely available in Israel in 2020, the Israeli government has long denied Palestinians access to 4G service, relenting to upgrades in 2021 that still have not fully come to fruition as they should have.

We also must recognize that human rights are often linked, with one essential to others. For example, internet access is increasingly connected to the quality of one’s education, a more globally recognized and embraced human right. According to one international survey, roughly 39% of internet users use it for education or study-related purposes. Internet access is also intimately connected to the ability to engage in free speech and to work, two other vital human rights.

While these kinds of infringements may seem unlikely to come to American shores, various forms of internet throttling and indirect censorship already broadly occur in the country. Owing to ongoing Republican politicking, the U.S. is behind on ensuring net neutrality, a principle that says all internet traffic should be treated equally and not subjected to the biases and financial spoils of tiered access. According to a CNET poll, last year, 42% of U.S. adults said they experienced unreliable internet speeds or connectivity, and 63% saw their home internet prices increase.

With digital connectivity increasingly determining access to basic needs, the case for earnestly treating internet access as a human right has never been clearer. Like warfare, our understanding of human rights has to evolve with the times. This means understanding that in future warfare, victory won’t be measured just in terms of adversaries eliminated, but also by the depth of destruction of the internet infrastructure that sustains our societies.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40b6a37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+97/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F05%2Fb4b2709e442986dee23ea256f460%2Ftaiwan-undersea-cable-80958.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:42.695117

What America Might Look Like With Zero Immigration

The Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the foreign-born population are being felt in hospitals and soccer leagues and on Main Streets across the country, with hints of what’s to come.

Dec. 28, 2025, 5:01 a.m. ET

Across the United States, someone is missing.

One year into President Trump’s immigration crackdown, construction firms in Louisiana are scrambling to find carpenters. Hospitals in West Virginia have lost out on doctors and nurses who were planning to come from overseas. A neighborhood soccer league in Memphis cannot field enough teams because immigrant children have stopped showing up.

America is closing its doors to the world, sealing the border, squeezing the legal avenues to entry and sending new arrivals and longtime residents to the exits.

Visa fees have been jacked up, refugee admissions are almost zero and international student admissions have dropped. The rollback of temporary legal statuses granted under the Biden administration has rendered hundreds of thousands more people newly vulnerable to removal at any time. The administration says it has already expelled more than 600,000 people.

Shrinking the foreign-born population won’t happen overnight. Oxford Economics estimates that net immigration is running at about 450,000 people a year under current policies. That is well below the two million to three million a year who came in under the Biden administration. The share of the country’s population that is foreign born hit 14.8 percent in 2024, a high not seen since 1890.

But White House officials have made clear they are aiming for something closer to the immigration shutdown of the 1920s, when Congress, at the crest of a decades-long surge in nativism, barred entry of people from half of the world and brought net immigration down to zero. The share of the foreign-born population bottomed out at 4.7 percent in 1970. Stephen Miller, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, has extolled those decades of low immigration as the last time the United States was “an undisputed global superpower.”

Whether or not restrictions will restore some of what Mr. Miller views as a midcentury idyll, there’s little doubt that major changes are in store. Immigration has woven itself so tightly through the country’s fabric — in classrooms and hospital wards, city parks and concert halls, corporate boardrooms and factory floors — that walling off the country now will profoundly alter daily life for millions of Americans.

Grocery stores and churches are quieter in immigrant neighborhoods. Fewer students show up in Los Angeles and New York City. In South Florida, Billo’s Caracas Boys, a Venezuelan orchestra, puts on an annual holiday concert where generations of families come to dance salsas and paso dobles. This year, the orchestra announced at the last minute that it was canceling the show because so many people are nervous about leaving home.

The changes will also be felt hundreds of miles from any ocean or national border, even in the snow-washed streets of Marshalltown, Iowa, a city of 28,000 about an hour’s drive northeast of Des Moines.

First Mexicans, some undocumented, came to Marshalltown in the 1990s to work at the pork processing plant. After a high-profile immigration raid there in 2006, refugees with more solid legal status arrived from Myanmar, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Now, Mexican, Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants dot the blocks around the grand, 19th-century courthouse. The population is 19 percent foreign born, and some 50 dialects are spoken in the public schools. The pews at the Spanish-language Mass at the local Catholic church overflow on Sundays, and, in 2021, a Burmese religious society built a towering statue of Buddha on the outskirts of town.

“You have more energy in the community,” said Michael Ladehoff, Marshalltown’s mayor-elect. “If you stay stagnant, and you don’t have new people coming to your community, you start aging out.”

But with President Trump’s crackdown on immigration gaining strength, local festivals are more thinly attended. Parents pull their children out of school when they hear about people being detained. The supervisor overseeing the construction of a high school sports stadium received a deportation letter, creating a conspicuous absence as the work finished up. The pork plant has let workers go as their work permits have expired.

The insecurity of each immigrant ripples into the wider community. Sergii Fedko and his wife, Tetiana, came to Marshalltown in 2023 along with five other Ukrainian families under an immigration parole program for their war-torn country.

Mr. Fedko, a power plant engineer in Ukraine, was quickly hired at a local architecture firm as a designer and draftsman. Ms. Fedko works at a day care center, where she is beloved by her charges. Their three sons are enrolled in school; the eldest excel at soccer and swimming. They bought two cars and a fixer-upper house.

New immigration policies have loosened their toehold in America. They applied for an extension well before their two-year parole ended, but the White House paused processing and changed the rules. As the weeks ticked by and they didn’t hear back, they got nervous, and decided to apply for asylum as well. In mid-December, Mr. Fedko got notice that his application for the extension had been approved, but it would require a new $1,000 fee. His wife’s application is still in limbo.

If she loses her work permit, it will add to the acute shortage of child care workers that is making it harder for American parents to go to work. Mr. Fedko’s manager, Heidi Hogan, has been doing everything she can to help. Her reasons aren’t entirely selfless; there aren’t many skilled draftsmen in the area.

“If he can’t stay with us,” Ms. Hogan said, “I’m going to have a hard time finding someone else.”

An Echo of the Past

It’s not clear yet what these changes will mean for America. But a past era of immigration crackdowns contains some lessons.

Over the country’s first century, immigration was essentially unrestricted at the federal level. This began to change in the late 1800s, with the “great wave” of immigrants fleeing political oppression or seeking work. Starting in the 1870s and over the decades that followed, Congress barred criminals, anarchists, the indigent and all Chinese laborers.

By the turn of the 20th century, anti-immigrant sentiment was rampant. The lawyer and eugenicist Madison Grant wrote in his 1916 book, “The Passing of the Great Race,” that foreign countries were taking advantage of America’s openness by unloading “the sweepings of their jails and asylums” and that the “whole tone of American life, social, moral and political has been lowered and vulgarized by them.”

Grant was consulted as an expert when Congress began crafting the Immigration Act of 1924, which, along with companion legislation, barred nearly all immigration from Asia, created the U.S. Border Patrol and established quotas from eastern and southern European countries. Net immigration — which accounts for people leaving as well as those coming in — plummeted.

Today’s language echoes that time. President Trump characterizes people from Somalia, Haiti and Afghanistan as coming from “hellholes” and accuses other countries of “emptying out their prisons and their mental institutions into the United States of America.”

The broader debate in the 1920s would be familiar to contemporary ears, too: fears about crime; anxiety about the falling fertility rates of the native born; suspicion about the politics of newcomers; hopes that restrictions would mean higher wages for U.S.-born workers; disputes about assimilation.

Today, some proponents of halting immigration — including Vice President JD Vance — argue that it would help the country absorb those who were already here, decrease competition for scarce goods like housing and strengthen job opportunities for young men who had dropped out of the work force. Reihan Salam, president of the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote in his 2018 book, “Melting Pot or Civil War?,” that a large and constantly growing population of low-skilled immigrants, many living in working-class ethnic enclaves, risks creating a “permanent underclass.”

Evidence is mixed on the effect of the 1920s restrictions on assimilation. Some researchers have found that, without newcomers arriving from their home countries, immigrants were more likely to marry American-born citizens and less likely to live in ethnically homogenous neighborhoods. Other studies suggest that policies aimed at forcing assimilation backfired, strengthening the determination to maintain ethnic identities.

Regardless, the effects of that period continue to reverberate. Melissa Marinaro, who directs the Italian American Program at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh, said that when people who fled Italy in the years around World War II could not join family members in the United States, they went to Australia or Canada instead.

“One hundred years later, we still have Italian American families who are split from their extended families,” she said.

The restrictions passed in the 1920s governed U.S. immigration until international competition in the Cold War, the civil rights movement and a shift in organized labor’s stance led to the end of national origins quotas in 1965.

Immigrants Make Up as Much of America as Ever

Before President Trump took office, the share of the population that was born outside the U.S. matched a historic high from 1890.

% foreign born

Although the effects of the 1924 immigration restrictions are difficult to untangle from other developments — wars, technological advancements, the baby boom — wages rose for U.S.-born workers in places affected by the immigrant restrictions. But only briefly. Employers avoided paying more by hiring workers from Mexico and Canada, countries not subject to immigration caps; American-born workers from small towns migrated to urban areas and alleviated shortages. Farms turned to automation to replace the missing labor. The coal mining industry, which was powered by immigrants now barred from entry, shrank.

And today? Construction wages have been rising, even as home building has been sluggish — a potential indication that deportations in the immigrant-heavy industry are bidding up salaries. The union representing workers in the pork processing industry sees an upside, too, even though it opposes deportations and won wage increases after President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s immigration surge.

“I will certainly bring it up at the bargaining table that the way to solve a labor shortage is to pay more money,” said Mark Lauritsen, head of the meatpacking division at the United Food and Commercial Workers Union International.

The same is true in landscaping. Immigrant crews, working outside, were an easy deportation target over the summer. Come spring, said Kim Hartmann, an executive at a Chicago-area landscaping firm, the labor force could be 10 to 20 percent smaller.

“It’s going to be much more competitive to find that individual who’s been a foreman or a supervisor and has years of experience,” Ms. Hartmann said. “We know that drives costs up.”

But there are limits to how much customers will pay for decorative shrubs, and they may opt to go without. One 2022 study examined the expulsion of tens of thousands of Mexicans from the United States in the early 1930s. Contrary to the policy’s intent, unemployment rose and wages were depressed for native-born workers, possibly because sectors that depended on immigrant labor — agriculture, construction and manufacturing — suffered so much that they contracted.

The lesson of the last period of intense restriction is that employers have an array of ways to adjust, said Leah Boustan, an economics professor at Yale who studies the history of immigration.

“The menu is other sources of labor, and machinery,” she said. “It’s not obvious that you’re going to pick the guy down the street relative to these alternatives.”

Where Hands Still Matter

Today, that menu has expanded. Companies can outsource jobs to other countries. Artificial intelligence is replacing some types of work, and other countries, like Japan, have shown the possibilities of robotics. But many services still require humans, in person.

“If you’re an obstetrician, delivering a baby right in the moment, you need hands to lay on the patient,” said David Goldberg, a vice president of Vandalia Health, a network of hospitals and medical offices in West Virginia. “It’s not the same as a banker, or someone creating code.”

Nearly a fifth of nursing positions are currently vacant in West Virginia — a state that is older, sicker and poorer than most — and the state faces a serious shortage of physicians in the coming years. The answer has been to look abroad. A third of West Virginia’s physicians graduated from medical schools overseas. Now that option is narrowing.

“We lost two cardiologists because of their concern that they wouldn’t get their visa and, if they did, that they would not be able to stay here permanently,” Mr. Goldberg said. “They went elsewhere.”

Similarly, nobody has figured out how to harvest delicate crops with machines. During the low-immigration 1970s, some crops, like green onions, disappeared from shelves or were imported instead.

“It’s not going to hop from the ground into a package without somebody’s hands being involved somewhere along the way,” said Luke Brubaker, who runs a dairy farm with his sons and a grandson in Pennsylvania. To milk cows, feed them and deliver calves, he relies on more than a dozen foreign-born workers, most of them Mexican. He is not optimistic that he will be able to replace them.

“You can put an ad in the paper,” he said. “Maybe you would have one American-born applying for that job if you need 10 people. And that’s a maybe.”

For now, Mr. Brubaker can still find staff. The surge of immigrants who entered the United States under President Biden — more than eight million people — means that many foreign-born workers are still available.

That surge helped create an anti-immigrant backlash, inflaming fears about crime and jobs. It also stung immigrants who felt they had faced higher barriers than newer ones from places like Venezuela.

“The Mexican population felt that it was not fair,” said Alfonso Medina, who owns La Carreta, a Tex-Mex restaurant in Marshalltown started by his father, a Mexican immigrant, in 2000. “Imagine you’re here for 20, 30 years contributing. And all of a sudden here comes this administration and starts letting people in right away with a permit. They felt betrayed.”

In 2024, they shifted toward Mr. Trump.

Land of Opportunity?

Dan Simpson, the chief executive of Taziki’s, a fast casual Mediterranean restaurant chain based in the Southeast, has been losing employees since the beginning of the year. These were not only dishwashers and cooks but also managers and assistant managers, who had come to the United States with advanced degrees.

While he worries about the effect on his own business, he believes that the damage could be much greater.

“If you zoom back, the bigger problem is that we’re tarnishing the brand of America,” Mr. Simpson said. Even if the United States opens up again, he said, “we’re going to need a campaign to fix the idea that America is not the land of opportunity.”

International students pay full-freight tuition that helps fund new programs and basic costs at many U.S. colleges. As international enrollment has dropped, many schools are facing budget holes.

Nearly half of the immigrants who legally came to the United States from 2018 to 2022 were college educated, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Immigrants are far more likely than U.S. citizens to start businesses; nearly half of this year’s Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants.

Several studies have found a decline in the number of patents issued for U.S. inventions after the immigration laws of the 1920s.

“You have an economy that is smaller, less dynamic and less diversified,” said Exequiel Hernandez, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

In early 2025, Rayan Sadri was raising money for his artificial-intelligence start-up. In June, the Trump administration barred everyone from a list of Muslim countries, including Iran, where Mr. Sadri is from. Based in Montreal and unable to travel in the United States, Mr. Sadri could no longer easily meet potential investors and customers. Moving the company to San Francisco, as he would have liked, was not going to happen. Among other factors, the ban slowed the young company’s momentum.

“Everything for start-ups is momentum,” said Mr. Sadri, who is now going to work for another tech company in Canada.

It’s not just Silicon Valley. Small enterprises across the country have been built by and for immigrants — and been embraced by a wider community. In Marshalltown, Luisa Ortega has been putting on Mexican-style rodeos and popular music acts since 2012. In recent years, white residents have started coming, too. “They like the all-day show, they want to be able to go and dance,” she said.

‘What Is the Future?’

Over the longer term, low immigration will collide with one inexorable trend: an aging population in need of care just as fewer workers are available to provide it.

Half of the people who work at Sinai Residences, a senior living facility in Boca Raton, Fla., are immigrants. Rachel Blumberg, the chief executive, has already had to notify 38 workers from Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela that they will have to go because the Trump administration ended their country’s temporary legal status. That is 9 percent of her work force.

“It was like this funeral that would never end,” she said, of those conversations. “They’re my best employees.”

Rural areas and postindustrial cities have long struggled with an exodus of the young and the growing needs of the older residents who are left behind. Many of these places have pinned their futures on immigrants.

Lancaster County, Pa., most famous for a community that has refused to assimilate — the Amish — has over the years also become home to a global marketplace. People from Myanmar now fill the pews of a Mennonite church founded in the 1700s. Scores of Congolese refugees work at local distribution centers. The county seat, Lancaster, has two Nepalese restaurants. Resettling refugees, long a mission of local Mennonites, has become central to Lancaster’s growth strategy.

Unlike most Pennsylvania counties, “Lancaster’s numbers are growing,” said Heather Valudes, the president of the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce. “But that is simply because of immigrants.”

Ahmed Ahmed, 31, arrived in Lancaster when he was 3. His parents, refugees from Chad, worked as certified nursing assistants, taking care of Lancaster’s elderly; Mr. Ahmed became the manager of a local hotel and a city councilman.

He now supervises some of the immigrants who came after him, including several Cuban refugees who worked at the hotel. This summer, they learned that their temporary work permits had expired. The Haitian workers at the poultry plant learned this, too. As did the Ukrainian employees at the Walmart.

They are now stuck in limbo. The economy is closed to them, but they are unable to return home — the United States does not even allow commercial flights into Haiti. Shut out of the formal work force, some will probably move to larger cities and look for under-the-table jobs, delivering food or cleaning homes.

Mr. Ahmed was not sure what became of the Cubans he worked with. He is concerned about them, and also worried about what may lie in store for his adopted hometown.

“This is only Year 1,” he said. “What is the future?”

They have also been shrouded in secrecy, and the opacity has been one of the defining features of 2025.

President Donald Trump had talked about reaching 3,000 deportations a day, but local enforcement actions here have been smaller. They have also been shrouded in secrecy, and the opacity has been one of the defining features of 2025.

Additionally, a clearer picture of the activities of Tren de Aragua emerged. This month, federal officials announced the indictment of two suspected TdA leaders in Denver on racketeering charges tied to robbery, extortion, kidnapping, money laundering and drug offenses over 14 months.

At the political front, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston appeared, alongside the mayors of Boston, Chicago and New York Mayor, in Congress to answer questions about his city’s “sanctuary” policies and response to the illegal immigration crisis, which spilled over from the southern U.S. border into America’s interior cities. The bill for Johnston’s legal defense for that March 5 hearing before the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee crossed the $1 million mark this month.

Within weeks of Trump assuming office, Immigration Customs and Enforcement had partnered with the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to knock down doors and round up immigrants unlawfully residing in the U.S.

These agencies widely touted their operations on social media.

Residents at one of these raids at Cedar Run Apartments in southeast Denver near Cherry Creek, disputed that federal agents had warrants targeting “wanted drug traffickers.”

The Denver Gazette sought copies of the warrants through the Freedom of Information Act. In response, ICE provided administrative warrants that in some cases were post-dated April 3 — nearly two months after the raid. An administrative warrant is an internal document that does not carry the same force of law as one signed by a judge. It authorizes agents to make an arrest, but not forced entry.

The DEA and FBI issued what’s called “Glomar” denials, rather than release the warrants tied to local operations, a position under appeal in cases involving the DEA and FBI.

Groups like the ACLU of Colorado have challenged some of the tactics in court, arguing agents have conducted warrantless apprehensions that violate constitutional protections. A federal judge has sided with the ACLU, granting a preliminary injunction.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has said ICE officials are not making “indiscriminate” stops.

“This activist ruling is a brazen effort to hamstring the Trump administration from fulfilling the President’s mandate to deport the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” McLaughlin has said.

“Allegations that DHS law enforcement engages in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically false,” McLaughlin has said, adding the ruling will “hamstring” the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, Colorado’s largest school district mounted an unsuccessful legal challenge after the administration attempted to roll back long-standing protections that limited immigration enforcement in “sensitive” locations, such as campuses.

As part of the lawsuit, Denver Public Schools Superintendent Alex Marrero claimed the ICE raids in February negatively affected attendance. Attendance data across district-run schools reviewed by The Denver Gazette suggested a more nuanced picture.

The administration’s immigration operations sparked a wave of “No Kings” demonstrations and mass immigration protests at the state Capitol that drew thousands of residents.

Meanwhile, the TdA gang remained at the forefront of news, with authorities indicting two men they alleged to have sanctioned the armed robberies of two jewelry stores in Denver. In the Joyeria El Ruby robbery, authorities said, gang members stole nearly $4 million in jewelry and gold and brutally beat several employees with a firearm.

The pair also directed the kidnapping of a young man at gunpoint in October last year in an attempt to extract $30,000 ransom that the family did not pay, according to authorities. TdA gang members cut off one of his fingers, the authorities said. One of the leaders is one of the FBI’s top 10 most wanted, with a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture or conviction.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25036611528177-scaled-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 18:56:55.012616

But, as Abrego emphasizes, to get there requires the government to successfully rebut the vindictiveness presumption Abrego is entitled to.
The evidentiary hearing is slated for Jan. 28, 2026.","The federal judge overseeing the human smuggling case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia has canceled an upcoming January trial.

In lieu of that proceeding, the court will hold a one-day evidentiary hearing dedicated to ferreting out whether or not the Maryland man was vindictively and selectively prosecuted by the government.

This week, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, a Barack Obama appointee, slammed the brakes on the controversial prosecution in a relatively terse four-page order – a decided victory for the father of three and an equally stinging loss for the Trump administration.

In the ruling, the judge said the evidence provided by the defense had turned the case in Abrego Garcia's favor long ago – at least on the due process issue of whether the prosecution is vindictive.

""The burden-shifting framework controls the Court's analysis,"" Crenshaw writes. ""Specifically, once a defendant establishes a prima facie showing of vindictiveness, 'a presumption arises in defendant's favor.' The Court has already found that Abrego has made such a showing, entitling him to discovery and an evidentiary hearing on why the government is prosecuting him.""

In August, Abrego Garcia filed a motion to dismiss his federal indictment on the basis of a selective and vindictive prosecution.

In October, the court found there was a ""realistic likelihood of vindictiveness"" behind the federal charges against Abrego Garcia.

The immigration lodestar's high-profile litigation is a well-known subplot of the story of the second Trump administration. Abrego Garcia was part of a summary deportation flight to a prison notorious for torture in El Salvador, but his deportation violated multiple court orders — both specific to him and general to the flight in question.

A DOJ lawyer was sacked after admitting the Trump administration's mistakes and, through a seesawing battle that has gone up the legal ladder all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and back down to various different district courts, Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States, promptly charged with unrelated crimes, and eventually released on bail before being taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) yet again in late September.

Now, the outcome of the case is contingent on whether the government can rebut the presumption in the defense's favor by producing ""objective, on-the-record explanations"" for the human smuggling charges, according to the court.

The judge notes the upshot, at length:

Whether the government can produce such evidence is critical, for ""[i]f the government fails to present evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption, the presumption stands and the court must find that the prosecutor acted vindictively,"" leading to ""dismissal of the charges or other appropriate remedies."" However, ""[i]f the government produces evidence to rebut the presumption, the defendant must prove that the offered justification is pretextual and that actual vindictiveness has occurred.""

Crenshaw says the next step will be the evidentiary hearing – which will ""only"" turn on whether or not the government is able to rebut the presumption currently working in Abrego Garcia's favor.

""If the government can rebut that showing, the Court will revisit the government's Motion to Quash, as the burden will again shift back to Abrego to establish that the government's rationale for prosecuting him is pretextual and that his prosecution is actually vindictive,"" the order reads.

Notably, the upcoming hearing is particularly high stakes for the Trump administration – and could upend their entire case.

""If the government fails to carry its burden at the evidentiary hearing, however, the Court need not resolve the government's Motion [to quash] on the merits, as the [defense motion to dismiss] would be granted without need for any further discovery,"" the order goes on.

Still, the court explains, the current procedural ""landscape"" of the case is something of a double-edged sword for the defense.

Again, the ruling, at length:

Because Abrego has already affirmatively satisfied the threshold question of whether he is entitled to a presumption that his prosecution is vindictive, his subpoenas of [DOJ officials] serve to support the third step of the vindictive prosecution inquiry, i.e., whether he can establish pretext and actual vindictiveness. But, as Abrego emphasizes, to get there requires the government to successfully rebut the vindictiveness presumption Abrego is entitled to. According to Abrego, the Government has already shown that it cannot do so, given what Abrego asserts to be troves of evidence in the record indicating that his prosecution is actually vindictive. Based on this record, Abrego argues that the Court could rule on his Motion [to dismiss] without an evidentiary hearing or the testimony of [DOJ officials].

In other words, the current state of motions practice has diminished the need for discovery requested by the defense. But if the government can solicit testimony that works in its favor, the court strongly hints such discovery might very well come into play.

The evidentiary hearing is slated for Jan. 28, 2026.",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-and-Kilmar-Abrego-Garcia-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 09:56:28.062581

American justice ceases to function when its arbiters silence law enforcement and give megaphones to those who oppose our legal system.”

In the video, which was posted to TikTok on Friday, Abrego Garcia can be seen lip-syncing to “Himno de Victoria” by Danny Berrios. In a second video posted to the platform, Abrego Garcia records the sky and trees before turning the camera toward himself and singing along to Jesús Adrián Romero’s “Sumérgeme.”

Employees of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are under a gag order preventing them from making comments that could prejudice the public or interfere with Abrego Garcia’s right to a fair trial.

Earlier this month, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers accused Border Patrol officer Greg Bovino of repeated violations of the gag order, citing comments made on national television in which he referred to Abrego Garcia as an “alien smuggler” and “wife beater,” then asked the court to impose sanctions.

Under the auspices of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security, including Noem herself, have worked overtime to smear Abrego Garcia, repeatedly describing him as a “monster,” human trafficker, domestic abuser, child predator, and MS-13 gang member.

Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland for years with his American wife and child, has not been convicted of any crimes, and denies any involvement in MS-13.

Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, has become one of the most high-profile targets of President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation strategy.

After a judge ordered that the 30-year-old be returned to the U.S., the Trump administration immediately began working to deport him again, considering locations like Uganda and Liberia, countries to which he has no ties, and indicting him on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.

Abrego Garcia was released from custody on Dec. 11 after a federal judge determined that the government had no viable plan for deporting him.

Debate, enforcement activity and protesting over the issue intensified in the course of the year. Reps from both sides suggest more of the same may be in store in 2026.

Immigration agents traversed Utah to round up immigrants they say are in the country illegally, while several Utah law enforcement agencies entered into formal accords with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to assist. Earlier this year, Utah lawmakers approved a number of bills meant, most notably, to toughen the penalties immigrants face when they break the law. The Utah National Guard agreed to help out in a supporting role, though not in arresting immigrants.

The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Salt Lake City is the potential site of a federal processing facility for immigrant detainees, echoing a CNN report last October.

The efforts are about ""enforcing the law and doing it in a way that protects citizens here in the state, trying to get the worst offenders off the streets,"" Gov. Spencer Cox said last July. He had signaled strong support for Trump's efforts ahead of Trump's inauguration to his second presidential term last January.

Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs sounded a similar message last August in announcing plans for the city's police force to increase cooperative efforts with immigration authorities in tracking and detaining immigrants in the country illegally. ""By putting federal resources to work here in Riverton, we can better protect our residents, uphold the rule of law and keep our neighborhoods safe from criminal activity,"" he said in a statement with Riverton Police Chief Shane Taylor.

At the same time, though, the uptick in action has sparked backlash from immigrant advocates, particularly in light of enforcement action targeting immigrants without serious criminal records and others going through the process to normalize their migratory status. Foes of the crackdown spoke for four hours last July against a Utah County Sheriff's Office proposal to enter into a cooperative agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a plan that was ultimately approved. They marched through the streets of Salt Lake City last June to protest the crackdown, and demonstrated earlier this month outside the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in the Utah capital against the threat of increased enforcement action inside the facility.

Immigration attorneys — sometimes quietly, sometimes loudly — have stood up in defense of immigrants with a potentially legal basis to remain in the country and advocated for their right to due process in immigration courts. They've also expressed concern with negative characterizations of immigrants put forward by Trump and his backers.

""What concerns me most about the current government approach isn't just policy, it's the false narrative of who immigrants are,"" said Ysabel Lonazco, a West Valley City immigration attorney. ""When we portray immigrants as threats rather than recognizing them as neighbors, co-workers and contributors to our communities, we lose sight of our own story. America has always been a nation of immigrants, and that diversity has been our greatest strength, not our weakness.""

She lamented the ""dehumanization"" of immigrants under Trump, while Nicholle Pitt White, an attorney in Murray, said the president's efforts haven't been focused strictly on immigrants in the country illegally, as advertised.

""He has been aggressive to legal immigration as well, working to denaturalize — take citizenship away — from people who have followed the rules and worked hard to become Americans,"" Pitt said. ""He has paused citizenship applications and oath ceremonies for hundreds, possibly thousands, of others just to be cruel.""

Indeed, Carlos Trujillo, a South Jordan immigration attorney, said all immigrants, legal or otherwise, are feeling uneasy. Originally from Venezuela, he's a naturalized U.S. citizen who was advised last April by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to leave the country or face ""potential criminal prosecution.""

""The problem is that we all feel attacked, even the ones that are doing the right thing, even the ones that are following the law,"" Trujillo said.

As a result, many immigrants are skittish about going out in public, terrified they may be targeted by immigration agents, Pitt said. At the same time, immigrant advocates are increasingly organizing, Lonazco said, using whistles to sound warnings when immigration agents are present and recruiting supportive business operators to place ""No ICE allowed"" signs in their front windows.

""Yes, they are nervous. Yes, they are terrified, yet they still show up for work, they still show up for their court hearings, and they are learning about their rights,"" Lonazco said.

'Making America safe again'

Looking ahead to 2026, the situation may not change much.

In a statement last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lauded what she said have been the advancements under Trump, suggesting more of the same is in store for the coming year.

""Under President Trump's leadership, we are making America safe again and putting the American people first. In record time, we have secured the border, taken the fight to cartels and arrested thousands upon thousands of criminal illegal aliens. Though 2025 was historic, we won't rest until the job is done,"" Noem said.

Similarly, Trujillo is bracing for more from the Trump administration, particularly additional measures that could erode immigrants' rights in federal immigration court.

""I don't see anything that really gives me any hope at the moment that things are going to change for the better,"" he said. ""I do believe that things are going to get worse in many, many ways.""",https://img.ksl.com/slc/3116/311621/31162154.jpeg?filter=kslv2/responsive_story_lg,N,,2025-12-28 01:56:36.854144
