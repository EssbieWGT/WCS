The report on the facility housing migrants deported from the United States was postponed from an initial air date of Dec 21, with CBS saying it required additional reporting and would be broadcast later.

“CBS News leadership has always been committed to airing the 60 Minutes CECOT piece as soon as it was ready,” the network said in a statement on Jan 18 , though the show had

mistakenly been streamed

on Canada’s Global TV app in December.

The broadcast on Jan 18 added comments from the US Department of Homeland Security, details of the criminal records of those deported and additional reporting on one with tattoos, the network said.

The US has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial to the facility, known as CECOT.

“Last year, the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador, a country most had no ties to, claiming they were terrorists,” CBS said in a programme description on the show.

In a segment of the show, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaks with two Venezuelan men who were later released, and who described conditions in the facility as “brutal and torturous”.

The segment on CECOT included accusations of torture inflicted on Venezuelan deportees sent to the prison and raised questions about how the US characterised them.

When the report was pulled in December , CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss flagged concerns with 60 Minutes producers about the segment and asked for a substantial amount of new material to be added, a CBS employee told Reuters.

Ms Weiss was picked to lead CBS News in October after its parent Paramount Skydance acquired the online publication she founded, the Free Press.

A former opinion writer for The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, she was seen by some analysts as a contentious choice, since she had never before managed a television newsroom or produced broadcast news content.

A federal judge in Minneapolis cited the episodes in an unusually detailed ruling on Friday that found a pattern of misconduct by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and ordered them and other immigration agents to stop using excessive force against protesters while conducting their operations in the city.

In some ways, legal experts said, the judge’s order was fairly mundane because it merely ordered the federal agents to follow established constitutional law, permitting peaceful protests.

In other ways, it stood out.

“Extraordinary,” Michele Goodwin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said of the decision. The judge, she said, reviewed dozens of witness declarations and video evidence and found conduct “alarming enough, dangerous enough that the court has imposed a preliminary injunction.”

Protesters and state officials have for weeks been calling on the federal government to withdraw its immigration agents from Minneapolis, a movement that has only intensified since Renee Good was shot and killed on Jan. 7 by Jonathan Ross, an ICE officer.

In late December, the American Civil Liberties Union, on behalf of several protesters, filed a complaint against the federal government and its agents seeking to protect the protesters’ rights to speech, assembly and unlawful search and seizure.

The court order was based on earlier interactions that immigration agents had with protesters that did not gain as much attention as the killing of Ms. Good. The accounts described in the order were submitted to the court from declarations and video submissions from both parties.

Ms. Goodwin was one of several legal scholars and criminal justice experts who said the conduct of ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge, the government’s name for its immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, evoked the attacks by police officers in Birmingham, Ala., on civil rights protesters in 1963.

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, also noted the similarities. “I think about the civil rights movement in the South and how Southern law enforcement reacted with hoses, dogs and lynchings,” he said.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, called the judge’s findings “ridiculous” on Sunday in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation and then blamed the protesters.

“We only use those chemical agents when there’s violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe,” she said, adding that the judge’s order will not change the agency’s operations on the ground. “It’s basically telling us to do what we’ve already been doing,” she said.

Her agency was expected to appeal the ruling.

The case is the latest in a series of legal challenges across the country, including in California, Illinois and Washington, D.C., where civil and immigrant rights organizations have sought to curb the tactics of federal agents.

In Illinois, where immigration agents massed for several weeks last year, a federal judge issued a sweeping injunction that placed several limits on how agents could use force and interact with protesters. An appellate court later blocked that ruling, calling it too broad and too prescriptive.

The legal moves have come as the Trump administration pursues its deportation agenda, a cornerstone of the campaign that helped get Mr. Trump elected to a second term. For many, including in Minnesota, the immigration crackdown is the welcome fulfillment of that promise and should not be impeded by protesters.

The 83-page ruling found that “the record adequately illustrates that the defendants have made, and will continue to make, a common practice of conduct that chills observers’ and protesters’ First Amendment rights.”

Judge Katherine Menendez, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota by President Joseph R. Biden, said that neither party requested an evidentiary hearing, even though the court made that available.

She also stated that she gave “substantial weight” to the sworn statements from the plaintiffs and noted that immigration agents involved in the interactions with protesters did not provide sworn declarations.

Rather, the defense depended on testimony from David Easterwood, who directs the Minneapolis field office for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. Mr. Easterwood said he was not present at the encounters, but rather relied on “personal knowledge, reasonable inquiry and information made available to me.” Judge Menendez said because of that, she gave “considerably less weight” to the testimony of Mr. Easterwood.

In one episode described in the order, Judge Menendez concluded that federal agents likely were “simply fed up with the protesters generally” when they decided to violently arrest a man who was involved in peaceful activity.

“‘Let’s get this guy,’ one of the agents said, before they grabbed Abdikadir Noor, and threw him to the ground,” the ruling said.

While ICE contended in court papers that Mr. Noor was leading an agitated crowd of protesters as agents attempted to make an arrest, videos showed that he had pushed another protester away from the officers and held his arm up to urge other protesters to stay back, the court ruling said.

He was detained by ICE agents, taken to a federal building, shackled and put in a cell, and later released, according to the decision.

Ms. Tincher woke to learn that ICE agents had arrived in her Near North neighborhood in Minneapolis. She drove to a nearby home that was surrounded by agents to find out what was happening.

Standing about six feet from agents who had encircled the home, she said, she heard officers say, “Get back,” and “Take her down.”

Within about 15 seconds, she said, several agents had grabbed her and pulled her to the ground, then handcuffed her while she was face down in the snow. Witnesses said she did not physically resist agents or taunt or threaten them.

ICE agents took Ms. Tincher to the federal building where they removed some of her clothes, cut off her wedding ring, and shackled her. Before releasing her, they told her she would be charged with obstructing a federal officer. She was never charged.

In court papers, Mr. Easterwood said that Ms. Tincher had attempted to cross into the perimeter of the house and tried to push an ICE officer out of the way.

But Judge Menendez disagreed.

She also cited a number of incidents of ICE agents “gratuitously deploying chemical irritants at observers and protesters.”

Alan Crenshaw, 35, a Minneapolis resident involved in the protests, said he entered a restaurant and witnessed two agents “violently slamming a young Black man against the wall” even though the man was yelling in pain and telling them he was a U.S. citizen.

Outside, he said, he saw the agents push the young man into the snow for no apparent reason, handcuff him and place him in a car.

As a crowd gathered, Mr. Crenshaw said multiple people were being pepper sprayed with no warning. Agents drove slowly past, opened the car door and sprayed a bystander on the side of the road. Then, another ICE car without lights drove past and sprayed Mr. Crenshaw right in the face.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/18/multimedia/18nat-injunction-folo-04-fzpv/18nat-injunction-folo-04-fzpv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:21.745769

Whether it concerns visa status or Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity, the constitutionality of recent federal action is being highly contested across the country.

In light of this national discourse, a crowd of around 80 students, community members and professors gathered at SIU Simmons Law School on Wednesday, Jan. 14 for a lecture regarding ICE, immigration and new policies under the Trump administration.

Ohio State University’s César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández presented a lecture titled “Immigration Law in Turbulent Times” in which he describes recent events involving immigration through a legal lens. His lecture highlighted the increase in ICE raids across the country, clashes between civilians and agents that have led to shootings — like the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month — lawsuits, mass protests, the recent addition of 75 new countries to the U.S. visa ban list and the overall confusion concerning the legality of federal deportation practices.

Hernández’s teaching and writing details the intersectionality of criminal and immigration law and his lecture at SIU focused on the constantly evolving legal landscape that surrounds immigration enforcement techniques.

Attendees were able to speak with Hernández beforehand and ask questions after his lecture.

In his lecture, Hernández spoke about Trump’s campaign, and how he specifically pledged to evoke a deportation operation similar to President Eisenhower’s 1954 military-style campaign aimed at ending undocumented immigration by deporting hundreds of thousands of Mexicans through mass raids and arrests throughout southwestern America.

Hernández detailed the non-fatal shooting of Marimar Martinez, a Chicago woman whose SUV allegedly struck an ICE agent’s vehicle in October of 2025, after which the agent fired five shots, striking Martinez multiple times. Martinez’s vehicle was “boxed in” by ICE vehicles during the time of the shooting, and is among many of the contentious incidents in which ICE agents have used lethal force while conducting raids.

“The head of the FBI called her (Martinez), a domestic terrorist,” Hernández said.

She was later charged with assaulting and impeding federal officers, but the government’s account was challenged with conflicting evidence, including body-camera footage and text messages from an agent. Federal prosecutors then dismissed these charges citing prejudice, which means the case cannot be reopened because of a weak or flawed case.

Hernández then spoke about the fatal shooting of Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in January 2026 while in her vehicle as she engaged with agents during a neighborhood raid in Minneapolis.

“Good did not open the door. She did not exit the car. She continued driving it. First backwards, then forwards, then to the right. Then an agent, phone in one hand, shot her with a gun that he held in the other.” Hernández said. “The script repeats: Good is dead, and high level government officials say she is a domestic terrorist.”

Hernández also talked about the role that court case Terry v. Ohio plays during ICE raids. The 1968 Supreme Court ruling found it constitutional for police to “stop and frisk” without probable cause if they have reasonable suspicion that someone was involved in a crime.

Hernández said that Terry v. Ohio ties directly into a “turbulent time” on the west coast, with hundreds of ICE agents in the Los Angeles area. A district court in California recently responded to a lawsuit, Vasquez v. Noem (2025), that was brought by a group of people who were stopped and questioned by ICE agents. The plaintiffs believe they were racially profiled.

Hernández explained that the lawsuit, if successful, would prohibit ICE from racially profiling based on skin color, native language, accents, location or work/profession. A federal judge from California then agreed and issued an order restricting these tactics of profiling because it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court later paused the judge’s ruling, allowing ICE to continue those tactics.

Hernández noted that Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court justice, is of the opinion that immigrants “often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.”

Kavanaugh was appointed in 2018, and has since written multiple court opinions about whether or not factors like race and ethnicity could be considered in immigration stops under the Fourth Amendment.

“How would an agent know that someone does not speak much English? How would an agent go about racially or ethnically categorizing a person?” Hernández asked, referring to Kavanaugh’s remarks regarding the Supreme Court’s hearing of Noem v. Vasquez. “Kavanaugh did not explain how agents were supposed to figure out those factors.”

Hernández explained that he and a friend, “just two brown-skin Latinos speaking Spanish” were having coffee.

“If we said one word to each other in English, it is one more than I can recall. If an immigration agent happened to be nearby, would they hear my conversation, not in English, and then decide that it must be because I cannot speak English?” Hernández asked. “What type of work would they decide I do? Would they assume that I am a tenured, full professor who holds an endowed chair at one of the country’s premier public universities?”

Hernández also spoke about the contingency surrounding the 14th Amendment, which states that people born of naturalized citizenship in the U.S. are citizens of the U.S. and that no state can enforce a law that can abridge the privileges and immunities of citizenship. Upon Trump’s second term, he challenged the interpretation of the 14th Amendment and what it means to be a “natural-born citizen” through an executive order. Trump argues that birthright citizenship should not automatically apply to children born to undocumented immigrants or parents without permanent legal status.

Hernández said that if this case is constitutionalized, “It will leave many of us without the U.S. citizenship we thought was woven into our legal DNA.”

In September 2025, the Supreme Court decided to hear the case. The court will likely not have a decision until mid-2026.

He closed his lecture with sobering remarks.

“We struggle to agree about whether what we see is real,” Hernández said. “We struggle to agree on whether the days are dominated by light or by darkness. We struggle to agree on whether the political storm in which we find ourselves is one of rejuvenation or one of decay.”

Hernández is currently the Gregory H. Williams Chair of Civil Rights and Liberties at Ohio State. Hernández has earned recognition as one of the top 10 most cited immigration law scholars in the U.S. Among being a scholar and author, Hernández is a former member of the ABA Commission on Immigration.

Simmons Law School Dean Hannah Brenner Johnson explained the importance of these lectures and continued conversations. She said the lecture was created in honor of the school’s founding dean, Hiram Lesar, whose work revolved around civil rights and public policy.

“I think at this particular point in our nation’s history, immigration is a very, very hot-button issue. So, it was very timely to bring a scholar in to talk about some of the constitutional issues that have arisen, and to also bring humanity to the problem as well,” Johnson said.

Attendee Sheila Simon, former lieutenant governor of Illinois and Simmons Law School professor, offered her perspective on Hernández’s lecture in an interview with the DE.

“I think it’s really important for them (law students) to hear the importance of conversation and the continued dialogue, and valuing the rule of law as a way to prevent violence,” Simon said.

In December, when a man accused of witness tampering requested a trial, prosecutors urged a judge to ban any mention of ICE or masked agents.","McALLEN, Texas (ValleyCentral) — In October, agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducted a major operation in McAllen.

The agents — wearing masks and carrying guns — raided five used-clothes warehouses, arrested more than 20 people and seized $176,000.

Three months later, as the cases head to trial, prosecutors want to ban any mention of ICE, masks or guns from the courtroom.

“The concern is that all this media attention surrounding these ICE shootings and ICE raids and things, they really strike an emotional chord with people,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Lyles said during a hearing on Monday. “And the concern is that the jury would be triggered by use of ‘ICE,’ ‘masks,’ ‘firearms,’ and ‘yelling and screaming,’ and decide the case based on their emotions and ignore the court’s instructions to weigh the evidence.”

Jurors should focus on the facts, Lyles said, not how ICE conducted the raids.

Lyles summarized the government’s argument during a hearing in the case against Pedro Quintero Cardenas, 29, of Mission.

Cardenas managed Cardenas General Merchandise, which is located near the intersection of South Ware Road and Military Highway in McAllen.

Cardenas General Merchandise purchased used clothing from Goodwill locations in Ohio and Maine, according to documents filed in an unrelated lawsuit. The clothing is typically sold to customers in Mexico.

Agents raided Cardenas General Merchandise and detained 23 people on Oct. 2.

Twelve had tourist visas, according to the criminal complaint against Cardenas. Another 11 had no legal status in the United States.

“He admitted to hiring visa holders and undocumented individuals,” Mirna Garcia, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of ICE, testified during a hearing in October. “He also admitted to paying them in cash and not withholding taxes or Social Security from their paychecks.”

People with tourist visas can’t work in the United States.

“The business itself was an illegal enterprise,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Cook Profit said during the October hearing, “because it was employing these illegal individuals who had no status to work in the United States.”

A grand jury indicted Quintero on eight charges, including participating in a conspiracy to encourage non-citizens to illegally enter or reside in the United States. He pleaded not guilty.

Quintero returned to court Monday.

Depositions had been scheduled for 10 a.m. and the government wanted to prohibit Quintero’s attorney from mentioning ICE, masks, guns or people yelling and screaming during the raids.

“The jury has a right to know all the details — all the facts — of the case,” attorney Edelmiro Arredondo III, who represents Quintero, told a judge.

Arredondo said the details would provide “a more colorful picture” for the jury.

“The government’s position is that allowing all this ‘color’ that defense counsel wants into the depositions will seriously risk jury nullification,” Lyles said.

Mentions of ICE, masks or guns are “completely irrelevant,” Lyles said, to whether Quintero encouraged non-citizens to enter or reside in the United States.

“It’s clear, I think, that use of those words risks inflaming the jury, creating undue prejudice and jury nullification,” Lyles said.

It wasn’t the first time Lyles had made that argument.

In December, when a man accused of witness tampering requested a trial, prosecutors urged a judge to ban any mention of ICE or masked agents.

Attorneys largely avoided both topics. After more than six hours of deliberation, jurors found the man guilty.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Juan F. Alanis, who presided over the hearing on Monday, granted the government’s motion to prohibit “argument or evidence designed to elicit jury nullification,” but refused to ban any mention of ICE, masks, guns or yelling and screaming.

“If they’re with ICE, that’s a factual statement,” Alanis said. “If they had masks on, that’s a factual statement. If they had their firearms in use, that’s a factual statement.”

Alanis noted that he wasn’t present when agents executed the search warrants and didn’t know what, exactly, happened.

“If, for whatever reason, they felt a need — they had to raise their voice to get control of the situation, that may be just a factual statement,” Alanis said. “I don’t know.”

The ruling is limited to depositions in the case against Quintero. Prosecutors remain free to make a similar request before trial.

“I understand the government’s concern,” Alanis said. “The defense is on notice: If they decide to grandstand or go beyond just asking the straightforward questions, at a later date a judge may disallow that information being played before a jury.”

The client complained on to LeO and, after he refused to accept the investigator’s decision, a final decision was issued by ombudsman Hannah Logue.
Instead, she reduced the costs bill by 50%, resulting in an order that Mr Sufian refund £4,911.50.
This contributed “to a significant extent” to her decision that Mr Sufian had failed to provide reasonable costs information throughout his instruction, Judge Pilgerstorfer held.
The judge quashed LeO’s decision on the costs information and the remedy and directed it to reconsider them.","The Legal Ombudsman (LeO) has been ordered to reconsider part of its findings of poor service by a direct access barrister after it overlooked a key piece of evidence.

However, Marcus Pilgerstorfer KC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, dismissed all of Md Abu Sufian’s other challenges to LeO’s decision.

Aside from the mistake of fact, he found neither procedural faults in the way LeO dealt with the case nor unreasonableness or irrationality in its decision making.

Mr Sufian, head of 160 Fleet Street Chambers in London, for ‘Client N’ on several pieces of immigration work, including two oral permission hearings in judicial review proceedings, preparing an appeal to the Court of Appeal – which was conceded before the hearing and led to an order of £16,350 in costs in favour of his client – and a successful challenge to directions to remove the client from the country, again with costs.

Client N complained to Mr Sufian’s chambers about various matters, including that the Court of Appeal costs were paid directly to the barrister. These were rejected, with the chambers saying Client N authorised payment of the costs direct to him.

The client complained on to LeO and, after he refused to accept the investigator’s decision, a final decision was issued by ombudsman Hannah Logue.

She found Client N had agreed that Mr Sufian could keep the Court of Appeal costs but went on to decide he failed to provide adequate costs information throughout his instruction, backdated one client-care letter, and failed to inform her of the costs award.

In deciding remedy, Ms Logue found that Mr Sufian received £27,210.50 but that Client N only reasonably expected to pay £17,298 based on the costs information provided.

However, if she ordered him to refund the difference of £9,912.50, that would have meant Mr Sufian receiving only 39% of the overall costs bill of £44,598. Given that the quality of the actual legal work was good, this would be unfair, Ms Logue decided.

Instead, she reduced the costs bill by 50%, resulting in an order that Mr Sufian refund £4,911.50.

The barrister brought a judicial review on multiple grounds and the only successful element was over one piece of work for which LeO said he did not provide costs information when in fact the client-care letter had expressly quoted a fee of £7,500.

LeO accepted that the evidence pack Ms Logue had used was missing the relevant page and that this amounted to a mistake of existing fact.

This contributed “to a significant extent” to her decision that Mr Sufian had failed to provide reasonable costs information throughout his instruction, Judge Pilgerstorfer held.

Further, it affected the decision on remedy. Under Ms Logue’s original methodology, adding £7,500 to the fees Client N reasonably expected to pay would have meant Mr Sufian was only overpaid by £2,412.50. Given that, she may well have stuck with that approach.

The judge quashed LeO’s decision on the costs information and the remedy and directed it to reconsider them.",https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Marcus-Pilgerstorfer-KC.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 19:58:10.010092

Several particularly relevant human rights that would feature in a national Human Rights Act include: The right to health: this right would ensure everyone has access to safe and affordable healthcare.","Did you know that Australia has no national human rights framework? Australia has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights since 1948, but this has never been adopted into Australian law.

There are state and territory-based human rights charters in Queensland, Victoria and the ACT, with legislation introduced in NSW in October 2025. However, these do not bind our federal government and are not necessarily very effective in enforcing human rights. Governments remain able to have the final say without oversight on whether a law or decision will infringe on a person or group’s human rights.

The national campaign for a Human Rights Act is well underway, and the ANMF has signed onto this campaign as a supporter. So, what would a national Human Rights Act look like, and how would it operate?

History of the campaign

There have been several attempts to launch a Human Rights Act in previous decades, the most recent of which occurred during the Rudd government. The concept of enshrining human rights on a national level appears inherently good, but the campaign has historically failed due to a lack of political will. After all, a large part of a Human Rights Act would be to require governments to consider human rights when making laws and decisions.

What will a Human Rights Act do?

Put simply, a Human Rights Act would do three core things:

Hold our governments accountable.

Consolidate and promote our national values of equality and non-discrimination.

Align our laws with our international obligations and provide legal clarity.

In doing these three things, a Human Rights Act would allow everyone in Australia to look to a set of rights that encapsulates our values and provides an understanding of what people can and cannot do, consistent with a rights-based framework.

Given the federal government makes laws and decisions in relation to key areas like immigration, childcare, aged care, welfare, taxation, and some aspects of health and housing, it is important they are bound by a human rights framework. A Human Rights Act would make sure the government considers our human rights and acts without breaching them. Key examples where a human rights framework would have impacted and potentially prevented poor decision-making include the Robodebt crisis or the use of indefinite immigration detention.

Finally, a Human Rights Act would enable the enforcement of our rights by the courts and prosecutions when they are breached. Individuals or groups would have a clear framework by which they can assess whether their rights have been breached and strong enforcement mechanisms to ensure those breaches do not continue.

How will a Human Rights Act impact ANMF members and patients?

Several particularly relevant human rights that would feature in a national Human Rights Act include:

The right to health: this right would ensure everyone has access to safe and affordable healthcare. It also ensures the underlying determinants of health including environment and work facilitate a person’s good health. This right in particular would have huge impacts for our members and patients across the health system, ensuring healthcare is delivered in a safe environment and at a high quality by appropriately qualified people.

The right to an adequate standard of living: this right would guide housing policy to ensure it is available and affordable, particularly for public and social housing. It would also impact welfare policy to ensure that our society’s most vulnerable are able to have dignity in their lives.

The right to privacy: in an increasingly digitised world, this right would ensure everyone has their privacy and data protected.

The right to education: this right operates to ensure education is readily accessible and affordable for everyone.

The right to freedom of association: this right enshrines the right for you as our members to be part of a trade union.

The right to work: this right ensures that everyone is able to meaningfully gain a living from employment and enjoy favourable conditions at work. Clearly, this is core business for the ANMF!

The arguments for a national Human Rights Act are resounding, and the ANMF is advocating for it to be added to the Albanese government’s legislative agenda.",https://anmj.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/HumanRightsWEB.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:10.854138
,Agencies,2026-01-19 00:03:51+00:00,CNN,Aftermath video of latest ICE shooting in Minneapolis involving an undocumented ... - CNN,"Diego Mendoza, Caroll Alvarado, Alaa Elassar",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/18/us/ice-agent-shooting-video-minneapolis,"But videos from Sosa-Celis’ family appear to tell a different story.
Exactly one week earlier, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, in her vehicle.
In the video, the family tells a 911 dispatcher that agents shot Sosa-Celis as he tried to enter his home.
In the Thursday statement from DHS, ICE said the agent who shot Sosa-Celis did so after chasing him on foot after Sosa-Celis crashed into a parked car.
Once we were inside, they shot at Julio.’” After ICE shot and then detained Sosa-Celis, Sosa-Celis joined a Facebook livestream while in the hospital.","Newly obtained videos of the moments right after the Wednesday incident in which an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis appear to contradict at least some of ICE’s claims about events leading up to the shooting.

In a statement Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security said the agent targeted, chased and then shot the man in self-defense as the agent was being “ambushed” by three people. But accounts in the videos contradict the identity of the person DHS says federal agents chased, and the details of the shooting itself.

According to DHS, federal agents were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” when, they say, Julio Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, resisted arrest and started to “violently assault” one of its officers. During the struggle, DHS said in the statement, two additional people came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer using a snow shovel and a broom handle.

According to DHS, Sosa-Celis “got loose” and began striking an agent “with a shovel or broom stick.” DHS says the agent then “fired a defensive shot,” which hit Sosa-Celis in the leg.

The three people who allegedly assaulted the officer ran into the apartment building and barricaded themselves before agents arrested all three, DHS said.

But videos from Sosa-Celis’ family appear to tell a different story. One of them shows a video call made by Sosa-Celis’ partner and reviewed by CNN, frantically describing to family members what she says happened, according to Alicia Celis, the mother of Sosa-Celis, who spoke to CNN.

The call appears to contradict ICE’s claims in DHS’ Thursday statement. There, ICE said it was Sosa-Celis who was driving a vehicle that crashed, and Sosa-Celis who fled on foot before agents struggled with him on the ground.

In the call, Sosa-Celis’ partner seems to say the driver of the car was not Sosa-Celis, but Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna — another man ICE detained during the same raid.

“Julio arrived first. They were chasing Alfredo — he had to jump from his car,” Sosa-Celis’ partner says during the call. “He ran and they threw themselves on top of him. After, Julio threw open the door, and they shot.”

The incident marks the second time in a week an immigration agent shot someone while on the job, sparking heated clashes in Minnesota and prompting President Donald Trump to threaten to use the Insurrection Act. Exactly one week earlier, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, in her vehicle.

Sosa-Celis was taken to an ambulance and hospitalized; the city of Minneapolis confirmed he had non-life-threatening injuries. CNN has contacted city officials to determine whether he is still hospitalized.

In a statement to CNN on Saturday, DHS stood by its initial statement that the subject of the raid on Wednesday was Sosa-Celis and that he was driving the vehicle.

The family’s version of events, heard in a livestreamed Facebook video when family members frantically called 911 to ask for help, also differs from DHS’ statement.

In the video, the family tells a 911 dispatcher that agents shot Sosa-Celis as he tried to enter his home.

“They were following my husband for about 30 minutes. They were trying to crash into him. He arrived at home and because we closed the door on them, they shot him!” a woman can be heard telling the dispatcher. It’s not clear who is speaking or whether Sosa-Celis is the person referred to as being followed.

Throughout the initial video, several family members can be heard pleading with the dispatcher for help.

“Where did they shoot your cousin?” a 911 dispatcher asks the family over the phone. “In the leg! The leg! Please help us! We have kids!” a man responds.

“We have a small child in the house!” one woman says in the background. “And if they shoot?” another woman asks.

“Do you know who shot them?” the dispatcher asks the group. “The ones from ICE! The ones from ICE!” a man replies.

The stream ends with the family continuing to speak with the dispatcher on the phone.

A different video obtained by CNN shows what was happening outside the home while the family waited inside.

In the video, agents are seen approaching the home and setting off a flash-bang. Smoke can be seen, and ramming sounds are heard as someone says, “They’re in! There’s more than a dozen of them.”

Mothers of detained men dispute DHS statement

Alicia Celis also told CNN she has spoken to her son only once, briefly, from the hospital after the shooting. Celis said she had not asked her son about ICE’s claim he attacked agents with a broom or shovel.

“(Julio) only called me to tell me that he is fine, for me not to worry, and for me to stay calm and not cry,” Celis said.

In the Thursday statement from DHS, ICE said the agent who shot Sosa-Celis did so after chasing him on foot after Sosa-Celis crashed into a parked car. DHS also described the agent as “fearing for his life” when he fired the shot. But in an interview with CNN, Mabel Aljorna, the mother of Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna, disputed both of those claims on the basis of her conversation with her son immediately after the shooting.

Aljorna said her son told her he was the one being pursued on foot by ICE, and that Sosa-Celis was already inside the home when the agent shot him — not outside, where ICE says the agent fired the shot.

“He told me, ‘Mom, ICE was chasing me. Once we were inside, they shot at Julio.’”

After ICE shot and then detained Sosa-Celis, Sosa-Celis joined a Facebook livestream while in the hospital. In that video, he says there was a physical confrontation between him and agents before the shooting as he tried to help Aljorna get inside the home.

However, he also claims he was inside the house and the ICE agent was outside — and the two were separated by a closed door — when the agent shot him, while Sosa-Celis was locking the door and Aljorna was already inside.

“What happened was that ICE had been chasing my cousin from far way. He came over here, and he tried coming to the house,” Sosa-Celis said. “He got there and he was able to escape. We struggled with them. We were successful in helping my cousin get inside. And as I tried shutting the door, ICE shot me in the leg.”

“The shot that was fired happened when my cousin managed to escape, and he entered inside,” Sosa-Celis said on the livestream. “I closed the door. And as I was locking it, I heard the shot, and that’s when I realized I had been shot in the leg.”

CNN visited the home Friday. The front doorway was boarded up and there was no evidence to be found about the condition of the front door at the time of the shooting.

CNN has been unable to directly reach Sosa-Celis and Aljorna for comment.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256383698.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-18 19:57:53.573433

Similarly, the Trump administration refused for months to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the same Salvadoran prison.","In his first year back in office, President Trump has completely shifted the U.S. approach to immigration, launching the most visible enforcement effort seen in history while closing the door to many legal pathways for entering the U.S.

Trump promised to plug the border and crack down hard on those living in the country illegally, and under his tenure crossings have fallen to a historic low while the number of people kept in immigration detention centers has soared.

Whether Trump has fulfilled his promise to go after the worst of the worst when it comes to immigrants in the country illegally is in dispute. More than 70 percent of those held in immigration detention have no prior criminal record.

Separately, many of those targeted have legal status in the U.S., as the Trump administration pushes to end, pause or limit various ways to lawfully live in the country.

The crackdown may also be negatively impacting Trump’s polling numbers.

Polling shows Trump’s approval rating has slipped from 50 percent to 40 percent in the span of a year. In a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 57 percent of respondents said they did not approve of how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enforces immigration laws. And a poll from The Economist saw a surge in support for abolishing ICE, with 46 percent recently saying they wanted to scrap the agency, up from 27 percent in July.

Republicans described the year as a culmination of Trump’s most prominent campaign pledge.

“Our job is pretty basic. What did you tell the voters you were going to do when you ran for it? If you get elected, go do what you say. No one does that better than President Trump,” said Rep Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of the president’s allies in Congress.

“He told us he could secure the border. He did it in like four months time.”

Democrats argue Trump’s actions have at times descended into unlawful territory.

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), who has introduced legislation to shift a number of immigration enforcement policies, said Trump’s actions “completely demeans and denigrates the American values that this country has lived, has relied on for 250 years.”

“The damage to the country is far greater than the actual policy or even the deportation results, because what he’s attacking are the very fundamental values that have been the bedrock of this country since its founding, which is that it’s the land of opportunity that was built by immigrants, has been a refuge for those who are suffering around the world,” he said.

A focus on immigrants with legal status

While Trump pledged to remove those in the country illegally, the president has taken a whirlwind of actions that instead target immigrants with legal status.

“The truth is that the Trump administration campaigned on immigration reform, but what we’ve seen and what he’s delivered goes well beyond what he said,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

“Not only has he shut down the border, he has shut down legal immigration and taken away legal status from individuals who had it,” she added, noting that those whose status has lapsed can then face deportation.

In his first year back on the job, Trump has ordered a re-review of the 200,000 refugees who had been admitted under the Biden administration, a group that undergoes some of the most rigorous vetting before arriving in the U.S.

And in the wake of the killing in November of a National Guard officer in Washington, D.C., Trump paused the processing of pending immigration petitions for people from 19 countries on the travel ban list, a group that grew significantly as the president expanded the ban to 39 countries. The move meant those seeking green cards or even set to naturalize were stuck in limbo, unable to advance their petitions.

In March, Trump said he would strip the parole status former President Biden gave to citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Honduras, curtailing the two-year status and forcing roughly 530,000 people to leave the country.

Trump has also moved to scrap deportation protections for 12 of the 17 countries designated for so-called temporary protected status (TPS).

Meant to block deportation of citizens whose home countries are experiencing natural disasters or civil unrest, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has repeated the same refrain as it has ended the status country by country: “Temporary means temporary,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in ending the TPS for Somalia.

Collectively, lifting TPS jeopardizes the status of more than 1 million people, and it’s one of the few issues that has sparked some pushback from within the GOP.

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R), whose Florida district includes many people who came in on parole or were covered by TPS, said the process needs more “nuance” to account for those who had legitimate concerns in fleeing dictatorial regimes.

He blamed Biden for a poor process that is “creating a very difficult situation to actually solve this issue for folks who, by the way, are here and are good people, and they committed the original sin, right, [on immigration]. But then most Americans understand, [for] those people, we should have a process,” Diaz-Balart said.

The Trump administration has also revoked 8,000 student visas amid a pushback on people it says have espoused views counter to U.S. interests. The majority of those visas revoked appear to be for committing crimes while in the country, but at least 200 to 300 visas were revoked over alleged support for terrorism, a term the department used for some who have protested the Israel-Palestine conflict.

Beyond students and faculty, the State Department also rescinded permissions for five technology researchers focusing on disinformation the Trump team accused of targeting conservative speech.

Immigration advocates say the move is a clear infringement on free speech.

“One of the ways that they have used the immigration system to impact democratic norms is in the weaponization and targeting people for what is speech, using the system against people who dare say something that the administration disagrees with — not [speech] that is illegal by any means, just not something that they that they want to hear,” said Jorge Loweree, managing director at the American Immigration Council.

Trump has also sought to prevent new immigration to the U.S. through various moves.

In October the president set the lowest refugee cap in history, allowing just 7,500 refugees to come into the country in the coming year, down from the goal of 125,000 set under Biden. In addition, Trump has dictated that accepted refugees should primarily be white South Africans.

Beyond the initial travel ban, Trump announced last week he would also pause immigration visa processing for 75 countries, effectively blocking immigration from nearly 40 percent of the countries on the globe.

Trump also suspended the green-card lottery, targeting the method the Brown University shooter used to arrive in the U.S., upending a program that allows up to 55,000 people a year to migrate.

Trump has opened up some new immigration pathways, but those options have been tied to hefty fees. He revamped the investor visa as a so-called Gold Card for those willing to pay $1 million. H-1B visas now also come with a $100,000 price tag.

Visible enforcement and growing detention

Trump has fundamentally changed the dynamic at the southern border as well as how immigration officials carry out enforcement across the country, part of a widely publicized campaign.

Data tracking crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border shows a nosedive from roughly 100,000 a month under the last few months of the Biden administration to an average of around 10,000 a month since Trump retook office.

Republicans in Congress say this is the crowning achievement of Trump’s immigration approach.

“We’ve pretty much solved that problem,” Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.), chair of the House Republican Conference, said of the border.

“So I think it’s been pretty doggone good. It’s been so doggone good that we don’t even talk about the border anymore. That is absolutely fantastic.”

Much of Trump’s focus has been on removing people already in the country as the president has sought to impose the largest mass deportation effort in history.

Rates of those held in immigration detention are also at their highest ever, with some 70,000 people currently locked up and facing deportation.

However, 73 percent of those currently held in detention have no criminal record. The data, compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, indicates that within the 28 percent who do have a criminal record, “many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, including traffic violations.”

“‘Mass deportation’ isn’t possible with any kind of targeted approach,” Loweree said. “Their promises to deport people en masse by going after ‘criminals’ were a lie from the start.”

The tactics used by the administration to remove people have also come under significant scrutiny.

ICE officers, backed by other DHS officials, have been dispatched to carry out raids in left-leaning cities across the country. Tracked by protesters and observers, city-by-city footage has emerged of aggressive and at times violent enforcement.

ICE’s policies have particularly come under scrutiny since an officer shot and killed Renee Good on a Minneapolis street earlier this month. The administration argues the ICE officer feared for his life because Good, driving her car, was threatening him. City and state officials argue the ICE officer acted recklessly.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) said those images have been a turning point for the public, referencing video of ICE officers cutting a woman’s seatbelt to drag her out of her car as well as the viral footage of Good’s death.

“The American people are changing their views on immigration, whereas immigration, maybe in the past, was seen as a negative thing, a bad thing, I think all polls show that that’s no longer the case,” he said. “And I think the American people are more empathetic about immigrants in the plight of immigrants, as they see with their very own eyes, what’s happening across the country.”

In the wake of Good’s death, the administration has largely doubled down, accusing her of acting as a domestic terrorist while noting attacks against ICE officers.

While DHS did not respond to request for comment for this story, Noem has routinely defended Trump’s immigration approach.

“ICE isn’t the problem. The problem is sanctuary politicians and the violent criminal illegal aliens they protect,” Noem recently wrote on social platform X.

“President Trump and this administration work to protect every single American and make sure that they can live in a safe community and can raise their kids without fear.”

Court battles on policy and with judges themselves

Many of Trump’s immigration moves have been paused or overturned by the courts, but the Trump administration has aggressively fought those orders and, in some cases, defied a judge’s directives.

The Trump administration faced a contempt of court inquiry after it sent more than 100 Venezuelan men to be imprisoned in El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. Numerous courts ruled Trump did not have the power to expel the men without giving them the chance to contest allegations of gang ties.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg determined the Trump team “secretly spirit[ed]” them away after his order to halt or turn around any flights. After Boasberg issued an additional ruling offering the Venezuelans a way to return to the U.S. to continue their court battles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued they would not return, citing ongoing negotiations after toppling Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

Similarly, the Trump administration refused for months to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from the same Salvadoran prison. Abrego Garcia, who was previously protected from being deported to his home country, was removed because of an administrative error. While numerous courts ordered the administration to attempt his return, it did not do so until it brought him back to face human trafficking charges relating to a 2022 traffic stop.

After lawmakers won a suit challenging a DHS policy seeking to block them from making unannounced visits to detention centers, Noem again tried to enforce the policy.

The Trump administration has also come under fire for interfering with the immigration court system, where migrants pursue asylum and other legal claims for remaining in the country. In some cases, prosecutors pushed to dismiss cases, only to end someone’s legal claim so an officer waiting outside the courtroom could arrest them and fast-track their deportation.

Goldman, who has sought to bar the practice, noted migrants who are pursuing a lawful pathway to immigration cannot be deported.

“The courthouse stuff is the betrayal of the promises of the campaign, when Donald Trump said that he would be focusing on going after the worst of the worst, citing murderers and rapists and sex traffickers and horrific violent criminals,” he told The Hill.

“To turn around and be so lazy and ineffective that they resort to just waiting for people who are following the requirements of immigration law, showing up for court appearances, showing up for their required check-ins, and instead of getting a benefit from doing things the right way, they’re getting smashed and detained and deported. And it’s such a sabotage and it’s so repulsive that rather than going after serious felons who should be deported they’re going after the people trying to do it the right way.”

Trump has faced roughly 150 major lawsuits challenging his immigration policies, and many of his moves remain tied up in court.

An effort by Trump to scrap birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are not American, which is guaranteed by the Constitution, is set to be weighed by the Supreme Court this spring.

He has also tried through numerous different policies and executive orders to end the legal right to asylum, effectively ending the pathway.

Many of Trump’s attempts at scrapping TPS have also been halted, in some cases because the administration failed to follow a process that requires offering detailed analysis of how country conditions have shifted.

But the Supreme Court has also repeatedly blocked lower court injunctions, allowing the Trump administration to continue to deport people to countries they are not from and to force those on parole to leave the country.

Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back on criticism of Trump, arguing he is using all the legal levers at his disposal to remove those not lawfully present in the U.S.

“He’s simply enforcing the law and a policy of enforcing the law, even one that did not prioritize criminal aliens, would still be enforcing the law,” he said.

“The fact that we had four years of not enforcing the law, flagrantly ignoring the intent of Congress and existing laws, is the four years of criminal conduct by Joe Biden.”

The 3 years ahead

Much of Trump’s immigration push is only just beginning.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump was given $45 billion in ICE funding to expand detention capacity to 135,000 at any given time.

Already the administration has struggled to secure facilities to house the migrants it wishes to detain, pushing them to work with states to line up more space. That includes so-called Alligator Alcatraz, a facility made of tents and chain link fences constructed in just days on an old airway strip in Florida.

Immigration advocates fear many who pose no real threat will continue to be exposed to harsh detention conditions.

“The fact that we’re spending billions of American taxpayer money on detaining individuals who are not criminals, who are not risks to our country, is outrageous,” said Dalal-Dheini, with the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Some in the GOP are hopeful that the trickle of migrants will mean the party will make good on its promise to review immigration reform once the border is secure.

Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), a former federal prosecutor, said that the focus should be on dangerous criminals and lamented that some industries, including those that need seasonal workers, have been hit hard by Trump’s enforcement.

“They always say, ‘Well, you gotta wait till the border’s secure to talk about immigration reform.’ So then that’s going to be the next debate,” he said.

“We got to look at some common sense solutions,” he said. “There are industries that really need the labor, and that’s the ag industry – I talk to them all the time, the construction, the restaurant [industries].”

He also noted areas like the tech sector also need workers.

Democrats hope to win back the House majority this fall and then have greater power to investigate the administration and curtail its immigration practices.

“This is a marathon. This is not a sprint. And so, yeah, people feel exhausted. I’m a fighter,” Espaillat said.

“I want to see how we could combat [Trump] and make sure that the right things are done.”

But others see Trump’s immigration moves as part of a broader militarization that aligns with decisions to flex U.S. might and trample on the rights of citizens and residents.

“I’m scared,” Goldman said when asked about possibilities under the rest of Trump’s term.

“It’s getting worse and worse and worse.”

Sebastian Ordonez, 58, was detained Thursday morning by ICE agents after leaving his Brooklyn apartment building because he lacked legal immigration status, according to Zhuang.

Ordonez is from Guatemala, but his family and close friends say he has no history of violent crime and has been part of the Brooklyn community for nearly 20 years.

Though his lawyer, Michael Musa-Obregon, believes his client is not legally in the country, he says “everybody is entitled to due process.”

“You cannot just randomly walk up to people, racially profile them, look at them like they’re other. And because of the color of their skin, and their mannerisms, or whatever other things you have as an agent in your brain, assume or presume that they are here illegally,” Obregon said.

On Friday, Zhuang, Bishop Salgado, and other community members gathered to demand that federal representatives act swiftly to end federal immigration enforcement. They are also calling for Ordonez’s release from custody.

“We have to stand up against this nonsense. Against this illegal act by our president,” Councilmember Susan Zhuang said. “We have to make sure everyone deserves due process, regardless of what legal status you have in this country.”

Solidarity follows Ordonez’s detention and the federal visa ban on 75 countries deemed likely to need public assistance in the U.S.

PIX11 News reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for details on Ordonez’s detention, but the department was not immediately available to comment.",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2026/01/BISHOP-detained-e1768614790343.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 19:57:37.588541

Mr. Thune pushed him to support Mr. Cassidy, the person said, noting potential consequences for key votes in the future.
The timing of Mr. Trump’s endorsement surprised Ms. Letlow, according to a colleague who spoke to her on Saturday night.
That includes Mr. Cassidy, who voted in favor of Mr. Trump’s choice for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., last year, despite expressing misgivings.
Mr. Cassidy, who is a physician and a proponent of vaccines, has remained a public skeptic of Mr. Kennedy.","And while the board was conceived as part of Mr. Trump’s plan to oversee Gaza, there is no mention of Gaza in the charter. That omission added to speculation that the group may have a broader mandate to cover other conflicts and could even be aimed at creating a U.S.-dominated alternative to the United Nations Security Council.

A Security Council resolution adopted in November 2025 endorsed Mr. Trump’s plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and welcomed the establishment of the board as a transitional administration that would set the framework and coordinate funding for Gaza’s redevelopment.

The enclave was devastated during the two years of war. About 80 percent of the buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, according to the United Nations. Many of the roughly 2 million residents are still living in tents among millions of tons of rubble.

The board’s charter was sent out with invitations to potential members over the weekend. A copy reviewed by The Times was verified by an official on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomacy. News of the $1 billion buy-in was previously reported by Bloomberg.

On Friday, the White House announced the board’s members would include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, and Ajay Banga, the head of the World Bank.

Several countries said they had received invitations to join, including Argentina, Canada, Egypt and Turkey. King Abdullah II of Jordan has also been invited, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry announced on Sunday.

Mr. Trump, who is to chair the board, said in a post on Truth Social last week that it will be “the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place,” though much about it remained unclear.

The charter appears to outline a much more ambitious role for the board than the one described in Mr. Trump’s plan for Gaza, published in October 2025, as well as the subsequent Security Council resolution.

The board’s mission, according to the charter, is to seek “to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” and “to undertake peace-building functions in accordance with international law.”

The preamble emphasizes the need for what it calls “a more nimble and effective international peace-building body” and laments that “too many approaches to peace-building foster perpetual dependency and institutionalize crisis rather than leading people beyond it.”

According to the charter, the board is expected to meet for voting at least annually, and expenses are to be funded through voluntary contributions from member states or other sources. The charter does not elaborate on the peacekeeping efforts.

Along with the “Board of Peace,” the White House on Friday also outlined a “Gaza Executive Board” that would help liaise with a committee of Palestinian technocrats appointed to administer daily life in Gaza. The Gaza executive board includes Ali al-Thawadi, a senior Qatari official, and Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister, among others.

The composition of the executive board prompted the office of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to issue a rare public protest against the Trump administration, saying it “was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.”

While an Israeli businessman is on the executive board, Israeli government officials have not been named to it.

Miri Regev, an Israeli minister from Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party, told Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, on Saturday that Israel objected to participation of Qatar and Turkey, adding, “Prime Minister Netanyahu will do everything to change that decision.”

Relations between Israel and Turkey have oscillated over the decades, but since the war in Gaza, set off by Hamas’s attack against Israel in October 2023, they have deteriorated.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has downgraded ties with Israel, repeatedly compared Mr. Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler and praised Hamas, while hosting its officials. Israeli officials are anxious about the prospect of Turkey gaining influence over Gaza’s future.

After Israel struck Qatar in September 2025 in a failed attempt to kill Hamas leaders meeting there, Mr. Netanyahu defended the action and lashed out against the country for giving what he called “safe haven” to the militant group, even as Qatar was trying to negotiate a cease-fire.

Qatari officials have said they hosted Hamas officials at the request of the U.S. government to facilitate channels of communication. Mr. Netanyahu has in the past relied on Qatar to send millions of dollars a month to Gaza, a policy that was intended to keep the peace but that also helped prop up Hamas’s rule over the territory.

Israel’s priority is seeing Gaza demilitarized. Hamas so far has not agreed to lay down its arms.

But after being pressed on a video that backed up the accounts provided to the court, she changed course. Protesters were to blame for the use of force, she said, adding that federal officers “only use those chemical agents when there’s violence happening and perpetuating.”

The ruling on Friday by Judge Kate M. Menendez of the Federal District Court in Minnesota said that chemical agents had been used against protesters on at least four separate occasions and called the evidence of their use “uncontroverted.”

“Federal agents used chemical irritants” to punish protesters for exercising “protected First Amendment rights to assemble and to observe and protest ICE operations,” the judge wrote in issuing her injunction, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In response to an inquiry about Ms. Noem’s comments, Tricia McLaughlin, a homeland security spokeswoman, did not comment on Ms. Noem’s initial denial and backtracking of immigration agents’ use of force. Instead, she emphasized that assaulting and obstructing law enforcement is a felony, and accused protesters of tampering with agents’ vehicles and attacking officers with fireworks and automobiles.

Judge Menendez had dismissed the government’s claims that all use of pepper spray and other chemical irritants had happened after agents were “attacked,” finding that “protected conduct,” including protesting and observing the operations, had “motivated” the agents’ “adverse actions.”

The injunction issued last week stemmed from a lawsuit filed by activists who have protested the crackdown or observed the department’s operations in Minnesota. The suit was filed in December, before an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, prompting increased protests against the crackdown.

Ms. Good, 37, had partially blocked a roadway where agents were working and did not follow commands to get out of her S.U.V. As she began to drive away, an agent near the front of her car opened fire.

In addition to barring agents from using “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech, Judge Menendez also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

On Sunday, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, defended the Justice Department’s decision to not investigate the agent who fatally shot Ms. Good, saying that doing so would be bowing to “pressure from the media” and politicians.

“We investigate when it’s appropriate to investigate, and that is not the case here,” Mr. Blanche said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We don’t just go out and investigate every time an officer is forced to defend himself against somebody.”

The Justice Department has instead pushed to investigate Ms. Good’s widow, prompting several federal prosecutors in the state to resign.

Ms. Noem said during the interview that her department was conducting a separate, internal review of the agent’s actions, “following the exact same investigative and review process” that existed for years.

Even as critics of the government’s tactics say the operations, particularly in Minnesota, have indiscriminately swept up individuals based on racial and ethnic profiling, President Trump and members of his administration have insisted they are aimed at violent criminals.

Department of Homeland Security officials have repeatedly said that 70 percent of those detained in the administration’s immigration crackdown have been charged or convicted of a crime. That figure is roughly in line with a New York Times analysis of immigration arrests between the start of Mr. Trump’s term and Oct. 15, which found that 67 percent of those taken into custody had been at least charged with a crime of some kind.

But Ms. Noem on Sunday went a step further. “Every single individual” arrested by immigration agents had broken the law, she told “Face the Nation,” adding that 70 percent of those detained had either committed or been charged with violent crimes specifically.

Ms. McLaughlin, the department spokeswoman, did not respond directly to an inquiry about that statement, but repeated the department’s position that 70 percent of those arrested had been convicted or at least charged with a crime of some kind.

He added: “If you believe in the power of the law and that no one stands above it, if you stand against heavily armed mass federal troops invading an American city using Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens, if you believe you don’t deserve to be murdered for exercising your American right to protest, then send a message to this president.”

Mr. Springsteen went on to quote Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, who had used an expletive to tell ICE to leave the city. He then dedicated his song “The Promised Land,” which tells of a young working-class man striving for a brighter future, to Ms. Good.

“This one is for you, and the memory of mother of three and American citizen Renee Good,” he told the crowd.

Ms. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on Jan. 7 in Minneapolis. Mr. Ross was standing near the front of Ms. Good’s car and fired his gun after she drove toward him and then turned to the right. Mr. Trump and administration officials have said that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” against the agent.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement on Sunday that no one cared about Mr. Springsteen’s “bad political opinions.”

“If he actually believed in the power of the law,” she said, “he would understand that criminal illegal aliens should be deported, that impeding federal law enforcement operations is a crime and that officers have a right to act in self-defense if an individual is using their car as a deadly weapon.”

Mr. Springsteen’s remarks on Saturday were hardly the first time the musician has spoken out against Mr. Trump and his policies.

When Mr. Springsteen endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign in 2024, he called Mr. Trump the “most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.” Last year, Mr. Springsteen opened his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour in England by accusing Mr. Trump and his administration of trampling on civil rights and siding with dictators.

In response, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.” He also called for a “major investigation” into Mr. Springsteen and other celebrities, including Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey.

Undeterred, Mr. Springsteen released a six-track EP that offered a mix of songs and his political remarks from the show in England. That project began with his statement that the United States was “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”

Even so, the Pentagon last week put troops with two infantry battalions with the Army’s 11th Airborne Division on alert in case they ended up being called up, two Defense officials said.

“The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the commander in chief if called upon,” Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said in an emailed statement, using the Trump administration’s preferred moniker for the department.

The Pentagon last week also quietly alerted 200 Texas National Guard troops to be ready to deploy to Minnesota in the event that Mr. Trump followed through with his threat. The Texas Guard soldiers have remained on standby since returning home from Chicago late last year.

But the deployment of troops from the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, would be a major escalation for Mr. Trump, who has already sent National Guard troops into a number of American cities.

The use of military force on domestic soil in the United States is rare, and it is usually reserved only for the most extreme situations. Active-duty forces are barred from domestic law enforcement unless the president invokes the Insurrection Act, which allows for the use of federal troops on U.S. soil.

The order putting the troops on notice to deploy was reported earlier by ABC News.

On Friday, a day after issuing his Insurrection Act threat, Mr. Trump appeared to walk back his comments. “I don’t think I need it right now,” he told reporters while leaving the White House to spend the weekend in Florida.

Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, urged Mr. Trump on Thursday to back off the heated rhetoric. “Let’s turn the temperature down,” the governor wrote on social media. “Stop this campaign of retribution.”

The Justice Department has opened an investigation into Mr. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, an escalation in the state-federal battle over the conduct of immigration agents in the city.

Mr. Trump was talked out of invoking the Insurrection Act in 2020 following the protests over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis policeman. At the time, his defense secretary, attorney general and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff all advised him against sending active-duty troops into American cities to battle local citizens.

But Mr. Trump has a much more compliant Pentagon in his second term, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has worked to amplify Mr. Trump’s directives and inclinations, rather than seek to restrain him.

One defense official said on Sunday that the Pentagon was aware that Mr. Trump had appeared to back away from his threat, but also said that Mr. Hegseth wanted to be prepared.

“RUN JULIA RUN!!!” Mr. Trump wrote, adding that “Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement.”

The move is likely to create new tensions between Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans.

Mr. Trump called Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, on Friday and said he was likely to endorse Ms. Letlow, according to a person briefed on the conversation who was not authorized to discuss the private remarks.

Mr. Thune pushed him to support Mr. Cassidy, the person said, noting potential consequences for key votes in the future. The majority leader also noted that Mr. Trump was starting to push a major health care bill, which Mr. Cassidy would have jurisdiction over as chairman of the Senate’s health committee.

Mr. Cassidy responded to Mr. Trump in a social media post of his own on Saturday night: “I’m proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.”

Ms. Letlow did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday night, but on social media, she wrote that she was honored by the endorsement and made it clear that she was likely to announce a campaign.

“This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver,” she wrote.

The timing of Mr. Trump’s endorsement surprised Ms. Letlow, according to a colleague who spoke to her on Saturday night. The congresswoman had told people she would not enter the race without Mr. Trump’s official backing. But the move had long been in the works.

Mr. Trump first met with Ms. Letlow on March 5 of last year, the morning after the president’s address to a joint session of Congress. The Oval Office meeting included, among others, Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; James Blair, a deputy chief of staff; and Representative Lance Gooden of Texas. Mr. Gooden helped arrange the meeting with Ms. Letlow.

In the meeting, Mr. Trump told Ms. Letlow that he would support her if she decided to challenge Mr. Cassidy, according to a person who was in the room and insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation. But he said he would have to lie low for the time being to avoid a repeat of Mr. Trump’s clashes with former Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who routinely broke with the president, including on his vote to remove him from office.

Ms. Letlow, a former teacher whose political profile in her state grew when redistricting added Baton Rouge to her mostly rural constituency, is not known in the Capitol as an aggressive politician. She was hesitant to make any moves with only private assurances of Mr. Trump’s support.

Ms. Letlow spoke again with the president at the congressional picnic on June 12.

He again privately expressed his support, according to a person who heard their conversation. But he had still said nothing publicly. And she had still heard nothing more concrete from Mr. Trump or anyone in his political operation as of Dec. 11, when she announced her engagement at a holiday ball at the White House.

Big donors, meanwhile, were still giving money to Mr. Cassidy and telling Ms. Letlow that, until she formally declared that she was running, they would support him.

Ms. Letlow had almost resigned herself to staying out of the race. This month, she filmed two campaign commercials: one for a re-election campaign to the House, and one for a potential Senate race. As the February filing deadline approached, she did not know which one she would be using, according to a person briefed on her campaign plans.

But Ms. Letlow has been building quiet support from encouraging colleagues in the House, who said they expected her to jump in now and campaign aggressively.

Any endorsement of a candidate opposing a sitting senator is viewed as unwelcome by Senate Republicans, and it is a move the conference writ large has sought to avoid. That includes Mr. Cassidy, who voted in favor of Mr. Trump’s choice for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., last year, despite expressing misgivings.

Mr. Cassidy, who is a physician and a proponent of vaccines, has remained a public skeptic of Mr. Kennedy.

But he has taken pains to repair relations with Mr. Trump. As of late Saturday, the post he had pinned atop his X account featured a photograph of a meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president signed red hats.

“This is what a great working relationship looks like,” the October post from Mr. Cassidy said.

Mr. Trump’s endorsement of a potential Cassidy challenger comes days after the president frustrated Senate Republicans when he declared that five other G.O.P. senators should never be re-elected because of their opposition to him on military intervention in Venezuela. Among them was Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who is seen as the party’s most vulnerable incumbent in 2026.

Mr. Trump has also been unwilling to throw his support behind Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, who is facing a competitive primary race against two challengers, Ken Paxton, the state attorney general, and Representative Wesley Hunt of Texas.

Mr. Thune indicated to reporters last week that, despite his best efforts to persuade the president to back Mr. Cornyn, the three Texans were going to have to “duke it out in the primary.”

The National Republican Senatorial Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump’s latest move.

Alex Latcham, the executive director of the main super PAC aligned with Senate Republicans, said in a statement on Saturday that his group’s mission was “to preserve and expand” the Republican Senate majority.

“Anything that distracts from our efforts to beat Democrats in November is unhelpful,” he said.

The El Paso County Sheriff’s Office held a town hall meeting to discuss public safety, community policing and the implementation of Texas Senate Bill 8.

The town hall meeting was held on Saturday, Jan. 17, at the Socorro Ramirez Community Center, located at 106 Payton Rd. The Border Network for Human Rights co-hosted the event.

As KTSM previously reported, SB 8 mandates that every sheriff’s office in Texas counties with a population over 100,000 enter into a 287-G agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Under the agreement, trained local officers are allowed to carry out certain federal immigration functions.

Out of the three options given for the agreement, Ugarte said they will move forward with the Warrant Service Officer option: limits participation to serving administrative warrants or detainers on individuals already booked into the county jail.

This means that all warrant checks are done by federal officers, rather than local staff, to see if a detainer or immigration warrant exists for someone booked into the county jail. The bill officially went into effect this year on Jan. 1.

“This is not an option. This is not something that I wanted to do. But the Sheriff’s Office needs to do it because it’s a state law,” Ugarte said.

Ugarte spotlights the current political atmosphere, with ICE raids occurring in El Paso and across the nation, and emphasizes the importance of transparency.

“It’s very important because there’s a lot of confusion, there’s a lot of fear in our community because of what’s going on across the nation with federal agencies. So us, as local officials, it’s important to be transparent and talk to the community and have these forums if they have any questions so they can hear it directly from the Sheriff’s Office on what we are doing,” Ugarte said.

Ugarte also notes that, although the Sheriff’s Office is partnering with federal agencies, the priority of his office will remain focusing on crimes affecting the community.

“We work in collaboration with other agencies, but I want to remind the community that the focus of the Sheriff’s Office is dealing with crimes and issues that affect our community. That is the priority of the Sheriff’s Office,” he said.

He asks that if residents see ICE agents out in El Paso County, to not interfere with the investigations, including blocking roadways, assaulting the agents or damaging any property.

“If you do not agree with ICE and if you want to protest, you have a right to protest, but you need to protest from a distance. Keep your distance from the federal officers so they can do their job and do not interfere with any of their investigations,” Ugarte said.

Samantha Singleton, the policy director for the Border Network for Human Rights, said the topic most talked about was concerns about ICE and DHS raids that have been happening in El Paso.

“Outside of the 287-G agreements, the community is really concerned about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s raids that are taking place, about Homeland Security investigation raids that are being taken place, that there is no checks and balance when it comes to the federal organizations, that they are not identifying themselves, to community members that are coming in mass and they wanted to know if there was something that they should do or could do as community members to respond to these outgoing enforcement tactics that are taking place,” Singleton said.

She said that the Sheriff’s Office can assist in situations by confirming if the people investigating are federal agents. Once they have identified that they are agents, the Sheriff’s Office has to back off, as they do not have power over them.

“I believe the community should know that there’s always a way to get involved. So we ask that if you have questions, utilize our organization to be a resource. There are some tools that we have that we can help the community with. Most importantly, we want the community to know that we are here and we are here to assist and that we are each other’s keeper. And so we want you all to reach out to us if there are things that is needed from you,” Singleton said.",https://www.ktsm.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2026/01/EPCSO-BNHR-town-hall-meeting.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 23:58:17.244363

He’ll turn over duties to former Rep. Mikie Sherrill, plus the largest Democratic majority in the Legislature since Watergate.
And after eight years of governing with Trump in the foreground or the background, Murphy has a vantage point on the president unlike any other governor in the country.
Beyond New Jersey, Murphy expressed concern with the administration’s way it went about capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.
Throughout her campaign, Sherrill positioned herself as a bulwark to the Trump administration.","Murphy spoke with POLITICO for an hour last week to reflect on his eight years in office, which concludes on Tuesday. He’s the first Democrat in decades to win two terms in the New Jersey governor’s office, and he steps down with his party on an even stronger footing than when he arrived in Trenton. That may have been hard to fathom when the former Goldman Sachs banker emerged seemingly out of nowhere a decade ago to succeed Republican Gov. Chris Christie.

But after years as a finance chair of the Democratic National Committee and U.S. ambassador to Germany under President Barack Obama, Murphy leveraged his wealth and connections to clear a crowded primary field to become New Jersey’s 56th governor. He’ll turn over duties to former Rep. Mikie Sherrill, plus the largest Democratic majority in the Legislature since Watergate.

Over the course of the conversation, Murphy toggled between national and local fights — from the investigation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which he called “breathtaking,” to his policy achievements at home, including the legalization of marijuana and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

But, like virtually everything else in American life, Trump dominated. And after eight years of governing with Trump in the foreground or the background, Murphy has a vantage point on the president unlike any other governor in the country.

During the pandemic, Murphy also had a working relationship with former White House senior adviser and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whom he praised for his efforts to provide ventilators and personal protective equipment. He said that “people forget” that “early on,” the administration was “pretty good on this.”

Murphy said he “expanded” his relationship with the president into “adjacent lanes,” like over the Portal North Bridge, an upgrade project important to the Northeast rail corridor that the Trump administration approved federal funding for later in 2020.

“When he ran the first time, he had a great line, he said, ‘I’m the only president, if I get elected, I’ll be the only president in history who understands what rebar is,’” Murphy said, referring to his discussions of the bridge with Trump. “So I would try to couch it in a lane that I thought would connect with him. So less flattery than, ‘Wait a minute, I know this is his lived experience,’ or knowing New Jersey well.”

There’s less of that this time around. Beyond having what he called a “cordial conversation” with the president after he was elected again, Murphy hasn’t spoken with Trump lately — “it’s not that I wouldn’t speak to him, but it’s just harder,” he said — but talked to chief of staff Susie Wiles a couple of weeks ago.

The difference between the two Trump administrations, Murphy continued, is that “they know what they’re doing” and “there are no, that I can find, powerful voices on the other side of some of the actions.”

“I’m not a big Mike Pompeo fan, but Pompeo is brilliant, number one in his class at West Point — you know, a serious person,” he said. “Or Gary Cohn, who I know well, used to work with at Goldman Sachs, was the national economic adviser, Jared himself, who I have enormous regard for. Those folks are not on the scene, and I feel like that’s the biggest — there’s no ballast.”

Even with a good relationship, New Jersey hasn’t been immune over the years to federal issues trickling down into the states. And there’s been plenty of disagreement between the governor and Trump, including on offshore wind, which the president has sought to kill: “We’ve fought like heck against the Trump team on offshore wind,” Murphy said. “I don’t think it makes any sense.”

New Jersey has also been bullish when it comes to legal action against the administration, with outgoing Attorney General Matt Platkin suing more than 40 times since Trump came back into office.

And Murphy himself hasn’t been completely untouched. Last year, Trump border czar Tom Homan said that Murphy could be prosecuted over a comment he made suggesting he was harboring an immigrant at his home, and former acting U.S. attorney Alina Habba said she was investigating him over immigration enforcement. Nothing came out of either of those threats, according to Murphy.

But the governor said that he found that Trump has not gone “out of his way” to impact the Garden State — and “for the most part” still isn’t.

That doesn’t mean he’s not worried.

“I wake up every day hoping that we don’t get hit in an innocent drive-by shooting [and] the shrapnel comes our direction,” he said. “You’re balancing. You can’t abandon your values. You can’t abandon communities or people who are being attacked for no good reason on the one hand. And on the other hand, you’re trying not to start World War III, and that’s hard.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Those fears have only been exacerbated in recent weeks and months. In Murphy’s view, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act “will be awful for New Jersey.” The state, which is home to a prominent population of immigrants and a controversial immigrant detention center, is “not immune” to action from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said, adding that he’s worried a situation like the ICE agent who fatally shot a U.S. citizen in Minnesota could happen here.

Beyond New Jersey, Murphy expressed concern with the administration’s way it went about capturing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. When it comes to talk about the U.S. seizing Greenland, he said that discussing “a land grab from an ally and a NATO partner of the United States” is “so beyond the pale.” And the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Powell “further undermines an institution that we’ve spent a couple of centuries building up,” Murphy said.

In just a couple of days, Murphy will hand the keys over to Sherrill, who had a blowout win in November to secure a third Democratic term in a row leading the state, a feat that has not been accomplished for six decades. Throughout her campaign, Sherrill positioned herself as a bulwark to the Trump administration. In an interview last month, her campaign manager and soon-to-be chief of staff told POLITICO that they would be willing to work with the president if the “administration wants to get on the team” to support her efforts to make “life easier and more affordable for New Jerseyans.”

Trump endorsed Sherrill’s opponent Jack Ciattarelli — a change from previous New Jersey gubernatorial elections. He didn’t get involved in Ciattarelli’s 2021 race against Murphy, nor did he back Murphy’s opponent in 2017.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbd%2F9f%2F184d59794edaa0bd46cbc33ea8df%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2244527993,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:30.119803

Businesses have been forced to close.” Trump promised to target the “enemy within” throughout his campaign and into his second administration.
Years later, without any new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement, a Republican-controlled Congress last year approved a massive injection of taxpayer cash into ICE that outpaces most foreign military budgets.
Indiscriminate, large-scale arrests increased by 600 percent within the president’s first nine months, with roving patrols and raids supplementing targeted operations, according to the American Immigration Council.
Immigration arrests have more than quadrupled.","Nearly one year after returning to the White House with a promise to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in American history, masked immigration officers ripped a woman from her car as she tried to get to a doctor’s appointment in Minneapolis. On the other side of the country, a 21-year-old protester in Santa Ana, California, was recovering from eye surgery after an officer fired a riot-control weapon inches from his face.

They both came just days after an officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good.

The Trump administration’s promise to go after the “worst of the worst” in his nationwide campaign to rapidly deport tens of thousands of people has turned American cities into conflict zones patrolled by hundreds of masked and heavily armed officers.

Democratic officials warned for months that a surge of militarized Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers would only stir up more unrest. They warned that the scenes of mass protests were by design, giving the president an opening to invoke the Insurrection Act and deploy active-duty troops on Americans in cities run by his political enemies.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has reshaped the government to pursue an anti-immigration agenda across nearly every federal agency, with a mission to find, arrest and deport thousands of people, deter new arrivals and impose new restrictions on legal immigration that have repulsed humanitarian aid groups and civil rights advocates.

Thousands of people, most of whom have never been convicted of a crime, are now locked up in immigration detention centers, entering a byzantine legal process that the administration has pushed to make it virtually impossible to escape.

Federal officers, whose identities are largely kept secret and whose faces are covered, are routinely seen jumping out of cars and vans to round up immigrants and citizens alike, sometimes leaving their cars stranded in roadways or rolling down streets. They leave behind neighborhoods in shock and families in crisis, scrambling where to find members who often end up jailed hundreds of miles from home.

From Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, to Chicago, New York City, New Orleans and Charlotte, North Carolina, footage and stories of violent arrests and volatile protests have emerged at a dizzying pace.

In Washington, D.C., last summer, Trump invoked a never-before-used authority to seize control of the city’s police department as deployed the National Guard and surged federal officers into the streets, claiming the city was overrun with “bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.” Officials there accused the administration of waging a politically motivated “hostile takeover.”

And in Minnesota, where thousands of federal officers descended in recent weeks, “news reports simply don’t do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities,” according to Governor Tim Walz.

“This long ago stopped being a campaign of organized immigration enforcement,” he said January 13. “Instead, it’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

“People are being racially profiled, harassed, terrorized, and assaulted,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement announcing a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of “spreading terror” in the state. “Schools have gone into lockdown. Businesses have been forced to close.”

Trump promised to target the “enemy within” throughout his campaign and into his second administration. In 2023, he told a crowd in Iowa that he would send troops into Democratic-run cities whether officials there wanted them or not.

“And one of the other things I’ll do — because you’re supposed to not be involved in that, you just have to be asked by the governor or the mayor to come in,” he said. “The next time, I’m not waiting.”

Facing widespread protests against his mass deportation campaign, and relying on varying justifications for their deployment, Trump did exactly that. In June, the president began ordering National Guard troops to several Democratic-led cities, an effort that one federal judge rebuked as “a national police force with the president as its chief.”

Legal challenges from state and local officials accused the administration of using American streets for political theater, an attempt to stir up unrest to justify the president’s military and federal law enforcement occupation of cities with large immigrant populations.

In December, the Supreme Court blocked the administration from sending the military into Chicago, and, sensing impending legal failures in the face of other lawsuits over his threats to put boots on the ground, Trump pulled out of the idea altogether on New Year’s Eve.

But the administration has continued to surge officers into Democratic-led cities, dovetailing with the president’s crusade of retribution against his political opponents.

In courtrooms across the country, protesters and detainees alleged officers shot them with chemical weapons at point-blank range, turned neighborhoods into “war zones” filled with tear gas, and racially profiled citizens and Native Americans before hauling them to detention centers.

The administration “has blown through normative guardrails to make mass deportations a central element of government function,” according to the Migration Policy Institute.

That “scorched-earth anti-immigration campaign” is “part of a broader Trump administration assault” on constitutional rights, from the arrests of international scholars Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk that presaged the administration’s threats to dissent, to his ongoing efforts to unilaterally define who gets to be a citizen, according to Uzra Zeya, president of Human Rights First.

Days after an ICE officer in Minneapolis fatally shot Renee Good, whose death sparked a renewed wave of protests and political outrage, Trump promised a “day of reckoning” for Minnesota, his latest target. “RETRIBUTION IS COMING,” he wrote.

Less than one year after she was sworn into office, Homeland Security Kristi Noem is now facing threats of impeachment from dozens of Democratic members of Congress. And years after moderate Democratic figures sidelined “abolish ICE” demands, lawmakers entered the new year mulling how to cut off new funding for the agency, potentially triggering yet another government shutdown in Trump’s second presidency.

The “abolish ICE” movement gained momentum on the political left under Trump’s first term after the administration’s catastrophic family separation policy and a fresh wave of raids and arrests. Years later, without any new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement, a Republican-controlled Congress last year approved a massive injection of taxpayer cash into ICE that outpaces most foreign military budgets.

A record amount of new funding has turned ICE into the single largest federal law enforcement agency in the nation’s history, with nearly $15 billion a year to expand immigration detention and billions more dollars to recruit and hire officers.

Indiscriminate, large-scale arrests increased by 600 percent within the president’s first nine months, with roving patrols and raids supplementing targeted operations, according to the American Immigration Council.

Those arrests exploded alongside a historic expansion of immigration detention, with dozens of jails, makeshift facilities and state-backed facilities such as “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida and a wing of the notorious Angola prison in Louisiana holding more than 60,000 people at any given time, shipped around the country and jailed hundreds of miles from where they were picked up.

Unauthorized arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have plummeted. Immigration arrests have more than quadrupled. Detentions are at their highest level in modern American history.

More than 622,000 people were deported by the end of 2025, according to Homeland Security. But as many as 73 percent of those booked into ICE custody last year had no criminal convictions, according to ICE data reviewed by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

The administration has also “de-legalized” more than 1.5 million people who were already legally living and working in the United States, swiftly expanding the pool of “undocumented” or “illegal” immigrants who were following immigration law until the moment Trump’s government changed it.

Immigration agencies are canceling citizenship hearings and threatening green card holders and married immigrants interviewing for permanent legal status. Officers have arrested thousands of people who were showing up for court-ordered check-ins with ICE or immigration court hearings where they sought to make their case to stay in the country, with federal agents waiting on the other side of the door to literally rip them away from their lawyers and families.

With that radical expansion of the nation’s immigration detention centers came an avalanche of reports of abuse and neglect inside them.

A series of sworn testimonials from detainees at the largest ICE facility in the country allege deteriorating conditions and routine beatings that have left several people hospitalized, including detainees whose testicles were “firmly crushed” by guards.

Federal judges have intervened to force ICE to improve conditions inside facilities in New York and Chicago, where detainees were allegedly forced into cramped cells near open toilets without adequate food, water, clean clothing or a place to bathe or brush their teeth.

“After nearly 35 years of experience with federal law enforcement in this judicial district ... I have never encountered anything like this,” Trump-appointed Judge Gary Brown wrote in response to squalid conditions at one facility on Long Island.

He rebuked “chillingly brutal conditions” at the jail and questioned why ICE shouldn’t be held in contempt.

The agency’s behavior “shocks the conscience,” he wrote.",https://static.the-independent.com/2026/01/15/14/45/Ongoing-federal-immigration-crackdown-in-Minneapolis-stb4tb8d.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:41.572592

A new Reuters/Ipsos survey found American approval of Trump’s immigration approach at its lowest point since he returned to the White House.
In an AP-NORC poll, just 38 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration enforcement, down from a 49 percent high this spring.
The polls come after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, marking a major flash point in Trump’s immigration crackdown and sparking protests across the country.
“Immigration is an issue with a lot of nuance, and there’s no nuance in the Trump administration’s approach,” GOP strategist Alex Conant said.","President Trump is facing signs that his immigration crackdown is losing popularity with American voters as fallout grows from the fatal shooting of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer this month.

Recent polling has found Trump’s approval on immigration at a low point and shown that even some Republican voters are critical of immigration officers’ approach.

The poll numbers come as some high-profile figures on the right have criticized ICE in the wake of the Minneapolis shooting, underscoring the potential political liability for the party as it heads into the midterms.

“This is the kind of political issue that can get out of control,” Republican strategist Jason Cabel Roe said.

Immigration has long been one of the president’s strong suits, and he won his second term partly on the promise of tough border policies and mass deportations.

But his administration’s aggressive moves have drawn sharp pushback from the left, prompted protests throughout the year and now appear to be dragging down his approval numbers.

A new Reuters/Ipsos survey found American approval of Trump’s immigration approach at its lowest point since he returned to the White House. In an AP-NORC poll, just 38 percent of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration enforcement, down from a 49 percent high this spring. And a majority of voters in a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS said ICE’s actions are making American cities less safe.

The polls come after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, marking a major flash point in Trump’s immigration crackdown and sparking protests across the country.

Administration officials have argued Ross acted out of self-defense, alleging Good was impeding federal law enforcement. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem swiftly labeled Good’s actions as “domestic terrorism.”

A 53-percent majority of voters in a Quinnipiac Poll said the Minnesota shooting wasn’t justified, including 92 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of independents and 10 percent of Republicans.

The Reuters survey found a notable 39 percent of Republicans said officers should limit harm to others, even if they make fewer arrests as a result.

“Immigration is an issue with a lot of nuance, and there’s no nuance in the Trump administration’s approach,” GOP strategist Alex Conant said.

“Americans want to see immigrants that cause crime deported, but they’re much more tolerant of undocumented immigrants who’ve been here a long time and are contributing to the economy and otherwise not breaking laws,” he noted.

Another signal of frustration in the days since the Minneapolis shooting has come from a small handful of media figures popular on the right, even as Republicans in Washington have largely been supportive of the ICE operations.

Conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly warned that ICE “needs to deescalate.” And podcaster Joe Rogan, who boasts a right-leaning audience and backed Trump in 2024, questioned, “Are we really gonna be the Gestapo, ‘Where’s your papers?’ Is that what we’ve come to?”

“Here’s the reality: the President campaigned on and won an election based on his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history – he’s keeping his promise and the American people are appreciative,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to The Hill.

Good’s shooting has renewed some Democrats’ calls to abolish ICE. In an Economist/YouGov poll, a 46-percent plurality of respondents supported shuttering the agency, including 47 percent of independents and 14 percent of Republicans.

A CNN/SSRS poll found that, among the 56 percent of respondents who labeled the shooting an “inappropriate” use of force, 9 in 10 said it “reflects bigger problems with the way ICE is operating.”

“There’s been a drip, drip downward as far as approval on how [Trump] is handling immigration,” Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said.

Malloy noted that more than 8 in 10 voters said they’d seen video footage of the Minneapolis shooting just days afterward, and that it could grow to have an even larger impact as coverage continues.

Democratic strategist Eddie Vale said his party should seize on the issue entering the midterms, arguing Trump “is in trouble” because of the administration’s hard-line tactics.

“Whenever they get a chance to talk immigration or health care or the economy, they should [talk about it] because people are against Trump on all of it,” Vale argued.

Democratic strategist Anthony Coley said Democrats should frame the argument as anti-American.

“What ever happened to ‘love thy neighbor as thyself’?” Coley said. “What Trump is doing on immigration isn’t about right vs. left. It’s about right vs. wrong. It’s immoral and anti-American, and that’s how Democrats should talk about it.”

Some Democrats, though, stress the party should be strategic in seizing on the controversy: A memo from the center-left think tank Third Way cautions the party to “abolish ICE abuses — not ICE” to avoid the blowback that came with prior calls to “defund the police.”

Some Republicans argue the winds will shift in the GOP’s favor when it comes to immigration. GOP strategist Ford O’Connell forecasts Trump “is going to prevail on this issue” because Democrats “will go too far” with calls to curtail ICE.

“Democrats think that this is going to be a winning issue for them, and they’re going to be wrong,” O’Connell said.

Still, Republican strategist Doug Heye said this might be a problem for Republicans in the midterm elections because “they’ve backed themselves into a corner on this.”

“They can oppose some administration policies — which leads [the media] to go mental with the ‘What does it say about Trump’s hold on the party?’ — but they can’t challenge him on things that are core to his identity. And this is,” Heye said.

White House border czar Tom Homan this week said the Trump administration needs “to be better at messaging what we’re doing out there” when it comes to immigration, arguing it faces “a lot of false media.”

Despite the signals of voter frustration, whether immigration and ICE actions remain a problem for the GOP in the midterms depends on what happens next, Republican strategists said.

“It depends how the Democrats respond. I think if the Democrats become anti-ICE and anti-law enforcement, I think that that will only help Republicans. If instead Democrats use this opening to rebrand themselves as more middle-of-the-road on immigration … that could help them politically,” Conant said.

Though Trump’s overall disapproval rating is reaching all-time highs as the immigration debate intensifies, Republicans “have plenty of time to claw some of this back” before November, said Scott Tranter, director of data science for Decision Desk HQ.

“What will be interesting to me is if it affects some of the big primaries, which will have an effect on control. Like, how does this play in the Texas Senate primary in two months? … How does this play out in the Michigan open Senate race? Immigration is obviously a big issue,” Tranter said.

The polling is a problem “in the immediate,” Roe said, but there will be “a thousand outrages” in the 10 months until Election Day.

“So it is an issue, but I imagine it’s going to get replaced by other issues. But it also depends on how things play out from here,” Roe said, crediting some of the anger over ICE to media coverage and blue-state leaders not cooperating with the agency’s actions.

Republican strategist Brian Seitchik, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016, agreed with that sentiment.

“This is short-term pain for long-term gain,” Seitchik said.

Republicans running in the midterms “are simply going to have to weather the storm.”

“There’s no magic to get around it,” Seitchik said. “All we can do is make Americans see the long-term benefit.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/ImmigrationCrackdown_Mueller_AP_AdamGray.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:36.229039

Indigenous members of the Arizona House Democratic Caucus on Friday condemned what they described as the unlawful detention of a Navajo man by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

As the man at the center of the incident recounts what happened, he said the encounter left him fearful, traumatized and questioning his safety in his own homeland.

In a statement released Jan. 16, Reps. Brian Garcia of Tempe, Mae Peshlakai of Cameron and Myron Tsosie of Chinle rebuked ICE agents for detaining Peter Yazzie, a Diné, earlier this month while he was in the Phoenix area for work. The lawmakers said Yazzie was carrying valid tribal identification and a birth certificate at the time but was detained anyway.

According to the statement, Yazzie was approached by ICE agents while traveling to work in Peoria, Arizona. Media reports and a viral TikTok video shared by Yazzie prompted widespread concern and scrutiny, leading Indigenous lawmakers to publicly denounce the incident and call attention to what they described as systemic targeting of Native Americans.

“ICE agents continue to show a complete disregard for the rule of law and have absolutely no justifiable reason to go after Indigenous Tribal members,” the lawmakers wrote in their joint statement. “In case they need a history lesson, tribal members are United States citizens.”

They added that Yazzie “should never have been approached” and said that instead of being immediately released with an apology, he was “manhandled, detained and accused of lying and theft.”

Lawmakers condemn detention, call it unlawful

Federal authorities have not publicly released details of the incident. In recent days, Yazzie has shared his account on social media, describing being detained by multiple law enforcement vehicles in Phoenix.

Yazzie said he often sleeps in his vehicle while working in the Phoenix area during the winter months, explaining that the weather allows him to do so as he travels for construction work throughout the year.

“I’m saying that I live out of my ride because, I mean, it’s Phoenix in the wintertime. It’s perfect weather,” Yazzie said. “I do that almost every year. I work in Phoenix throughout the winter, travel in the summer times.”

He said the incident happened early in the morning as he was preparing for work.

“I start work at five, I’m up at four, and I was getting ready, putting on my work shirt, standing outside of my ride,” he said.

Yazzie said several vehicles, including Suburbans, pulled into the area one after another, with only two using lights. At first, he believed law enforcement was conducting a raid unrelated to him.

“They got out and had ‘Police’ written on the back of their vest, so I’m thinking this must be like a drug raid or something,” he said.

Yazzie said officers began yelling commands at him, ordering him to face his vehicle and place his hands on it. He said he complied immediately.

“Where I’m from, you learn that when it comes to the law, you do what you’re told. Otherwise, things escalate,” he said.

He said he watched another man forcibly removed from his truck.

“They pull another guy out of his truck, and they drag him on the ground, like literally dragged him on the ground,” Yazzie said.

Moments later, he said, officers forced him to the pavement.

“They tossed me down, knees on the back, facing the pavement,” he said.

Yazzie said he realized the encounter involved immigration enforcement only after hearing an officer identify himself.

“That’s when I heard him say, ‘immigration control,’” Yazzie said.

He said he immediately told agents that he is Navajo and had identification inside his vehicle, including his wallet, Social Security card, Certificate of Indian Blood and birth certificate.

“I’m full-blooded Native,” he said. “My wallet’s in the car. My ID’s in there. My Social Security card. The backpack in the back seat has my CIB and my birth certificate.”

Despite this, Yazzie said he was placed inside a vehicle while agents searched his car.

“They start pulling off, and I’m like, ‘Why are we leaving? You guys have my identification,’” he said.

Yazzie recounts early-morning stop, detention

Yazzie said agents accused him of stealing both the vehicle and his identity.

“They said that car came back under another name. It’s not listed under the name you gave us, which leads us to believe you stole the vehicle and you stole your identity as well,” he said. “They told me I had 24 hours for my information to come back, otherwise they’d place me with the rest of the deportation detainees.”

He said the threat left him imagining the worst.

“I’m thinking, ‘What the hell? I have a job. I have bills. I have kids,” he said. “And their response was, ‘Oh, we’ll get them next.’”

Yazzie said that at that point he stopped trying to explain himself.

“They’re not listening to me, no matter what I say,” he said.

While detained, Yazzie said he encountered other men who were also picked up while going about their daily lives.

“These were guys who, just like me, left early one morning for work or left to get dinner for their families and never came home,” he said.

He said several men asked him to notify their families if he was released.

“I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a grown man with fear and desperation in his eyes,” Yazzie said. “If that doesn’t move you, then you’re not human.”

Yazzie said he was eventually released without explanation or apology.

“They let me go. Not so much as an apology,” he said.

When he returned to his vehicle, he said it had been ransacked.

“They took everything out, ran through everything,” he said. “I had to fix up my car. I had to call my superintendent, my general foreman, my actual foreman and notify them what happened.”

He said the experience has had a lasting impact on his sense of safety.

“I’m not gonna lie. This is something that has me angry, stressed and worried,” he said. “I gotta look over my shoulder all the time now.”

He said the treatment went beyond racism.

“This is racism, but it’s beyond racism,” Yazzie said. “This is hating someone like they’re a pest or a rodent.”

He compared the experience to being dehumanized in his own homeland.

“You’re treated like a stray dog, like you don’t belong here,” he said. “And not only that, we don’t need to earn a place here. This is where we’re from.”

Yazzie said his family’s roots run deep on this land.

“This is where I was born. My parents were born, my grandparents, great-great-grandparents, all the way down the line,” he said. “We’ve never been nowhere else.”

Encounter changes sense of safety

The Arizona lawmakers echoed those sentiments in their statement, saying ICE’s actions are “making everyone less safe” and accusing Republican-supported immigration policies of violating basic rights and human dignity.

“It has to stop,” the lawmakers said.

In follow-up posts, Yazzie said the attention surrounding his story has brought both support and fear. He said people have offered him places to stay, meals and assistance, but he has remained cautious.

“I feel like I put a large target on my back,” he said. “I feel like I’ve been back in survival mode.”

He said he has changed locations nightly and remains hyper-aware of his surroundings.

“When I’m asleep in my car, I’ll hear a door shut or some kind of fast movement, and I’m just waiting for that knock at the window,” he said.

Despite the trauma, Yazzie said he continues to believe change is possible.

“I still believe we have enough humanity in us to come back from this,” he said. “To turn things around.”

Three members of the Oglala Sioux tribe were detained by ICE, and continue to remain in their custody in Minneapolis, according to their tribal officials.

Federal officials have not publicly commented on the incident. The Arizona lawmakers said they are calling for accountability and greater protections for Indigenous people who they say continue to be wrongfully targeted by immigration enforcement.

Anyone with information related to similar incidents is encouraged to contact civil rights organizations or elected representatives, said lawmakers.",https://navajotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dq-border18.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 19:58:04.378882

One lawsuit by the ACLU has already resulted in a federal judge, Kate Menendez, issuing an order restricting what ICE agents can do when confronting peaceful protestors.

The judge's order says there can be no ICE retaliation against protestors, no detaining people without probable cause unless they are obstructing agents or committing a crime, no using pepper spray on a peaceful protest, and allowing drivers to follow ICE agents' vehicles at a safe distance. On ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan"" this Sunday morning, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the order changes nothing about how federal agents are conducting their business in Minnesota.

Another development is that the U.S. Justice Department has opened criminal investigations into Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for allegedly obstructing the work of federal agents.

Appearing on WCCO Sunday Morning with Esme Murphy, Attorney General Keith Ellison called this latter investigation ""from the playbook.""

""This is the president who is persecuting Jerome Powell of the Fed, who tried to prosecute James Comey of the FBI, and the current attorney general of New York, Letitia James. He uses the criminal justice system to persecute the people he doesn't like,"" Ellison said.

The second federal lawsuit against ICE was filed late last week by the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. It seeks to stop ICE activity throughout the state. The lawsuit argues the unprecedented surge of an estimated 3,000 federal agents is endangering citizens. It accuses ICE of violating the First and Tenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

That lawsuit argues that President Trump is retaliating against Gov. Tim Walz, who ran against Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance on Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' ticket, for his objections to ICE activity.

""What the federal government needs to do is leave and stop the surge,"" Ellison said.

The Tenth Amendment protects states' sovereignty and limits federal powers to those granted in the U.S. Constitution. It provides autonomy to the states in issues like education, elections and public safety. While Ellison is optimistic, some legal experts think the lawsuit is a long shot because it would be similar to telling the FBI it could not operate in the state.

The state, in this second lawsuit, is seeking an immediate temporary restraining order limiting ICE activities. The judge in the case is Kate Menendez, the same judge who issued that first order favorable to peaceful protestors. The judge said last week she would not issue the temporary restraining order until she heard a response from the federal government. That response is due to be filed at 5 p.m. Monday, which is the federal Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/454ef978-d6d2-43d0-8b1d-d216d2fde6fa/thumbnail/1200x630/bf35a562013bb6332b90700dad4b5214/gettyimages-2256249848.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 17:57:59.089111

“They will push our core European allies further away while doing nothing to advance US national security,” Murkowski maintained.
Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Michael McCaul expressed similar concerns, cautioning that a US military intervention in Greenland would probably spell disaster for the Nato alliance.
That is why he has repeatedly floated multiple ways of acquiring Greenland, ranging from purchasing the territory to the possibility of a military takeover.

Such Republicans included US senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski, who were part of a bipartisan group to travel to Denmark to discuss concerns in Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory.

Both Tillis and Murkowski sharply criticized new tariffs threatened on Saturday by Trump on a slew of European countries – including Denmark, Germany, France and the UK – until the US is allowed to purchase Greenland.

Murkowski wrote on X that the tariffs were “unnecessary, punitive, and a profound mistake”, coming after Nato allies deployed troops in Greenland on Thursday in response to Trump’s threats to forcefully take the Arctic island if needed.

“They will push our core European allies further away while doing nothing to advance US national security,” Murkowski maintained. “We are already seeing the consequences of these measures in real time: our Nato allies are being forced to divert attention and resources to Greenland, a dynamic that plays directly into [Russian leader Vladimir] Putin’s hands by threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.”

She urged Congress to exercise its authority over tariffs to ensure they are “not weaponized in ways that harm our alliances and undermine American leadership”.

Tillis, for his part, wrote on X: “This response to our own allies for sending a small number of troops to Greenland for training is bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America’s allies. It’s great for Putin, [Chinese leader] Xi [Jiping] and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided.”

Tillis added that “actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid”.

“It hurts the legacy of President Trump and undercuts all the work he has done to strengthen the Nato alliance over the years,” Tillis maintained.

Mike Pence, the US vice-president during Trump’s first White House term, separately said he believed “the current posture … does threaten to fracture that strong relationship, not just with Denmark, but with all of our Nato allies”.

“Denmark is a very strong ally of the United States of American,” Pence said Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union.

Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Michael McCaul expressed similar concerns, cautioning that a US military intervention in Greenland would probably spell disaster for the Nato alliance.

Appearing on ABC’s This Week, McCaul said: “The fact is, the president has full military access to Greenland to protect us from any threat” that could materialize on the Arctic island.

“So, if he wants to purchase Greenland, that’s one thing,” he continued. “But for him to militarily invade would turn … Nato on its very head and, in essence, press a war with Nato itself. It would end up abolishing Nato as we know it.”

Trump has repeatedly argued that US control of the island is necessary for national security, pointing to concerns about Russia and China expanding their influence in the Arctic. That is why he has repeatedly floated multiple ways of acquiring Greenland, ranging from purchasing the territory to the possibility of a military takeover.

During a Sunday appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Republican US senator Rand Paul weighed in, saying it “ridiculous” to portray Greenland as some urgent situation.

“There’s no emergency with Greenland,” Paul said.

Trump has insisted that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect Greenland in the case of a confrontation with China or Russia, even as he has also said that “something will work out” with respect to the future governance of the Danish territory.

The goal of the bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers who traveled to meet with Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen was to emphasize the Republican dissent to any suggestion that the United States should forcefully seize Greenland.

Polling also shows a substantial majority of Americans oppose taking control of the island.

Nonetheless, former US House speaker Newt Gingrich was one Republican who seemed unconcerned about Trump’s approach.

Gingrich went on Sunday’s Cats Roundtable radio program and called Trump’s posture with Greenland “a lot of noise to set up a negotiation to get what he wants”.

That “is tourist rights, economic rights, mineral rights and national security rights”, Gingrich said.

Gingrich pointed to Greenland’s abundance of natural resources and noted that China, Russia and the US all have an interest in accessing its minerals. He also called Greenland’s oil and gas reserves “a huge economic opportunity”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7cc9c3ff5d5cee2fddc4c47ef39c344dab03d2a/639_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=663dab34da0603d7b41b99cae84c3a73",N,,2026-01-18 14:57:24.932607

Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul wants New York to allow people to sue federal officers alleging violations of their constitutional rights. Another measure aims to keep immigration officers lacking judicial warrants out of schools, hospitals and houses of worship.

Oregon Democrats plan to introduce a bill to allow residents to sue federal officers for violating their Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.

New Jersey's Democrat-led Legislature passed three bills Monday that immigrant rights groups have long pushed for, including a measure prohibiting state law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has until his last day in office Tuesday to sign or veto them.

California lawmakers are proposing to ban local and state law enforcement from taking second jobs with the Department of Homeland Security and make it a violation of state law when ICE officers make ""indiscriminate"" arrests around court appearances. Other measures are pending.

""Where you have government actions with no accountability, that is not true democracy,"" Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco said at a news conference.

Democrats also push bills in red states

Democrats in Georgia introduced four Senate bills designed to limit immigration enforcement — a package unlikely to become law because Georgia's conservative upper chamber is led by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a close Trump ally. Democrats said it is still important to take a stand.

""Donald Trump has unleashed brutal aggression on our families and our communities across our country,"" said state Sen. Sheikh Rahman, an immigrant from Bangladesh whose district in suburban Atlanta's Gwinnett County is home to many immigrants.

Democrats in New Hampshire have proposed numerous measures seeking to limit federal immigration enforcement, but the state's Republican majorities passed a new law taking effect this month that bans ""sanctuary cities.""

Tennessee GOP works with White House

The bills Tennessee Republicans are introducing appear to require government agencies to check the legal status of all residents before they can obtain public benefits; secure licenses for teaching, nursing and other professions; and get driver's licenses or register their cars.

They also would include verifying K-12 students' legal status, which appears to conflict with a U.S. Supreme Court precedent. And they propose criminalizing illegal entry as a misdemeanor, a measure similar to several other states' requirements, some of which are blocked in court.

""We're going to do what we can to make sure that if you're here illegally, we will have the data, we'll have the transparency, and we're not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you're in jail,"" House Speaker Cameron Sexton said at a news conference Thursday.

Trump administration sues to stop laws

The Trump administration has opposed any effort to blunt ICE, including suing local governments whose ""sanctuary"" policies limit police interactions with federal officers.

States have broad power to regulate within their borders unless the U.S. Constitution bars it, but many of these laws raise novel issues that courts will have to sort out, said Harrison Stark, senior counsel with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

""There's not a super clear, concrete legal answer to a lot of these questions,"" he said. ""It's almost guaranteed there will be federal litigation over a lot of these policies.""

That is already happening.

California in September was the first to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration officers, from covering their faces on duty. The Justice Department said its officers won't comply and sued California, arguing that the laws threaten the safety of officers who are facing ""unprecedented"" harassment, doxing and violence.

The Justice Department also sued Illinois last month, challenging a law that bars federal civil arrests near courthouses, protects medical records and regulates how universities and day care centers manage information about immigration status. The Justice Department claims the law is unconstitutional and threatens federal officers' safety.

Targeted states push back

Minnesota and Illinois, joined by their largest cities, sued the Trump administration this past week. Minneapolis and Minnesota accuse the Republican administration of violating free speech rights by punishing a progressive state that favors Democrats and welcomes immigrants. Illinois and Chicago claim ""Operation Midway Blitz"" made residents afraid to leave their homes.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety and called the Illinois lawsuit ""baseless.""

— Terik Hashmi, immigration attorney with International Law Group

WASHINGTON DC, DC, UNITED STATES, January 18, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — U.S. immigration law firm International Law Group (ILG) announced today that it is offering rapid-response immigration consultations for Venezuelan nationals and families in the Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) area who are facing heightened immigration enforcement, status uncertainty, or expiring protections.

Recent federal actions and policy changes by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have created widespread confusion and anxiety among Venezuelans, particularly those relying on Temporary Protected Status (TPS), pending asylum applications, work permits, or other humanitarian and employment-based immigration benefits. Increased data reviews, background checks, Requests for Evidence (RFEs), Notices to Appear, and referrals to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have made early legal review critical.

“Many Venezuelans in the DMV area are understandably worried about what these changes mean for their families, jobs, and futures,” said Terik Hashmi, senior attorney at International Law Group. “Our message is simple: don’t panic, but don’t wait. Ignoring a notice or assuming nothing will happen can be a serious mistake. Early legal guidance can significantly change the outcome.”

To meet urgent demand, International Law Group is offering confidential Zoom consultations, including evenings and weekends, to quickly assess risk, explain options, and help clients respond appropriately to government action.

International Law Group services include:

• Emergency Zoom consultations (available nationwide)

• Review of USCIS, DHS, and ICE notices

• TPS status review and transition strategies

• Asylum and humanitarian case audits

• Work permit (EAD) and Green Card planning

• ICE encounter preparedness and rights counseling

International Law Group has decades of experience representing immigrants in high-stakes, time-sensitive cases, including those involving sudden policy shifts, enforcement actions, and humanitarian crises.

Adds Mike Meier, senior attorney at International Law Group: “Consultations are confidential and designed for urgent situations. We strongly encourage Venezuelan community members in Washington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia who have received notices, whose TPS or work authorization is expiring, or who are unsure about their current status to speak with an experienced immigration attorney immediately.”

Transcript: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan""

A federal judge on Friday blocked federal law enforcement from using pepper spray or nonlethal munitions on peaceful protesters as demonstrations continue. The judge also barred federal agents from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers when there is ""no reasonable articulable suspicion"" that people driving near protests are forcibly interfering with law enforcement operations.

On Sunday, Noem called the order ""a little ridiculous.""

""We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,"" Noem said. ""So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.""

Thousands of federal agents have been deployed to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks for immigration enforcement operations and to investigate fraud allegations in the state. Federal law enforcement agents have faced allegations of using aggressive tactics.

Noem put the blame on protesters and local leaders for violent incidents, including one in which a couple said they and their six children were tear-gassed while driving home from basketball practice.

""That family was caught up in that situation because of violent protesters that were impeding law enforcement operations, and that family would have never been in that situation if those protesters had been acting peacefully and law enforcement was able to do their job without being threatened,"" the secretary said.

Noem said ""the mayor and the governor have allowed this kind of violence to be perpetuated across Minneapolis,"" claiming it's ""why there's other innocent people that are impacted throughout the city.""

The administration has faced renewed scrutiny and ramped-up protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month. Last week, Senate Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee urged the GOP chairman to call Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to testify before the panel.

Noem said Sunday that Good ""weaponized her car and threatened the life of a law enforcement officer and those around him."" She said the 37-year-old woman was ""impeding law enforcement operations for quite some time before this incident happened,"" while saying the incident was a ""tragedy."" She added that the officer ""relied on his training to defend his life and to defend those around him.""

Asked whether the agency was conducting a review of the agent who shot Good, Noem said, ""We are following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE and under the Department of Homeland Security and within the administration.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/edf04c16-ba1d-4629-bf3d-0734361dbf88/thumbnail/1200x630/714a0d3d1a59cc46e31671a3199faf8e/noem-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 15:57:44.324253

In the CBS News/YouGov poll conducted late last week, 61 percent of respondents say the way ICE is conducting its operations when it stops or detains people is “too tough,” while 15 percent say it’s “not tough enough.” Another 24 percent say it’s “about right.” That marks a shift from a similar poll released at the start of November, when 53 percent said ICE operations were too tough, and 17 percent said they were not tough enough.
Among Republicans, the share who say ICE has been too tough in its conduct ticked up 4 points, to 19 percent, in the latest poll.
Similarly, the latest poll shows Americans are increasingly doubting the administration’s claims that it is prioritizing “dangerous criminals” in deporting migrants who are living in the country illegally.

That marks a shift from a similar poll released at the start of November, when 53 percent said ICE operations were too tough, and 17 percent said they were not tough enough.

The shift comes mostly from Democrats and independents, both of which saw a 9-percentage point increase in the share who say the way ICE has conducted its operations has been too tough — to 94 percent and 68 percent, respectively.

Among Republicans, the share who say ICE has been too tough in its conduct ticked up 4 points, to 19 percent, in the latest poll.

Similarly, the latest poll shows Americans are increasingly doubting the administration’s claims that it is prioritizing “dangerous criminals” in deporting migrants who are living in the country illegally.

Today, 56 percent of people say the Trump administration is prioritizing for deportation “people who aren’t dangerous criminals,” up from 52 percent in the November poll.

Overall support for Trump’s program to deport immigrants are in the country illegally has dropped, from 52 percent in the November poll to 46 percent now.

The poll was conducted a week after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good during a standoff with protesters in Minneapolis. The Trump administration maintains the officer acted in self-defense and feared for his life, pointing to video footage it says shows Good was using her car to threaten his life. Critics, however, say the footage shows Good was trying to drive away from the officer, not run him over.

On Wednesday, the first day of the three-day poll, another ICE officer shot and injured a Venezuelan migrant in Minneapolis after the officer was allegedly attacked when following the target on foot after he fled a traffic stop.

Editor’s Note: The above guest column was penned by James C. Harrington, retired founder of the Texas Civil Rights Project and an Episcopal priest in Austin.","We typically commemorate the Martin Luther King holiday with his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. This time around, it would behoove us to pay attention to his powerful 1967 speech at Riverside Church, “Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence,” opposing the war in Vietnam.

The moral principles he affirmed, with Rabbi Abraham Heschel, himself a great moral leader, at his side, apply with piercing relevance to the upheaval facing our democracy today.

State terrorism against the immigrant community confronts us daily. Agents with face masks and no identification inflict harm on families as men masked with white hoods once did when perpetrating evil on the nation’s minority communities.

People have been killed, families broken up, and small children handcuffed. There has been long-term detention in disgusting facilities, and people dispatched to countries which are foreign to them. We see attacks on boats, killing people with impunity. Congress is lamer than ever in asserting the rule of law.

Amnesty protections have been abandoned, regardless of how severe the persecution and oppression that immigrant families had to flee or the economic disaster they faced. There have been mass deportations, no matter how many years immigrants have lived as our neighbors and supported our country. Never mind the risk to them if they return to their former homeland.

Dismantling the safety net for vulnerable America’s seniors and poor is underway. The world’s wealthiest country now denies aid to poor countries facing immeasurable poverty and rampant violence. Free speech and dissent are on the Administration’s and Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s chopping block.

We are replicating those dark days of American history from which we thought we had emerged.

Fort Bliss in El Paso, a major immigrant detention facility, was a Japanese internment site 80 years ago. The national security rhetoric used to justify mass incarceration today is the same used for the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans.

The Administration’s actions are against people of color—the same grievance Dr. King articulated about the Vietnam war.

Dr. King understood the retaliation he would suffer for his speech, but his moral challenge to the government was necessary, and correct. He lost significant support among white allies, including President Johnson, and the powerful media. His popularity sank because he did not stick to the “civil rights script” expected of him.

Howard Thurman, the premier Black theologian, in his 1946 essay, “The Fascist Masquerade,” faulted the Christian church for “the bitter truth” of permitting hate-inspired groups … to establish squatter’s rights in the middle of believers because there has been no adequate teaching on the meaning of faith, the faith in terms of human dignity and human worth.”

Faith groups are finally heading his warning. For religious folks, as for non-believers, this current struggle is about the inherent dignity of people and fairness, or, as Pope Leo has forcefully framed it, the core values of democracy.

At a January 9th candlelight vigil for Renee Nicole Good, two days are an ICE agent killed her, Bishop Rob Hirschfeld of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire announced he had advised his clergy, “that we may be entering into that same witness,” and to get their affairs in order and write their wills because “it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us, with our bodies, to stand between the powers of this world, and the most vulnerable.”

Dr. King put his body on the line, as had countless others for a more just society.

For Dr. King’s holiday this year, we must jettison our comfort zone and not rest on the laurels we thought that society had accomplished, but which our federal and state governments are steadfastly discarding with abandon.

The call for us is to accept that moral challenge and shed our complacency and, as Dr. King put it in 1967, “go down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land” before “America's soul becomes totally poisoned.”

It is time to break silence and put our bodies on the line.

Southern Nevada attorney reports surge in ICE detentions amid national immigration tensions

To find out, I sat down with immigration attorney Adriana Pereyra of Integrity Law Firm, who says what's happening in Southern Nevada isn't always visible.

""How often are we seeing this? Is this happening a lot more often than what people are actually realizing?"" I asked.

""Yes, it definitely is. Even my clients who are detained have told me, you know, they bring 10-15 people a day, just in Henderson detention center,"" Pereyra said.

Here's why that matters: Under federal immigration law, ICE has the authority, including through what's called the 287(G) program, to operate with local jails. ICE can identify and take into federal custody people who were booked into jail.

""ICE is still very involved here in our community?"" I asked.

""Absolutely they're just doing it in a different way that is not so public,"" Pereyra said

.According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website, ICE also maintains holding facilities in Southern Nevada, including the Henderson Detention Center and the Nevada Southern Detention Center, where people taken into ICE custody can be detained for immigration proceedings.

When the justices on Wednesday consider the legality of his bid to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, their willingness to preserve the U.S. central bank's independence will be ​put to the test.

With control over U.S. monetary policy at stake, the legal battle over Trump's attempt to remove Cook marks the second case involving an action by the Republican president of vast economic significance ‌to reach the Supreme Court during its current term, which began in October.

Make sense of the latest ESG trends affecting companies and governments with the Reuters Sustainable Switch newsletter. Sign up here.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, heard arguments in November concerning Trump's sweeping global tariffs, with justices indicating skepticism over the lawfulness of these import taxes on nearly every U.S. trading partner imposed under a law meant for use in national emergencies. Its rulings in the tariffs and Cook cases are expected by the end of June but could come sooner.

The court has been largely deferential to Trump in a series of rulings on an emergency basis since his return to office 12 months ago as he repeatedly tests the limits of presidential authority. The justices, however, may be less eager to strengthen Trump's hand over the economy.

""I think they worry about the effect that removal of central ‌bank independence could have on the economy,"" said John Yoo, who served as a Justice Department lawyer under Republican former President George W. Bush.

""It seems a basic principle of macroeconomics, ​backed up by the experience of other countries, that political control over the money supply, interest rates and central banking will inevitably lead to inflation,"" said Yoo, now a University of California, Berkeley law professor.

According to legal scholars, the court has not been so directly involved in U.S. economic policy since the justices weighed the constitutionality of Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt's muscular agenda called the New Deal during the 1930s amid the crisis of the Great Depression.

'NOT UNBOUNDED'

Columbia Law School professor Kathryn ‍Judge said the fights involving Fed independence and Trump's tariffs ""will be key in determining the scope of the president's authority to unilaterally determine economic policy.""

""This Supreme Court has taken a very expansive approach to executive authority,"" Judge said, ""but it is not unbounded.""

Cook, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, sued Trump in August after he sought to fire her, an unprecedented step by a president against a central bank official. Trump claims that Cook committed mortgage fraud before being appointed to the ⁠Fed by his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden in 2022, an allegation she denied and described as a pretext to try to remove her for her monetary policy stance.

Similarly, Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Sunday called a criminal investigation of him launched by ‍Trump's Justice Department a pretext to gain more influence over the central bank and monetary policy. The investigation centers on Powell's congressional testimony about a Fed building project.

Critics see the steps by Trump and his administration targeting Cook and Powell as a bid to ‌pressure the Fed ‌to lower interest rates before the November midterm elections in which Democrats are hoping to regain control of Congress from the Republicans. Pocketbook concerns may loom large for voters.

""With each passing day - and with each passing attack by the Trump administration - I suspect that the court increasingly sees the value of an independent Fed,"" University of Illinois Chicago law professor Steve Schwinn said.

Yoo added that ""Trump is not helping his own case with the Department of Justice's implausible criminal investigation"" of Powell.

REMOVAL PROTECTIONS

Cook has said Trump's allegations of mortgage fraud did not empower him to remove her under the Federal Reserve Act, the law that created the central bank in 1913. Aiming to insulate the Fed's decision-making from politics, Congress included provisions constraining a president's ability ⁠to fire a Fed governor, allowing removal only for adequate ""cause,"" ⁠not policy differences.

A Washington-based federal judge ruled that Trump's ​claims were likely insufficient grounds to fire Cook. A federal appeals court in Washington denied Trump's request to halt the judge's ruling, prompting his request to the Supreme Court.

Legal analysts said the justices have offered recent clues signaling their interest in protecting the Fed's independence. For instance, they allowed Cook to remain in her post as the case plays out after allowing Trump to remove officials from other agencies with similar tenure protections while those cases proceed.

Last May, the court let Trump fire two Democratic members of federal labor boards ‍while challenges to their removals continue in lower courts. In that ruling, called Trump v. Wilcox, the court sought to allay concerns that letting the president fire officials from federal labor boards would imperil the independence of the Fed.

""We disagree,"" the court wrote in an unsigned opinion. ""The Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.""

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley ‍Law School, said the court's interest in protecting Fed independence likely will be very important as it weighs Cook's case.

""In Trump v. Wilcox, the court discussed the Fed being different even though it had nothing to do with that case,"" Chemerinsky added.

RELATED: Judge rules feds in Minneapolis immigration operation can’t detain or tear gas peaceful protesters

“I think it lays out some ground rules going forward for ICE to operate within,” says Ryan Wood, a former chief immigration court judge. “It really lays out the framework for future court actions for violating those court orders.”

The decision, by U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, prohibits federal immigration agents in Minnesota from arresting, detaining or retaliating against peaceful protesters or observers.

They also can’t use pepper spray or other non-lethal munitions against them.

“These are just some of the foundational and fundamental principles under which any law enforcement operation really needs to abide,” notes Jessica West, a professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law. “I think her goal was to start the process of having a dialogue between law enforcement and the courts about what is and what is not permissible.”

But the injunction goes further.

It says federal officers can’t stop or detain drivers or passengers in vehicles with no reasonable suspicion that they’re forcibly obstructing or interfering with agents.

That includes those following at an “appropriate distance.”

Wood says he’s concerned about clarity in the ruling.

“These are all messy situations,” he explains. “What does it mean to have a reasonable distance between a protester and an arrest incident? What does it mean to have a reasonable distance by an ICE vehicle and a vehicle that’s following it?”

The ruling follows a case filed in December by six Minnesota activist-observers, represented by the ACLU.

RELATED: ACLU sues ICE, claiming federal agents deprived citizens of civil rights

Their argument — that government officers are violating the constitutional rights of Twin Cities residents.

West believes the government will appeal, but she says there’s an opportunity for the Department of Homeland Security as well.

“One potential way the government could take this is to start to not only train and hand this order out to their officers on the ground,” she notes. “To start to correct information about who’s doing what, where, when, and hold some of those people accountable; to change the culture a little bit.”

After the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency is taking “appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters. We remind the public that rioting is dangerous — obstructing law enforcement is a federal crime and assaulting law enforcement is a felony.”

The statement went on to say: “Rioters and terrorists have assaulted law enforcement, launched fireworks at them, slashed the tires of their vehicles, and vandalized federal property. Others have chosen to ignore commands and have attempted to impede law enforcement operations and used their vehicles as weapons against our officers. Despite these grave threats and dangerous situations, our law enforcement as followed their training and used the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.”

The judge ordered the federal government to inform all officers about the ruling within 72 hours as of Friday night.

So far, DHS has not commented on whether there would be an appeal to the ruling and what the process would be to get information about it to officers in the field.

Wood says he hopes the judge’s ruling will make a difference.

Meanwhile, Republicans overwhelmingly feel the protesters have gone too far.

In the wake of events in Minneapolis, overall support for the deportation program — which has roughly divided the nation for months — has dipped even as it continues to draw strong backing from Republicans and especially strong backing from MAGA.

And in sum, the public expresses a difference between how they see the goals of the deportation program and how it's being carried out.

There are shifting perceptions of who is being targeted by the program. Americans are increasingly likely to say the administration isn't prioritizing dangerous criminals, and most think the administration is trying to deport more people than they thought it would.

So, as Americans look overall, a slight majority feel ICE is making the communities where it is conducting operations less safe, many more than feel it's improving safety.

Over the course of the term, overall approval of the deportation program started net positively, became more divided over the summer, and then hovered near that division for months. In the wake of events in Minneapolis, it dropped to its lowest overall mark of the term.

More people like what they believe the program's goals are than like the approach being taken. The former is mixed, while the latter is negative.

Overall, Mr. Trump's approval on handling immigration has also ticked down to its lowest point of his second term, though it continues to outpace his approval on the economy and inflation.

Views on the shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis hew closely to party lines. Republicans tend to call it justified, while Democrats and independents say it was not. Most also say that they don't believe the administration's response to it has been fair.

Non-MAGA Republicans are less inclined than MAGA to call the shooting justified.

Thinking about what should be next for ICE, the recent events in Minneapolis appear to have at least partially reinforced preexisting views about the deportation program. Democrats say recent events mean ICE operations in the U.S. should be decreased, though they already opposed the program. Republicans either say it means operations should be increased or kept the same; they've long favored the program.

Looking overseas to Greenland and Iran

Looking overseas, with widespread opposition to the prospect of military action in Greenland or Iran, a majority of Americans appear pessimistic about what Mr. Trump's policies might bring in terms of peace and stability in 2026.

Most Americans think the U.S. does have strategic interests in Iran, but they are more divided on whether or not it has moral responsibilities there.

Most don't think the U.S. has effective plans for military action there, and two-thirds feel it would be a long and costly involvement. Those sentiments are closely connected to opposition to the idea of force.

The idea of using military force to take Greenland faces overwhelming opposition across party lines, including most MAGA Republicans, who say they would disapprove. For context, they have largely backed the president after he has taken military actions, including in Venezuela and the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year.

Whether they support military action in Greenland and Iran or not, most Republicans do think Mr. Trump has made the U.S. position in the world stronger.

What do Americans think would happen if the U.S. took Greenland by force?

Some think taking Greenland would constitute a show of force to Russia and China, and just over half think it would provide access to needed natural resources. But large majorities also think it would cause the U.S. to leave the NATO alliance and create instability in the world.

Views about the latter two implications are very closely associated with opposition to the idea.

Democratic lawmakers and candidates for office around the country increasingly are returning to the phrase, popularized during the first Trump administration, as they react to this administration’s forceful immigration enforcement tactics.

The fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent this month in Minneapolis sparked immediate outrage among Democratic officials, who proposed a variety of oversight demands — including abolishing the agency — to rein in tactics they view as hostile and sometimes illegal.

Resurrecting the slogan is perhaps the riskiest approach. Republicans pounced on the opportunity to paint Democrats, especially those in vulnerable seats, as extremists.

“If their response is to dust off ‘defund ICE,’ we’re happy to take that fight any day of the week,” said Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee. The group has published dozens of press statements in recent weeks accusing Democrats of wanting to abolish ICE — even those who haven’t made direct statements using the phrase.

Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) amplified that message Wednesday, writing on social media that “When Democrats say they want to abolish or defund ICE, what they are really saying is they want to go back to the open borders policies of the Biden administration. The American people soundly rejected that idea in the 2024 election.”

The next day, Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) introduced the “Abolish ICE Act,” stating that Good’s killing “proved that ICE is out of control and beyond reform.” The bill would rescind the agency’s “unobligated” funding and redirect other assets to its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security.

Many Democrats calling for an outright elimination of ICE come from the party’s progressive wing. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) said in a television interview the agency should be abolished because actions taken by its agents are “racist” and “rogue.” Jack Schlossberg, who is running for a House seat in New York, said that “if Trump’s ICE is shooting and kidnapping people, then abolish it.”

Other prominent progressives have stopped short of saying the agency should be dismantled.

Sen. Alex Padilla, (D-Calif.) who last year was forcefully handcuffed and removed from a news conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, joined a protest in Washington to demand justice for Good, saying “It’s time to get ICE and CBP out,” referring to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

“This is a moment where all of us have to be forceful to ensure that we are pushing back on what is an agency right now that is out of control,” Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said on social media. “We have to be loud and clear that ICE is not welcome in our communities.”

Others have eyed negotiations over the yearly Homeland Security budget as a leverage point to incorporate their demands, such as requiring federal agents to remove their masks and to turn on their body-worn cameras when on duty, as well as calling for agents who commit crimes on the job to be prosecuted. Seventy House Democrats, including at least 13 from California, backed a measure to impeach Noem.

Rep. Mike Levin (D-San Diego), who serves on the House Committee on Appropriations, said his focus is not on eliminating the agency, which he believes has an “important responsibility” but has been led astray by Noem.

He said Noem should be held to account for her actions through congressional oversight hearings, not impeachment — at least not while Republicans would be in control of the proceedings, since he believes House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) would make a “mockery” of them.

“I am going to use the appropriations process,” Levin said, adding that he would “continue to focus on the guardrails, regardless of the rhetoric.”

Chuck Rocha, a Democratic political strategist, said Republicans seized on the abolitionist rhetoric as a scare tactic to distract from the rising cost of living, which remains another top voter concern.

“They hope to distract [voters] by saying, ‘Sure, we’re going to get better on the economy — but these Democrats are still crazy,’” he said.

Democrats have for years struggled to put forward a unified vision on immigration — one of the top issues that won President Trump a return to the White House. Any deal to increase guardrails on Homeland Security faces an uphill battle in the Republican-controlled Congress, leaving many proposals years away from the possibility of fruition. Even if Democrats manage to block the yearly funding bill, the agency still has tens of billions of dollars from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Still, the roving raids, violent clashes with protesters and detentions and deaths of U.S. citizens and immigrants alike increased the urgency many lawmakers feel to do something.

Two centrist groups released memos last week written by former Homeland Security officials under the Biden administration urging Democrats to avoid the polarizing language and instead channel their outrage into specific reforms.

“Every call to abolish ICE risks squandering one of the clearest opportunities in years to secure meaningful reform of immigration enforcement — while handing Republicans exactly the fight they want,” wrote the authors of one memo, from the Washington-based think tank Third Way.

“Advocating for abolishing ICE is tantamount to advocating for stopping enforcement of all of our immigration laws in the interior of the United States — a policy position that is both wrong on the merits and at odds with the American public on the issue,” wrote Blas Nuñez-Neto, a senior policy fellow at the new think tank the Searchlight Institute who previously was assistant Homeland Security secretary.

Roughly 46% of Americans said they support the idea of abolishing ICE, while 43% are opposed, according to a YouGov/Economist poll released last week.

Sarah Pierce, a former policy analyst at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services who co-wrote the Third Way memo, said future polls might show less support for abolishing the agency, particularly if the question is framed as a choice among options including reforms such as banning agents from wearing masks or requiring use of body cameras.

“There’s no doubt there will be further tragedies and with each, the effort to take an extreme position like abolishing ICE increases,” she said.

Laura Hernandez, executive director of Freedom for Immigrants, a California-based organization that advocates for the closure of detention centers, said the increase in lawmakers calling to abolish ICE is long overdue.

“We need lawmakers to use their power to stop militarized raids, to close detention centers and we need them to shut down ICE and CBP,” she said. “This violence that people are seeing on television is not new, it’s literally built into the DNA of DHS.”

Cinthya Martinez, a UC Santa Cruz professor who has studied the movement to abolish ICE, noted that it stems from the movement to abolish prisons. The abolition part, she said, is watered down by mainstream politicians even as some liken immigration agents to modern-day slave patrols.

Martinez said the goal is about more than simply getting rid of one agency or redirecting its duties to another. She pointed out that alongside ICE agents have been Border Patrol, FBI and ATF agents.

“A lot of folks forget that prison abolition is to completely abolish carceral systems. It comes from a Black tradition that says prison is a continuation of slavery,” she said.

But Peter Markowitz, a law professor and co-director of the Immigration Justice Clinic at the Cardozo School of Law, said the movement to abolish ICE around 2018 among mainstream politicians was always about having effective and humane immigration enforcement, not about having none.

It was also the first time the National Guard had showed up to protect the Department of Homeland Security in its immigration work.
The recent conflicts with local officials have alarmed some former leaders of the Department of Homeland Security.","In November 2002, President George W. Bush signed a bill creating a federal agency devoted to protecting the United States. The country was still reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, and the threat of international terrorism permeated public life.

Among the agencies that would be included in the Department of Homeland Security, as it would be called, would be Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — the parts of the government most responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws.

“The new department will analyze threats, will guard our borders and airports, protect our critical infrastructure, and coordinate the response of our nation for future emergencies,” Mr. Bush said at the time, adding that the department would “focus the full resources of the American government on the safety of the American people.”

But more than two decades later, as thousands of ICE and Border Patrol officers flood Minneapolis, some Democratic leaders say the department’s role appears to have strayed far from its original purpose, turning its tools of enforcement away from external threats and toward President Trump’s domestic critics.

They say enforcement has looked more like an occupation, as officers in helmets and tactical gear have faced off against hostile residents and left-wing protesters in Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago and Washington. The interactions, broadcast to the world through social media videos filmed by protesters and federal agents alike, have given the impression of a government at war with the country’s own cities.

The Department of Homeland Security “was designed to protect Americans from threats, and what we’ve essentially done is, in some cases, we’ve turned that agency on Americans,” said Mayor Keith Wilson of Portland, Ore., a Democrat. “It’s deeply unsettling.”

Mr. Wilson said he was concerned that federal immigration enforcement activities could lead to a shooting like the one in Minneapolis that took the life of Renee Good, a 37-year-old protester fatally shot by an ICE officer. Hours after his comments, Border Patrol agents shot two Venezuelan nationals who had rammed their vehicle, the department said. The Venezuelans survived their injuries, and one was charged in connection with the incident.

More than two decades after its formation, the Department of Homeland Security is the government’s largest law enforcement agency, with around 250,000 employees. It includes many functions that are not directly part of the turmoil on the ground, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the agency that oversees airport security.

Yet even those agencies have come under pressure to meet Mr. Trump’s political objectives, with the airport security agency providing information to immigration agents and Mr. Trump trying to redirect disaster funding away from states not cooperating with his deportation goals.

ICE’s budget increased dramatically because of the sweeping domestic policy bill the president signed into law last July, making it the highest funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Under Mr. Trump, the department also redirected thousands of agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, a New York Times investigation found last year.

The Trump administration and officials in some of the targeted cities have used militaristic language to describe the conflict unfolding on the ground.

A lawsuit filed this week by Minnesota described the recent deployment of thousands of immigration agents and officers as “a federal invasion of the Twin Cities.”

“I see it as a personal militarized police force for the president to do his bidding against people who don’t see the world through the lens of the ultra rich,” said Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago, a Democrat.

Mr. Trump has recently raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military to suppress rebellions and enforce federal laws. On Tuesday, he said on social media that Minnesotans should expect more action in their state, and that the “DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING.”

Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has called Chicago a “war zone,” and said the agency had made parts of the city “much more free.” In recent weeks, the department has described Minnesota as a place where there was “rampant fraud and criminality happening.”

Mr. Bush at the time said that the United States would be better equipped to “reduce our vulnerability and, most important, prevent the terrorists from taking innocent American lives.”

Building the agency was a big task, with all or portions of 22 federal agencies, including the Coast Guard and what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be folded into a single department. Some politicians in Washington initially resisted the creation of a new cabinet-level agency, including Mr. Bush.

Supporters of the department’s stepped-up role on immigration enforcement this year say the surge of officers in cities has made the country safer by rounding up violent criminals. They say voters endorsed decisive action on immigration when they elected Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized “sanctuary cities” that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. He has pledged to be more aggressive.

“What these mayors are asking D.H.S. to do is not really an option,” said Chad Wolf, an acting homeland security secretary during the first Trump administration. “The majority of American people said, ‘We don’t want that America. We actually want criminal illegal aliens arrested and removed, as well as others.’”

Some law enforcement officials who have had productive relationships with federal authorities in the past have watched the new D.H.S. approach with concern.

“The biggest question that I’ve been receiving is: How will we intercede if there’s a conflict between community members and D.H.S.?” Shon Barnes, Seattle’s chief of police, said in an interview last fall. “Who will we side with? What will we do?”

The answer, Chief Barnes said, was that the department would “keep the peace.”

Jim McDonnell, the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, said the city had long had close ties to D.H.S., in particular the agencies focused on criminal matters. But that cooperation became harder last summer, he said, when the agency launched a regionwide immigration operation that ensnared thousands of immigrants.

“This has been something very different — unprecedented — that we’ve seen here,” he said last year.

In many ways, Los Angeles was on the front line of the agency’s incursion into large, Democratic-led cities. Last June, following protests of an ICE operation in downtown Los Angeles, the agency empowered Border Patrol agents to lead immigration enforcement in the area.

Soon, agents were seen raiding carwashes, Home Depot parking lots and other locations. At one point, border agents traveled through a city park as a show of force. It was also the first time the National Guard had showed up to protect the Department of Homeland Security in its immigration work.

“The federal government invaded, intervened and created a problem, and then patted themselves on the back for so-called saving the city, when the city was never at risk of anything,” said Karen Bass, the city’s Democratic mayor.

The recent conflicts with local officials have alarmed some former leaders of the Department of Homeland Security.

When it was created, the agency was not just supposed to connect different parts of the federal government, but also expand its outreach to local and state entities.

“We must open lines of communication and support like never before, between agencies and departments, between federal and state and local entities, and between the public and private sectors,” Tom Ridge, who led the White House Office of Homeland Security, a precursor of the Department of Homeland Security, said when he was sworn in.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/00dc-dhs-cities-02-zqfl/00dc-dhs-cities-02-zqfl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:17.853514

Laura Gillen, provided a statement calling for federal immigration reform that avoided any mention of Hochul’s proposals.
Republicans in the past have pointed to state-level laws in Democratic-dominated Albany to blast Democrats running for federal office.
Democrats in Albany this year want new boundaries around federal immigration officers — provisions that would apply to a state with a civically engaged immigrant population.
Hochul will also implement restrictions on new state-funded public safety grants to require they not be used to support civil immigration enforcement by the federal government.
Spurred by efforts in California — like requiring ICE agents be unmasked — Fahy and her fellow legislators have been on group chats trading ideas for new ways of bottling up federal enforcement efforts.","“They’re going to have to be really careful how they talk about this,” Laura Curran, a Democrat and former Nassau County executive, said of her party’s swing seat candidates. “We don’t want to talk about defunding the police or all that stuff.”

Proposals by Hochul and the Democratic-dominated state Legislature to put guardrails around Trump’s immigration tactics have not been enthusiastically received by vulnerable House Democrats.

Reps. Tom Suozzi and Josh Riley would not comment on the governor’s policy pushback, which she outlined in her State of the State speech this week. And a third Democrat, Rep. Laura Gillen, provided a statement calling for federal immigration reform that avoided any mention of Hochul’s proposals.

Efforts in Albany to check ICE’s actions are quickly becoming an issue in the three Democrats’ races as Trump moves to deport more undocumented immigrants and potentially use the Insurrection Act to quell adversarial protests. Republicans plan to mount competitive campaigns against Suozzi, Riley and Gillen this year with the goal of making in-roads among voters in purplish areas of New York state. Attacks over the governor’s immigration measures are already starting: A spokesperson for the House Republicans’ campaign arm accused Hochul and her fellow Democrats of trying to “reopen the illegal immigration floodgates.”

“New Yorkers haven’t forgotten what Democrats’ reckless open borders did to their state, and they won’t stand for it again,” said National Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Maureen O’Toole.

The stakes for New York Democrats to get the immigration policy right couldn’t be higher. Races in at least four seats in this deep blue state are expected to determine control of the House — and the course of Trump’s final two years in office.

Republicans in the past have pointed to state-level laws in Democratic-dominated Albany to blast Democrats running for federal office. GOP candidates hammered Democrats, regardless of what office they were running for, over a controversial law that restricted cash bail.

State-backed provisions that undermine federal law enforcement stand to serve as a replay of a fight that played out in several election cycles and led to electoral gains for Republicans.

Gillen’s office sidestepped questions about the Hochul-backed measures and instead called for action on the federal level.

“Our immigration system has been broken for decades and is in dire need of repair,” she said in a statement. “Comprehensive reform must be done at the federal level. Congress should pass my bipartisan Dignity Act to strengthen our border security, remove dangerous criminals, and provide a pathway for law-abiding immigrants to earn legal status.”

Curran, who led bellwether Nassau County for four years, believes Democrats in swing seats will have to remain cautious with calls to scale back ICE. But she acknowledged some voters want action following Good’s death and Trump’s threat of invoking the Insurrection Act amid ICE’s clashes with protesters. The fraught emotions have created a tricky balancing act for Democrats in tough races.

“The dramatic nature of all this ICE action is really starting to freak people out,” Curran said. “The popularity of Republicans is starting to go down if this escalates. This is going to become much more toxic, but I also understand why some of these Congressional Democrats are being vanilla. I understand these districts; they have to be.”

The lack of support for Hochul’s ICE-curbing plans among the trio of vulnerable New York Democrats underscores how Trump’s increasingly controversial deportation efforts continue to be a third rail for the party. Democrats have struggled to articulate an alternative plan and voters punished their candidates in 2024 as the president returned to the White House promising swift action.

But the expansive efforts to remove people from the country have changed how the party’s officials — especially at the state level — are approaching the issue.

Democrats in Albany this year want new boundaries around federal immigration officers — provisions that would apply to a state with a civically engaged immigrant population. Hochul wants to make it easier for New Yorkers to sue federal officials in state court and to require a judicial warrant before carrying out a civil deportation proceedings in locations like schools or houses of worship. Hochul will also implement restrictions on new state-funded public safety grants to require they not be used to support civil immigration enforcement by the federal government.

The moderate Democrat in interviews has hammered ICE’s recent actions around the country, accusing the agency of abusing its power.

“It hurts peoples’ confidence in all law enforcement,” she told Fox 5. “This undermines the NYPD, and our state police, who are just doing their jobs.”

State lawmakers have proposed bills to prohibit federal agents from wearing masks while carrying out their official duties. They are calling for new monitoring requirements for ICE. And there are discussions to guarantee that every person facing civil deportation proceedings has access to an attorney.

“There’s a massive shift — including my own shift,” said Democratic state Sen. Pat Fahy. “Public opinion has shifted dramatically.”

The Albany-area Democrat has worked with state lawmakers across the country in recent weeks to develop new legislation. Spurred by efforts in California — like requiring ICE agents be unmasked — Fahy and her fellow legislators have been on group chats trading ideas for new ways of bottling up federal enforcement efforts. She acknowledged, though, that some moderate Democrats are yet to come around amid uncertainty over how the rapidly changing events will shape the public’s view of the deportation crackdown.

“The marginal Democrats or the swing area Democrats are still nervous about it,” she said. “But now it’s more than an immigration issue. This is about who we are as Americans.”

Even among Democrats eager to put the brakes to ICE’s enforcement there are disagreements.

Hochul is typically cautious around controversial immigration issues — she is not embracing calls to expand sanctuary protections and said in a Fox 5 interview this week she does not want the agency abolished. But the governor received standing ovations from the audience when she laid out her immigration measures in her State of the State address — a speech given days after Good’s shooting in Minneapolis and an indication she is delicately threading a needle with her proposals.

“This doesn’t interfere with lawful enforcement or public safety,” Hochul said in the speech. “It simply affirms a core truth: Power does not justify abuse.”

There are signs voters across the country are becoming unnerved by immigration agents’ expansive tactics and deployments. A Quinnipiac University poll this week found 57 percent of voters disapproved of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws while 53 percent of those surveyed believe Good’s shooting was not justified.

Hochul has said she was “sickened” by Good’s death and called for “recourse” when a federal official acts inappropriately.

“Let’s start holding these people accountable,” she told MSNOW this month.

Her likely Republican opponent, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, has taken a starkly different posture.

Blakeman — who signed an executive order opposing sanctuary-related policies — told reporters this week he does not want to “put any shackles on ICE.” He said videos of Good appeared to show her turning her car toward an ICE agent and “trying to run down” the officer — a claim Hochul’s campaign rebuked. The Republican added that there should be more support for victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants.

“You want to talk about ICE? Let’s talk about the victims of crimes committed in New York state by the people who shouldn’t be here,” said Blakeman, who Republicans expect will have strong coattails in down-ballot Long Island races.

The differing views among Democrats over how to address Trump’s immigration actions highlights Hochul’s imperative to win over statewide voters, while swing seat incumbents must take a more careful approach, said independent political analyst J.C. Polanco.

“Hochul understands she’s never going to win a Blakeman voter,” he said. “Unfortunately for Gillen and Suozzi, they need Blakeman voters.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb5%2F22%2Fb0d1e60342c3bbdd4d8cfb61aa4f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2254658829,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:20.729538

Jacob Ellis, an organizer of the protests, estimated there were twice the number of protesters than on a standard Saturday.

Recent warnings about Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents potentially conducting widespread action in Portland and Lewiston drew a crowd of about 200 people to Monument Square. On both sides of Congress Street, the majority of protesters held up signs against ICE, including “ICE is slippery and dangerous” and “crack ICE.”

While some have been protesting consistently, many demonstrators were there for the first time, compelled to participate because of the recent actions of ICE officers and the Trump administration.

Amara Aiken, 21, is one of them. Aiken said while it is always important for those with more privilege and power to stand up for those who are being targeted, it’s especially essential today.

After hearing about the recent fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE officer, Aiken said people are worried that something similar might happen in Portland. In a tight-knight community like Maine, Aiken said, people are concerned it could happen to someone they know.

“Everyone’s having that anxiety that ‘oh, my neighbor might be next, my friend might be next, my partner might be next,’” Aiken said.

Aiken is a manager in a taqueria, and when rumors started spreading about ICE in Portland, the owner and the management team established a protocol in the event that officers show up. They’ve decided they would ask the agents to leave and would refuse to serve them.

At the protest, a nurse gave a speech in front of the crowd, explaining that she has had conversations at work about what to do if ICE agents try to forcibly enter the doctor’s office.

Since hearing the rumors of ICE activity in Maine, many protesters said they have been trying to help out their neighbors and immigrants in their community, from sharing the number of the Maine ICE Watch Hotline to keeping track of where ICE officers might be located.

Jane Hoover, a retired nurse, said she has been involved in helping immigrants for years, from tutoring to helping provide shelter to attending the weekly protest whenever she can.

Hoover pointed sadly to a young girl standing on the sculpture in the middle of the square with a sign that read, “This is home. Why are we scared?”

The girl wasn’t the only one feeling scared. Protesters also said they felt sad, angry, disheartened and resigned. Some, like Nancy Anderson, still felt hopeful.

Anderson was glad to see new faces at the protest Saturday, including many young people. Anderson, who is 76 years old, said it crossed her mind that ICE officers might come to the protest, but there was no place she’d rather be than trying to defend democracy in the country for her four grandkids and help those at risk.

“Our Somali communities are vibrant and a gift to Maine, and people are coming together to do what is necessary to support them,” she said.

Ellis, the organizer, said he was encouraged by the number of people at the protest Saturday, although he is infuriated by the circumstances that necessitated the demonstration.

There will be another protest against ICE at 5 p.m. Sunday at Monument Square in coordination with other rallies across the country, he said.

Burks said that MPR journalists have focused less on competition with other outlets and more on answering the questions of viewers.","After a federal immigration agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with grisly videos quickly going viral on social media, news organizations from around the state, country and world dispatched correspondents and anchors to the scene.

In the days since, that media presence has ebbed and flowed – though a well-resourced local news corps and many national journalists have remained, including reporters for the Guardian, covering additional clashes between police and protesters.

Another shooting (of a man attempting to flee arrest, the government said) on Wednesday drew more coverage, and on Thursday a CNN crew was hit with projectiles while covering a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

While cuts and closures have thinned out local news reporting around the country, the Minneapolis media market remains strong, ensuring the shooting – and what has followed – have received robust coverage.

“I think we have the strongest media ecosystem of any city that’s parallel to our city,” said Matt Carlson, a Minneapolis-based professor of journalism for the University of Minnesota, mentioning the Star Tribune newspaper, Minnesota Public Radio, and smaller outlets such as the Sahan Journal, which covers immigrant communities, including the Somali refugee population that has come under attack from conservatives. (There’s also Alpha News, a conservative outlet that made headlines by publishing cell phone video taken by the ICE officer who killed Good.)

While there are always debates about national and international journalists parachuting in to cover catastrophes, “I think people in Minneapolis are actually excited to see national coverage of this, because we know that we can’t stop what’s happening by ourselves,” Carlson said.

He also predicted that Minneapolis will remain an epicenter of ICE activity and counter-protests, with Donald Trump recently threatening to invoke the Insurrection Action and send troops to the city.

“I would be very happy if the national news were able to leave because things have died down,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is not a case where things are dying down.”

Here are some of the journalists and newsroom leaders who have participated in coverage.

Omar Jimenez, anchor and correspondent, CNN

Jimenez, 32, came to the story last week with a lot of experience reporting in Minneapolis.

In May 2020, Jimenez was arrested live on CNN while covering protests in the city following the murder of George Floyd, which occurred just blocks away from where Good was killed.

While Jimenez’s team was quickly released, the incident made international headlines as an extraordinary incursion into the activities of journalists.

Since then, Jimenez has returned to the city multiple times for reporting trips. He said his antenna is always up for stories involving Minneapolis. So he flew to Minnesota a few hours after the shooting, arriving on the evening of 7 January and driving straight from the airport to the spot where Good was shot.

“When it became clear that obviously this was going to be as big as it has become, that’s when a manager of mine kind of walked in and said, ‘Hey, are you able to go to Minnesota as soon as possible?’” (He was only delayed, he said, because he needed to go home and get warmer clothes after seeing the weather forecast in Minnesota.)

During his reporting in Minneapolis last week, Jimenez said he met several people that he first encountered back in 2020.

“It’s a little bit of a balance in the sense that you obviously don’t want to be the story,” he said. “But I do think what you want is to try and be able to convey an authentic space, especially when you have the luxury of a camera. Even though everyone is seeing what you’re seeing, they’re not feeling it. There is a little bit of a barrier still. And so that’s why it is a constant balance of: ‘how close do we want to get?’”

Jimenez got pretty close to the action on 8 January, when CNN viewers watched him and his crew running away from law enforcement agents who had moved aggressively toward protesters after someone threw a water bottle at them.

While Jimenez is now back in New York City, he said: “I am not done with this story. I can tell you that.”

Kathleen Hennessey, editor and senior vice-president, Minnesota Star Tribune

A veteran of the Associated Press and the New York Times, Hennessey only took on the top editorial position at the newspaper (which was previously called the Minneapolis Star Tribune) last May. It’s fair to say that she’s been busy, considering the number of major stories that have happened in the state since then, including the June 2025 assassination of state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband.

“It’s been maybe busier, newsier than I expected to some degree, but it’s also been really rewarding to be at a place that feels so needed,” she said.

Hennessey’s newsroom of about 200 people has broken several major stories since the shooting, including being the first outlet to report the ICE officer’s name. That story drew a sharp rebuke from DHS press secretary Tricia McLaughlin, who called the outlet “reckless” and said it should “delete their story immediately” (it didn’t).

Hennessey said the decision to name the shooter (Jonathan Ross) was “a very deliberate, much-discussed decision” – but she added that it “wasn’t a particularly tough call”.

She said her news team had been “on edge and prepared and ready” for the Good story, considering the surge of deportation enforcement in recent weeks in the community.

“By this time, we feel pretty well practiced in sort of the quick mobilization of an all-hands-on-deck moment,” she said. “And so this was another one of those, really. Just about everybody immediately ran to their stations and did what they do.”

Considering how widely covered this story has been, “I encourage our newsroom to remember that nobody knows this place better than we do,” she said, “and nobody can be as close to the people involved, and be a more reliable source for people who actually live here.”

Unsurprisingly, Hennessey said the Star Tribune’s website has received a very large number of online readers over the last week and a half – though it’s a bit harder to net paying subscribers.

Going forward, she said she expects her newsroom to remain in overdrive covering the story. “It’s ongoing, it’s unfolding, and it feels very everywhere all at once,” she said. “At any given moment, there’s just a million videos popping up everywhere of incidents and encounters with ICE that feel newsworthy.”

Alex Tabet, political reporter, MS NOW (formerly MSNBC)

Tabet, who arrived in Minnesota at 1am on 7 January, made it to the scene of the shooting extremely quickly. He had already been tipped off by an ICE observer that there was an enforcement action going on in the neighborhood, and then got word that someone had been shot. It was his third reporting trip to Minnesota over the past month. “We were the first – at least – TV crew on the ground,” he said.

Tabet’s first call was to his network’s editorial leaders and standards officials, telling them, “Hey, this is what we know, this is what we don’t know,” he said. “And we started vetting all of the information that we had to try to figure out what is appropriate to put on air, what should we hold off on, basically making sure we had hit the threshold of understanding what was going on.”

Tabet, who left Minnesota on Tuesday after almost a full week, said he’s “hoping to go back as soon as possible” – though he said the network is well staffed on the story. The decision to leave “was a discussion between my bosses and I, because there’s only so many days [you can go] without sleep”.

“I know MS NOW is committed to having a strong presence on the ground, because they recognize how important of a story this is right now,” he said.

Megan Burks, deputy managing producer, MPR News (Minnesota Public Radio)

Burks, who coordinates daily news coverage for the NPR member station, said the newsroom had been settling into a new rhythm since the 7 January killing of Good. And then on Wednesday, a federal officer shot a man in the leg, leading to new protests and clashes with law enforcement.

“Just as it felt like we were settling into a manageable rhythm, this new twist came and now we’re back to trying to figure out what is our new normal, what is our new rhythm,” she said.

Burks said that MPR journalists have focused less on competition with other outlets and more on answering the questions of viewers.

“Knowing that we can’t focus on everything, we’re trying to let the audience drive some of what we choose to put our stamp on,” she said.

Sganga arrived in Minneapolis two days before the shooting. She participated in a ride-along with immigration agents and interviewed Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, pressing her on how she can “justify” the government sending 2,000 DHS agents to the city.

In addition to reporting on the ground about Good’s killing, Sganga covered the intensification of immigration raids after the incident.

“My approach is always, ‘get there, bear witness, ask questions,’” Sganga said.

She said it’s been important to cover the story from Minneapolis to be able to press government officials on “contradictory accounts” of what happened and what is happening.

“That kind of independent reporting and verification is critical to holding power to account and to clarifying the facts for the public,” said Sganga, who has reported for the network for a decade.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db15c70b319ad3d587a5d51b7ccf3c7301280013/506_0_5055_4046/master/5055.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b91d9258b3d9dea6d35eeab10b3eab38",N,,2026-01-18 09:58:28.290296

The Next Century Foundation´s Research Officer, Olwyn Matthews, takes up the challenge:

Since its origins as the Brexit party in 2018, Reform UK has maintained a strong focus on immigration, Zia Yusuf (Head of Policy for Reform UK) naming UK return agreements for irregular or unauthorised migrants as the party’s “almighty foreign policy campaign”. Since the 2024 General Election, Reform UK’s primary policy document remains the party’s manifesto, “Our Contract With You”. Whilst Reform UK party members refer back to the core policies of this document, their ongoing discussion and media comments on foreign policy matters provide current insight into how a Reform UK government would approach foreign affairs.

Despite only having 5 MPs in the 650-seat House of Commons, Reform UK have topped recent opinion polls on voting intention in Parliament, reaching 31% in 2025. These results are far above the next contender, the Conservative party, with 18% voting intention. Polling offers a snapshot of voting decisions but makes the prospect of Reform UK success in the 2029 general election much more likely than in 2024.

Reform UK’s Approach to Foreign Affairs

With a populist party so focused on anti-migration and fuelling Euroscepticism, the increased probability of a successful campaign leaves many to question how a Reform government would approach foreign affairs. This is particularly relevant in an international arena with emerging populist parties favouring nationalism and the rejection of international community.

President Trump’s Administration

Reform UK’s approach to the US is mainly derived from Leader of Reform UK, the MP Nigel Farage’s public admiration for President Trump and their personal relationship. Generally, party members praise Trump’s administration, and it can be expected that their foreign policy would be closely aligned with Trump’s direction. Alan Mendoza, Reform UK foreign affairs advisor (Alan is also founder of the small right wing think tank, the Henry Jackson Society), has commended Trump’s “decisive” politics, particularly with regard to the Trump brokered Gaza Peace Plan of October 2025. In response to the recent US invasion of Venezuela, Farage commented the move by Trump was “contrary to international law”, but if it makes China and Russia “think twice, it may be a good thing”.

It is clear from Reform UK’s outlook on foreign affairs that its policy would follow a similar trajectory to the Trump administration. However, this personal relationship does not provide any clear foreign policy plan or confirm US support.

Israel

Reform UK has no clear policy on Israel or Palestine, but members of the party have shown strong support towards Israel. Farage has rejected the idea that the UK stop the arms supply to Israel and also opposes the arrest warrant for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by the International Criminal Court (ICC). MP Richard Tice, Deputy Leader of Reform UK has accused Tom Fletcher, UN humanitarian chief, of “lying with absurd claims” regarding the “UN’s genocide smears” against Israel.

The party itself has displayed support of Israel last year as it founded Reform Friends of Israel, joining similar groups such as Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) and Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), cementing even further their backing for the State of Israel. Both individual members and the party itself have been outspoken on its support for Israel and, even without an explicit policy, it can be expected that, if elected to office, a Reform government would back the state.

Palestine

With regard to Palestine, many members of the party, including Farage, Mendoza, and Tice have condemned the UK’s decision to recognise the Palestinian state in September 2025. 2023 London Mayoral candidate for Reform UK, Howard Cox, stated in a Reform UK press release, “flying the Palestinian flag in our Capital is needlessly provocative” and, “As London Mayor, I would not allow any pro-Palestinian protests to take place in London whilst the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues in Gaza.”

In response to President Trump’s Gaza Peace Plan announced in October 2025, Farage and Mendoza have publicly celebrated Trump’s “personal diplomacy and intervention”. To reach permanent peace in Gaza, Mendoza claims there are three issues that must be addressed: (i) the disarmament of Hamas and their removal from power, (ii) the governance of Gaza “free of terrorist control”, and (iii) the determination of who will enforce peace.

Russia and Ukraine

Farage has shown a mixed stance towards Russia and Ukraine over the years. Recently, the party has been under scrutiny as its former Welsh leader and Member of European Parliament, Nathan Gill, was jailed in November 2025 for taking bribes to make statements in favour of Russia. In June 2024 Farage made comments implying that the Russian invasion was provoked by NATO advances. After criticism, he then called the invasion “immoral, outrageous, and indefensible”, but that “poking a bear is obviously not good foreign policy”. Despite his previous statements, which imply NATO expansionism is partly to blame for provoking the Russian invasion, Farage now views Ukraine joining NATO as “essential” to a peace deal.

On January 6th 2026, both Britain and France committed troops to Ukraine following the implementation of any peace deal. This was negatively received by Farage, claiming he would vote against sending British soldiers to Ukraine. The Reform leader argues Britain has neither the manpower nor the equipment to commit to an operation with an unknown timeline. This comment was made after 24 world leaders and Ukrainian allies making up the “coalition of the willing” discussed strategic plans post-peace deal.

Farage’s reluctance to send troops to Ukraine has been highlighted by cabinet minister Pat McFadden as a “pro-Russia” outlook, arguing that sending British troops is not just for Ukraine, but is a “British national security interest”. However, Mendoza argued Reform UK’s opposition to the Prime Minister’s Ukraine plans is not because the idea of sending British forces to Ukraine is the “wrong principle”, but that the plan itself is “unviable”. Moreover, Farage’s declaration that he would ensure the UK was a leading NATO force, alongside his recent support for Ukraine´s aspiration to become a NATO state, leaves one to assume that Farage would provide assistance to Ukraine as “once you’re a NATO member, you must be defended”. Reform voters on the other hand show scepticism in regard to the idea of sending British troops and only 4/10 voters are shown to favour the provision of arms to Ukraine.

The current reluctance from both Farage and the party’s voters introduces doubt as to how a Reform government would approach Putin´s Russia in the future and to what extent the party would utilise British forces.

Reflecting on Reform UK’s 2024 General Election Manifesto

“Our Contract With You” remains the most recent written document on Reform UK’s policy. The party’s foreign policy outlined in the document is extremely limited and vague, prioritising anti-immigration policy and arguably demonising foreigners and foreign influence.

Immigration

In 2025, the current Labour government announced their intent to extend the Indefinite Leave to Remain qualifying period from 5 to 10 years, presumed to enter into effect in April 2026. Reform UK’s migration policy sets to erase the Indefinite Leave to Remain status, replaced with a pathway by which migrants would be required to apply for a 5-year work visa. This would be a radical policy change. A salary threshold, at least £60,000 per year, would also be required, linking the number of dependents to the individual’s income, compared to the current (and already high) £41,700 per year requirement. This particular element of their policy would make little difference. If elected, Reform UK would prohibit anyone except British citizens from accessing welfare, raising questions as to the treatment of EU citizens with settled status who can acquire benefits outlined in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. The party has also announced plans to implement an “immigration tax” which would increase the national insurance rate to 20% for migrant workers, deterring employees from hiring non-British citizens.

Defence

As part of the Brexit Policy, Reform UK’s Manifesto calls for the “Independence for Britain’s Armed Forces” from the EU Command and Control Force. This would involve abandoning current membership in the EU Horizon programme, stop any financial support of the European Defence Fund, and participation in the EU’s military mobility project.

Defence spending would be increased to 2.5% of the national GDP by Year 3, to 3% by Year 6. This is very similar when compared to Labour’s current spending of 2.5% national GDP in 2027, increasing from 2.3%. Reform UK calls to increase the size of Britain’s Armed Forces by 30,000 troops and to ensure a leadership position in NATO.

The introduction of the “Armed Forces Justice Bill” would “protect” servicemen and women “from civil law and human rights lawyers”. Presumably, this would allow British soldiers who have committed crimes overseas to escape any prosecution.

Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has shown mixed support of military intervention over the years, but based on opinion polls, Reform UK voters do not think an active role in foreign affairs is necessary. Less than half of Reform UK voters view this as extremely or very important, with 29% accepting that the UK consider the interests of allies.

Disengagement from International Institutions

What little foreign policy that there is in Reform UK’s Manifesto is limited to immigration, sparse defence policy, and the rejection of the international institutions with the planned exit from several conventions and agreements.

The Manifesto states intent to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) – this is framed in the Manifesto and by Farage as a way to “stop the boats” that is argued to contribute to “uncontrolled Immigration”. If exiting the ECHR, the UK would join Russia and Belarus as the only states to have left or been expelled from the Convention. This would be followed with a replacement of the Human Rights Act 1998 (which authorises the ECHR into domestic UK law) with a “British Bill of Rights” which could involve the re-evaluation of the rights of UK citizens. The suggest altered policy regarding the ECHR and the Human Rights Act 1998 would presumably weaken or remove legal protections for asylum seekers and would re-shape the UK’s approach to settlement in the UK.

A UK departure from the ECHR would also impact the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which itself is under fire in the Manifesto which calls for a round of renegotiations, as it claims a “so-called EU ‘level playing field’ is holding us back”. As the party initially formed as the ‘Brexit Party’, the severing of ties with EU conventions and agreements is not at all surprising.

Climate Change Denial and goodbye to the ICC

Beyond these EU agreements, the manifesto pledges to withdrawal from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the eradication of any domestic and international goals to reach Net Zero. On Thursday 8th January, MP Richard Tice, Deputy Leader of Reform UK, echoed these plans, now calling for the UK to follow Trump’s move to quit the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the organisation that supports the annual COP climate conferences, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which Tice claims are “failing British voters”.

The disengagement with international agreements can also lead the assumption that Reform UK will very likely ignore any international law. Danny Kruger, Reform UK MP, declared in October 2025 that the party would rewrite UK’s ministerial code, a plan also stated in the party’s Manifesto. The ministerial code refers to “the overarching duty on ministers to comply with the law, including international law and treaty obligations”. Kruger affirmed his “glaring objection” to this code “is that it requires them (the ministers) to acknowledge international law in their decision making. That is an immediate change we would make.” This change would allow or even be shown to encourage policymakers to act even more lawlessly.

This neglect of international law is further evident with the party’s dismissal of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in response to the Chagos deal. The Reform party has declared plans to cancel the current Labour government’s Chagos deal, signed in May 2025. This deal agrees upon the transfer of sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, after people were removed from the territory by the UK in the 1970’s to claim the land for a US military base. Farage argues that giving up Diego Garcia in particular – the largest island crucial for US/UK military interventions – is “the single most important thing that we give America right now”, and this ‘loss’ plays “into China’s hands”.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) published their advisory opinion, demanding the UK cease control over the Chagos Islands and relinquish sovereignty to Mauritius. Farage has dismissed this as “an advisory judgement from the International Criminal Court has no force of legal power whatsoever; indeed, America disregards it so much that it is not even a member.” The UK’s exit from any of these institutions, and lack of participation in the international arena would lose any leadership position the UK may have on the international stage.

Reducing Foreign Aid

Reform UK stated in the run up to the 2024 General Election that it would slash “wasteful” spending, one example being the cutting of foreign aid by 50%. More recently, Reform UK has announced plans to limit foreign aid much further to £1 billion, a decrease from the £14 billion budget in 2024. Approximately £750 million of this sum would be spent to maintain membership of international organisations such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, allocating the rest for “genuine disaster relief”.

This was renounced by Gideon Rabinowitz, Director of Policy and Advocacy at Bond, arguing that such a vast cut in foreign aid would cause “irreversible damage to the UK’s safety net” in an “increasingly unstable world”. With the reduced contributions to international organisations, there would be extreme risk of losing influence in these spaces of international collaboration. A relation can be made to the Trump administration’s “slash and burn” approach to government financing, with the closure of USAID in 2025 felt across the globe.

Conclusion

Reform UK maintains a focus purely on the ‘national interest’, with a lack of appetite to support international causes. Reform UK voters continue to hold more nationalistic views on foreign policy compared to other voters, with a lower level of approval for British action overseas. Generally, with a future Reform UK government, one could expect nationalist, Trump-aligned policy on migration, higher defence spending, slashing ties to international partners, and decreasing foreign aid.

Several South Asian civil rights and advocacy organizations are condemning the U.S. State Department’s decision to suspend immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries, a move scheduled to take effect Jan. 21, calling on President Donald Trump to immediately rescind what they describe as discriminatory measures.

The South Asian Bar Association of North America Foundation said the policy unfairly penalizes people from the South Asian subcontinent, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal, and undermines principles of equity, family unity and human dignity.

Rittu Kumar, president of the South Asian Bar Association of North America Foundation, said the organization views the policy as discriminatory in both impact and intent.

“The South Asian communities have long contributed to the social, cultural, academic, and economic fabric of the United States. Policies that single out entire nations and populations for exclusion, under the guise of security or administrative efficiency, perpetuate harmful stereotypes, fuel xenophobia, and punish individuals based on nationality rather than any individualized assessment,” Kumar said.

Asked about data on how many South Asians could be affected and whether the group plans legal action, Kumar told indica the foundation is monitoring developments but does not plan to file a lawsuit.

“I do not have any data available for how many South Asians would be impacted and we do not intend to file a lawsuit. We will be keeping a close watch regarding the changing landscape affecting immigration rights, and reaffirm our commitment to advocating for an immigration system that treats all people with dignity and respect,” Kumar said.

In its statement, the South Asian Bar Association of North America Foundation rejected the administration’s rationale for the suspension and criticized what it described as a broader pattern of restrictive immigration policies.

“We reject the false narrative that immigration from South Asia, and other named countries, poses a threat to the United States. History and evidence show the opposite, inclusive immigration policies strengthen communities, foster innovation, and uphold democratic values,” the statement said. “This announcement and other country-specific immigration restrictions that the Trump administration has enacted in the last 12 months are a modern version of xenophobic U.S. immigration policies and seek to reverse decades of legal immigration to the United States. Blanket bans and pauses erode trust in government and damage the nation’s moral standing.”

The organization called on the federal government to reverse course.

“The SABA North America calls on the U.S. government to immediately rescind these discriminatory measures, restore fair and timely visa processing, and pursue immigration policies grounded in justice, transparency, and due process,” the statement said. “We stand in solidarity with South Asian communities in the United States and abroad, as well as all affected individuals and communities, and reaffirm our commitment to advocating for an immigration system that treats all people with dignity and respect, regardless of where they come from.”

Other civil rights organizations also voiced strong opposition. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said the suspension would have sweeping consequences for immigrant families and communities of color.

“The Trump administration’s sweeping decision to indefinitely suspend immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries is a cruel, unjustified and bigoted policy that undermines American values and divides American families from their relatives overseas,” the group said. The organization said the policy disproportionately targets majority Black, Brown and Global South nations, including many Muslim-majority countries.

Asian Americans Advancing Justice said the decision represents one of the most restrictive immigration actions in decades and likened it to earlier racially discriminatory policies.

“This new policy constitutes one of the most restrictive attacks on the immigration system that our nation has seen in decades,” the organization said. “It blocks hundreds of thousands of people from immigration pathways established by Congress and harkens back to the racially discriminatory immigration restrictions of the 1920s that effectively barred Asian and Black immigrants.”

The group said the suspension would separate families and block workers who have followed existing legal pathways to permanent residence.

“The pause disproportionately targets immigrants of color, yet another indication of the xenophobia and racism driving this administration’s policies,” the organization said. “Asian Americans will suffer under this pause, with 44% of Asian immigrant visa holders, and over 135,000 individuals, barred.”

Asian Americans Advancing Justice also disputed the State Department’s justification for the policy.

“The State Department has justified this action based on supposed concerns about public benefit usage by immigrants. This is a blatant lie,” the organization said. “Various rules already restrict the ability of immigrant visa recipients to qualify for public benefits. Moreover, countless studies have shown that immigrants enhance economic growth, and that access to public benefits leads to better long-term outcomes for children, families and society.”

The organization urged the administration and Congress to reverse the suspension and pursue broader immigration reform.

“Policymakers should expand access to immigration and address root causes of poverty and displacement with dignity, not exclusion,” it said. “We call on the administration to immediately reverse this decision and work with Congress to improve, and not curtail, our immigration system.”",https://indicanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pexels-n-voitkevich-7235892.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 12:59:29.409872

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used the presidential pardon power to reward his supporters and potential allies.","“Move fast and break things” – the Silicon Valley mantra – aptly describes the whirlwind start to President Donald Trump’s second term.

The president hit the ground running last January, issuing a flurry of executive orders, including pardons for most Jan. 6 defendants and the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk’s effort to slash the federal government.

One year on, Mr. Musk is long gone, as is DOGE. And the impact of President Trump’s ambitious and aggressive efforts to reshape policy – indeed, America itself – is coming into focus. He has pushed the envelope on presidential power, issuing more executive orders in his first year back than in his entire first term. He has bypassed Congress and challenged the courts, invaded Venezuela and arrested its leader, exacted retribution on his perceived enemies, and transformed the White House itself with golden decor and a big planned ballroom.

Mr. Trump’s second term makes the first term look like a dress rehearsal. It’s almost as if he spent his first four years in office figuring out how much power he had, and came back determined to use every bit of it.

Fifty years from now, will historians be calling Mr. Trump a “transformational president”? Or will this period ultimately seem like a lot of tumult that added up to little long-term change? Likely both. Every president leaves a stamp on the office and the country. As always, the challenge is to separate the signal from the noise.

Mr. Trump has made plenty of promises (or threats) that have gone nowhere – from claiming he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within 24 hours to saying he would turn the Gaza Strip into a luxury tourist destination.

But in many ways, Mr. Trump has already changed the United States profoundly, including its role in the world, in ways that may have lasting impact.

A timeline at the bottom of this article charts major presidential events this past year.

More stories on President Trump’s second term after one year:

• On the economy, no recession, but no boom either

• Shattering foreign policy norms

• Battling universities over antisemitism and DEI

America’s image in Europe as a steady ally has been torpedoed, as made clear in the president’s new National Security Strategy, which lauds Europe’s “patriotic” – i.e., nationalistic – parties. Mr. Trump’s new tariff regime has upended global trade, while his crackdown on illegal immigration cut off the flow of migrants at the border and sparked major unrest in Minneapolis.

He’s also shrunk and reshaped parts of the U.S. government, including eliminating “diversity, equity, and inclusion” as a priority. The departments and agencies that Mr. Trump gutted, such as the Education Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, will be hard to reconstitute, even if a future president wants to do so. In all this, and perhaps most important, he has reset the bar for using executive power.

“Previous presidents have been criticized for using executive orders and trying to act unilaterally, but he’s taken it to a different level,” says Matthew Dickinson, a presidential scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont. “It’s going to be hard to put that genie back in the bottle.”

In a year of upheaval, one notable aspect of Trump 2.0 has been the loyalty and stability of his team. Unlike Year 1 of his first term, when the president rapidly cycled through top aides in key spots – including his chief of staff, press secretary, and chief political strategist – this year has seen little staff turnover. “Let Trump be Trump” appears to be the guiding philosophy of Term 2.

Looking ahead, Mr. Trump’s power might get a real check after the fall midterm elections, if Democrats retake the House of Representatives. Signs of “lame duckery” are already appearing, as some Republicans start pushing back on his policies and approach. Still, he has a year to go with the current Congress – and that’s a lifetime in Trump time.

On immigration, big goals and big controversy

In Year 1, President Trump oversaw an avalanche of anti-immigrant policies – while creating exceptions for some immigrants who are white or rich. From borderlands to urban centers, his administration targeted illegal immigration and lawful pathways alike. He condemned many migrants, generally, as criminals. He called some, specifically, “garbage.”

Invoking a rare wartime law – and disputed gang ties – the Department of Homeland Security sent more than 100 Venezuelans to a notorious Salvadoran prison in March. A federal judge has asked the administration to address due process violations, while the government dismisses former detainees’ claims of abuse.

The president kept campaign promises as he sought to “seal” the southern border. Border Patrol apprehensions, a proxy for illegal crossings, sank to their lowest level since 1970. A surge of armed forces to the border included the creation of new military zones. In the interior, controversial waves of immigrant arrests – many targeting people without criminal records – at times ensnared U.S. citizens. Even as the administration withholds certain data, it reports deporting over 600,000 people. Mr. Trump also limited legal immigration, including of refugees, while prioritizing Afrikaners from South Africa. As foreigners from 39 countries face entry bans, Mr. Trump is offering “gold card” residency for $1 million per person.

Heading into Year 2, polling suggests the public has soured on his immigration agenda. An immigration officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month has also sparked protests there and nationwide.

What to watch: whether the Supreme Court lets the president end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship.

Steering a new direction on social issues

President Trump has taken a number of steps in office aimed at defeating “woke” ideology – including dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that he said illegally discriminated against white people.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing government agencies and departments to terminate all DEI offices and positions, “equity action” plans, and DEI performance requirements.

This order was a direct response to the first executive order President Joe Biden signed after his own inauguration, instructing agency heads to assess the equity of agency policies and actions. Another Trump executive order rescinded affirmative action requirements for federal contractors. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo instructing the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to investigate illegal DEI mandates in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.

In response, major U.S. companies from Walmart to Meta scrapped diversity goals and training programs. And hundreds of colleges and universities have ended programs that promoted DEI on campus or focused on LGBTQ+ or minority students.

Mr. Trump moved to undo protections for transgender people, making it federal policy to recognize only two genders and rescinding federal funds from schools that allow biological males to compete in women’s sports. After Mr. Trump revoked Mr. Biden’s executive order that allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the military, the Department of Defense issued a ban on transgender service members, which the Supreme Court has upheld. His Department of Health and Human Services in December proposed a sweeping set of new rules that would dramatically restrict access to gender-transition treatments for minors.

Mr. Trump has also tried to shift American culture in a more conservative direction. He has instructed the Smithsonian museums to root out what he calls anti-American propaganda in their exhibits. He took over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, appointing a new board that tapped him as its chair, eliminating “woke” programming, and adding his name to the building’s exterior.

Justice as retribution?

The first year of this second Trump administration has challenged long-standing norms in the criminal justice system. Having criticized the justice system as unfairly targeting him, Mr. Trump appears to be trying to use the system in a similar fashion.

He has pushed for prosecutions of his political adversaries and issued pardons for allies. He has personally criticized lower court judges who ruled against his administration, while one of his top aides has railed against “judicial tyranny.” Presidents have traditionally refrained from direct criticism like this out of respect for the judiciary’s independence and to uphold public confidence in the courts. Amid Mr. Trump’s attacks, violent threats against federal judges rose.

In September, Mr. Trump called for two adversaries – former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James – to be prosecuted. Indictments quickly followed – against Mr. Comey on charges of lying to Congress, and against Ms. James on charges of mortgage fraud. Both deny the charges, and both cases have since been dismissed on procedural grounds. In January, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that he was being investigated for allegedly lying to Congress. The investigation is a pretext, Mr. Powell said, for not acquiescing to Mr. Trump’s demands to lower interest rates.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used the presidential pardon power to reward his supporters and potential allies. On his first day in office, he issued pardons to more than 1,500 people convicted or charged for their participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including hundreds charged with violent felonies.

A chain saw, but DOGE doesn’t meet its target

Remaking the federal bureaucracy began on President Trump’s first day in office, when he created the Department of Government Efficiency. Under the leadership of Mr. Trump’s billionaire benefactor Elon Musk, DOGE became synonymous with the president’s effort to dislodge what he calls the “deep state” and slash a “bloated” federal government. Mr. Musk set a goal of cutting $2 trillion from the country’s $7 trillion budget. By its own accounting, DOGE – which disbanded eight months ahead of schedule – only achieved about 10% of its cost-cutting goal; media investigations and conservative think tanks suggest the true savings were roughly half that, at best.

Still, cuts were widespread across the government. According to data released by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in January, more than 322,000 federal employees have left the government since January 2025, either through layoffs or after taking buyouts. But some agencies also rehired workers, either out of necessity or because of court rulings, leading to an overall workforce cut of roughly 220,000 employees, or a 10% reduction. This falls short of Mr. Trump’s stated goal of four reductions for every new hire, and is less than President Bill Clinton’s federal workforce cut of about 17% in the 1990s.

The cuts varied across the government, with some agencies and departments harder hit than others. The U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered almost entirely, the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities was cut by more than 50%, and the Department of Education by more than 40%. The Departments of the Treasury, Agriculture, State, and Health and Human Services each lost around 20% of their workforces. The Department of Defense, on the other hand, only fell by 8%.

Beyond the current cuts, workers and experts fear that the administration’s attacks on federal workers may damage future recruitment. Mr. Trump also signed executive orders to allow for more politically appointed positions – a “sharp departure,” says Rachel Augustine Potter, a politics professor at the University of Virginia, from “the meritocratic foundations of the U.S. bureaucracy.” If courts uphold these changes, she writes, it could make it difficult for America to return to a less politicized, expertise-based civil service.

The president hit the ground running last January, issuing a flurry of executive orders, including pardons for most Jan. 6 defendants and the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk’s effort to slash the federal government.

One year on, Mr. Musk is long gone, as is DOGE. And the impact of President Trump’s ambitious and aggressive efforts to reshape policy – indeed, America itself – is coming into focus. He has pushed the envelope on presidential power, issuing more executive orders in his first year back than in his entire first term. He has bypassed Congress and challenged the courts, invaded Venezuela and arrested its leader, exacted retribution on his perceived enemies, and transformed the White House itself with golden decor and a big planned ballroom.

Why We Wrote This

Beyond policy specifics, Donald Trump has in many ways raised the bar for how much power a president can wield unilaterally. Controversy has followed, regarding both the policies and the approach to power.

Mr. Trump’s second term makes the first term look like a dress rehearsal. It’s almost as if he spent his first four years in office figuring out how much power he had, and came back determined to use every bit of it.

Fifty years from now, will historians be calling Mr. Trump a “transformational president”? Or will this period ultimately seem like a lot of tumult that added up to little long-term change? Likely both. Every president leaves a stamp on the office and the country. As always, the challenge is to separate the signal from the noise.

Mr. Trump has made plenty of promises (or threats) that have gone nowhere – from claiming he could end Russia’s war on Ukraine within 24 hours to saying he would turn the Gaza Strip into a luxury tourist destination.

But in many ways, Mr. Trump has already changed the United States profoundly, including its role in the world, in ways that may have lasting impact.

A timeline at the bottom of this article charts major presidential events this past year.

More stories on President Trump’s second term after one year:

• On the economy, no recession, but no boom either

• Shattering foreign policy norms

• Battling universities over antisemitism and DEI

America’s image in Europe as a steady ally has been torpedoed, as made clear in the president’s new National Security Strategy, which lauds Europe’s “patriotic” – i.e., nationalistic – parties. Mr. Trump’s new tariff regime has upended global trade, while his crackdown on illegal immigration cut off the flow of migrants at the border and sparked major unrest in Minneapolis.

He’s also shrunk and reshaped parts of the U.S. government, including eliminating “diversity, equity, and inclusion” as a priority. The departments and agencies that Mr. Trump gutted, such as the Education Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, will be hard to reconstitute, even if a future president wants to do so. In all this, and perhaps most important, he has reset the bar for using executive power.

“Previous presidents have been criticized for using executive orders and trying to act unilaterally, but he’s taken it to a different level,” says Matthew Dickinson, a presidential scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont. “It’s going to be hard to put that genie back in the bottle.”

In a year of upheaval, one notable aspect of Trump 2.0 has been the loyalty and stability of his team. Unlike Year 1 of his first term, when the president rapidly cycled through top aides in key spots – including his chief of staff, press secretary, and chief political strategist – this year has seen little staff turnover. “Let Trump be Trump” appears to be the guiding philosophy of Term 2.

Looking ahead, Mr. Trump’s power might get a real check after the fall midterm elections, if Democrats retake the House of Representatives. Signs of “lame duckery” are already appearing, as some Republicans start pushing back on his policies and approach. Still, he has a year to go with the current Congress – and that’s a lifetime in Trump time.

On immigration, big goals and big controversy

In Year 1, President Trump oversaw an avalanche of anti-immigrant policies – while creating exceptions for some immigrants who are white or rich. From borderlands to urban centers, his administration targeted illegal immigration and lawful pathways alike. He condemned many migrants, generally, as criminals. He called some, specifically, “garbage.”

Invoking a rare wartime law – and disputed gang ties – the Department of Homeland Security sent more than 100 Venezuelans to a notorious Salvadoran prison in March. A federal judge has asked the administration to address due process violations, while the government dismisses former detainees’ claims of abuse.

The president kept campaign promises as he sought to “seal” the southern border. Border Patrol apprehensions, a proxy for illegal crossings, sank to their lowest level since 1970. A surge of armed forces to the border included the creation of new military zones. In the interior, controversial waves of immigrant arrests – many targeting people without criminal records – at times ensnared U.S. citizens. Even as the administration withholds certain data, it reports deporting over 600,000 people. Mr. Trump also limited legal immigration, including of refugees, while prioritizing Afrikaners from South Africa. As foreigners from 39 countries face entry bans, Mr. Trump is offering “gold card” residency for $1 million per person.

Heading into Year 2, polling suggests the public has soured on his immigration agenda. An immigration officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month has also sparked protests there and nationwide.

What to watch: whether the Supreme Court lets the president end the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship.

Steering a new direction on social issues

President Trump has taken a number of steps in office aimed at defeating “woke” ideology – including dismantling diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs that he said illegally discriminated against white people.

On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order instructing government agencies and departments to terminate all DEI offices and positions, “equity action” plans, and DEI performance requirements.

This order was a direct response to the first executive order President Joe Biden signed after his own inauguration, instructing agency heads to assess the equity of agency policies and actions. Another Trump executive order rescinded affirmative action requirements for federal contractors. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo instructing the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to investigate illegal DEI mandates in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.

In response, major U.S. companies from Walmart to Meta scrapped diversity goals and training programs. And hundreds of colleges and universities have ended programs that promoted DEI on campus or focused on LGBTQ+ or minority students.

Mr. Trump moved to undo protections for transgender people, making it federal policy to recognize only two genders and rescinding federal funds from schools that allow biological males to compete in women’s sports. After Mr. Trump revoked Mr. Biden’s executive order that allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the military, the Department of Defense issued a ban on transgender service members, which the Supreme Court has upheld. His Department of Health and Human Services in December proposed a sweeping set of new rules that would dramatically restrict access to gender-transition treatments for minors.

Mr. Trump has also tried to shift American culture in a more conservative direction. He has instructed the Smithsonian museums to root out what he calls anti-American propaganda in their exhibits. He took over the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, appointing a new board that tapped him as its chair, eliminating “woke” programming, and adding his name to the building’s exterior.

Justice as retribution?

The first year of this second Trump administration has challenged long-standing norms in the criminal justice system. Having criticized the justice system as unfairly targeting him, Mr. Trump appears to be trying to use the system in a similar fashion.

He has pushed for prosecutions of his political adversaries and issued pardons for allies. He has personally criticized lower court judges who ruled against his administration, while one of his top aides has railed against “judicial tyranny.” Presidents have traditionally refrained from direct criticism like this out of respect for the judiciary’s independence and to uphold public confidence in the courts. Amid Mr. Trump’s attacks, violent threats against federal judges rose.

In September, Mr. Trump called for two adversaries – former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James – to be prosecuted. Indictments quickly followed – against Mr. Comey on charges of lying to Congress, and against Ms. James on charges of mortgage fraud. Both deny the charges, and both cases have since been dismissed on procedural grounds. In January, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that he was being investigated for allegedly lying to Congress. The investigation is a pretext, Mr. Powell said, for not acquiescing to Mr. Trump’s demands to lower interest rates.

Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used the presidential pardon power to reward his supporters and potential allies. On his first day in office, he issued pardons to more than 1,500 people convicted or charged for their participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including hundreds charged with violent felonies.

A chain saw, but DOGE doesn’t meet its target

Remaking the federal bureaucracy began on President Trump’s first day in office, when he created the Department of Government Efficiency. Under the leadership of Mr. Trump’s billionaire benefactor Elon Musk, DOGE became synonymous with the president’s effort to dislodge what he calls the “deep state” and slash a “bloated” federal government. Mr. Musk set a goal of cutting $2 trillion from the country’s $7 trillion budget. By its own accounting, DOGE – which disbanded eight months ahead of schedule – only achieved about 10% of its cost-cutting goal; media investigations and conservative think tanks suggest the true savings were roughly half that, at best.

Still, cuts were widespread across the government. According to data released by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in January, more than 322,000 federal employees have left the government since January 2025, either through layoffs or after taking buyouts. But some agencies also rehired workers, either out of necessity or because of court rulings, leading to an overall workforce cut of roughly 220,000 employees, or a 10% reduction. This falls short of Mr. Trump’s stated goal of four reductions for every new hire, and is less than President Bill Clinton’s federal workforce cut of about 17% in the 1990s.

The cuts varied across the government, with some agencies and departments harder hit than others. The U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered almost entirely, the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities was cut by more than 50%, and the Department of Education by more than 40%. The Departments of the Treasury, Agriculture, State, and Health and Human Services each lost around 20% of their workforces. The Department of Defense, on the other hand, only fell by 8%.

The latest incident comes amid heightened tensions in the city in Minnesota state following the fatal shooting of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent earlier this month.

Demonstrators chanting against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol gathered near City Hall and quickly pressed the rival group toward a municipal building before forcing them to retreat to a nearby hotel.

Water balloons and snowballs were thrown at the right-wing demonstrators in weather that reached -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius) with the wind chill.

Police kept their distance and no serious injuries were reported.

Who is behind the pro-ICE rally?

Right-wing influencer Jake Lang, who organized the pro-ICE rally, later claimed on social media he was stabbed, but Minneapolis police said no report was filed and they received no injury complaints.

Lang is one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by US President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6, 2021, riot on the US Capitol. He faced multiple charges, including assaulting a police officer with a baseball bat.

The right-wing social media personality, who recently announced plans to run for US Senate in Florida, is known for making anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments.

Ahead of his appearance, Lang had posted on social media that he intended to ""burn a Quran"" on the steps of City Hall. It did not appear that he actually burnt a copy of the Muslim holy book.

Pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis have often targeted the Somali immigrant population in Minneapolis, most of whom ⁠are Muslim.

What are the anti-ICE protesters saying?

The anti-ICE rally was organized by the People's Action Coalition Against Trump.

Residents had vowed to blockade the neighborhood and not let the marchers into the area after pro-ICE protesters announced their plans to march to where many Somali immigrants live.

""We're out here to show Nazis and ICE and DHS and MAGA you are not welcome in Minneapolis,"" protester Luke Rimington told AP news agency. ""Stay out of our city, stay out of our state. Go home.""

Minnesota's leadership at odds with Trump

Trump has sent thousands of immigration agents into the Minneapolis area, citing alleged misuse of federal funds and singling out the state's Somali immigrant community.

Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz has mobilized the National Guard to support law enforcement in the state, officials said in a statement.

The state's Democratic leadership has clashed with the Trump administration over the crackdown, with the Justice Department opening an investigation into Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey saying they have impeded federal immigration enforcement through their public statements.

Meanwhile, a US judge restricted federal agents on Friday from interfering with peaceful protesters, even as Trump backed away from a threat of invoking the Insurrection Act over the demonstrations.

Karmel Mall in south Minneapolis contains more than a hundred small businesses in suites offering everything from clothing and food to insurance and accounting services. On Thursday, the noisy hallways inside lay quiet, save for occasional chatter between neighboring vendors. The smell of fried food still wafted from the bakeries, the central heating hummed and the sound of Quran recitation flowed quietly from some shops.

But many sellers sat alone in their clothing stores, waiting for the occasional customer to walk by. Everyone is afraid of federal immigration agents, business owners said. Sellers and customers, citizens and noncitizens. Some don’t bother opening shop because they aren’t expecting any customers.

“It’s been like this for three weeks now,” said Abdi Wahid, who works at his mom’s convenience store in the mall. “Everywhere it’s all been closed up, all the stores.”

Karmel Mall is an economic hub for the area’s Somali population, which is the largest in the U.S. But it also features housing, a mosque and Quran classes, serving as a robust community center for the area.

The economic impact of the Trump administration's “Operation Metro Surge” stretches beyond the Somali community: many immigrants are on edge, afraid to go to work or leave their homes amid the immigration crackdown.

But President Donald Trump has made the Somali community a special target of his deportation rhetoric after a recent government fraud case in Minnesota included a number of Somali defendants. Since December, Trump has made numerous jabs at the community, calling them “garbage” and saying “they contribute nothing.""

Wahid said early afternoons at the family business once meant 15 to 20 customers. These days, it’s tough to get one.

Wahid is a citizen, but he said the fear extends beyond just immigrants. Citizens are also scared of coming in, especially following the killing of Renee Good and the ICE raid at Roosevelt High School in south Minneapolis.

“I think that caused a lot of people to not even want to come,” he said, because they could be targeted “just because of their race.”

Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that law enforcement uses “reasonable suspicion” to make arrests under the fourth amendment.

“A person’s immigration status makes them a target for enforcement, not their skin color, race or ethnicity,” she said.

Upstairs, Bashir Garad runs Safari Travel & Accounting Services. Not only has the crackdown in Minneapolis meant he's lost almost all his customers, but his existing clients are cancelling upcoming trips because they’re worried they won’t be let back into the country.

“They see a lot of unlawful things going on in the city,"" he said. “They look at something bad, and then they think some bad things may happen to them.” The majority of his clients are East African, and nearly all are U.S. citizens. They still hesitate to travel.

“The government is not doing the right thing,” he said. “If there’s a criminal, there’s a criminal. Regardless, there are ways to find the criminal, but to marginalize the community’s name, and a whole people, that is unlawful.”

Ibrahim Dahiye, who sells electronics, said winter always used to be slow, “but now it’s totally different. No one comes here. All the stores are closed, few are open.”

Since the crackdown began, Dahiye said his business is down $20,000 monthly, and he’s now pooling funds to make rent.

He said he's lost most of his customers. His employees are too scared to come to work. He tapped his jacket pocket, saying he keeps his passport on him at all times.

“I don’t know what we can do,” Dahiye said. “We believe in Allah, but we can’t do anything.”",https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 09:58:35.061188

Five hours away at the Fort Benning U.S. Army base, near Columbus, ICE conducts more specialized tactical training for its elite units.
As ICE’s special response teams have expanded, so has its programming at the military base.
To train its sniper teams and special response groups, ICE has also inked deals with military contractors and obscure security firms.
“Target Down Group is honored to have provided training to them in order to assist them [sic] perform their duties.” The other ICE training contractors mentioned in this story did not respond to inquiries, nor did ICE.","Over the past six months, per federal procurement records reviewed by The Lever, a variety of shadowy private security and weapons firms have been tapped to provide firearms and combat training to Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) snipers and special response teams — several of which had never before received any federal contracts.

Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who killed 37-year-old legal observer Renee Good in Minnesota last week, was a 10-year veteran of an ICE special response team, the agency’s equivalent of a SWAT team. Good’s killing has sparked nationwide unrest and scrutiny of ICE’s increasingly violent tactics.

The firms that have won valuable contracts under the Trump administration to train officers like Ross include a Texas armed security company, a politically connected sniper firm in Florida, and a shadowy tactical training company in Virginia. One, Target Down Group, is owned by the brother of Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), as Wired reported in September.

These firms are among the many private entities, alongside private prison companies and social media surveillance firms, lining up for their cut of the Trump administration’s deportation spending blitz, which nearly tripled ICE’s annual budget with the enactment of the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill in July.

ICE’s workforce has ballooned by 120 percent since President Donald Trump’s inauguration amid an unprecedented hiring frenzy. The agency has slashed its training requirements and loosened hiring standards to hire as many new recruits as possible.

The new contracts with little-known companies that advertise training in “advanced techniques once exclusive to military protection units,” are another window into the ongoing militarization of ICE, a subagency of the Department of Homeland Security.

ICE has long deployed tanks and specialized tactical units in the course of immigration enforcement. But the agency is now spending more than ever before on munitions and military equipment to outfit its officers. The consequences of this spending spree, in the view of many people who have taken to the streets in Minneapolis and around the country, were seen in the killing of Good and, a day later, the shooting of two people during a traffic stop by ICE.

A Bloomberg report last month found that ICE spent nearly $140 million on weapons and ammunition in the final weeks of the 2025 fiscal year, buying from some vendors that had previously worked primarily with the Pentagon. (A single vendor, Lionheart Alliance, received a $49 million contract last month to provide tactical gear like ballistic helmets to ICE.)

Most new ICE recruits go through several weeks of routine training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia. Five hours away at the Fort Benning U.S. Army base, near Columbus, ICE conducts more specialized tactical training for its elite units. As ICE’s special response teams have expanded, so has its programming at the military base.

ICE also rents firing ranges around the country for its agents; ICE spends the second-highest amount of money on gun-range contracts in Minnesota, behind Texas.

ICE’s training methods at Fort Benning have come under scrutiny before. In 2019, under the first Trump administration, the agency inked a contract with military contractor Strategic Operations, Inc. to build out its “tactical operations complex” at the military base, including a “hyper realistic” replica of a home in Arizona and an apartment complex in Chicago in order to train its agents for supposed “urban warfare.”

Strategic Operations, Inc. received a subsequent $975,000 contract from ICE in 2024 for another “modular training structure” at Fort Benning, procurement records show.

Already, since Sept. 1, 2025, ICE has spent nearly $8 million on new equipment — including simulation rounds, junk cars, sniper training gear, and a model building — for various training courses, including for its tactical training at Fort Benning, per The Lever’s review of contracting records.

To train its sniper teams and special response groups, ICE has also inked deals with military contractors and obscure security firms.

In July, ICE awarded a first-time, $23,000 contract to Reticence Group LLC, a Texas-based armed security firm, for “specialized law enforcement pistol and rifle” training. The company, led by two SWAT officers in Texas, advertises that it offers “covert and confidential armed security contractors” for the private sector, as well as “firearms training that pushes limits.”

Another sole source contract in July for $35,000 was awarded to Path Consulting LLC, a Virginia Beach-based firm that, according to a contract notice, provides “[close-quarter combat] live fire training” and would help an ICE special response team “develop new standard operating procedures.”

Although the contract notice indicated that Path Consulting LLC had worked with ICE in the past, no other online procurement records mention its name. A call to a phone number linked to the company went unanswered.

In September, ICE issued a no-bid contract to Target Down Group, a company owned by Dan LaLota, the brother of Nick LaLota, who has served as the Republican U.S. Representative for New York’s 1st congressional district since 2023. (Dan LaLota denied his brother had any role in the award when asked by Wired in September.) Most of Target Down Group’s leadership are veterans of the U.S. special forces; the company’s president, Dan LaLota, is a former U.S. Marine.

The company’s website advertises “elite firearms instruction,” drawing from “years of experience as veterans from U.S. Military Special Operations.” In the Department of Homeland Security’s September justification for the no-bid contract, officials wrote that ICE had an “immediate requirement to procure precision fires and specialized observation capabilities for the national Special Response Team (SRT) sniper program.”

“The law enforcement officers of ICE have a very challenging job to conduct,” LaLota wrote in response to The Lever’s request for comment. “Target Down Group is honored to have provided training to them in order to assist them [sic] perform their duties.”

Kaden Rummler said in an interview that he was in agonizing pain and underwent an extensive six-hour surgery to his left eye after he was injured at a Jan. 9 protest over the fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis. Rummler said he has no depth perception and can no longer drive. Shards of metal and a nickel-sized piece of plastic remain lodged in his skull, his attorney said, and he is considering suing.

""It's going to affect every aspect of my life,"" said Rummler, who hopes to pursue a career in forestry.

A second demonstrator at the same protest outside a federal immigration building in Santa Ana told the Los Angeles Times he was also blinded in one eye by a projectile fired by federal agents. Britain Rodriguez, 31, said he was standing on steps outside the immigration building when he was struck in the face.

""I remember hitting the ground and feeling like my eye exploded in my head,"" Rodriguez told the newspaper.

The Department of Homeland Security didn't respond to questions from The Associated Press about what type of projectile was used. Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the agency, said in an emailed statement this week that the protesters were violent and that two officers were injured but didn't specify the extent of their injuries. DHS said one demonstrator was taken to the hospital with a cut. McLaughlin confirmed to the Times that was a reference to Rummler and called his injury claims ""absurd.""

Rummler has been charged with a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct. One of his fellow protesters was jailed for several days and has been charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer.

Rummler's attorney John Washington said doctors want to know whether the materials in the projectile could be toxic but have been unable to get answers from DHS. Washington said based on their preliminary investigation they believe it was a capsule made from metal and plastic containing pepper spray.

The injuries in California are the latest in a growing number of violent encounters between federal agents and community members during protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Federal immigration agents deployed to Minneapolis have used aggressive crowd-control tactics that have become a dominant concern after the deadly shooting of Renee Good.

In Santa Ana, hundreds of people marched in the streets on Jan. 9 to protest Good's killing. A smaller group later congregated outside the federal immigration building, shouting expletives through megaphones about ICE, according to video taken by OC Hawk, a group that films breaking news in Orange County.

The video shows a handful of officers in riot gear standing guard and urging demonstrators to move back. An orange cone is later seen rolling onto a plaza outside the building, and authorities begin firing crowd-control projectiles as they walk toward the crowd.

In the video, an officer is seen grabbing a protester by the arm and Rummler and a few others are seen stepping forward shouting in response. An officer then fires a crowd-control weapon, striking Rummler from several feet away. Rummler grabs his face and falls to the ground, and an officer grabs him by the shirt and drags him backward across the ground toward the building, the video shows. Later, video appears to show him face down on the ground being handcuffed.

Rummler said he joined the protest against immigration authorities because he can't stand seeing families torn from their homes. Despite his injuries, he said he would do it again.

""I refuse to sit around idly and watch that happen, and in 50 years, I would absolutely regret not trying to make a change,"" he said.

Washington, a civil rights lawyer, said his client could have been killed.

""Any officers with just the most basic training would know you don't shoot someone ever in the face with this, but let alone at point-blank range, and that's because it is a lethal weapon when used like that, and it very nearly was,"" Washington said.

Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of South Carolina, said a thorough investigation is needed into the reason for using a high level of force in that situation.

""I don't know of any projectile where you train to shoot at that close range,"" Alpert said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18381267_010925-kabc-raw-ice-protest-oc-vid-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:00.307280

Conclusion The Second Circuit’s disposition in Hinds v. Bondi reinforces two practical rules in immigration litigation.","1. Introduction

Hinds v. Bondi (2d Cir. Jan. 16, 2026) is a nonprecedential summary order reviewing a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) that (1) sustained removability and (2) affirmed the Immigration Judge’s (“IJ”) discretionary denial of cancellation of removal.

The petitioner, Devon Alexander Hinds, a lawful permanent resident and native and citizen of Barbados, pleaded guilty on July 15, 2021 to New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) (endangering the welfare of a child). DHS charged him as removable for a “crime of child abuse” under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The IJ ordered removal and denied cancellation of removal as a matter of discretion; the BIA affirmed.

The petition raised two core issues: (1) whether the child-endangerment conviction categorically fits the immigration “crime of child abuse” ground—especially after Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo ended Chevron deference; and (2) whether the agency committed reviewable legal error in denying cancellation, given its credibility and evidentiary findings.

2. Summary of the Opinion

Removability: The Second Circuit denied review. It held that it remains bound by prior circuit precedent treating New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) as categorically matching the BIA’s child-abuse definition, and that Loper Bright does not permit a panel to disregard those precedents. The court also noted an independent procedural barrier: Hinds did not raise his removability challenge to the BIA.

Cancellation of removal: The Second Circuit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that Hinds’s arguments attacked factfinding and the weighing of evidence—matters largely insulated from review by statute—rather than presenting a constitutional claim or colorable question of law.

3. Analysis

A. Precedents Cited

1) Child-abuse removability and post-Loper Bright stare decisis

Matthews v. Barr, 927 F.3d 606 (2d Cir. 2019): The court treated Matthews as controlling authority that a conviction under New York’s child-endangerment statute is a categorical match to the BIA’s definition of “child abuse.” Matthews also supplied the panel-rule framework: panels are bound by prior panels unless overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court.

Florez v. Holder, 779 F.3d 207 (2d Cir. 2015): Florez is the earlier decision adopting the BIA’s child-abuse definition in the context of New York Penal Law § 260.10(1), at least in part within a Chevron-deference framework. Hinds relied on Florez’s observation that it was “unlikely” the court would have adopted the BIA’s definition absent deference.

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024): The petitioner argued that because Loper Bright overruled Chevron, the circuit should stop deferring to the BIA’s definition and revisit Florez/Matthews. The panel rejected that move, emphasizing Loper Bright’s statement that it did “not call into question prior cases that relied on the Chevron framework.”

Garcia Pinach v. Bondi, 147 F.4th 117 (2d Cir. 2025): The opinion treated Garcia Pinach as the circuit’s post-Loper Bright instruction that “Loper Bright provides no basis for us to disregard” earlier Chevron-reliant circuit precedent. This case is the immediate bridge from Loper Bright’s general statement to the Second Circuit’s operational rule of adherence.

Ud Din v. Garland, 72 F.4th 411 (2d Cir. 2023): Cited for the issue-exhaustion principle—courts generally do not review issues not first presented to the agency. The panel used Ud Din to underscore that Hinds did not challenge removability before the BIA.

2) Cancellation-of-removal review limits and the law/fact line

Rodriguez v. Gonzales, 451 F.3d 60 (2d Cir. 2006): Used to frame the two-step structure of cancellation of removal: (i) statutory eligibility and (ii) discretionary decision whether relief is warranted.

Wilkinson v. Garland, 601 U.S. 209 (2024): Central to jurisdiction and standards. The court cited Wilkinson both for the proposition that review is limited to constitutional claims and questions of law, and for its taxonomy distinguishing reviewable “application of a statutory legal standard … to an established set of facts” from unreviewable factfinding like credibility determinations.

Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, 516 F.3d 35 (2d Cir. 2007): Cited for the idea that use of an “incorrect legal standard” can supply a reviewable question of law in cancellation cases.

Mendez v. Holder, 566 F.3d 316 (2d Cir. 2009): Cited for the principle that “ignoring or seriously mischaracteriz[ing]” important facts can present a reviewable legal error.

Penaranda Arevalo v. Bondi, 130 F.4th 325 (2d Cir. 2025): The court relied on Penaranda Arevalo to draw the jurisdictional line: it lacks jurisdiction to review “the agency’s weighing of the evidence, or the logic it employed in drawing inferences from it.”

3) Use of police reports/complaints and agency fact roles

Padmore v. Holder, 609 F.3d 62 (2d Cir. 2010): Invoked by Hinds to challenge reliance on a police report. The panel distinguished Padmore as a case about impermissible BIA fact-finding (not the IJ’s factfinding role).

In re Arreguin De Rodriguez, 21 I. & N. Dec. 38 (B.I.A. 1995): Cited by Hinds to argue arrest reports deserve little weight. The panel distinguished it: there, prosecution was declined and wrongdoing was denied; here, there was a conviction and not a complete denial.

Carcamo v. U.S. Dep't of Just., 498 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. 2007): The panel treated Carcamo as affirming that “police reports and complaints, even if containing hearsay and not a part of the formal record of conviction,” may be admitted for discretionary-relief determinations.

Argueta v. Holder, 617 F.3d 109 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting In re C-V-T, 22 I. & N. Dec. 7 (B.I.A 1998)): Cited for the proposition that “proof of genuine rehabilitation” is a relevant discretionary factor in the overall balancing test.

B. Legal Reasoning

1) Removability: exhaustion + binding precedent after Loper Bright

The court’s removability analysis proceeds on two reinforcing tracks.

Agency exhaustion: Because Hinds did not challenge removability in his BIA appeal, the court invoked Ud Din v. Garland for the general rule against reviewing issues not presented to the agency. The panel noted this as a threshold obstacle, though it also addressed the merits in the alternative (“assuming arguendo”).

Stare decisis despite Chevron’s demise: On the merits, the panel treated Florez v. Holder and Matthews v. Barr as binding circuit precedent establishing that New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) qualifies under the BIA’s “crime of child abuse” definition. Although Hinds argued Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo undermined those decisions by eliminating Chevron deference, the panel applied the circuit’s post-Loper Bright approach from Garcia Pinach v. Bondi: Loper Bright expressly disclaimed disturbing prior Chevron-based outcomes, so it does not provide an “intervening Supreme Court decision” sufficient to permit a panel to overrule prior circuit authority.

In practical terms, the decision announces a stability rule: in this circuit, the end of Chevron does not automatically reopen settled circuit constructions in immigration cases where the circuit previously deferred to the agency, absent a more specific Supreme Court signal or en banc reconsideration.

2) Cancellation of removal: jurisdictional limits and deference to IJ factfinding

For cancellation, the panel emphasized the statutory jurisdictional bar in 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), with the savings clause for constitutional and legal questions in § 1252(a)(2)(D). Citing Wilkinson v. Garland and Penaranda Arevalo v. Bondi, the panel treated credibility determinations, evidentiary weight, and inferential reasoning as unreviewable factual matters.

The panel then mapped Hinds’s arguments onto that law/fact line:

Credibility and the incident facts: The IJ found Hinds generally credible but not credible about the incident underlying the conviction, because his testimony conflicted with the victim’s sworn statement and other record evidence (including an order of protection). The court characterized this as classic IJ factfinding under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(4)(B), not legal error.

Police report reliance: The panel relied on Carcamo v. U.S. Dep't of Just. to conclude that police materials can be used in discretionary-relief adjudication. It also rejected the claim that the BIA engaged in improper factfinding, pointing to 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(d)(3)(i) (BIA reviews IJ factfinding only for clear error). Padmore v. Holder was distinguished on this basis.

Rehabilitation evidence: The IJ considered Hinds’s failure to complete sex offender counseling (even if not court-ordered) as part of the discretionary assessment, supported by Argueta v. Holder and In re C-V-T. The panel treated Hinds’s objections as disagreement with weighing and inference, not a legal-standard error under Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales or a serious mischaracterization under Mendez v. Holder.

Because Hinds did not identify a legal-standard mistake, a constitutionally cognizable defect, or a serious record distortion, the court held it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed that portion of the petition.

C. Impact

Post-Loper Bright continuity in the Second Circuit: Even after Chevron’s overruling, litigants challenging long-settled circuit outcomes that incorporated Chevron deference face a steep barrier. This order—tracking Garcia Pinach v. Bondi—signals that only an en banc decision or a more directly on-point Supreme Court ruling is likely to dislodge existing circuit immigration precedent.

Strategic premium on agency issue preservation: The court’s reliance on Ud Din v. Garland reinforces that arguments (including new legal theories prompted by intervening Supreme Court decisions) should be raised to the BIA to avoid forfeiture/exhaustion problems.

Narrow channel for cancellation-of-removal appellate review: The decision exemplifies the constrained review permitted by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and (D) after Wilkinson v. Garland: framing disputes as “legal questions” will fail if the substance is disagreement with credibility calls, evidentiary weight, or inferences.

Use of police statements in discretionary relief: By leaning on Carcamo v. U.S. Dep't of Just., the order underscores that sworn victim statements and police documents can significantly influence discretionary relief outcomes even if they include hearsay—so long as used for discretionary assessment rather than categorical removability.

4. Complex Concepts Simplified

“Categorical match”: A method of deciding whether a state conviction fits a federal immigration removal category by looking at the statute’s elements (what the law requires for conviction), not the person’s specific conduct. Here, prior cases held New York Penal Law § 260.10(1) matches the BIA’s “child abuse” concept.

Chevron deference and Loper Bright: Chevron required courts (in many circumstances) to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo ended that doctrine going forward, but—crucially for this case—the Supreme Court said it was not reopening past cases that used Chevron. The Second Circuit treats that as a reason to keep following its earlier decisions unless an en banc court or the Supreme Court specifically changes the rule.

Issue exhaustion: Generally, you must present an argument to the agency (here, the BIA) before asking a federal court to review it. The court cited this as a reason it “generally” will not review removability arguments not raised before the BIA.

Discretionary relief vs. eligibility: Even if someone is legally eligible for cancellation of removal, the IJ can still deny it as a matter of discretion after weighing positive and negative factors (rehabilitation, seriousness of conduct, family ties, etc.).

Jurisdiction limits and “questions of law”: Congress largely barred courts from second-guessing discretionary denials like cancellation, except for constitutional claims and legal questions. Courts may review legal-standard mistakes, but not ordinary fact disputes like who is more credible or how much weight to give a police statement.

IJ vs. BIA fact roles: The IJ is the factfinder. The BIA generally may not find new facts; it reviews the IJ’s factfinding for “clear error.” That distinction is why Padmore v. Holder (BIA factfinding) did not help Hinds where the IJ made the factual determinations.

5. Conclusion

The Second Circuit’s disposition in Hinds v. Bondi reinforces two practical rules in immigration litigation. First, within the circuit, Loper Bright does not authorize panels to depart from prior Chevron-influenced circuit holdings such as Florez v. Holder and Matthews v. Barr; absent en banc or Supreme Court overruling, those decisions continue to govern. Second, challenges to the discretionary denial of cancellation of removal must identify a genuine legal or constitutional defect; disputes over credibility, evidentiary weight, and factual inferences—like the agency’s reliance on a victim’s sworn police statement—are typically outside the court’s jurisdiction.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:21.776558

’cause that seems to appear the most in the most number of Supreme Court opinions these days.
But the Supreme Court has been understandably nervous about second guessing when the President says something is an emergency because, uh, the Supreme Court doesn’t know anything about foreign affairs.
The, uh, Supreme Court, I’m gonna forget the name of this particular order ’cause there were a series of removal related Supreme Court orders, but in the, the Supreme Court made very, very clear in an unrelated case about removal from another agency that they thought the rule would be different for the Fed.","Hi everyone. Good evening. My name is Bella Ryb and I’m the executive director of the Constitutional Law Center here at Stanford. And it is my pleasure to welcome you all to our annual Supreme Court roundup and preview. Tonight we have three fabulous panelists to talk us through the most important Supreme Court cases of last term and this term, and I’m excited to introduce them.

First, we have our very own Easha Anand. She is an assistant professor and the co-director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic here at Stanford Law School, where she represents employees, non-citizens, consumers, unions, criminal defendants, and civil rights plaintiffs before the United States Supreme Court. Recent victories in cases Easha has briefed and argued at the Supreme Court, include wind on behalf of a long distance truck driver tricked into buying a product that contained a federally controlled substance, a jeweler jailed after police fabricated evidence against him, and, in a unanimous opinion, a whistleblower fired after reporting violations of securities regulations.

Prior to joining the SLS faculty, Professor Anand was a Supreme Court and appellate counsel at the MacArthur Justice Center, where she litigated police, excessive force, prison condition, wrongful conviction, and other criminal defense and civil rights cases in state and federal courts of appeal around the country.

Easha received her JD from the University of California Berkeley School of Law, and clerked for former Judge Paul J. Watford on the Ninth Circuit and for Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Jeremy Feigenbaum is the Solicitor General of New Jersey, a role he has held since July 2020. Jeremy is the state’s first Solicitor General, a role from which he helps coordinate the New Jersey Attorney General’s involvement in matters before the United States Supreme Court, federal Circuit Courts, and the New Jersey Supreme Court, and provides assistance to the department in cases involving significant constitutional and appellate issues.

Jeremy previously served as counsel in the office of the New Jersey Attorney General before joining the office of the Attorney General. Jeremy was an associate at Kirkland and Ellis in New York. He has also served as an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law. He clerked for Judge William Fletcher of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and Justice Atlanta Kagan of the United States Supreme Court. He graduated from Brown University and Harvard Law School.

Last but not least. Colleen Sinzdak is a partner in the Washington DC office of Millibank LLP, and a member of the firm’s Litigation and Arbitration group.

She has also briefed well over 100 Supreme Court cases. She clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts of the United States Supreme Court. With that, I’ll hand it over to our panelists. Thank you.

Thank you Bella. Can you guys hear me in the back? Is this better? Better? Yeah. Okay. Uh, thank you Bella. Thanks to the Constitutional Law Center. Uh, thank you all for being here. It is such a treat to be here with Jeremy and Colleen. So thank you two from flying for flying out. Um, so those of you who have been here in previous years kind of know the drill.

We’ll each take a few minutes to kind of put a theme or a high level thought about the court on the table. Then we’ll kind of each run through a case from last term that’s significant and a case from this upcoming term that’s significant. Um, and one of us will kind of take point on table setting and explaining what the case is about.

Uh, but I hope that both of you will feel free to kind of chime in with questions and comments as we go along. Um, so with that, maybe Colleen, I’ll turn it over to you to start, if you don’t mind. Um, uh. Court at this moment an idea or thought you wanna kind of put on the table or an observation you wanna share?

I’m sorry. I’ll figure out the microphone before I talk again. Uh, can people hear me? Great. Okay.

Hello? Oh, can you hear me now? Okay, great. Um, uh, I was always too loud as a child, so wearing microphones makes me very self-conscious. Um, anyway, what I was, what I started out saying is that I, I think that the court, that, that there’s a lot to be praised about the court right now. I think this is an incredibly difficult time in our country and I think that the court is functioning and, um, I’m not, I’m not going to say well, but I actually, I think that in a lot of ways it is actually functioning quite well.

So at a time when Congress is not, uh, legislating and the, um, president is doing something, but maybe not exactly what the, um, constitution contemplates in all respects, uh, I think that the Supreme Court is functioning as, um, the Constitution contemplates. I think that it is, it is deciding cases and I think that it is, um, deciding cases and, and, and talking, uh, and, and demonstrating how people can, um, speak to one another with very different views in government in a way that the other branches perhaps are not.

So I think if you, uh, go to an oral argument, um, you would be surprised, uh, because if you read in the newspapers, the, um, court is depicted as this, uh, partisan beast. Um. If you read the Supreme Court decision, sometimes there’s quite a lot of, uh, rhetoric from, um, both sides. If you go to oral argument, you get a very, um, civilized, thoughtful argument about the law.

It’s not just a bunch of people saying what their policy preferences are. It’s not a bunch of people yelling at each other or, um, name calling. It’s actually people trying to have a serious discussion about, um, about the cases and about the principles. And it’s sort of, um, encouraging in this time to see, uh, one area of our government continuing to function.

So that’s what I wanna put on this, on the table. I recognize it’s not the most popular, but that I, I think we, we we can focus, uh, on what the Supreme Court is doing right. And just as a little end piece to say why I wanna focus on this is I think it’s really important to focus on what the Supreme Court is doing, right?

Because I think we’re in a time when the legitimacy of courts is being questioned and the need to adhere to judicial decrees is being questioned. And when we, uh, constantly focus on what’s wrong with the Supreme Court and wrong with courts, I think it actually makes it easier to, to push them aside and to say, why bother? Why bother with them? Anyway, so, um, focusing on the good. There you go.

Can I ask, I’m curious, the last kind of piece you put on the table about the kind of legitimacy of the court and the likelihood of following judicial decrees. What are your thoughts about kind of the Supreme Court’s role in that? Because I think, um, I maybe among others was a little bit surprised to see, for instance, the recent opinion by Justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh kind of chastising some of the lower courts. I think I’ve also been surprised to see that in general, um, the Supreme Court majorities have not taken to task behavior.

Um, that does call into question the legitimacy of the decrees, right? So in, you know, for instance, JGD, the kind of Judge Boasberg place case where he says, turn the planes around. Um, and there’s a bunch of, uh, conduct that the dissenters call out as shady. Justice Barrett joins everything but the part characterizing the shady conduct, for instance.

Um, uh, and so I’m curious if you think the court has a role either in buttressing the lower courts, or in calling out some of the behavior that comes close to skirting these sorts of judicial decrees, um, as part of its effort to kind of retain a legitimacy. I mean, I, I think, you know, what you, to, to, to focus on one specific issue.

I think Justice Barrett not joining that particular part was actually an attempt to stay out of what I think she may have perceived as a very, a political dispute. Um, I, I think something that has been tremendously. Useful to me is that, uh, many of my friends are of, of the conservative persuasion. Um, and I think that the way that the Judge Boasberg episode happened seemed very clearly one way.

And then I talked to some incredibly, I think, intelligent principled people who saw it in a different, in a different way. And I think there was some, like how you saw it, maybe did depend more on politics than I had at, at first appreciated. And so I, I think that some of the, like not doing that is trying not to engage.

And I think there are serious questions to be asked about, like, you know, at what point does not engaging is that, you know, abdicating your, your important role in protecting the judiciary and the, the judicial institution. But I, I think that that, that, that’s where that’s coming from.

Um, Jeremy, can I turn it over to you? Any theme, topic, opinion about the Court you wanna put on the table?

Yeah. Theme and topic. Um, first of all, thank you to all the same folks for having us. I know all three of us are excited to be doing this. I think the theme, okay, I might have to move. Oh yeah, I have to move that up. Like Colleen, I also was told I was too loud throughout my life and I am in fact too loud. So this is going to be an unusual experience, um, acoustic of this rule. Yeah, no, no, it’s great.

Um, two thoughts. First is like everything in American society right now, it’s impossible this year to talk about the Supreme Court without talking about the president. The president, President Trump is sort of like the defining figure for our government, for our institutions, for our courts right now. And like all the oxygen in all of our conversations about anything relating to governance, it’s impossible to have a conversation about SCOTUS and review this year without talking about the president and the policies that they’re specifically responding to coming out of the executive branch.

So what that means in a big way is that this was the year of the emergency docket. Some people call it the shadow docket. Some people call it the interim orders docket. I’ll use emergency docket. ’cause that seems to appear the most in the most number of Supreme Court opinions these days. Um, it is the year of the emergency docket, and I think it is the year that the emergency docket proved it’s here to stay. So we can have a big interesting debate about whether the emergency docket is a good idea or whether it’s a bad idea. I happen to fall in a really unhelpful perspective on the, it’s here to stay. It can’t be never. It can’t be always, and we have to figure out how to live with it and when to live with it and what role it’s going to play.

It can’t be never, because there are seismic decisions coming out of individual district courts that prevent a policy, uh, a president from adopting a landmark policy. It can’t be always because if the emergency docket has problems that I think everyone acknowledges, rushed decision making, a lack of oral argument, a lack of detailed briefing, when you don’t have the full consideration, you get from full merits briefing and for full oral argument, you can revert to the mean, you get decisions that don’t fully explain themselves in this posture.

And so I admit some sympathies to the members of the court who basically say, we recognize that this has costs, but it can’t be that we never do this because there are some decisions coming out from the lower courts, from both the district courts and the court of appeals that require our intervention.

And so if it’s here, if we have to live with it, if it’s here to stay, how do we improve its procedural regularity? And I think the court, and I think a lot of the sort of commentators are around the court n. It’s fine to talk about whether it’s good or bad, but it’s time to acknowledge it’s here and it’s time to acknowledge that we should try to figure out what are the best ways to improve it.

When should they have oral argument? What are the benefits of oral argument on these emergency cases? When should they just grant certiorari and turn the case in an expedited way into a merits case right out the gate? They’re trying different options across the board. So we will talk about individual cases later, but in the birthright case, they set argument in the Cook case, the, um, Lisa Cook fed, uh, fed board member case. They set argument in the slaughter case involving the firing and FTC official, they granted cert in most cases. They’re just issuing orders. When should they just issue orders? When should they turn these cases into full cases? How should they think about these cases knowing that we live in a new world with a pretty small merits docket and a pretty big emergency docket.

And that’s gonna define in many ways the success of the court and how people grapple with the court. And so it’s time to pivot ourselves into living with it. Um.

Maybe I’ll actually use my time to ask you a follow up question, which is about, um, my prediction that actually we’re gonna see more oral argument. So here’s my thesis and I’ll be curious to hear both your reactions. So, um, we know there’s sort of one fairly consistent vote actually for briefing an oral argument, which is Justice Kavanaugh, right? So he is, um, dating back to a case called Labrador v. Doe, which was about Idaho’s ban on gender affirming care. He writes his concurrence, that’s sort of like, you know, I think we should be setting argument a lot more. These, these sort of interim orders have a lock in effect, um, and there’s no reason we can’t do it. And then actually somewhat consistently in the Trump cases, right? So in a A RP, that’s the Third Alien Enemies Act case that sort of turn the buses around in Texas case, in boil the case about firing the kind of purportedly independent head of the consumer product safety commission, both cases, he writes these concurrences saying, I think we should set this for argument one vote.

I’ve kind of understood why to date a bunch of the other justices haven’t wanted to, to be the remaining votes. It’s four votes to grant cert. We got one, the three liberals. Maybe you thought at some point that you could limit the kind of bad law from your perspective that’s being made. Right. The state decisions, um, for a long time were considered not precedential. Right? It was not so long ago that Justices, Alito and Kavanaugh in a case called Merrill v. Milligan about, um, which was one of these redistricting cases where the Supreme Court granted a stay. Um, they would literally write a concurrence that says like, please no one mistake this for precedent. To reiterate, this opinion is not precedential, right?

And so maybe you’re one of the three liberals you think, I don’t wanna force a grant ’cause that’ll convert this from an emergency docket, uh, order that is not precedential. To read it, not precedential, um, to something that that’s got real force that’s in the US reports. Um, you know, we’ve heard skepticism from some of the other justices.

Justice Gorsuch in the TikTok case, which was one of these kind of expedited cases, writes, you know, because it was so expedited, I can’t profess the kind of certainty I would like to have. Justice Barrett, um, in a case that where the court granted cert early in the lifecycle of a case, um, about, um, Idaho’s abortion ban, when the court has to dismiss the case, she writes, you know, facts on the ground are changing, I think it was a bad idea to do this early. So if you’re the liberals, if you are Justice Gorsuch, who wants to have this kind of certainty, if you’re Justice Barrett, who’s worried about facts on the ground changing, I think I understand why to date you have not wanted to be votes 2, 3, 4 for a cert grant, full argument and briefing.

Um. That’s changed, right? So in recent months we’ve seen, uh, case after case where the court has treated prior emergency docket orders as squarely precedential. Um, so for instance, in the kind of removal cases, we saw kind of an initial case, um, about the firing of the, uh, MSPB and NLRB heads, uh, where the court doesn’t even really reach the merits, right?

It sort of says, uh, we think that the government’s likely to prevail on part of the analysis, but we don’t have any opinion about whether this falls into an exception. And yet the follow-on cases come up and they’re just citing back to that case. Um, there’s a series of cases about whether funding challenges go to district court or have to go to the court of federal claims.

Um, the Supreme Court not only cites back to emergency docket opinions and their reasoning, but in one instance, justices, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh even chastised the lower courts for not kind of squarely following that earlier precedent. So I guess my, my prediction is. Why hold back now? I think that we’re gonna see a lot more oral argument ’cause whatever your worries are about the difference between these emergency docket orders and what’s in the US reports, um, whether it’s because of bad law or certainty or whatever other values you have, it seems like that difference is getting erased.

So I’m curious if, if you think that’s right as a predictive matter or that pendulum’s gonna not gonna swing the other way.

I, I share Easha’s prediction that we’re likely to see more cases where they grant either cert immediately upon the emergency application or set additional briefing and argument.

I don’t know. I’m ready to say we’ll see it in sort of like the modal way that they handle these emergency applications. But I think we’re gonna see significantly more. We’re already seeing an increased number of this term. We’re already seeing. In two cases this year, they’ve already granted in these removal cases, one, they granted right from the emergency application for the removal of an FTC member. And then in the Lisa Cook case I was mentioning before, they set that for additional briefing and argument. So I think we’re gonna see the emergency docket as a way to tee up full briefing and oral argument a little more. I have to say, I think partially because of what Easha is identifying, I think in some respects it’s a welcome development.

If these orders are going to be precedential and if they’re going to bind the country for a couple of years before the US Supreme Court returns to the issue on the merits, then they’re effectively final. A great example is what we call the agency dismantling cases. I’m gonna try to avoid using like pejorative language. I’ve litigated some number of these cases, so I may have some strong feelings at various times. I’m sure there’s a better framing than agency dismantling cases. I think you can probably call them reduction in force cases instead. So call them RF cases, call them agency dismantling cases. Call them what you will. But the, the downsizing considerably of federal agencies. And those were consistently decided by emergency order without more detailed briefing, without more detailed oral argument, uh, and without detailed opinions. And that’s gonna last for a couple years. And it means that some agencies have lost 40% of all employees, 50% of all employees or more.

And so if that has happened and years go by, you can never refill those agencies. So if that’s gonna be effectively the final decision for the country on the validity of the rif slash downsizing slash dismantling of these agencies, it would be good. For the US Supreme Court to be confronted with the full panoply of arguments for the merits and demerits of that position and an oral argument to grapple more with the nuance.

Because one thing I found, and I think this goes to Colleen’s point earlier, oral argument does force courts to grapple more with nuance. It might not change the actual outcome of the bottom line vote, but it forces them to think about how far their rule goes. It forces them to talk to each other in open court about how far different sorts of rules go.

And when you add a little more procedural regularity, you might end up producing opinions that have a little more caveat, a little more, carve out a little more recognition of what makes that case particularly hard. And so it might not even change all the outcomes, but we’ll have more detail, more answers for why certain decisions were reached and may reached, and maybe a recognition on what the kind of cases are that would be different so that all of us as litigants, as states, as federal actors, as nonprofits as, as, uh, law school clinics will have more certainty about why decision X came out a certain way. So trial courts can know how best to follow it, and parties can know how best to litigate that precedent in the next case. So maybe speaking of a high profile case that migrated from the emergency docket to the merits docket, um,

Jeremy, uh, you argued the CASA case about universal injunctions. It was a masterful argument. If anyone has not listened to it yet, um, you offered to recap that case and tell us what you think it, it portends.

Okay. I am hopelessly biased about this case, so I will do everything in my power to check my biases about this case. Uh, the New York Times had a great title, uh, talking about this case that said the case about birthright citizenship in parentheses, but is really about nationwide injunctions.

And I thought that was like the perfect way to encapsulate it because so. Trump v. CASA is ostensibly a case, but is in no way a case about birthright citizenship itself, although it’s certainly looming in the background for this case. The first day of Trump two, President Trump issued an executive order redefining birthright citizenship, and a number of lawsuits were filed by states, by nonprofit organizations and by individuals and putative classes of individuals representing birthright citizens themselves.

And from my perspective, given, uh, 150 years of Supreme Court precedent and a very long, uh, tradition under the Fourteenth Amendment and predating the Fourteenth Amendment of what citizenship has always meant in this country, we all want our cases. And the United States, uh, perhaps recognizing the strength of our merits position did something very different in this case than it did in all the other cases.

In all, in basically every other case, not literally every other case, but close to every other case that it’s taken up to the US Supreme Court in the emergency docket in the last seven months, eight. Nine months, whatever, whatever amount of time it’s been. 10 years. Yeah. Dog months. Um, it, it, it took up the merits and all the other cases, but in this case, it conspicuously said Supreme Court, we are not here to talk to you about birthright citizenship. We are here to talk to you about a different problem. The fact that these individual trial courts across the country have all blocked the president across the nation from adopting his birthright citizenship executive order. And they made a case that this was a particularly good vehicle for the US Supreme Court to consider this question that had been bothering them for some number of years because it came from a presidential executive order.

I’m gonna explain later why that potentially made it a useful vehicle for them. Um, and the Supreme Court treated it very differently than the way it was treating the other applications. Set it for oral argument and invited additional amicus briefing. My one procedural comment here is that these were early days, and this is one of the reasons I’m so bullish on additional briefing in these cases too.

These were early days where it wasn’t yet fully known that, uh, a filing by the president and the US Solicitor General’s office to the US Supreme Court would almost certainly get emergency relief if they agreed with him on the particular argument he was making. And so a lot of that brief has discussions about why on this posture it’s too soon for the Supreme Court to come in.

It has a lot of stuff about the equities of why the public interest or irreparable harm does not support the, the US Supreme Court stepping in at this stage. Now, it’s quite clear when you’re filing these sorts of filings in response to a, an emergency application by the president, you should de-emphasize those points and you should be just emphasizing why ultimately you think that the president does not have the right case on the merits because they have shown that they think the equities in these cases very much warrant early stepping in and allowing the president to.

Um, federal law as the president understands it if they ultimately agree with him. And so, um, we probably briefed seven pages on the question of universal injunctions, which is not the amount of briefing you would want as a party for heading into a US Supreme Court dis, uh, case about the propriety of universal injunctions and incredibly difficult legal question.

I do not think the birthright citizenship merits question is the hardest question I’ve ever had to litigate as a lawyer. But the universal injunctions question is a genuinely difficult question that has long vexed administrations of both presidential parties. And so ultimately we had argument and in my view, because of the increased procedural regularity that we saw in the emergency docket, in that case, we got a much more nuanced opinion that came outta the US Supreme Court.

It did not issue a decision that matched what New Jersey and the other states were ultimately asking for squarely, which was to specifically affirm our nationwide injunction. Instead, the US Supreme Court for the first time, as a majority said that, um, the statutes that govern, uh, jurisdiction in the courts, the equity power of the courts does not actually let, uh, these sorts of orders be issued.

But it had a ton of carve outs, a ton of carve outs, and from my perspective, the import or lack thereof of a case like Trump v. CASA is gonna completely rise or fall with how those questions get answered in the future. So, Trump v. CASA, big headline day of is the universal injunction is over.

But actually there’s tons of questions they note in the opinion that say maybe there are other opportunities to get nationwide relief. So they say sometimes, maybe even the states in this case still have an opportunity to get nationwide relief if we show we need it to protect ourselves from harm.

People move across borders when they’re citizens or not citizens. It harms us in a lot of ways when we’re dealing with our own punitive citizens. Maybe this is a case that meets that. They also said in cases where you’re challenging agency actions as distinct from presidential actions, a separate law, the Administrative Procedures Act may or may not.

They reserve the question entirely allow for this kind of universal relief across the board. So maybe presidential eos are exempt from this, but there’s a whole different statute with a whole different potential legal tradition that applies when an agency is acting instead. And also they said, and it shouldn’t be too hard, maybe to get class actions against a lot of these federal policies and how one answers those three questions, how easy it is for states to sue and when they need these sorts of broad remedies for complete relief.

Whether and when the administrative procedures act separately allows for this sort of universal relief and how easy it is to get class actions against federal policies will either make Trump v. CASA an incredibly seismic, hugely important case about the role of the federal government vis-a-vis everyone else, or a case that seemed a lot bigger than it was until everyone pivoted in the kind of filings that they filed going forward.

And so from my perspective, Trump v. CASA was arguably the biggest case of the term last term, and also arguably not going to make a huge difference on the ground. And I think anyone who tells you they know the answer to that, to how the Court’s gonna answer those three questions in the future is a little bit unknowable.

And all I’ll say is, before CASA there were three nationwide injunctions against birthright citizenship. And after CASA, there were four nationwide injunctions against birthright citizenship. And the United States did not take the injunctions back up knowing I think that they’d gotten everything that they were gonna get out of that case.

And so from my perspective, I think it is a really interesting, meaningful case about how the Supreme Court sees the role of courts writ large and sees its role vis-a-vis the lower courts, if there’s gonna be a big conflict between the executive and the judiciary, the Supreme Court’s making clear it wants to be the one deciding what the judiciary’s posture is, vis-a-vis the executive as much as possible.

It’s why we have an emergency docket, and it’s been so active. It’s why CASA reflects a certain conception about the role of different courts authority and a specific statement that the Supreme Court’s opinions will always be followed by the executive, a concession that the United States truly made during oral argument.

So it’s very much a story about the Supreme Court, making sure it has the authority over the judiciary for these inter branch conflicts, but what that means on the ground for litigation going forward. I, to me, is a big open question.

Yeah, I guess. I guess that is my question from it. I have to say, I read the opinion and I thought. I don’t think this is actually different from prevailing law, uh, in the sense that it seemed to just be saying, you know, remedies should be limited to the parties. And sometimes because of the nature of the particular legal dispute to truly remedy the party’s injury, you’re going to have to give wide relief. And I thought that was the law. Um, so I guess like what, what was added by uh, CASA?

So I think CASA did something very important, I think, um, and important has no value judgment in it. But I think that this part was important, which is I think that before CASA District Courts were all over the place about what were the basis for nationwide relief. So some district courts and in our view, the district court, in the case I had been litigating, thought that nationwide relief, you look for relief for the parties and nationwide relief makes sense here because the parties needed it and Justice Barrett for the majority leaves open that that might have been right and remands the question and says, maybe actually in this case, we’re just not deciding one way or the other. Maybe in this case a nationwide injunction is fine. You did have a series of decisions across administrations and the district courts that were issuing these decisions would vary, but the idea was the same, which would say, for example, uniformity in immigration law is important and therefore a nationwide injunction must follow.

And I think that way of reasoning of saying, like, uniformity of this area of law or of this right is enough to justify the injunction. That’s the kind of stuff I think CASA‘s taking off the table. And so I think CASA itself cites different district court opinions that were in front of it. There were three different district courts that went in front of it and it is saying, one of you looked like you used a test that works.

We’re leaving if you applied it right, but it looks like you used a test like Colleen is describing. That’s fair. Two of you look to us and the dissent disagrees with the reading of the district courts, but what matters is what the majority thought. The majority says. Two of you, you actually just thought like a uniformity or right sort of analysis is good enough to justify nationwide relief and that we’re taking off the table.

Uh, Colleen, I’m gonna kick it to you next. I’m actually excited you’re gonna talk about this case. ’cause I think it’s a challenge to your collegiality theme, maybe a little bit. Uh, that’s the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor. Um, I’ll turn this on.

Uh, yes. Look, no one is collegial all the time. Um, we have to look on balance. Uh. Uh, yeah, I, I, I find Mahmoud v. Taylor a really a tricky case. So just to give you the facts briefly, in case, um, you are not aware of it, this is the case in which the Supreme Court appended the pages of children’s books to its, uh, decision. Um, the actual question presented was whether Montgomery County Public Schools, which is actually the public school system that my children attend.

Um, yep. I’m a graduate of Montgomery County.

Oh, really? Well, we’ll talk later about where, but, um, anyway, uh, it’s about whether Montgomery County Public Schools was permitted to have a program in which they, um, they, uh, included books. And it’s so hard to talk about the facts of this case because the Def Defense dissent and the majority actually disagree strongly on the facts.

So I’m trying to kind of present a, a, a neutral, a neutral, uh, dis, uh, account, but books featuring LGBTQ+ characters arguably, um, encouraging the view that, um, that an LGBTQ lifestyle is okay, exists, um, a great thing and everybody should have to be it. Uh, it really, it kind of depends, um, on how you see these, uh, these particular children’s books.

Um, but Montgomery County introduces them into the curriculum. It originally offers an opt-out, and this is very important. It originally says, parents, if you do not want your children to participate when these books are being taught, you can let us know. And that opt-out was consistent with an opt-out that Montgomery County has for, I didn’t actually know this, but human sexuality classes.

Um, you can opt out, uh, you can say you don’t want your kids to, to, to, to be there for that instruction as well. Then Montgomery County, um, decided that that was not administrable, that the opt-out wasn’t working because too many people were asking for opt-outs. And unlike in the, um, in the human sexuality, uh, lessons, which were a discreet part of the curriculum, where you could say like, you know, next week we’re doing this, do you want your kids to sit out?

They were just using the, the whole point of this program was to just integrate the books into the curriculum throughout. So Montgomery County does away with the opt-out, a number of parents who do not want their children to be exposed to these books object. Uh, and they say that the teachings in the book, uh, that the books are being used to teach values that are contrary to their religion because they are teaching values that celebrate the LGBTQ+ lifestyle that celebrate the idea that, um, humans can have different, uh, can, can, can have different genders from the gender with which they’re born. Did I just use gender wrong? Okay, good. Um, alright, so, uh, um, so they, uh, object these v the this and they say that it is a burden, a First Amendment burden on their rights to, um, force their children to be, uh, getting public education, uh, with it without an opt out.

So the case comes to the Supreme Court, and interestingly, I really do think this is as I was an English major and a high school English teacher. And this is one of the few cases that seems to turn, to turn heavily on, um, on, on the interpretation, the, uh, of, of children’s books because Justice Alito writes this majority opinion saying that, yes, of course this is a First Amendment burden, an intolerable First Amendment burden, because he reads these children’s books as, um, ipar as as, as requiring, uh, as a message of like, uh, celebrating the LGBTQ plus lifestyle, celebrating, uh, the idea that you can have different genders over the course of your lifetime. And that, and, and he reads the instructive material accompanying these texts as, as, as, as essentially requiring teachers to say that these are values that our community has. Um.

Justice Sotomayor in dissent has a completely different reading of these children’s books. So her understanding of the children’s books is that these are books that simply treat LGBTQ+ people as existing, that they are just having char, they’re just characters. So, you know, there’s a, the, I, I’m gonna try to be brief on this, but the maj, the story that’s kind of at the, at the centerpiece is about a little girl who’s upset because her uncle is getting married. And Justice Alito reads this story as a sort of coy reference to the little girl being upset that her uncle is getting married because she’s upset that he is a gay man, marrying another man. And the lesson is she shouldn’t be upset. She should learn to celebrate it. And at the end, she does in fact celebrate the wedding. And Justice Alito reads this story as a story of a, a child learning, you should celebrate gay marriage.

I have to tell you, as a former English teacher, I actually think it’s just a story about a little girl who’s upset ’cause her beloved uncle is now maybe gonna spend more time with his husband and not with her. And I think the story, I think it would’ve been exactly the same if it was, uh, a, um, woman that he was marrying. Um, that so, so that story, I think Justice Sotomayor has the better of the, uh, literary interpretation.

There are other stories where I actually think that Justice Alito has the better of the literary interpretation, where I think it is hard to read the stories as, as saying anything other than like, these are values that we should have. Um, you know, books are great because you can have lots and lots of different interpretations of them.

Um, but it’s really tough when you have a Supreme Court case that turns on this because, um, I don’t quite know what the holding of Mahmoud really is at the end of the day because I think. There’s one way of reading Justice Alito’s opinion to just say like, look, you can’t have a bunch of lessons in school where you tell everyone that they have to be happy about gay marriage.

Like, right. Like that’s one way of understanding it. And, and I think at the end of the day, we could probably all say like, okay, that’s, that’s pretty, pretty reasonable. Just like, you know, you can’t have a bunch of lessons at school saying that everybody has to believe that Jesus Christ was our Lord and Savior.

You know, like, fine, fine, that’s what’s going on. But if you read it actually as him saying, you know, people have to be able to opt out of being exposed to books that have, uh, LGBTQ+ people in it, that’s a much bigger statement. And that would be a decision that has much, much bigger effects. You know, again, as a former English teacher, I taught lots of books.

I was teaching in high school. I taught lots of books that had a lot of, um, characters of all different sorts in them that I’m sure you could have lots of objections to the messages of those books and the, and what was going on. And like, you know, the point is they, they, they just kind of existed and we were using them and we were talking about them and we were having open discussions and I’m genuinely not sure reading Mahmoud whether I would have to allow opt-outs for a lot of the books that I was teaching, what my responsibilities would be.

And, and that’s, that’s really tough. So I find Mahmoud an interesting and really tough case. I actually looked online to see the California Public Schools has put out, um, public school system has put out guidance on Mahmoud that kind of says what I said I just said, which is like, we don’t really know what it means. Don’t do anything dramatic because no one’s quite sure exactly what that decision is going to stand for in the end.

Uh, well, I, I have a lot of thoughts about the case as a Montgomery County Public School graduate, as the owner of both Uncle Bobby’s Wedding and Pride Parade. I’ve read them both to my kid.

Yeah. Um, uh, but in the interest of kind of getting through a few more cases before we turn over to Q&A, um, and we, I’ll bring up the rear and talk a little bit about another blockbuster case from last term, uh, United States v. Skrmetti. So I’ll be brief about the background of this case, ’cause I think it’s one that’s familiar to a lot of people.

Um, about half the states have passed partial or total bans on gender affirming care for minors. This is treatment that’s lifesaving for a lot of children and their families. Um, and so both United States, this is during the Biden administration and the individual families represented by the ACLU sue to enjoin one of these bans in Tennessee.

Um, uh, Sixth Circuit upholds it so they lose the Sixth Circuit. They seek certiorari. Quick note at the outset. So both the United States and the ACLU seek certiorari, um, and the United States petition contains one question. It asks just does this law violate the equal protection clause? The ACLU petition has two different questions.

It’s the equal protection clause piece, and then it’s also a question about the substantive due process rights of the parents. Um, I think sort of, uh, puzzlingly to a lot of observers, the Supreme Court just takes the United States petition and not the ACLU petition puzzlingly because, um, at that point it was clear that there was some chance that the administration was going to change, right?

The United States position on this issue was going to change. We were in an election year, and, uh, lo and behold, come January, um, uh, the Trump administration comes in and says, we think actually Tennessee’s law is totally constitutional. Puzzling also because, you know, the Supreme Court has been raring, or at least some of the justices have been raring, um, to deal with this kind of substantive due process parents’ rights question. So we see, um, justices, uh, Alito and Thomas in a couple of different cases, writing these dissents from denial of certiorari. So cases where the Supreme Court says, we’re not taking this case, these two justices say, would like to take this case, um, about that issue. They, the cases that they’re interested in arise from, um, school districts that have a policy that says, um, uh, if a child doesn’t want you to, you don’t tell their parents what pronouns they’re using at school.

And, uh, this has been challenged on the kind of substantive due, substantive due process, parents’ rights front. So that’s at the outset of the case. Okay. So what are the arguments that get made within this equal Protection Clause framework? Um, so remember, right, 1L Con Law, um, uh, most laws just get what’s called rational basis review, right? So laws just dripping with animus or wholly arbitrary. We trust the democratic process. Certain laws that classify on so-called suspect characteristics, things like race, sex, national origin, get what’s called heightened scrutiny. So you have to look a little bit more into whether there’s an actual problem being solved and that this law is kind of a good way to do it, because otherwise you’re worried about kind of rank discrimination.

So challengers make two sets of arguments, right? They say first this bill classifies on the basis of sex. If you were assigned male at birth and you want to take, um, uh, uh, puberty blockers or hormone therapy to deepen your voice or get facial hair, totally okay? If you are assigned female at birth and you wanna take the same drugs, uh, to deepen your voice or to develop facial hair, not okay. Under Tennessee’s law, that’s a sex classification.

Second, they say this bill also classifies, uh, people on the basis of their transgender status, right? Um. And, uh, even though the Supreme Court has not ruled on this yet, that is a suspect characteristic akin to, um, uh, uh, sex or race or these other, uh, characteristics that trigger heightened scrutiny.

So after argument, um, was clear the challenges were gonna lose, and the question was, how are they gonna lose? So possible path number one, which would’ve been kinda the best case scenario for the challengers, would have been the court holding or accepting for the sake of argument that this law did classify in the basis of sex or transgender status, um, and doing the kind of heightened scrutiny analysis, right? And the court could have said, um, again, in this world where the challengers are losing, look, this is about minors. It’s about medical care. It’s about from what our perspective is still evolving science, uh, and therefore this law is okay, even under heightened scrutiny. And that would’ve been the best possible outcome, I think, for the challengers, because it would’ve been devastating for a lot of families on the ground today. It would make clear that these sorts of laws are subject to some sort of scrutiny, and it would leave open the possibility that if the medical consensus changed these sorts of laws could be revisited.

The Court didn’t take that off ramp. I think it took the second least bad option from the challenger’s perspective, um, which was to basically say, um, uh, look, this law does not classify in either of those bases. We don’t have to address whether transgender status gets this kind of heightened protection. Um, instead we’re gonna say, this law classifies on the basis of medical condition.

Right? So they say neither a boy nor a girl can get, uh, puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria. Transgender boy cannot get puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria, but can get puberty blockers to treat premature puberty. Um, uh, I’d sort of commend folks to the def descent written by my former boss, justice Meyer, which I think takes apart this logic, um, uh, pretty effectively.

Um, the path is in terms of practical consequences, I think still far worse than the first outcome, right? It puts, um, state could pass a law outlawing this kind of treatment for adults and, uh, uh, that would classify in the basis of medical condition. And so it be subject only to rational basis review. Um, but it would, it’s not as bad for the challengers as the path the three of the Justices, justices, Barrett, Alito, and Thomas.

So Barrett, again, people always talk about kind of the 3, 3, 3 court and sort of put her squarely in the middle. Um, on this issue at least, she’s certainly not in the center of the court. It’s the Chief Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh that take this kind of middle path. Um. The path that Justice Barrett articulates says I would address right now the question of whether transgender status is suspect, um, and I would say no. So I would say laws that classify on the basis of transgender status don’t trigger any form of heightened scrutiny. Um, now the majority reserves that question, so who knows where it ends up? Um, uh, but at least for now, I would, I would assess this as the court picked. The second, the second least, the, the, the middle path among the worst in the world where the challenges are losing. The court picked the middle path, um, uh, despite three justices urging them to go further.

Um, with that, I, I guess I’m hoping we can transition to talking about the term coming up, um, blockbuster case in the docket, uh, tariff’s case that Colleen is helping to spearhead litigation about. Um, so we’re very lucky to have you here talking about the case. Tell us what’s going on and what your predictions are, without compromising any client con confidences.

Yes. So I am working on the litigation, so I’m only talking about publicly available information. Um, I am on the team of, uh, people representing a number of small businesses who sued to challenge, uh, President Trump’s Liberation Day, uh, tariffs.

Those were the tariffs that were imposed worldwide, um, on a number of countries, uh, in percentages between 10% and 50% increases. On, on, actually, I think just on, yes, on tariffs, uh, that on the existing tariffs. Um, President Trump introduced these tariffs in, in saying like, this is a, we are overhauling, uh, the tariff system and the American economy. This is going to be a massive change. Um, and the executive orders that he used to impose these new tariffs explained that there have been persistent large trade deficits, which were harming American manufacturing, um, harming Americans, um, national security readiness, uh, in terms of, of our dependence on foreign, uh, military supplies and, um, that, and, and, and overall just creating an emergency and an extraordinary and unusual threat.

Now, he had to say that this was an emergency and extraordinary and unusual threat because he is imposing these tariffs under IEEPA, which is an emergency law, uh, that is for, that allows the president to use a range of economic sanctions, um, in situations that are both a declared emergency and an extraordinary and unusual threat.

So IEEPA has been used in the past, for example, to impose embargoes. Um, the most famous instance of its use was in the Iran, Iran hostage crisis in the seventies when, um, the United States or the President set up a, uh, actually a whole claim claims tribunal system under IEEPA for dealing with, um, for dealing with, uh, Iranian assets, um, in, as part of an effort to get the Iranian hostage, the, sorry to get the hostages back. Um, so IEEPA is an emergency statute. One of the emergency powers that it gives the president is the authority to regulate importation and exportation. President Trump and the government interpret that phrase, that, that phrase to mean, uh, tariffs.

The idea, the, their argument goes regulate importation. What does that mean? Well, one of the most obvious ways to regulate importation is to impose tariffs. And, um, yes, the statute does not in any other way refer to tariffs. There are no limits, for example, on, uh, the tariff authority. There’s no minimums, there’s no none of that.

But, um, the idea is there’s lots of other major powers being given under IEEPA, including, and this is undisputed, the authority to impose embargoes on trade altogether. And so the, the theory goes regulate importation is a broad power for use in these emergency situations. The challengers allege a number of things, a number of problems with this.

One of the problems is that regulate is a word that is actually used over, uh, a thousand times in the US code, and it is not used to refer to taxation. So you all remember from back in the day, by back in the day here, I mean the American Revolution. Um, we fought, uh, a whole war about taxation and therefore, um, the framers treated taxation differently from regulation.

So the very first clause that imposes that, that grants powers to Congress, grants Congress, the power to tax and the power to impose duties, which are like tariffs, right? So, um, separately you have to go down three more clauses before you get to the power to regulate. Okay? So separate, separate regulation is separate from taxing.

It’s separate from tariffs. So a statute that says regulate importation and the views of the challengers does, uh, including me, does not mean, um, does not give the, the authority to impose, uh, tariffs. Uh, there’s a number oth of other arguments if you, even if you don’t buy that one, is that this is not an emergency or an extraordinary and unusual threat.

I think that actually on a kind of common sense level, a lot of people have that intuition. While like the president needs broad powers and emergencies, maybe he needs the, the power to impose tariffs. But, you know, if he’s saying there’s a large and persistent trade deficit, maybe that’s not really an emergency.

But the Supreme Court has been understandably nervous about second guessing when the President says something is an emergency because, uh, the Supreme Court doesn’t know anything about foreign affairs. They’re wisely in this one area, aware of their own, um, their own fallibility. Uh, they’re also really afraid about telling, um, district courts that they can, uh, second guess the president’s emergency authorities, because, you know, in a legitimate emergency, if the president needs to do something, what you would not want is some, is a district court immediately stepping in and, and, and barring it.

And again, you have to, to imagine a, a, a genuine emergency. So that’s probably the most common sense argument, but probably has practical problems. We also point to a range of other specific tariff statutes that control here. And, um, if you’re law students, you’ve probably learned many times about the specific controls, the general canon.

So even if you think that IEEPA gives some general tariff authority, the more specific statutes, um, that that control in these particular circumstances and have actual limits on the tariff power, those should control. Plus, if you just look at those tariff statutes and they’re all specific, and if you look at any tariff statute in the, in the statute books, you’re gonna see specific limits put on it.

It starts to suggest that maybe IEEPA, this general statute that doesn’t refer to tariffs and doesn’t in fact put any limits on, isn’t really be, shouldn’t really be used for tariffs. And then finally, the nondelegation doctrine. That great doctrine that the, was probably, is probably dead, but who knows, um, which says that you, the, the, that Congress cannot give away all of its legislative authority.

The argument is if you interpret IEEPA to give away this tariff power, um, without any limits, then you’re basically giving the president the power to impose tariffs and taxes, which is Congress’s authority alone. So that would be a non delegation problem, the government’s main response, other than to say, come on, regulate importation.

That sounds like tariffs is to say this is foreign affairs. In the foreign affairs context, we have always interpreted the statutes broadly. We’ve always thought that the president should enjoy broad powers and you, this shouldn’t be any different. I expect to kind of hear, uh, a lot of sounding on the, you know, implicit sort of, this is Trump derangement syndrome.

Don’t look at, don’t, don’t kind of make a decision that’s going to impose limits. On, uh, the president, the, the, the powers the president needs in real emergencies based on your view that this president is abusing it in this particular circumstance. But I am hoping that, you know, we can, um, carry the day with plain text.

And then I should also mention major questions, doctrine, the idea that like no president has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs before. And, um, the court has been very fond of late of saying that Congress doesn’t hide, uh, elephants in mousehole. And, um, this really looks like, um, an elephant in a mouse hole if you find the power to over to rewrite the entire current economy, um, in this statute that’s supposed to be for foreign affairs emergencies.

I mean, one question I have for you, Colleen, on this because, uh, it’s what you brought up right at the end there where I was wondering if major questions was gonna come up in the discussion. I mean, one interesting thing going on at the court right now is what is the major questions, doctrine, when do you apply it?

And Justice Kavanaugh has, I think, the most interesting recent concurrence. On when he thinks the major questions doctrine should apply and when it should not, and when he thinks Congress would naturally think it is giving the executive untrammeled power and when you would think that they wouldn’t think they’re giving the executive that sort of sweeping power and trying to key the major questions doctrine to substantive areas of law.

And it seems like in his archetype, taxing would be the kind of thing that would be a major question because that’s not the sort of thing you would think that the executive can do in a plenary sense without Congress, but foreign policy and interrelationships with other nations is Brett Kavanaugh’s, number one thing that he thinks the executive is being given broad grants of authority to do so.

I’m curious how you think, you mentioned major questions, but I’m curious how you think tariffs will or will not teach us things about how to think about the major questions doctrine going forward. Yeah, I mean I do think that not Justice Gorsuch, who, I think Justice Gorsuch has a view of the major questions doctrine as a functionally nondelegation doctrine.

So it’s kind of, it would be unconstitutional for, um, Congress to grant large amounts of power. So if we think that like a statute is granting these large amounts of power, it’s as a constitutional matter. It just can’t, so we won’t, you know, the statute is unconstitutional to the extent it does that. I think that the, the, the kind of Justice, Justice Barrett, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice, and the Chief all think of major questions as a statutory interpretation, canon as, as, as exactly as you’re describing it.

Kind of like where would it make sense to think that Congress delegated tons of power? And in that sense, you know, I, I, I think that that’s the role it, it has to play here. And it does depend whether they are thinking of this as a taxing case or a foreign affairs case, and whether they really buy into the idea that, um.

Even when we’re talking about taxes, if you’re talking about taxes on imports, whether that actually, like, it doesn’t even matter that it’s taxing because, because foreign affairs taxes still implicate that broader power. So Curtiss-Wright, which, um, I recently heard someone describe as Curtiss-the government is always right– in, uh, foreign affairs context. Curtiss actually refers to tariffs in part of, uh, as part of that. And so, you know, I think it depends, to me it’s very obvious that, that because the first clause is giving Congress that power and is expressly referring to tariffs, not just taxes, not just, you know, domestic, the domestic realm. It has to be that Congress wouldn’t just give away those, that power.

But, you know, the Supreme Court has disagreed with me before.

Um, uh, well, thank you. Uh, we will all be tracking that case.

Uh, Jeremy, do you wanna take a minute and talk about the, the, I guess the, the couple of cases about presidential removals? And I’ll flag for folks that we’re gonna cut off wherever we are at 6:10. I have been told we are cutting things off so we have time for questions.So start to think about what you wanna ask because we’re gonna, uh, have at least 20 minutes of questions.

Yes, we are most interested in your questions and it will make for fun back and forth. We’ll be really off the cuff. Uh, two thoughts.

So one, as you’ve already discovered, I am your friendly neighborhood emergency docket man, and so I’m back to the emergency docket and back to the new ways to think about the emergency docket.

Thankfully, for the first time since I’ve spoken, I’m not talking about a case that I have litigated in any way. So I think, I think biases are less likely to creep in here. So, uh, there are two thus far, major removal cases at the US Supreme Court for this term. There is the question in Trump v. Slaughter about whether the president can remove members of the Federal Trade Commission, and that squarely presents an issue that the US Supreme Court has been thinking about taking about for a very long time. Maybe not since the American Revolution, but you know, back in a more recent day, it has been thinking about whether and when to overrule the seminal decision Humphrey’s Executor that allows for removal protections for members of multi-member boards in the executive branch.

And, uh, I I, I’m probably not gonna like fully predict everything that happens in all of these cases, but there are, you know, if we think of like four major, uh, Trump cases so far at SCOTUS are about to be at scotus, I think tariffs is hard to predict. We’ll talk about Lisa Cook, which is hard to predict. I do not think the other two are that hard to predict.

Um, I think the Trump administration is very clearly going to lose birthright citizenship on the merits and very clearly going to win Trump v. Slaughter. And I don’t think I get any points for those predictions ’cause I think basically everyone agrees. So on Trump v. Slaughter, I think it shows two interesting things.

One, this US Supreme Court has been very willing to overrule precedents that it thinks are sufficiently wrong, and that the main check on whether and when it will overrule precedents is whether it grants cert in the first place. Because once it grants cert, most of the other stare decisis factors have become overcome by the sense that the decision was truly wrong enough.

And so I think there are a number of precedents likely to be safe for some extended period of time because the court is unlikely to wanna return to the question and just isn’t gonna grant cert. But once the court grants cert on a question of whether to overrule it and you can feel confident that they strongly wouldn’t have decided it the first way, I don’t think the other starry decisis factors in any way hold them back from making that decision.

And so once they granted Trump v. Slaughter, and they granted certiorari before judgment. I think the writing is very clearly on the wall for how that one’s gonna come out. I will also say from a procedural perspective, it makes total sense that it was a, uh, before judgment in the way that they granted here, because there’s binding us Supreme Court precedent, no one else is able to hold that Humphrey’s Executor is no longer good law. So if someone’s going to hold Humphrey’s Executor is no longer good law. It has to be the US Supreme Court. They have to take it, they have to confront the question. Again. We can have a, you can have years of discussion about the merits and, and the costs of stare decisis.

I’m not gonna run through all of it here, but I think it is very clear that they’ve taken this for one reason and one reason only. I think the Cook case is very different. I think the Cook case is very interesting, very challenging and shows the way advocacy is shifting on the emergency docket, even in just the months since January and February of this year.

So the Cook case is interesting because this is about removals for the Fed and. The, uh, Supreme Court, I’m gonna forget the name of this particular order ’cause there were a series of removal related Supreme Court orders, but in the, the Supreme Court made very, very clear in an unrelated case about removal from another agency that they thought the rule would be different for the Fed.

They just said it, no one was debating it. And that particular case, and that’s how you know, the Supreme Court really cares about this. And the, the dissent makes fun of it and sort of calls it a bespoke exception for the Fed. But I strongly doubt the dissent. Once, uh, Slaughter comes out the other way, I strongly doubt the dissent will resist going along with the bespoke exception for the Fed.

Um, it’s, it’s a device for pointing out the problems with the decision in slaughter rather than, uh, a desire for the liberals to allow for removals from the, uh, Fed Governors. And it’s interesting because Advocacy’s really shifted as that case has gone on to Easha’s earlier point about, uh, shifts in cases on the ground, the Trump administration as in birth.

Has decided not to like, stake the end-all, be-all fight on whether there’s like plenary removal, vis-a-vis the Fed. Instead, the United States says we are accepting for these purposes. We can only remove Fed Governors for cause, but we think we have for cause here. And also we basically think you have to be completely deferential when we think there’s cause which gets you kind of to the same place, which is if you could ever review the president finding their cause, it’s not exactly what you would normally think of in the corporate setting as for cause removal obviously.

Um, but they say we’ll accept that it’s for cause removal. Then the challengers respond and the DC circuit and a concurring opinion by Judge Garcia accepts that. Okay, well if you’re accepting that, then we have a narrower thought too. Yes, we have an argument that you can review for cause even when the president finds it.

And that, um, to Colleen’s point about tariffs earlier, you should review the president’s fact finding, which is something the court has been openly quite nervous about. For many years. So yes, you can do that, but also you don’t have to, you can just say, well, if you need fact finding, then you need process.

Because if the president’s gonna find facts, you need to give process to the person that’s being fired to explain why he’s about to make the wrong factual call. And so everyone in interesting ways recognizes there’s a really sensitive area for the court. It’s clear both parties are not sure how it’s ultimately gonna come out.

And so the United States is making its narrowing pivot and the challengers are responding with their narrowing pivot. And it shows the way the emergency docket, everyone realizes you’re gonna get some seismic holdings. You’d better if you’re gonna try to win out in an area, you know, the court’s uncomfortable with, give them the path they think they can do the least damage in an area they’re nervous about.

And that’s, I think, what Cook is showing us in real time. Uh, so interesting. I agree. That’s a, uh, I’m very, very curious to see how that argument goes. Um. I thought I’d just take the five minutes at the end to review one of the huge cases on the docket that is not a “versus Trump” case. Um, but that is gonna have pretty seismic implications for kind of the way politics is done in America.

Um, so Louisiana v. Callais starts as a pretty traditional kind of section two of a Voting Rights Act case. So section two, uh, prohibits election practices that result in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote on account of race. Um, layered atop that over the past few generations, courts have kind of constructed a series of tests to figure out when this is happening, specifically in the redistricting context, cases to come to court. The challengers typically say some version of, uh, when you were drawing your sort of congressional district, let’s say. Um, you either tried to pack a bunch of, uh, voters of a particular race into one district, so they couldn’t have influence over more than one congressional representative.

Or you tried to what’s called crack the voters. That is you try to spread them out across so many districts that they don’t have sufficient electoral influence anywhere to elect the representatives of their choice. Um, and the court has said that the way you make out these claims is you first do what’s called the jingles factors, which is basically figure out, uh, whether there’s kind of racially polarized block voting.

Then you look at what are called the senate report factors, which is sort of a totality of the circumstances inquiry, where you look at kind of a history of discrimination, um, uh, uh, through to kind of the use of racial appeals and current politics. Um, so there’s this whole kind of apparatus that’s grown up around this, this kind of super statute.

Uh, so Louisiana loses one of these section two cases and so it has to redraw its map when it redraws the map. Non-black voters, that’s sort of the term that they use for themselves, come into court and say the redraw map, right? The one that was drawn to comply with section two of the Voting Rights Act over indexes on race and therefore violates the equal protection clause and comes to the court, court hears argument, and then somewhat ominously over the summer.

They ask for reargument ominously because the court basically does this in two situations. Situation one is where there’s a four four court. So, um, you know, after Justice Scalia passed, there was an interim before Justice Gorsuch got on the court. They ordered some rearguments when Justice Gorsuch got on the court, uh uh, because they were tied four-four, and he’d be the swing vote.

Sometimes it doesn’t for that reason. The other reason it does it is because it, uh, has a theory, uh, often a, a theory that no one is raising in the litigation that it really, really, uh, thinks is the right one. Uh, so Citizens United famous example of reargument, right? Um, so, uh, question is re argued on basically whether the Voting Rights Act, uh, violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.

Um, dominant theme and argument. Um, I think it’s dominant. It could just be the Justice Kavanaugh asked this question like seven different times, so it seemed very dominant. But I think the dominant theme and argument was, um, basically the question of expiration date. So Court sort of says, uh, uh, you know, in cases like Shelby County about a different provision of the Voting Rights Act, uh, kind of says, you know, this is relying on stereotypes about what the South was like many generations ago, so it’s unconstitutional.

In Students for Fair Admissions, which was a case that struck down the affirmative action programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. Um, uh, oral argument is dominated by this talk of, you know, 23 years ago there was an opinion that said that in 25 years, we hope the race, the use of race conscious admissions will end.

Um, so Justice Kavanaugh kinda asks over and over again, both the NAACP Legal Defense fund lawyer and the various folks saying that this is unconstitutional. Like what’s the end date? Um, and you know, the NAACP lawyer basically says three things. She says, um, first look, section two, this whole analysis. Um, it relies on facts on the ground today.

So. It will sunset when racially polarized block voting sunsets, right? The first thing you have to show is this prima facie case. People are segregated on the basis of race, on our, uh, uh, that minority voters are unable to elect the candidate of their choice. So when that stops happening, this will sunset automatically.

Second thing she says is, look, when you prove the violation of section two of the Voting Rights Act, all you’ve said is that this map is no good. Section two doesn’t tell us anything about what kind of map the state has to draw in response to that. Um, and so, you know, a state can redraw a map without taking race into account just so long as it doesn’t engage in these forbidden practices to try to dilute the votes of minority voters.

Um, uh, and the third thing she says is, look, Students for Fair Admissions is quite different because they’re the compelling government interest, right? The reason you were allowed to be race conscious in the admissions process was this idea of diversity in the class. Here, the basis on which we’re allowing race consciousness in some instances has to do with remedying specific racial discrimination.

And even in Students for Fair Admissions, the Supreme Court told us that that’s okay, that’s an okay use of race. Um, so we shall see what happens. I think that the, the stakes of this are quite big. So whether or not you think that section two of the Voting Rights Act is a good idea, whatever you think of the court’s current redistricting jurisprudence, um, the way that, you know, our House of Representatives is comprised turns to some extent on this case.

Uh, so an argument, the NAACP pointed out that every uh, uh, black elected representative, including the justices of the Louisiana Supreme Court in the state of Louisiana comes from a district that was drawn specifically to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Right. Some analysts say that we’re talking about 19 seats that would shift from Democratic to Republican control.

If, uh, voting Rights Act compliance wasn’t mandated in the same way, um, and, you know, in a lot of years that’s control of the house. So, uh, even though this is not a case about the president, I think it’s one we should all kind of be watching because it will have big implications for our politics and for the upcoming elections, whatever the outcome with that ballot day would do.

Okay. On time. Okay. With that, we’ll turn it over to the audience to, for questions, please line up at these two microphones and then we can go one by one.

Come on down.

Thank you so much for being here today. Very interesting. The question I have relates to the tariffs, uh, case and in particular, the justification of the administration is partly based on emergency and partially. Based upon the traditional deference, I guess, of the courts to the presidency as, for example, in Curtiss-Wright.

But as an emergency, it’s something that’s kind of dragged out and the whole process is taking a long time. And part of this is also based upon negotiations with other countries. And of course the treaty power is one that’s given to the president as well, but subject to the ratification of Congress. So my question is, in this context, if the Supreme Court seems to be inclined to disapprove, either in part or in large measure what the administration has done, what do you assess the probability that they might stay the action of the Supreme Court, uh, stay the action of the court for a period of time to permit Congress to ratify the decisions of the presidents as, for example, uh, the Supreme Court did in 1982 in the Northern Pipeline case about the constitutionality of, uh, judicial powers, uh, in, in that case.

Yeah, that, that’s a, that’s a great question. And I have to say that, um, remedy is not, uh, an issue that we had focused on very much, in part because, um, just, just of a, the procedural of a procedural court, the federal circuit, which re, which issued the only merits decision we have from a court of appeals, it agreed with us on the merits, but it remanded on remedy because it thought actually that, uh, the nationwide injunction in our case was too broad.

I don’t know why. They just used logic like no uniformity is required. Um, anyway, uh, and actually no one has litigated. Um, what is a really a question that, that is on the minds of a lot of people, which is what about refunds? So the, the short answer is that’s not really, you know, um, that just has not really been a piece of the case.

Certainly, I think one, like the government would, would they consider that, uh, you know. I, the a 45 day stay, I don’t know. Nobody so far has been talking about it. Um, the, the government actually said they would pay refunds. Um, uh, I, I think, you know, it’s not a part of the public case, so maybe I’ll, I’ll let you two.

Yeah, I’ll jump in. Just to say, you know, in the, in the birthright context, it was super interesting. One of the things that the US represented in that case was they would, if they won, be willing to wait 30 days to avoid chaos on the ground. And you could see the US Supreme Court asking similar questions.

Like in casa last term, we said our, uh, our opinion would not take effect for 30 days, so things could play out in the ground. As Professor Goldsmith has pointed out, that is a universal injunction, even from the Supreme Court. Uh, it doesn’t have more authority to issue universal injunctions than others.

So when it said it won’t take effect on representation for 30 days, it was a form of universal injunction, but you could easily see given how disruptive, like if, if all tariffs went away tomorrow with, with no warning, you, you could see the court having some practical concerns. I think it’s quite possible that the US has promised to pay refunds to show that it would be disruptive to take away their authority at this point.

Um, so it wouldn’t shock me to see some questions and argument trying to explore what would happen in that case, although that argument has so many. Hard merits questions that everyone is going to get that using your, your scarce argument, time and oxygen on, how long it should take after is something that probably only comes up late in the argument ’cause they’re gonna have their work cut out for them and asking all the many questions on the many topics Colleen had to work through in just summarizing the case while we’re waiting for the next question, which I hope is forthcoming, oh, we’ve got, okay, go ahead.

Sorry, I was hiding. I didn’t mean to, uh, I have a question about CASA and I almost think you shouldn’t answer it happily. Absolutely. Not necessarily for like confidentiality purposes, but because like, I feel like, you know, it, it, it’s, I just, I was in the position of having, uh, to read that through and I find that opinion endlessly confusing and I’m not quite sure what’s going on and I’m interested in the role that history is playing in it, those sorts of things. But I was wondering, you, uh, you mentioned one, like a bunch of caveats that need to get answered in the next few years that are gonna determine its scope. And I was thinking about how many, uh, equitable decisions aren’t enforced under the judicial act too. Like, uh, one of them is that, uh, like for example, the Clayton Act allows you to enforce, uh, antitrust statutes, uh, like outside of the jurisdiction of, of, of the particular district court judge.

And I wanted to know what the fact that those, uh, other statutes don’t seem to be affected by stat, uh, by CASA, seem to tell us about CASA, about it’s, uh, I think one thing that’s dubious about cost is it feels as if it feels like it’s a solution for this presidency or for the particular moment in front of us.

And I think that tension between, uh, its ruling on that statute and on others, um, might lend themselves to that sort of suspicion. But I know, I probably know what you think about CASA is what I’m trying to say, or what the other people, I want all the people to answer. I, I guess what I’m trying to say, uh, feel cold called.

You wanna go first and we can uh, I, I, I’ll go first briefly. Which, which is to say I actually think that the timing in the case in which the Supreme Court chose to issue this ruling has all sorts of complications because of what the merits is of birthright and how quickly they did it into the new administration.

But I don’t think this came just from Justices thinking this as a bespoke solution for President Trump. Like Justices Gorsuch and Barrett and Thomas were on record during the Biden years, that they had problems with these reliefs now query why there weren’t more orders in that time, if that reflected their view.

But they were on record previously. And I think, I think Colleen said something about this earlier, but I think they do sometimes think that the challengers are so focused on Trump and they’re trying to write for the presidency for all time. And so I think they think that the cost opinion is not a solution for Trump.

I think they think it is the correct response to the like institution of the executive writ large. Um, but I think a really important point you’re making, which is totally correct, and this this really did come up at oral argument, is that they know there are statutes that adopt universal forms of relief.

The administrative procedures act, certain types of, um, nationwide review schemes, uh, the Clayton Act, et cetera. And they specifically and Conspicuously wanted to avoid that because if you’re gonna strike down those statutes only come up if you’re gonna make a holding on Article three that federal courts lack this authority constitutionally rather than under the Judiciary Act of 1789.

But if you do that, Justice Kavanaugh can’t sign on because he is on record with an opinion that you can do this under the Administrative Procedures Act. So he can’t agree with the article three constitutional holding, and no one knows what the chief thinks. And so it is quite possible there isn’t a majority of even five.

Certainly there isn’t of six. To say that the constitution forecloses it, so then you just have to work with the statute in front of you and you have to leave for another day. Those other questions, so it’s a little bit path dependent in that they can’t resolve the APA question. They have a footnote saying, we’re not gonna get to the APA question.

But if you’re not gonna solve the APA question, you can’t decide it as a constitutional matter. So you have to leave other statutes for another day. But I’m curious for other folks takes on this too. Uh, yes. I’m gonna totally plagiarize one of my colleagues, Mila Sohoni, who is sort of, as Jeremy knows, one of kind of foremost experts on this.

Um, her take on this is actually that casa is gonna be, it’s gonna not have major repercussions for universal injections specifically. It’s actually gonna have its ripple effects outside of the context of universal injunctions. Part of it is sort of exactly what you’re saying, which is like. Um, I think for a long time everyone sort of said like, well, if it says equitable remedies and statutes, equity changes over time, that’s the nature of equity.

So, of course, like that means basically whatever courts want and the, and the Supreme Court seems to say like, as a textual interpretation matter, when a statute says equity, it means equity at the time of statute is passed. Um, it matters particularly under the kind of the judiciary act, um, because Mila kind of points out that, uh, Ex Parte Young right?

That, or sort of what Ex Parte Young has come to be known as. So Ex Parte Young is sort of the case that says you can, you can’t sue a state directly, but you can sue an official in the state in their official capacity and get them to do something. There is a tradition of what were called anti-suit injunctions.

So that is, you could sue the individual and say, you can’t prosecute me under this law, or you can’t do x to me. There isn’t an equitable tradition of, for instance, you have to take an affirmative step. You have to desegregate the schools, for instance, right. Um, and so if we think that, uh, CASA really means what it says, the equitable powers given to the court are frozen, uh, based on what equitable remedies were available at the time the statute was passed.

Um, I think you have a lot of issues in a lot of other areas, partly under other statutes, but even under the Judiciary Act, um, you know, like a lot of the business of civil rights litigation of the last two generations has centered on the assumption that a set of remedies are available to courts and they’re kind of equitable powers That CASA really calls into question.

I mean, I, I, I, I definitely do not think this is a bespoke solution. I think that like the, I mean, you know, having worked in the government for the last six years, you know, like, it doesn’t matter, the administration, they never like, uh, universal injunctions and I, and, and so I, I, I, I, I think this doesn’t have that valence.

Um, the other piece that I’d say is like, I think that that opinion’s hard to follow too. I’ll say that. Um, I, because of my knee-jerk government attorney reaction, I was like, obviously, uh, universal injunctions are, they’re going down. And my husband, um, who’s also a lawyer, uh, and I were in the car, he was also a government lawyer, and we were, we’re talking about this and we’re like, yeah, they’re going down.

And then we start talking about like, oh, but what about this? Oh, well, they’d have to be okay in that situation. And then we’re like, well, and what about in there? We’re like, yeah. Then they’d be okay. Then they’d be okay. And we just kept coming up with. Why they couldn’t actually have the blanket rule. And at the end of the conversation we were both like, Ooh, this is kind of like hard.

And I kind of wonder if the Supreme Court went through the same process where they thought like, finally we have a vehicle and we’re just gonna say no more universal injunctions. And then, you know, these, these doubts crept in. And, and, and it became really hard to write a clean opinion because it’s just a messy, messy issue.

So about that, and just to go to my theme, that only happens because of procedural regularity. You get full briefing on the question, you grapple with what’s hard. You hear all argument. You ask all these questions, you write an opinion and then write an opinion. And you’re like, God, this is hard. And, and I, well, Mike, small counter on that is that I think we have to be careful about fake procedural irregularity.

Like I do think when you have a full oral argument. On an, in an emergency posture, often what you are still getting is, is briefing that was written in like two weeks and, uh, judicial clerks who’ve been thinking about it for like three weeks. And, but now they are saying, well, I mean, it’s just true. That’s not a knock on anyone.

It’s just like these cases come up, they have to be decided right away and people want full process. But once you have the full process, I think it does, it does become like this is, this is like a fully measured and thought out decision. Um, and, and I just think a lot of the time because of, because of the, the need for speed, it’s not, and it makes me nervous.

To have like the oral argument and say like, now we did it, we did all of this. When, when really there’s so much more that people just haven’t had a time to think about. I think universal injunctions, that is an issue that’s been kicking around for, you know, just years and years and people have been thinking about it for years.

But a lot of the questions that the court is facing right now are huge and they’re novel and they’re difficult and like, I’m just not, I really feel for the court because I don’t know how they, how they can decide these in a way that is, you know, fair and equitable, but also respects the need for speed.

I think it’s really difficult. Can’t be always, can’t be never. And this is right, this is Justice Gorsuch, and it’s to TikTok concurrence. That is a case where they do expedited briefing, the whole argument and at the end it’s sort of nine zero to uphold the law. But Justice Gorsuch writes this concurrence.

It’s like, I mean, I guess, but I really would’ve liked to have some time to think about this. Right. Thanks for answering the question. I just wanted. We went very far afield from the question, but hopefully it’s an answer somewhere in there. So, so I thank you so much for, for the discussion. I have a question about a case that you guys have not discussed that is about, is in the doc in the emergency docket thing.

So a bit of background. So I’m a naturalized citizen and I voted for Trump few times, and yet I’m deeply concerned about the case that originated here in California that actually essentially you can be racially profiled if you’re speaking a certain way or something. And it wasn’t. So, actually it’s the first time that I feel a need to have my copy of my US passport just in case I, so the question is, we’re always carrying that with you, right?

No, yeah, yeah. Going around. Right. So is this something that is a one-off for that particular case in LA or is, uh, sets a precedent for right now it’s okay to essentially profile in the context of immigration enforcement. I’ll take a crack and then I’m curious to hear your thoughts. Um. I think that this is a case that, uh, shows some of the dangers of the emergency docket, and in particular, this is a case that shows some of the dangers of the Supreme Court doing its own kind of fact finding.

Right. So if you read the kind of Kavanaugh concurrence mm-hmm. It maybe sounds like it’s something specific to LA, sort of has all this rhetoric about things in LA um, uh, but then when you read what the district court found and what the dissenters say, it sounds like there’s really nothing specific to LA about this case.

Right. Um, and it turns out some of the, the, the things that Justice Kavanaugh says are contrary to some of the things that District Court says, even the things Justice Kavanaugh says. Right. Which is basically like, um, there are a, a lot of that’s like he says a lot of, at some point in the opinion. Right.

He says that there are a lot of people who are, um, uh, uh, undocumented in Los Angeles, like, doesn’t give us a numerical threshold. It’s actually, it turns out to be like a pretty small percentage of Los Angeles. Mm-hmm. Um. So I guess I would say I, uh, I think that Justice Kavanaugh thought he was making a ruling about la I don’t know how it gets KA to LA.

Um, and so that’s like n neither, not, not particularly helpful, but just I would not put that away. Yeah. It’s very sad actually. I mean, I, I, that cases, that cases, um, I agree a great example of the perils of the emergency docket, but I’ll, I’ll, I’ll say something different about it. So that case was, was always going to be hard for the challengers because of, uh, a procedural issue, which is that there was well established doctrine around standing that made it particularly hard to challenge law enforcement search policies that you couldn’t show sufficiently were gonna be applied to you prospectively.

That’s been the law for some time in a case called Lyons. And so it was understood, I think that the challengers were gonna have a hard time on standing and on the fact that they got a class action in that case, um, because it kind of turns on the different facts that that might be applied to you. And I think what surpri and, and what surprised a lot of folks was that Justice Kavanaugh could have stopped there and chose to go further and talk about the merits of this policy when, if he’s right, that there’s no standing, there’s no re the court mm-hmm.

Should not be talking about the merits in a case it finds no jurisdiction to reach. Um, and I think it was, it was difficult for a lot of people because among other things, no one knows if he’s means to be speaking for the court and himself is frustrated. The court is not sharing views. I mean, Justice Kavanaugh is one of the justices who is most vocally saying, we should be explaining ourselves active and often, uh, on the emergency docket.

Now, it’s helpful when you’re one of the swing justices to say that because they mostly reflect your views compared to others. Not always, but often. More often. And, um, and so it’s easier to say, we should be explaining ourselves when they’re your views, but no one knows because the court doesn’t explain if it’s just doing a standing only it has issues with the policy, but it thought there wasn’t standing.

Mm-hmm. And there wasn’t an appropriate class and what have you. Or if there are. Five or six justices who agree with everything in that concurrence. And that’s one of the things that I think has frustrated folks about the emergency docket is this weird combination of one justices views and you have no idea who to attribute them to and why it went into the merits when there was a standing issue all along.

I’ll just say that even if it’s just the standing issue, that’s still pretty devastating for kind of checks on police. Um, so it is, as Jeremy said, it has been true for many years. This case, Lyons was a case about a choke hold policy in the Los Angeles Police Department. Supreme Court said, um, you don’t an up standing person who was subjected to a choke hold to challenge this because, um, who knows if this will happen to you again, in this case, the challengers compiled evidence of multiple plaintiffs who had multiple times themselves been arrested, right?

So they could say with some certainty like this has already happened to me twice. I have, I think it’s likely to happen again. And they had some concrete harms, right? So in Lions, this prior case, the court says, well, you haven’t had to change anything about your behavior to avoid being put into a choke hold.

You’re going about your business. And the challengers here said like, no, we’re not. Right? We’re, we’re having to carry around a copy of our passport everywhere we go. Yeah. Um, and so I think even if it’s just a standing opinion, even if nothing else that Justice Kavanaugh said stands for the view of the court, it will change dramatically the ability of civil rights practitioners to try to constrain any sort of law enforcement conduct.

Because I think it goes significantly farther than lions. And I think that alone will mean that there’s more unchecked police and ice enforcement. Thank you all three for the question. Last question. Thank you. Uh, this question may be a little bit different, but I think it’s interesting, especially for the students and the non-lawyers in the room.

You were all, uh, clerks to Supreme Court Justices. Can you talk a little bit about what the role of the clerk is, your interactions with the justices, your. Influence or lack thereof on decisions and just sort of demystify that process for those of us who have never been Supreme Court clerks. Yeah, and actually you’ve got a pretty, I think, a, like, pretty good cross section of the role of the clerks across the three of us.

Um, I would, I would like to say, um, I dunno, Colleen, do you wanna start? We can go online. Um, sure. Uh, so I, I clerked for the chief, um, uh, and uh, the, one of the great things about clerking for the chief was there were no bench memos. Um, the chief did everything, um, orally. Uh, so we spent a lot of our time talking to the chief Justice about, um, all of the cases in front of the Supreme Court at the time.

Uh, and I think, you know, the role of the clerk in the chief’s office is sort of, um, sounding board researcher. Uh, he, you know, I, I think I have always said that the chief is, is an amazing boss. And he really was, uh, he trusted us and gave us a lot of, um, autonomy and he let us know that he was, was listening to us.

At the same time, he made all of his decisions himself. I mean, I think I was seeing, saying earlier, anybody who says that like they were responsible for their justices opinions is, you know, I think suffering from delusions of grand grandeur. Uh, you know, I, I actually, when I was clerking, I remember thinking, why did they hire me?

Because I don’t really know that much about the law. And they could be using like, you know, practitioners who’ve been in, in practice for a long time and actually, you know, would have useful knowledge. But I think that’s the point, right? You’re, you’re taking a young lawyer who, when you’re dealing with them and you’re a justice and you’ve been dealing with the law for, for decades, you’re not gonna be.

Get, get confused and think, oh, let me let this, you know, person who just graduated from law school make all of these important decisions, not me. I trust them. Right. And it’s, it’s a useful check in that sense. But I do think you’re like a, a fresh voice. You are, um, you’re your research, but you’re also, you know, a different take, a different perspective.

Um, you know, I think something I really admired about the, the, the chief, and I think the justice is just, is he, he really listened, he did not always agree, or maybe not most of the time agree with what I had to say, but I felt like he really listened and that, and what I was saying went into his, um, decision making process.

Uh, so I actually agree with, with almost all of that. So maybe I’ll just add three, three observations. The first is probably, actually none of us are a particularly good gauge anymore because, um. The emergency docket I would date. We can have a longer conversation about this. I think it actually sort of like the current in its current form kind of started our term clerking.

Um, but the amount of time that the law clerks now spend on the emergency docket just bears no resemblance to when any of us was clerking. So I actually have no idea what’s happening in that building anymore. How they’re sleeping, when they’re sleeping, what’s happening. Um, uh, uh, so take all this with a grain of salt.

Um, the second thing I’ll say that I think is a little bit different about the Clark and Bridge. So Sotomayor, who’s my former boss, is, um, she views her role as much outside the building as inside the building. So she cares deeply about the cases. Read any one of her impassioned dissent, and you will see that she also recognizes that in some ways her role as an ambassador for the court and an inspiration to young people is a way that she will make change that is different from what, what she writes and what she says at conference.

Um, so again, both in kind of the way she writes her dissents, right? She’s speaking to a much broader audience and the amount of time that she spends on like public appearances, like she would, you know, she’d like get invited to something and she’d be like, ask her judicial assistant to pull out the file of like, anyone who’d like written a letter to her from that town so she could invite them to the event, right?

I had the pleasure of going with her to these events where she’s treated like, like a rock star. Like people cry when they like reach out to touch her. Um, and so it was a really interesting lesson for me in, as someone who thought about a judge, like, your source of power is like what you, your, the votes that you cast in conference to think about, to work for a justice, who really saw her role as much broader than that.

About inspiring people, about being a voice for the court to, to on, on behalf of people who didn’t always have a voice on the court and, and writing and kind of allocating her time in that way. Um, and the final thing I’ll say is, um, here’s the really weird thing about being a clerk is, um, you know, all of us now practice before the court where we clerked.

Um, and it’s like a very, very strangely insular club. So Justice Sotomayor for instance, officiated my wedding, like one of the first people who met my son when he came out of the hospital. Um, and I remember the first case I went up to argue, I was talking to a friend of mine who’s a, a public defender in New York, and she was like, oh my God, if I were in front of a judge where who had officiated the prosecutor’s wedding who didn’t recuse themselves, I would be livid, right?

Um, but that’s just not the vibe. Um, and I don’t know a way to sort of justify or explain that, just to say that. I, I think one thing I hadn’t fully realized until going through the clerkship process is just how small this world is and how many, uh, deeply close ties the justices have to the advocates appearing before them.

I don’t have a ton to add beyond that. Uh, I, I’ll second what everyone is saying, which is the clerks really don’t make the decisions. The justices really do make the decisions. I felt that confidently when I clerked for Justice Kagan, and she very much wanted clerks to push back on her ideas and make them better and find holes and poke holes.

And in a case, like there are some cases that are really 51-49 cases, especially like non-ideological ones, and you can like help shape an opinion or get more caveats or nuance into a take because you’ve pushed back in a certain way. The justices are voting on their cases and the justices know how to figure them out.

And I mean, Justice Kagan is, you know, basically one of the smartest people I’ll ever interact with in my entire life. And I didn’t have a lot that I could tell her that she couldn’t figure out. But justices are also busy people and so I was plucking enough to try to keep pushing back on a variety of cases.

And so it made for like an incredibly intense and incredibly fulfilling year. But I think mostly like the clerks get to learn from the experience more than they’re really teaching the justices and look in a case that’s poorly briefed, clerks can have a valuable role in helping find things that the parties are not presenting so that ",https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/supreme-court-roundup-and-preview-4.png,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:27.181475

Among the many corrosive consequences of Mr. Trump’s actions is a loss of faith in almost anything that his Justice Department does.
The Justice Department was hardly perfect before Mr. Trump took the oath of office a year ago.
As the second year of Mr. Trump’s second term begins next week, there are some modestly encouraging signs of resistance — but not nearly enough.
But the Republican Party has largely been a silent partner as its leader removes all sense of justice from the Justice Department.","President Trump is celebrating the anniversary of his return to power by accelerating his attack on the rule of law. He has spent the week leading up to Jan. 20 using the mighty powers of the Justice Department as an extension of his personal and political interests. The department has started a fabricated criminal investigation of the Federal Reserve chair, searched the home of a Washington Post reporter and created a White House-controlled fraud unit that would streamline partisan prosecution.

Mr. Trump does not attempt to hide his use of law enforcement powers for vengeance. He glories in it. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported, he hosted federal prosecutors at the White House and complained that they were not moving fast enough to punish the rivals, critics and truth tellers he wished to target. This followed months of pressure by the president on his attorney general to do more to prosecute those who oppose his actions and those who tried to hold him accountable under the law in the past.

These efforts have become a defining feature of Mr. Trump’s second term, and it can be easy to become numb to them. We urge you not to. His usurpation of law enforcement power threatens us all. His meddling with the independence of the Fed undermines the economy. His attacks on members of Congress and the news media threaten people’s right to speak freely and hold the government accountable. His move to control investigation and prosecution from the White House portends an America where the state uses force to promote the political interests of its leaders, rather than uphold the laws passed by our representatives.

One year into his second term, America risks losing a central feature of our democracy: that we are a country ruled by laws, not by one man.

Among the many corrosive consequences of Mr. Trump’s actions is a loss of faith in almost anything that his Justice Department does. Consider the situation in Minnesota that attracted so much of the nation’s attention in recent days. On Jan. 7 an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot to death Renee Good, who was protesting ICE’s raids in Minneapolis. Under any other modern president, the next steps would have been clear. The government would have conducted a sober-minded inquiry about whether the agent had acted appropriately.

Under Mr. Trump, the verdict was preordained. The ICE agents on the scene prevented a bystander who identified himself as a doctor from treating Ms. Good as she sat slumped and bleeding in her car. The ICE agent who shot her sped away shortly afterward, videos suggest. Mr. Trump quickly posted a misleading description of the confrontation on social media. Later that day, the F.B.I. barred state investigators from joining them in collecting and analyzing evidence from the scene.

Senior Trump officials accused Ms. Good of “domestic terrorism,” and the Justice Department made a mockery of itself by opening an investigation into Ms. Good and her partner for their political activism. At least 10 federal lawyers in Washington and Minnesota have since resigned or retired. Their response is honorable, although it leaves even fewer principled officials to stand up to future abuses.

The Justice Department was hardly perfect before Mr. Trump took the oath of office a year ago. Still, between Richard Nixon’s resignation in disgrace and Mr. Trump’s second term, the department under both political parties took steps to remain independent from the White House so that Americans could have confidence that federal law enforcement was nonpartisan. If the government investigated somebody — or decided not to — the reasonable assumption was that it was on the merits. That assumption is in tatters, as the events in Minneapolis demonstrate.

After hollowing out the functions of the federal government’s system of justice that ensure fairness and guard against misconduct, the Trump administration has turned what remains into the agent of Mr. Trump’s personal and political impulses. If you are on the president’s side, you will be protected and even pardoned of crimes. If you threaten his interests, you risk retribution from federal law enforcement.

On Sunday, Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, said the Justice Department had served him with subpoenas in a bogus criminal investigation. The department claimed it was looking into whether he had misled Congress about the cost of renovations to the Fed’s headquarters, but he said he had provided exhaustive details to Congress and had the bank’s internal watchdog examine the construction costs. Mr. Trump’s real motive is obvious. He wants to replace the Fed’s leadership with officials who betray its tradition of independence from partisan politics and rapidly cut interest rates to goose the economy before midterm elections this year. The targeting of Mr. Powell, who will leave his role in May, serves to remind his successor that there is a cost to independence.

Three days after Mr. Powell’s announcement, federal agents took the extraordinary step of searching the home of Hannah Natanson, a reporter for The Washington Post, and seizing her phone as part of a leak investigation. This violates traditional government policy and appears designed to chill valuable reporting by making sources nervous about talking to journalists. Ms. Natanson had helped expose some of the negative consequences of the Trump administration’s policies.

The list of Trump critics and opponents who face or have faced legal action by the administration also includes another Fed governor, Lisa Cook; the former F.B.I. director James Comey; Attorney General Letitia James of New York; Senator Adam Schiff, Democrat of California; and Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California. This month Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would begin administrative proceedings against Senator Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona — which could result in the reduction of Mr. Kelly’s military retirement rank and pension — after the senator participated in a video urging military service members to resist illegal orders. The five other Democratic lawmakers who participated in the video said they are also under federal investigation. On Monday, Mr. Kelly sued Mr. Hegseth and the Pentagon on free-speech grounds.

At the same time, a parade of actual criminals who curry Mr. Trump’s favor receive clemency, and investigations into suspicious behavior by his cronies are canceled or never opened. Many of the president’s uses of the pardon power seem partly aimed at diminishing confidence in legitimate past prosecutions — and trying to make previous administrations look as unethical as the current one.

Janet Yellen, a former Fed chair and Treasury secretary, summed up this inversion of the basic principles of American justice: “If you can bring charges for no reason whatsoever against your enemies, we’re no longer living in a society governed by the rule of law,” she said.

More than 200 of the department’s career lawyers have been fired, and thousands more have resigned. “I wouldn’t even call it the Justice Department anymore,” Dena Robinson, a lawyer who formerly worked in the civil rights division, said last year. “It’s become Trump’s personal law firm.”

The administration crossed another line last week when Vice President JD Vance announced that the White House would run an unnecessary new Justice Department division on fraud. The department already has an anti-fraud section, but it has been depleted by administration cutbacks; what’s different about this new division is that the White House controls it directly. The new outpost is particularly suspicious, given Mr. Trump’s loose and expedient definition of fraudulent behavior as occurring only in states run by Democrats. The announcement suggests it will be another piece of his partisan use of legal powers. For now, the new division is centered on the social-service fraud that has occurred in Minnesota, though he has his eyes on other Democratic states as well.

The Minnesota fraud is real, and the people who perpetrated it deserve to face charges. Many already have; one of the prosecutors who resigned Tuesday over the response to the ICE shooting had overseen the sprawling investigation. But Mr. Trump’s interest in fraud is selective, applying exclusively in jurisdictions that have opposed him. As KFF Health News reported, he gave pardons or commutations to at least 68 people convicted of fraud-related crimes during his first and second terms. And he fired or demoted more than 20 inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud.

As the second year of Mr. Trump’s second term begins next week, there are some modestly encouraging signs of resistance — but not nearly enough. Several Republicans in the House and Senate have said they do not believe Mr. Powell is a criminal, and Senator Thom Tillis said he would oppose the confirmation of any Fed governor until the investigation is concluded.

But the Republican Party has largely been a silent partner as its leader removes all sense of justice from the Justice Department. Some seem to grasp the danger to the economy of having Trump control the Fed, but they need to see the larger picture and grasp the danger to democracy of controlling law enforcement, too. On behalf of Americans who are now living without a functioning system of federal law and order, Congress should step up and end this self-interested destruction.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/opinion/17vengeance-editorial-image/17vengeance-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 01:58:09.869115

On Jan. 9, two days after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent’s shooting of Renee Good sent tensions in Minneapolis to a fever pitch, the Department of Homeland Security posted to social media an image of a man on a horse riding through a snowy, mountainous landscape with the words “We’ll have our home again.” That’s the chorus to a song about ousting a foreign presence by a self-described “folk-punk” band that the Proud Boys and other far-right and white supremacist groups have used.

The next day, the Department of Labor posted on X: “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.” Several Trump critics on the social media site drew a parallel to a notorious Nazi slogan, “One People, One Realm, One Leader.”

And this past week, as President Donald Trump stepped up his pressure campaign to claim Greenland, the White House posted an image on X that showed a dog sled facing a fork in the trail, one that leads to an American flag and the White House and another that leads to the Russian and Chinese flags. Above the image was the phrase, “Which way, Greenland Man?”

The post refers to a meme that riffs off the title of a notorious white supremacist book titled “Which Way Western Man?” The administration had already used the framing in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruiting post last year, which asked, “Which way, American Man?”

The flurry of posts has renewed criticism about a recurring pattern in Trump’s second term — the sometimes cryptic use of imagery popular with the far right and white supremacists in the administration’s campaign to rally the nation behind its immigration crackdown, which it frames as a battle to preserve Western civilization.

Administration tells critics to ‘get a grip’

The administration says it’s tired of criticism that its messaging is framed around white supremacy or Nazi slogans.

“It seems that the mainstream media has become a meme of their own: The deranged leftist who claims everything they dislike must be Nazi propaganda,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “This line of attack is boring and tired. Get a grip.”

Referring to the “We’ll Have Our Home Again” post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said it “was a reference to 20-plus million illegal aliens invading the country.”

“I don’t know where you guys are getting this stuff,” she added, “but it is absurd.”

César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University, said the administration’s references are a choice.

“You don’t have to dip into white supremacist sloganeering to promote immigration regulation,” he said, noting that former President Bill Clinton signed two bills toughening penalties on immigrants who were in the country illegally in the 1990s without doing so.

He added that the administration seems to calibrate its references.

“The imagery is not simply a reproduction of common white supremacist imagery or text, but a play on that imagery — and that gives them the breathing room they want,” Garcia Hernández said.

Trump won his second term with robust support from Latino voters and increased his backing among both Black and Asian voters, all while running on pledges of tough border enforcement and mass deportations.

Still, Trump for years has created enthusiasm among white supremacist groups, who see his nationalist and anti-immigrant stance as validating their own.

The president has complained that immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and spoken favorably about white immigrants compared to other immigrants. In his first term, he bemoaned the number of immigrants coming from what he called “shithole countries” such as Haiti or ones in Africa, while wondering why the U.S. doesn’t draw more people from Norway. Last month, he called Somali immigrants “garbage.”

Trump changed immigration policy to favor whites in one area by shutting down the admission of refugees except for white South Africans, whom he contends, against evidence, are being discriminated against in their home country.

Online appeal for the far right

Some of Trump’s most prominent supporters have openly embraced the cause of white nationalists.

Elon Musk, who was Trump’s biggest donor during the 2024 presidential campaign and ran the president’s Department of Government Efficiency for the first part of last year, recirculated a user post on X, the social platform he owns, that called for “white solidarity” to prevent the mass murder of white men and added a “100” emoji indicating agreement.

The administration’s history has led to claims that it’s using white supremacist language even when there is no evidence for it.

In the aftermath of the Good shooting in Minnesota, a sign that appeared on Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s lectern during a news conference — reading “One Of Ours, All Of Yours” — drew widespread attention on social media, with many commentators suggesting it was a Nazi phrase. The Southern Poverty Law Center, however, could not trace the words to any Nazi slogan.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said it was a reference to the subject of the press conference: “a CBP officer who was shot — he was one of our officers and all of the country’s federal law enforcement officer,” she wrote in an email.

Hannah Gais, a senior researcher with the SPLC, has long tracked white supremacist groups and said she thinks the administration knows what it’s doing with its messaging slogans.

“They know their base is this overly online right-winger who they know will go nuts if they say ‘Which Way, Western Man?’” Gais said. “I don’t think it’s a tenable strategy for the long term because the stuff is incomprehensible to most people. And if it is comprehensible, people don’t like it.”

In the public's view, he failed to resolve one of the two major issues that elected him, the increasing unaffordability of day-to-day life. And he created grave doubts about his methods to curb illegal immigration.

As president, Trump bears ultimate responsibility for his administration's misdeeds, many of which face legal challenges.

But three top appointees — Stephen Miller, Russell Vought and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — are, along with the president, the architects of the most damaging aspects of Trump 2.0. Most other top officials are primarily enablers.

Here is a rundown:

› MILLER. Miller has been the main architect of Trump's anti-immigration policies and efforts to curb civil rights programs and other so-called ""woke"" policies, both within the government and beyond it.

He set numerical targets for deporting illegal immigrants that led to detention and deportation of some legal residents and citizens.

Though descended from Jewish immigrants who fled Eastern Europe, Miller encouraged policies ending asylum for victims of repression and eliminating most legal immigration.

He was also a principal architect of the legally questionable effort to send federal and National Guard troops into major cities in the name of reducing crime and assisting deportation efforts.

Miller also urged overthrowing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and threatening Greenland's independence.

› VOUGHT. As director of the Office of Management and Budget, Vought picked up where Elon Musk left off in slashing federal personnel and programs, especially those that helped the poor.

The mastermind behind many of the conservative Project 2025 recommendations that form the basis of Trump's second-term policies, Vought has long believed the executive branch can refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress. A Supreme Court test looms.

Vought contends the president has total authority over the executive branch and can fire members of semi-independent commissions and others who oppose his policies.

He encouraged the sharp cutback in federal health and food programs, emergency and foreign aid programs. He also unilaterally blocked funds for environmental projects in Democratic-run states.

› KENNEDY. As secretary of health and human services, he implemented an array of damaging policies reflecting his long-held contrarian beliefs after promising senators he would weigh scientific expertise.

His appointees at the Centers for Disease Control encouraged those who contend without evidence that many vaccines are unsafe and may jeopardize long-term health for millions.

This year has already seen the first two significant outbreaks in a generation of measles, likely exacerbated by Kennedy's refusal to support anti-measles vaccinations.

More recently, his department revised guidelines for what American should eat, against eating processed foods and sugary drinks and reversing decades of warnings that over-consumption of red meats, butter and whole milk contribute to heart disease.

Kennedy also canceled billions of dollars for research, including hundreds of clinical trials, but Congress is reversing his actions.

Trump, himself, initiated many questionable policies, from seeking to end birthright citizenship to imposing import tariffs, ordering prosecution of longtime critics and encouraging fossil fuels while dismantling projects using alternate fuels.

His campaign of breaking norms and imposing his own instinctual views has inspired a spate of lawsuits. Their outcome will ultimately determine the extent of long-term damage by the most unpopular re-elected president in U.S. history.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2026/01/18/103909884_OPED-LEUBSDORF-COLUMN-GET--2-_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-18 10:58:32.056223

Abigail Spanberger signed 10 executive actions that broadly targeted affordability and pushed the commonwealth away from former Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's approaches to education, immigration and race.

She also signed an action that delegates broad emergency and day-to-day authority to Bonnie Krenz-Schnurman, her longtime chief of staff, hours after taking Virginia's high office.

The orders also put the risks to Virginia's economy and budget posed by federal funding cuts from Congress and President Donald Trump in the public discussion more so than under the previous administration.

""Today, we are responding to the moment. We are setting the tone for what Virginians can expect over the next four years: pragmatic leadership focused on lowering costs and delivering results,"" said Spanberger in a statement.

While governors do not have the power to appropriate funds, Spanberger's executive orders also reflected her and top Democrats' apparent preference to avoid using Virginia's general fund to lower costs and raise wages, arguing that raising taxes is another cost for families.

Spanberger, who is also the first woman to be elected Virginia's governor, did not take questions from the press after signing all 10 actions.

The directives on affordability were to identify cost savings for families, which state-facilitated services are most at risk due to federal policies, and finding housing regulations that may be cut in order to spur new home and apartment construction.

The executive order named housing, health care, energy, education, child care and living expenses like groceries as areas of particular concern. Health care and identifying potential ways to loosen housing regulations got their own executive orders.

In the order on health care funding, Spanberger created an ""Interagency Health Financing Task Force"" to coordinate health care financing and sort out all the various funding risks posed by the congressional passage of HR1. Hundreds of thousands of Virginians are at risk of losing their health care or being priced out due to the bill's provisions.

It also includes a review of Managed Care Organizations, a key part of Medicaid services in the commonwealth. Recently, a forecast from the Department of Medical Assistance Services said that MCOs would need an additional $3.2 billion in state funds to maintain current services for the 1.6 million Virginians enrolled, according to December data from DMAS.

The underlying challenges for Spanberger and Virginia's tight spending plan, given rising education and health care costs, compound the limitations of state government according to Terry Clower, director of George Mason's Center for Regional Analysis.

""Saying that 'we are going to make affordability better for you in the short run' is really hard for government to do, and particularly state government,"" Clower told VPM News in an interview Friday.

Virginia normally conforms to federal tax law on a ""rolling"" basis, with some exceptions. However, state lawmakers paused that conformity in 2025 in light of the federal cuts to taxes that could have trickle-down effects on Virginia's tax collections — to the tune of billions of dollars.

Democrats said during the opening of the General Assembly session they would not look to conform to many of new federal tax law's provisions.

Spanberger directed Virginia's agencies to identify what risks the federal government's policies will have in one order. Clower noted that tariffs have an inflationary effect, immigration crackdowns could affect labor costs and availability, and jobs connected to the federal government are affected.

""We've also seen a trend now for professional business services jobs that are declining,"" he said. The effects ""are crossing different levels of households, so you're creating some pressures in the economy.""

Higher education governance also got special attention. Executive Order 6 requires recommendations for legislative or policy changes to how board of visitor members are appointed or selected. It follows tumult at University of Virginia (Spanberger's alma mater) and resignations of at least three board members shortly before Saturday's inauguration.

In the order's wording, Spanberger cited federal interference as the need for the changes: ""These pressures underscore the urgent need for the Commonwealth to reevaluate how governing boards are appointed, ensuring they are composed of individuals dedicated to upholding the quality, independence, and reputation of our institutions.""

That is but one of a few departures from the approach of Youngkin's administration to university governance.

The new governor's Day 1 EOs also give specific mention to diversity and opportunity. Executive Order 4 mentions ""inclusive"" education and closing ""opportunity gaps,"" while EO 9 tells agencies to take ""affirmative measures … to emphasize the recruitment of qualified minorities, women, disabled persons, and older Virginians to serve at all levels of state government.""

It heavily contrasts with the tone of Youngkin's administration, which praised the closure of DEI offices. In 2023 Martin D. Brown, Youngkin's chief diversity officer (whose title did not include the word ""equity""), declared that ""DEI is dead"" during a talk at Virginia Military Institute.

Spanberger also is rescinding a controversial executive order of Youngkin's that directed state and local law enforcement to pursue immigration-related enforcement duties. Executive Order 10 does not withdraw from existing 287(g) agreements, according to Spanberger Communications Director Libby Wiet.

It solely rescinds Youngkin's issued mandate — which directed Virginia's law enforcement agencies to become federally deputized for immigration enforcement and opened up Departments of Corrections facilities for immigrants' federal processing and detention.

Spanberger also issued orders that outline expanded powers for her chief of staff; Krenz-Schnurman has served as the newly installed governor's chief of staff since her first term in Congress.

Those EO- designated powers include budgetary and administrative roles (EO 8), as well as the limited ability to call forth the Virginia National Guard (EO 7) or declare a state of emergency if Spanberger is ""unable to be reached.""

Ugarte said that El Paso County will be entering into the warrant services officer model, which will check the federal system for inmates entering the El Paso County Jail to see if the individual has a warrant related to immigration and detain them.
""If we do immigration enforcement out in our community, that will create a divide between law enforcement and our community.
The sheriff told the El Paso Times that these new requirements could strain his already underfunded and short staffed office.
Fears in El Paso immigrant community Residents spent more than an hour asking Ugarte questions related to ICE operations in the county.","El Paso County Sheriff Oscar Ugarte met residents at a townhall meeting to explain an agreement to work with expanding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.

Dozens of residents attended the meeting on Saturday, Jan. 17, at the Socorro Ramírez Community Center in Sparks to hear Ugarte explain what will happen now that El Paso County is required by Texas state law to join the national 287(g) program to cooperate with ICE enforcement operations.

Ugarte explained that he was given three options for what type of agreement that his office could enter. Ugarte said that El Paso County will be entering into the warrant services officer model, which will check the federal system for inmates entering the El Paso County Jail to see if the individual has a warrant related to immigration and detain them.

""We picked this model because we believe that it will have the least affect on our community,"" Ugarte told residents. ""If we do immigration enforcement out in our community, that will create a divide between law enforcement and our community. We don't want that. We don't (want) our community to be scared.""

The townhall was organized by the Border Network for Human Rights, an El Paso-based immigrant advocacy group. There was no way for El Paso to avoid being forced to participate, Samantha Singleton, the policy director for the BNHR, told attendees, because the county could be sued if they do not ""comply.""

The county must now join the 287(g) program with ICE after SB 8 went into effect on Jan. 1. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bill into law in June 2025 requiring all counties that operate a jail or contracts with a private vendor to operate a jail in Texas to sign one of three types of agreements with ICE: the Warrant Service Officer, the Jail Enforcement Model and the Task Force Model.

Over 225 counties in Texas already have signed agreements with ICE, according to the ICE's 287(g) program website. Only one county in New Mexico is participating in the program, the Curry County Sheriff's Office in Clovis.

ICE agents already had access to inmates detained in the El Paso County Jail due to a 2017 law that required them to work with federal agents.

Ugarte — a first generation American and Democrat who just completed his first year in office as sheriff — expressed his opposition to being forced to sign any new agreement throughout the townhall. The sheriff told the El Paso Times that these new requirements could strain his already underfunded and short staffed office.

""As local law enforcement, we have enough issues to deal with already,"" Ugarte said following the event. ""We don't have the resources, we don't have the manpower, we don't have the budget. Do I believe that local law enforcement should be focused on federal immigration laws? Absolutely not.""

Fears in El Paso immigrant community

Residents spent more than an hour asking Ugarte questions related to ICE operations in the county.

The questions from residents ranged between how his office had received emergency calls reporting federal agents, how would his office address racial profiling and what to do if federal agents leave a child behind after detaining their guardians, among many other questions.

Ugarte said that any emergency calls will be treated as any other call, but if the person identifies themselves as a federal agent, there isn't much deputies can do. He requested that residents do not protest at a close distance and not interfere with federal agents. He also pointed out that these policies were the result of the 2024 elections, and reminded residents to show their anger through voting.

The questions reflected the concerns of many residents of the Borderland, many of whom are immigrants and still have loved one who cross the border regularly.

There is fear in the community, Alfredo Agüero, a resident of El Paso, said after the townhall. The 68-year-old U.S. citizen was born in Juárez and was one of about 20 people to ask a question of the sheriff, asking how can residents have confidence that these masked individuals are actual federal agents when they do not identify themselves or present identifications and how the community can have confidence in the sheriff.

The sheriff's answer that there was nothing he could do did not ease his concerns, he said.

""I feel like we are in the same spot,"" Agüero said. ""The answers we received is that they can do whatever they want. It is not fair.""","https://www.elpasotimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/17/PTX1/88236521007-lt-sheriff-oscar-ugarte-10.JPG?crop=3999,2250,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-18 02:57:07.141749

A group of local unions in Minnesota, meanwhile, has endorsed a planned statewide economic blackout in response to ICE actions in the state.

The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, first announced its endorsement alongside other regional bodies on Friday.

""The Minnesota labor movement is united against the violent ICE occupation of our beloved cities that has directly impacted union members, our workplaces and our families,"" the group said in a press release.

Dozens of community, faith, and union groups are organizing the Day of Truth and Freedom, a call to action asking Minnesotans to avoid work, school, and shopping on January 23 to pause the economy. There will also be a rally and march in downtown Minneapolis at 2 p.m. local time.

""We will gather with family, neighbors, and community to show Minnesota's moral heart and economic power,"" organizers said in a Facebook post.

Organizers listed several demands, including that ICE leave Minnesota and that federal funding for ICE be scrapped in the upcoming congressional budget.

The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation told Business Insider that ICE's presence is disrupting residents' daily lives.

""Working people from across sectors — hospitality, healthcare, education, custodial, construction, public works — are being targeted,"" the group said in a statement.

Thousands of ICE officers have descended on Minnesota as part of Operation Metro Surge, launched on December 1. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press release earlier this month that the operation was targeting criminal activity among immigrants in the state.

""Under President Trump, we will expose and deliver accountability for the rampant fraud and criminality happening in Minnesota. You won't steal from Americans or break our laws and get away with it,"" she said.

The Trump administration has criticized cities like Minneapolis that have passed so-called ""sanctuary"" laws preventing city resources and police from supporting federal immigration agents. In a statement shared on Friday, the White House said sanctuary cities create ""a climate of hostility that endangers federal officers and incites violence."" Earlier in the week, the administration said it would cut federal funding to sanctuary cities.

Business Insider reached out to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House for comment.

Many residents, meanwhile, have criticized the tactics that federal agents are using to locate and detain individuals. Tensions in the state skyrocketed after ICE officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen from Minneapolis, on January 7, leading to a wave of protests and outcry.

Days after the shooting, Minnesota's attorney general filed a lawsuit on behalf of Minneapolis, St. Paul, and the state against Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, seeking to end the operation.

""As a result of this surge, municipalities have been forced to divert local law enforcement resources away from their normal public safety duties, emergency responder resources have been strained, schools have been forced into lockdowns and closures, businesses have been forced to close, and the rights of Minnesotans have been violated time and time again,"" a press release from the Minnesota Attorney General's Office said.

Homeland Security said officers have arrested over 2,500 individuals during Operation Metro Surge so far.

Business and Legal Community Mobilize Against Immigrant-Visa Freeze

Within hours of the State Department’s announcement, business coalitions, immigration lawyers and civil-rights organizations began crafting legal and lobbying strategies to overturn or narrow the new immigrant-visa suspension. In an editorial titled “Echoes of 1924,” the Economic Times argued that framing the freeze as an anti-welfare measure masks a broader attempt to slash lawful immigration levels. Advocacy groups likened the policy to the National Origins Quota Act, warning of talent shortfalls in STEM fields.

Several multinational employers told reporters they are exploring emergency L-1 intracompany transfers and E-2 treaty visas to keep high-value employees on projects scheduled to launch in Q2. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) confirmed it is assembling plaintiffs for a potential injunction, citing due-process violations and harm to U.S. businesses. Meanwhile, diversity-visa (DV-2026) winners from Sudan, Sierra Leone and Laos have organized online forums to crowd-fund litigation before their visas expire on September 30.

For individuals and corporations scrambling to adjust their plans, VisaHQ can be a practical lifeline. The platform (https://www.visahq.com/united-states/) offers real-time embassy updates, customized document checklists, and step-by-step assistance for alternative visa routes such as L-1 or E-2, helping HR teams and foreign nationals keep projects on track while the courts decide the fate of the suspension.

Corporate response: Global-mobility teams are reassessing succession plans and may shift onboarding centers to Canada or Mexico to await adjudication. Recruiters note that prolonged uncertainty could push foreign graduates of U.S. universities to competitors in the U.K. and Australia. HR leaders are urging Congress to clarify that employment-based immigrants with employer affidavits of support should be exempt from the ""public-charge"" rationale.

Next steps: Observers expect the first lawsuits to be filed in federal district courts within the next two weeks. If an injunction is granted, consular processing could resume temporarily, but practitioners caution that injunctions may apply only to named plaintiffs or limited jurisdictions.

VisaHQ's expert visas and immigration team helps individuals and companies navigate global travel, work, and residency requirements. We handle document preparation, application filings, government agencies coordination, every aspect necessary to ensure fast, compliant, and stress-free approvals.

A second ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that did not cause a fatality happened Wednesday night when a Venezuelan who ICE said had illegally entered the United States fled during a targeted traffic stop.

That man and two others assaulted the ICE officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, and the officer shot the primary suspect in the leg to end the attack.

National Guard units on Saturday were ""staging to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies,"" the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said in a social media post.

A federal judge on Friday restricted ICE's use of crowd-dispersal tools, such as tear gas and pepper spray, to protect peaceful protesters and banned ICE from initiating traffic stops of protesters who have not broken any laws.

While a federal judge has restricted ICE activities, the Department of Justice on Friday opened an investigation of Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and others for potentially conspiring to impede ICE and other federal law enforcement in Minnesota.",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/3701768700092/2026/1/3ffcf9843cdf749d5cf0d470e0ce0b39/v1.5/Gov-Tim-Walz-mobilizes-Minnesota-National-Guard-amid-ICE-protests.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 00:57:56.297997

This all comes after the Portland mayor confirmed to CBS13 that he was warned by someone at the federal level of a possible ramp up of enforcement.

Lisbon Street, a major hub for businesses in Lewiston, felt unusually quiet on Friday. The door to an African supermarket was locked, even though online it says they are open until 8 p.m. A sign on the door read, “ICE is coming. Be prepared.”

The owner of Soya on Lisbon Street in downtown Lewiston says right now, it’s rare to find stores like hers open.

She’s limiting her hours, but remaining open, so her customers can buy groceries.

“Some customer called me that they are going to come in to get something to eat because they are staying home,” she said.

Ever since the rumors of increased ICE enforcement, many shop owners on Lisbon Street are afraid to leave their homes.

The shop owner says she sought asylum in the U.S. several years ago. Now she’s worried about herself and her two children.

“They are afraid,” she said.

""Whether or not they are residents, visitors, federal agents. Anyone that comes into our state is subject to our laws,” Cumberland County District Attorney Jacqueline Sartoris said.

Sartoris sent a firm statement Friday to ICE, saying while they can't arrest federal agents, they will investigate any agent that breaks Maine law.

""We are all watching this and saying this is not appropriate and necessary,” Sartoris said.

The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office says that when ICE arrests somebody in Maine, they will go to the ICE facility in Scarborough, where they will be booked. From there, they could be transported to the ICE facility in Massachusetts or the Cumberland County Jail.

Our employee is a dedicated public servant who serves the people of Los Angeles County with professionalism and integrity.","A Los Angeles County district attorney’s office employee was “wrongfully detained” by federal immigration agents on Friday, according to an internal e-mail obtained by The Times.

L.A. County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman called the incident “unacceptable” in an office-wide memo sent out on Friday evening.

“A member of our Office was wrongfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I can thankfully report that, shortly after, our employee was released and is safe,” Hochman wrote. “This incident is unacceptable. Our employee is a dedicated public servant who serves the people of Los Angeles County with professionalism and integrity. This troubling situation caused great distress to our colleague, our co-worker’s family, and our entire Office family.”

The reason for the person’s detention was not immediately clear. A spokesman for Hochman declined to comment further and referred questions to ICE. Representatives for ICE did not respond to inquiries from The Times. .

Two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the incident, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to talk candidly, said the employee was not a prosecutor. The employee was also not engaged in protest activity, the officials said.

In the e-mail, Hochman said he personally reached out to federal authorities on Friday to make them aware of the situation and “urge them to be more respectful of the rights of those who reside in our community and ensure this wrongful conduct does not occur again.”

In the months since ICE and Border Patrol agents began carrying out President Trump’s sweeping immigration raids in U.S. cities, civil liberties groups have repeatedly sued the Department of Justice alleging agents are making stops based on race rather than reasonable suspicion.

After ICE and Border Patrol agents spent months raiding car washes and Home Depot parking lots around L.A. County, a federal judge in October found sufficient evidence that agents were violating the 4th Amendment by relying on the race, language and vocation of targeted individuals to form “reasonable suspicion” for arrest.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d131c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7929x4163+0+548/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8d%2Fe7%2F73c28b53419a828579bb0b64f29b%2F1511530-me-nathan-hochman-portrait-cmh-05.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 21:58:13.619836

Crowds began to gather, and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.","MINNEAPOLIS(AP) — Work starts around sunrise for many of the federal officers carrying out the immigration crackdown in and around the Twin Cities, with hundreds of people in tactical gear emerging from a bland office building near the main airport.

Within minutes, hulking SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans begin leaving, forming the unmarked convoys that have quickly become feared and common sights in the streets of Minneapolis, St. Paul and their suburbs.

Protesters also arrive early, braving the cold to stand across the street from the fenced-in federal compound, which houses an immigration court and government offices. “Go home!” they shout as convoys roar past. ""ICE out!”

Things often turn uglier after nightfall, when the convoys return and the protesters sometimes grow angrier, shaking fences and occasionally smacking passing cars. Eventually, the federal officers march toward them, firing tear gas and flash grenades before hauling away at least a few people.

“We’re not going anywhere!” a woman shouted on a recent morning. “We’re here until you leave.”

This is the daily rhythm of Operation Metro Surge, the Trump administration's latest and biggest crackdown yet, with more than 2,000 officers taking part. The surge has pitted city and state officials against the federal government, sparked daily clashes between activists and immigration officers in the deeply liberal cities, and left a mother of three dead.

The crackdown is barely noticeable in some areas, particularly in whiter, wealthier neighborhoods and suburbs, where convoys and tear gas are rare. And even in neighborhoods where masked immigration officers are common, they often move with ghostlike quickness, making arrests and disappearing before protesters can gather in force.

Still, the surge can be felt across broad swaths of the Twin Cities area, which is home to more than 3 million people.

“We don’t use the word ‘invasion’ lightly,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, told reporters this week, noting that his police force has just 600 officers. “What we are seeing is thousands — plural, thousands — of federal agents coming into our city.”

Those agents have an outsized presence in a small city.

It can take hours to drive across Los Angeles and Chicago, both targets of Trump administration crackdowns. It can take 15 minutes to cross Minneapolis.

So as worry ripples through the region, children are skipping school or learning remotely, families are avoiding religious services and many businesses, especially in immigrant neighborhoods, have closed temporarily.

Drive down Lake Street, an immigrant hub since the days when newcomers came to Minneapolis from Norway and Sweden, and the sidewalks now seem crowded only with activists standing watch, ready to blow warning whistles at the first sign of a convoy.

At La Michoacana Purepecha, where customers can order ice cream, chocolate covered bananas and pork rinds, the door is locked and staff let in people one at a time. Nearby, at Taqueria Los Ocampo, a sign in English and Spanish says the restaurant is temporarily closed because of “current conditions.”

A dozen blocks away at the Karmel Mall, where the city’s large Somali community goes for everything from food and coffee to tax preparation, signs on the doors warn, “No ICE enter without court order.”

The shadow of George Floyd

It’s been nearly six years since George Floyd was murdered by a Minneapolis police officer, but the scars from that killing remain raw.

Floyd was killed just blocks from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old American citizen, during a Jan. 7 confrontation after she stopped to help neighbors during an enforcement operation. Federal officials say the officer fired in self-defense after Good “weaponized” her vehicle. City and state officials dismiss those explanations and point to multiple bystander videos of the confrontation.

For Twin Cities residents, the crackdown can feel overwhelming.

“Enough is enough,” said Johan Baumeister, who came to the scene of Good’s death soon after the shooting to lay flowers.

He said he didn’t want to see the violent protests that shook Minneapolis after Floyd’s death, causing billions of dollars in damage. But this city has a long history of activism and protests, and he had no doubt there would be more.

“I think they’ll see Minneapolis show our rage again,” he predicted.

He was right.

In the days since, there have been repeated confrontations between activists and immigration officers. Most amounted to little more than shouted insults and taunting, with destruction mostly limited to broken windows, graffiti and some badly damaged federal vehicles.

But angry clashes now flare regularly across the Twin Cities. Some protesters clearly want to provoke the federal officers, throwing snowballs at them or screaming obscenities through bullhorns from just a couple feet away. The serious force, though, comes from immigration officers, who have broken car windows, pepper-sprayed protesters and warned observers not to follow them through the streets. Immigrants and citizens have been yanked from cars and homes and detained, sometimes for days. And most clashes end in tear gas.

Drivers in Minneapolis or St. Paul can now stumble across intersections blocked by men in body armor and gas masks, with helicopters clattering overhead and the air filled with the shriek of protesters' whistles.

Shovel your neighbor’s walk

In a state that prides itself on its decency, there’s something particularly Minnesotan about the protests,

Soon after Good was shot, Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat and regular Trump target, repeatedly said he was angry but also urged people to find ways to help their communities.

“It might be shoveling your neighbor’s walk,” he said. “It might mean being at a food bank. It might be pausing to talk to someone you haven’t talked to before.”

He and other leaders have pleaded with protesters to remain peaceful, warning that the White House was looking for a chance to crack down harder.

And when protests do become clashes, residents will often spill from their homes, handing out bottled water so people can flush tear gas from their eyes.

Residents stand watch at schools to warn immigrant parents if convoys approach while they're picking up their children. They take care packages to people too afraid to go out, and arrange rides for them to work and doctor's visits.

On Thursday, in the basement of a Lutheran church in St. Paul, the group Open Market MN assembled food packs for more than a hundred families staying home. Colin Anderson, the group’s outreach director, said the group has seen a surge in requests.

Sometimes, people don’t even understand what has happened to them.

Like Christian Molina from suburban Coon Rapids, who was driving through a Minneapolis neighborhood on a recent day, taking his car to a mechanic, when immigration officers began following him. He wonders if it's because he looks Hispanic.

They turned on their siren, but Molina kept driving, unsure who they were.

Eventually, the officers sped up, hit his rear bumper and both cars stopped. Two emerged and asked Molina for his papers. He refused, saying he’d wait for the police. Crowds began to gather, and a clash soon broke out, ending with tear gas.

So the officers left.

They left behind an angry, worried man who suddenly owned a sedan with a mangled rear fender.

Long after the officers were gone he had one final question.

“Who’s going to pay for my car?”

The patrols in Minneapolis mirror tactics that have emerged in other Democratic-run cities amid stepped-up immigration enforcement.","MINNEAPOLIS — Standing outside his son’s elementary school, a father heard a warning crackle over his walkie-talkie: a suspicious car nearby.

At another school, volunteer Joe Dirkswager stood watch, nodding at passing vehicles. Miles away in St. Paul, Matthew Kearns was questioning unfamiliar individuals near the school he graduated from decades ago.

The three are among the volunteers who have begun patrolling streets around elementary and high schools in the Twin Cities, using walkie-talkies, Signal group chats and whistles to warn families and school staff of immigration enforcement activities. The informal patrols have emerged amid a sharp surge of federal immigration personnel in Minnesota and the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer last week.

On Thursday afternoon, about two dozen adults lined the perimeter of Green Central Elementary School in central Minneapolis, just blocks from where Good was killed. Patrol volunteers scanned nearby streets and relayed updates in real time.

The father, Greg, a 42-year-old who asked that his last name not be published because of safety concerns for his family, said the patrols have forced families into impossible decisions on a daily basis.

“Every morning I feel like I’m forced with the choice of ‘Do I try to do patrol to protect my daughter and her preschool or do I come to my son’s kindergarten to do patrol here?’” he asked.

“Those are the kind of choices that the community is being faced with.”

Greg and eight other volunteers who spoke with NBC News said the patrols are especially aimed at protecting parents and school staff who are not U.S. citizens and fear being detained while coming and going from schools.

More than 3,000 federal immigration personnel have descended on Minnesota in recent weeks, and more than 2,500 undocumented immigrants have been apprehended in Minneapolis since November, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The enforcement push — dubbed Operation Metro Surge — follows renewed scrutiny of a state fraud investigation involving a number of individuals of Somali descent, a link that community leaders say has fueled fear beyond those accused.

The heightened enforcement has coincided with clashes between teachers, parents and federal law enforcement officers.

On Wednesday, a parent was detained by ICE at a school bus stop in Robbinsdale, a Minneapolis suburb, according to a statement from Robbinsdale Area Schools Superintendent Teri Staloch. And last week, on the day Good was killed, U.S. Border Patrol agents clashed with teachers and protesters at the nearby Roosevelt High School. At least one educator was detained and released, according to the teachers union.

In response to the disruptions, the Minneapolis Public School District said last week it would offer online classes to its roughly 30,000 students until Feb. 12. St. Paul Public Schools, which serves more than 30,000 students, said Thursday it would offer a similar online option and will close school several days next week to prepare.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children,” and that “criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest.”

“Our officers are highly trained and in the face of rioting, doxxing, and physical attacks, they have shown professionalism,” she added. “They are not afraid of loud noises and whistles.”

Bearing witness

Kearns, 56, said the heightened enforcement has been visible beyond the schools where organized patrols first appeared. On Friday afternoon, he drove around Riverview Elementary School on Minneapolis’ west side — which has a large Latino population — watching sites he said have become flashpoints in recent weeks.

“We have basically a Gestapo coming in and infiltrating our neighborhood and just doing whatever they feel like they want to do,” he said.

The sightings pushed Kearns to begin patrolling the area around his former school.

“I grew up, born and raised here, went to this school, played football here, kissed my wife when I was a little boy,” he said, pointing to a field on the school’s property. “We protect our kids in our community. I mean, that’s what every other community would do in this situation or any situation.”

As NBC News spoke with Kearns, a handful of volunteers — most of them parents — watched nearby. Several appeared visibly shaken, declining to discuss how the patrols were organized or how volunteers communicate, citing safety concerns about publicizing their plans. St. Paul Public Schools expressed gratitude for the “care and concern” from the community but noted the patrols are being organized independently. The Minneapolis Public School District did not immediately return a request for comment.

The patrols in Minneapolis mirror tactics that have emerged in other Democratic-run cities amid stepped-up immigration enforcement. In recent months, volunteers in cities including Chicago and Los Angeles have deployed similar patrols.

Leah Hood, 42, an instructor at a nearby university, said she started patrolling Green Central Elementary School this week after hearing from her friends who were already volunteering. She said the presence of observers feels crucial in a moment when families fear encounters could happen without witnesses.

“I mean, how horrifying that you would be kidnapped off the street while coming and going from school at all?” she asked. “But how much more horrifying and terrifying is it to think that that could happen and no one would see it, and no one would be able to attest to the fact that this is real, and they did this to you?”

Hood pointed to directives from state and local officials in recent days. Prosecutors have asked the public to submit videos related to Good’s killing, as much of the evidence gathered by the FBI remains inaccessible to local authorities. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this week encouraged Minnesotans to “peacefully film ICE agents as they conduct their activities.”

Kids scared and confused

Parents and teachers who spoke with NBC News said children have been fearful and confused amid the heightened enforcement.

Desiree, who has patrolled Green Central Elementary School for weeks and asked that her last name not be published due to safety concerns, said her son has repeatedly asked about law enforcement sightings nearby.

“It’s not a mystery to them that something terrible is happening and that it’s happening right around them,” she said.

Greg said the community, shaped by past trauma over George Floyd’s killing, has responded with solidarity.

“You get on this corner and all day long it’s just cars passing by, and everyone’s waving and saying ‘thank you’ because we’re all looking out for each other,” he said.

Dirkswager, 38, said the events last week compelled him to patrol Bancroft Elementary School in the Central neighborhood of Minneapolis, blocks away from where Floyd was murdered in 2020.

“The events last week pushed me to the point where I had to get outside and do something — even if it’s just standing on a corner and blowing my silly little whistle at federal agents that are driving by,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260116-minneapolis-Joe-Dirkswager-mn-2237-66403f.jpg",N,,2026-01-17 19:57:59.151012

ICE agents were seen running after two people of interest into the Garrahy Judicial Complex in Providence on Thursday.

Stephen Dennis, a Rhode Island attorney, saw the incident firsthand.

""Out of nowhere, ICE agents started chasing individuals, two young men, through the building from the back to the front. Started screaming, yelling at them to stop,"" he said. ""They had masks on, they had guns, and they breached the whole security around the court and ran right through, ran right past me, and several of us had to jump out of the way.""

Last week, a man previously arrested by ICE outside the Portsmouth Police Department was due in Newport Superior Court but did not show up.

Advocates say ICE agents were outside court on that day as well.

The arrest was caught on surveillance cameras outside the station and released to the public from Portsmouth police.

A warrant for the arrest of 29-year-old Josue Perez Gomez was later issued.

Across the country, some immigrants have been skipping their court hearings out of fear that ICE agents will arrest and detain them.

""I've had some that don't want to pursue claims because they would have to show up at court,"" Dennis said when asked if he has clients who are concerned about showing up to court out of fear of ICE agents.

Advocates are asking the Rhode Island court system to allow people to hold their hearings virtually so that they don’t have to worry about showing up at court and finding ICE there to detain them.

""They have an absolute right to be heard in these proceedings. In workers' comp cases we don't make a distinction whether you're a documented or an undocumented. So they're entitled to it,"" Dennis said. ""I think it's ridiculous and immature that we don't allow it.""

Some Rhode Island Republicans are staunchly against the idea of virtual court hearings.

""For me that would feel a bit obstructionist for the judiciary to do that,"" Senate Minority Leader Jessica de la Cruz said.

""It's not just bad policy. It's deliberate. It's dangerous. And it's a calculated attempt to shield criminal illegal aliens from deportation,"" Anthony d'Ellena said.

""These people have nothing to fear if they're here legally,"" he said when asked about ICE agents detaining immigrants with legal status. ""If you're here illegally, you deserve to be deported. You broke the law coming into this country and you need to leave.""

The discussion around state immigration policy comes as there are renewed concerns about federal funding being withheld from Rhode Island.

In August, the Department of Justice released a memo threatening to cut off federal funding from ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" who they ""identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

Rhode Island is on the list.

""I certainly don't think that the administration would look at the judiciary here in Rhode Island and say, oh, well, that's okay. They would look at it just the same as the cities and towns who count themselves as sanctuary cities,"" de la Cruz said. ""It's like you know, don't play cute games. The administration has said if you try to obstruct us we will halt funding and if we don't want funding halted to our state then we need to comply with federal law.""

""Rhode Island refuses to follow federal law and should not receive a dime federal funding if we do not comply,"" D'Ellena said, adding, ""President Trump's Feb. 1st cut off on funding to sanctuary states is exactly what we need"" to compel the Rhode Island state legislature to adjust the state's sanctuary city policies.

""Rhode Islanders pay federal taxes to participate in federal programs, and we fully expect those dollars to flow back to Rhode Island through those federal programs,"" Gov. Dan McKee's office said in a statement to NBC 10. ""Attempts to arbitrarily withhold these taxpayer funds have been repeatedly struck down by the courts.""",https://turnto10.com/resources/media2/16x9/608/1320/0x124/90/30d0a760-081b-49c0-a6e0-737be14a40a9-Screenshot20260115194849.png,N,,2026-01-17 21:58:22.745820

Anti-ICE protesters force back small group of far-right activists

No injuries reported, but influencer says vest blocked stabbing attempt

Thousands of ICE agents deployed to Minneapolis

MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-ICE protesters in Minneapolis chased off a small group of far-right activists who had vowed to march on a neighborhood where many immigrants live on Saturday, stoking tensions in a city on edge after the killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent 10 days ago.

Waving signs and screaming chants that called for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to leave Minneapolis, the anti-ICE protesters gathered downtown near City Hall. Scores of them moved forward, forcing about 10 far-right demonstrators against the outside of the municipal government center within minutes. Some in the crowd tossed water balloons that soaked the right-wing demonstrators as temperatures hit -4 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 Celsius) with the wind chill.

Police maintained their distance as the dueling protests played out. About an hour after the rallies began, the tiny contingent of right-wing activists quickly walked a few blocks away to a hotel, hounded by hundreds of anti-ICE protesters who screamed obscenities and told them to get out of the city. A few scuffles broke out, but Reuters did not observe any serious violence.

ONLINE INFLUENCER REPORTS STABBING ATTEMPT

Jake Lang, an online right-wing influencer and one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, organized what he called an “anti-fraud” rally. At no point could Lang's voice be heard by the crowd.

Later, Lang posted on X that he was stabbed during a scuffle but that his protective vest blocked the attempt. Reuters could not verify his account.

Minneapolis police said in an email to Reuters they were aware of Lang's social media post, but no official report had been filed with the department. Police had received no reports of injuries related to the protests from victims.

Camera feeds showed some people who appeared to be injured, police said, but those individuals left before officers could contact them.

The anti-ICE protest was organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump.

Trump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota. The president and administration officials have repeatedly singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants.

""We're here to support our Somali neighbors; they asked for their white allies to show up for them,"" said Laura, 56, who, like all protesters interviewed, asked that their last name not be used for fear of retribution by the federal government. ""I'm here to exercise my First Amendment right because my neighbors can't, they're too afraid to leave their house.""

Lang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure the U.S. for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week and has targeted Somali immigrants, most of whom are Muslim.

Some 3,000 agents from ICE and Border Patrol have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, after she drove away after being ordered by ICE agents to exit her vehicle. The officer who shot Good was positioned in front of her car on the left. DHS has said he was hit by the car and feared for his life, though videos show the agent remaining on his feet and raise questions about how much contact the car made with him.

The situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

In the case of Good, ICE has maintained the narrative that they were acting in self-defense, even though they had surrounded her vehicle and threatened her before she attempted to drive away.

As with the earlier court rulings that reaffirmed the right to record ICE agents, however, those decisions provided little deterrent for them to use a thin pretext to target immigrants and neighborhood volunteers.","The suddenness, scale and violence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids over the last year have prompted neighborhoods and volunteers to either record raids in progress or preemptively stand guard near areas where raids might take place, such as schools with immigrant children. This accountability led to the numerous videos that captured the moment when ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week, sparking a nationwide outpouring of anger and grief.

Good had been monitoring an elementary school as students were being dropped off before Ross stepped in front of her vehicle and shot her. Human and civil rights advocates who spoke to Salon have called this a classic example of law enforcement foisting on their victim a “deadly dilemma,” forcing the person to appear as aggressive or insubordinate and giving agents an excuse to react violently.

Before Good’s death, other civilians across the country who were recording or watching ICE had been threatened, physically assaulted and arrested, amplifying the sense among critics that ICE officers, the broader law enforcement establishment and the Trump administration view themselves as above the law and capable of getting away with it.

Nevertheless, critics say that ICE, Customs and Border Protection and other institutions have followed a similar playbook used by police states, maintaining the thinnest pretexts to justify their behavior in a way that gives, in theory, plausible deniability, and signals to critics that they’re too powerful to need a perfect alibi.

“They typically cite these vague concepts of obstruction, interference with an investigation, incitement in protest cases, entirely inapplicable statutes, presumably to sound official,” Seth Stern, advocacy director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, told Salon. “Let’s say somebody is following an ICE vehicle to record what the officers are doing, which does not actually fall under a stalking statute, to state the obvious. It is not stalking to follow a law enforcement officer to document what they’re up to — that’s constitutionally protected conduct. But more often than not, ICE officials on the ground, and higher-ups alike, will cite those loose concepts to intimidate and later justify their actions on social media or unofficial statements.”

“If anything, I’ve seen people reaffirm their commitment to continue documenting ICE and CBP activity because they see it as an essential form of holding on to whatever justice and democracy still exists.”

Federal court rulings have reaffirmed the right of citizens to observe and record police activity in public areas under the First Amendment. Civilians with little knowledge of statutes and court rulings or experience in dealing with law enforcement have proven, in many documented cases, to be fairly resilient against those kinds of tactics. But generally, they still operate with fewer defenses than professional journalists, and might, due to uncertainty over repercussions, put away their camera or delete their footage when confronted by an armed officer.

Organizations like Carolina Migrant Network and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) have been working to not only educate people about their rights when filming or watching ICE agents, but train them on how to effectively document the evidence while avoiding personal injury and unlawful arrest.

In one video, LULAC advises recorders to keep their camera focused on agents rather than their victims, verbally narrate the facts, strategically capture key information like badges and street signs, and potentially limited themselves to note-taking and other support roles while someone less at risk handles the recording. While some people might find themselves as unexpected witnesses of an ICE raid, other volunteers, such as those working with the Carolina Migrant Network, have formed or joined rapid-response text groups to coordinate movement and to be able to arrive on-site soon after an alert goes out.

“What happened in Minneapolis could have happened here in Charlotte, could have happened in Chicago, could have happened anywhere. It wasn’t shocking to folks who have been doing the work for a long time, because they’ve witnessed firsthand what ICE is capable of doing,” Stefania Arteaga, co-founder and co-director of the Carolina Migrant Network, told Salon. “If anything, I’ve seen people reaffirm their commitment to continue documenting ICE and CBP activity because they see it as an essential form of holding on to whatever justice and democracy still exists.”

The widespread protests over Good’s death are an example of just how far people have been pushed, but Arteaga expressed her wish that such outrage could be found earlier.

“There was a prevailing attitude that everything was good and dandy again until we found ourselves once again under a Trump administration where we’re being forced to confront the history of the United States and their treatment of immigrants and other minority groups,” she said. “More than before, white America is reckoning with the fact that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security didn’t start under Trump. But the fact that it took this long really shows the lack of humanity that is given to immigrants, immigrant voices, immigrant stories and immigrant life.”

During the Obama and Biden administrations and the first Trump administration, ICE used family separation, raids and physical and verbal aggression against immigrants, but were more prone to brush off witnesses as mere annoyances. The second Trump administration has overseen a marked increase in permissibility for particularly brazen actions, with the Department of Homeland Security making it official policy to prosecute those who videotape ICE agents and post the content on social media. While federal courts have usually ruled against newer or intensified ICE policy as unconstitutional or in violation of existing statutes, ICE has found ways to continue forcefully handling any perceived threats to their mission.

In the case of Good, ICE has maintained the narrative that they were acting in self-defense, even though they had surrounded her vehicle and threatened her before she attempted to drive away. The tactics ICE used against Good are recognizable across the country against people who may have narrowly avoided her fate. Sometimes, agents would issue contradictory orders which would force someone to risk serious danger either way; other times, they might trap cars, snatch people’s phones, and otherwise escalate the intensity of a confrontation, hoping, critics say, to make their victim panic.

“I had a scenario where an agent called the police on me. They are intentionally trying to frame the situation in ways that are completely disingenuous,” Arteaga recalled.

Meanwhile, state legislatures across the country have passed bills designed to codify limitations on the ability of civilians to hold ICE and law enforcement accountable. One popular proposal has been to ban recording police activity within a certain distance — usually around 25 feet. Those laws, which go far beyond punishing actual obstruction and interference, have largely been struck down by the courts as unconstitutional. As with the earlier court rulings that reaffirmed the right to record ICE agents, however, those decisions provided little deterrent for them to use a thin pretext to target immigrants and neighborhood volunteers.

“Law enforcement agencies are all public institutions, and allowing the wider public to see what they’re doing and potentially object to what they’re doing and recognize that what they’re doing is wrong is not legally actionable interference,” Stern said. “That’s the purpose of good journalism, to expose wrongdoing and alert the public that their officials are not behaving as they should.”

“To the extent that officers consider journalism in and of itself to be obstruction,” he continued, “those are probably officers who should be obstructed.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2026/01/ice-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-GettyImages-2255783416.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:08.166633

This year threatens to be the one that makes or breaks the unique moral commitment to human rights that has underpinned, even when flawed, the global order for the past 80 years.

Instead, the message sent around the world by bombastic leaders, acted out by mobs, armies and militias and embedded into the technology that shapes daily life, is that some people are less than human, deserve less empathy, compassion, opportunity or even physical safety.

This is potentially even more dangerous than the implosion of the “international rules-based order”. It normalises heinous behaviour towards other human beings in a world that has never had greater capacity for self-destruction.

You hear it everywhere. The tone is set when the US President declares some people are scum or a Cameroonian “freedom fighter” succinctly says his opponents, “don’t see us as human. Likewise we don’t see them as [human]”.

Australia, thanks to the work of Labor party leader Doc Evatt, was one of the midwives of the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But Australia remains the only liberal democracy not to have adopted its own constitutional or statutory bill of rights. Instead there is a patchwork of local laws and international agreements.

For all the talk about Australian values this absence is a telling reminder of the fragility of our rights as citizens and human beings.

This has come into sharp focus in the debate after the Bondi attack, and the implosion of the Adelaide writers’ week.

In the rush to blame, the principle is lost. When the threat feels existential, pluralism is attacked and tolerance as a virtue derided.

The Australian commitment to human rights is always subject to political whim. Legislation protecting rights has been voided to allow racially charged laws to pass, including the Northern Territory intervention. States that have legislated to recognise rights, readily vacate the legislation to remove them from some groups – most frequently First Nations people.

After years of work, legislation asserting the rights of artists – something that had been promised in the last South Australian election campaign – was introduced in 2025. But the parliament ran out of time to pass it. Among the principles outlined in the bill was that “all artists, makers and creatives in South Australia have the right to freedom of artistic and creative expression.” If this had been enacted, would it have changed the ground rules, and meant the conundrum played out differently?

Last year, in recognition of the increasing fragility of the international commitment to human rights, the government appointed former attorney general and sitting MP Mark Dreyfus as an International Human Rights envoy.

It would be good if he started his advocacy at home.

Given that the consensus is that Australian constitutional change is just too hard, a statutory bill of rights could have symbolic as well as practical impact. It would also strengthen Australian advocacy in a world where human rights are increasingly derided.

This is not just a legal debate: human rights and empathy touch everything.

In the tick-box world mediated by AI, it is likely to become even more pervasive. We know that the selection biases of technology are increasingly excluding people, ensuring that the world order as it exists in the minds of technocrats is imposed on us all. They generally don’t do empathy or pay attention to people not like them.

Much of the time we can work around this, but sometimes it is accentuated.

Over the summer break I had two experiences that threw this into stark relief. Not the grand infringements of human rights that capture the headlines, but mundane encounters that point to the banal cruelty of a data-driven world in which empathy has evaporated and shades of grey no longer exist.

In response to one of those slightly threatening Robodebt-inflected Centrelink letters I waited until I had the time to sit on a call – last time it took three hours – and was pleasantly surprised that after 38 minutes a human answered.

I provided the required case number and then said, “But the person has died.”

The operator proceeded, “Can you spell his name again … and the birth date … the reference number.” I did this, and then added, “I know you are working to a script, but when someone tells you the client has died, it would be appropriate to pass on your condolences.”

“Oh yes,” he replied, “You are right. I am working to a script, we don’t have that option.”

“Well in the interests of training and quality control I hope this call is recorded and that is fixed,” I said.

“I’m sorry,” the operator replied, and without missing a beat we continued to populate the form with the details the script required.

A few weeks earlier a brilliant young colleague, educated to the highest level in the Stem disciplines, said with unnerving clarity when discussing whether to appeal a questionable driving fine: “I don’t like to rely on human intervention.”

If we give up on human intervention, the technocrats have won. There will be even less room for human rights in the world they are crafting in the name of efficiency and profit, under a cover of bombastic rhetoric. It’s not a fight we can afford to lose.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e848919432d279e7f9dc018c50d5274afb17b49/0_0_3804_3044/master/3804.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7063f166142a8219f493d8d1ad6460c4",N,,2026-01-17 17:57:12.441872

As protests escalated following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, the Trump administration defended the agent and doubled down on its efforts in the Minneapolis area, sending in more resources.

Trump has also threatened to the extreme step of invoking the Insurrection Act to clamp down on the protests and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has suggested people may be asked to “validate their identity” in some cases.

Here are some of the most common questions, answered.

What is the Insurrection Act?

The law that Trump is threatening to invoke would allow him to deploy active-duty US troops to Minnesota as “necessary to enforce (US) laws or to suppress the rebellion.”

The law says the president can send troops to control situations they consider to be “unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States.”

A state governor or legislature can also request troops — as was the case the last time the law was invoked in 1992 — but Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has openly rebuked the surge of federal activity in Minneapolis.

There is precedent of a president invoking the act without the support of a governor.

Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy both invoked the Insurrection Act against the wishes of governors in order to facilitate school integration after the Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling.

On Friday, Trump said there’s no reason to use the Insurrection Act “right now,” but that he’d invoke the law if he felt it were necessary.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it. It’s very powerful,” the president told reporters.

Read CNN’s Zachary B. Wolf’s analysis of the Insurrection Act here.

What authority has the Trump administration given to federal agents?

Immigration agents can use deadly force against someone who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, according to a DHS policy. Historically, federal law enforcement agencies have spent weeks or even months conducting exhaustive investigations before deciding whether an agent’s use of force was appropriate.

But Trump administration officials have rushed to offer full-throated defenses of immigration agents after high-profile use of force, raising questions about whether mechanisms meant to hold law enforcement accountable for wrongdoing have been abandoned in Trump’s second term, writes CNN’s Josh Campbell.

The administration has argued agents are immune to prosecution by state or local officials. And any federal prosecutions seem unlikely, Campbell writes, due to Trump’s installation of political loyalists atop the Justice Department and FBI.

In August, during the federal takeover of the Washington, DC, police department, Trump effectively gave law enforcement a green light to use force that may far outpace the severity of the circumstances, according to Campbell.

While lamenting images he claimed to have seen showing protesters spitting on officers, Trump said in August, “I said, ‘You tell them, “You spit, and we hit,”’ and they can hit real hard,” Trump said. “And they’re standing there, and people are spitting in their face, and they’re not allowed to do anything.”

“But now,” he added, “they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”

A similar carte blanche signal is being sent to ICE officers and other federal agencies assisting in Trump’s immigration crackdown, DOJ insiders have told CNN.

Read more of Campbell’s analysis on federal agents’ powers here.

Can federal agents ask to see proof of citizenship?

Noem said Thursday that federal agents may also ask people around someone they’re targeting to “validate their identity.”

“If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are and why they’re there, and having them validate their identity,” Noem said. “That’s what we’ve always done.”

Is this legal? CNN’s senior legal analyst Elie Honig said, “It’s illegal and it’s unconstitutional to require people to show their citizenship papers without some other basis to make a stop.”

“What you cannot do is just go arbitrarily up to people or set up a checkpoint or go door to door and say, ‘Hey, you need to prove to us that you’re a US citizen,’” Honig added. “The immigration officer needs to have some reasonable suspicion. You cannot just arbitrarily approach people and make them prove that they are in fact here legally.”

Cori Alonso-Yoder, an associate professor at University of Maryland law school, told CNN federal agents can ask for proof of citizenship, but people can resist showing their documents under the Fifth Amendment.

“ICE certainly can ask and then the question is, then, how does an individual in that circumstance respond,” Yoder, who is also the director of the law school’s immigration clinic, said. “Because there are protections under the Fifth Amendment, regardless of immigration status, to not incriminate oneself or to again assert one’s right to remain silent when engaging with law enforcement.”

What is the 10th Amendment, which Minnesota has invoked to block federal agents?

On Monday, Minnesota filed a lawsuit seeking to curb the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown in the state, arguing that it violates the 10th Amendment.

Illinois has also filed a similar lawsuit.

Michele Goodwin, professor of constitutional law at Georgetown University, told CNN the 10th Amendment established that states retain sovereign power to make local laws and govern within their borders, and the federal government cannot impose its will over a state, unless that authority has been granted by Congress or the Constitution.

In its lawsuit, Minnesota emphasized strains on local police resources, asserting that Minneapolis and Saint Paul have been forced to divert officers from their usual duties to respond to incidents involving federal immigration enforcement, undermining local efforts to protect the community.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said earlier this week that the state’s lawsuit is aimed squarely at what he described as unlawful federal overreach, not at blocking immigration enforcement itself.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2255776689.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-17 17:57:40.243693

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez prevents the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from arresting or detaining people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of 3,000 immigration officers and agents here. The Reformer talked to a protester who was detained for hours on Sunday and never charged.

The federal agents can no longer use pepper spray or other nonlethal munitions against people engaged in peaceful protest. They cannot stop or detain drivers where there is no “reasonable, articulable suspicion” that they are interfering.

ICE observers are frequently following cars they suspect are being driven by federal officers, tracking them, entering vehicle descriptions into a database and discouraging them from making immigrant arrests. The judge declared this legal and a protected activity: “The act of safely following (federal agents) at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop.”

The ruling comes out of a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU.

The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year as the agency ramped up raids in Minnesota, especially in the state’s large Somali community.

Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs, pulled up to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer.

“I was genuinely afraid I was being kidnapped,” Tincher said at a press conference last year.

The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_661-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 18:58:10.364417

Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals. We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.” – Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” April 16, 1963

""Sometimes, we were learning, we had to hold hands and walk forward into the darkness, even when we didn't know what the next step would bring. Walking by faith wasn't easy. But it was taking us places where the rules of organizing had not allowed us to go. No one knew just what we were becoming, but we knew one thing for sure: there was no turning back.""

— Rev. Willam J. Barber, The Third Reconstruction

“I have told the clergy…that we may be entering into that same witness. And I've asked them to get their affairs in order—to make sure they have their wills written, because it may be that now is no longer the time for statements, but for us with our bodies to stand between the powers of this world and the most vulnerable. And it may mean that we are going to have to act in a new way…to put our faith in the God of life, of resurrection, of a love that is stronger than death itself.” – Bishop Rob Hirschfeld, Episcopal Diocese of NH, at a Concord vigil for Renee Nicole Good, January 9, 2026

January 17, 2026

Welcome to Martin Luther King weekend! Let us ground ourselves in the wisdom, courage and examples – past and present – of nonviolent and life-affirming movements for justice and peace. It will be nourishment for our spirits to be together at one or more of the many MLK community celebrations throughout the state. Here’s a good list (NHPR), and scroll down to the Events section for some highlights. We thank our friend Arnie Alpert for sharing the story with the NH Center for Justice & Equity of how NH people organized over decades (!) to establish this important holiday.

Read more about the statewide MLK Coalition’s celebration on Monday, January 19 in Manchester, where former NH Senator Melanie Levesque will receive the Martin Luther King award for her tireless leadership for voting rights, public education, and racial justice (read more here). NH Representative Alice Wade, a courageous champion for the rights of transgender people and civil rights for all, will receive the Vanessa Johnson Youth Award.

We were sad to learn last week of the passing of Claudette Colvin at the age of 86. At 15 years old, and already a student of active nonviolence, Claudette refused to give up her seat on the bus, nine months before Rosa Parks’ act of dignified defiance would launch the Montgomery bus boycott. “I felt like Sojourner Truth was pushing down on one shoulder and Harriet Tubman was pushing down on the other – saying. ‘Sit down girl!’ I was glued to my seat.” Read more about Claudette here. We at AFSC-NH have fond memories of welcoming Claudette to NH for our annual celebration back in 2009.

Strong opposition to death penalty bills

While last week’s public hearings on death penalty bills began in a chaotic fashion – due to an overscheduled daily calendar in the House Criminal Justice Committee, and outrageous speeches by bill sponsors – the messages delivered by members of the public to lawmakers were sacred testimonies of compassion, courage, and love. The most powerful voices were those of the family members of murder victims and other victims of violence – including the sisters and daughter of the late and beloved Renny Cushing, New England Yearly Meeting secretary Noah Merrill, NH Council of Churches executive director Lisa Beaudoin, and many others. Committee members also heard from Paul Hildwin, who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent three decades on death row in Florida. Hear some of his story here (WMUR).

In addition, compelling testimony was provided about the extraordinary financial cost and complexity of the infrastructure and procedures for capital punishment, and the lack of deterrent effects. No one except bill sponsors spoke in favor of the bills.

You can listen to the hearings here: January 14 (starting at 5:48:30), and January 15. And you’ll find news coverage at NHPR and InDepthNH. We also want to lift up an op-ed from our NH Program Associate, Ophelia Burnett: “The death penalty is inhumane - the ultimate form of slavery.”

In related news, the NH Attorney General argued last week that the death penalty sentence in Michael Addison’s murder conviction is “not excessive, nor disproportionate.” Read more here. Michael Addison, an African-American man convicted in the 2006 shooting death of police officer Michael Briggs, is still on death row in NH despite the 2019 repeal.

ICE activity expands in NH

Approximately 45 people gathered at the Strafford County jail in Dover on Friday in a vigil of solidarity with the family of Oscar Gutierrez Cardona, an immigrant who is being sent to Honduras this week, a place he fled many years ago in order to save his life. Oscar’s deportation leaves his wife and children without a beloved husband and father, and leaves the Manchester community he called home to mourn his absence and the injustice of his removal. Read more here and here. We are heartbroken, angry, and committed to continuing our resistance to the cruelty and violence of detention and deportation.

We’re frustrated to report that another NH town – Auburn – has signed a 287g agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), enabling more law enforcement collusion with the violent and often lawless actions of ICE. Auburn’s decision brings the number of NH law enforcement agencies with 287g agreements to 13, and to 14 in all of New England, a shameful tally. Read more here, and learn more about the efforts of our indefatigable colleagues at ACLU-NH to obtain the training materials 287g participants. New Hampshire people have a right to know how our locally funded law enforcement agencies will be ‘prepared’ to participate in the federal government’s mass deportation machine.

And one more bit of grim news on the immigration front – it appears that a site may have been secured for the rumored ICE “processing center” planned for Merrimack, NH, although local officials are still unwilling to confirm the news. Read more here. As many who testified last week in support of HB 1609, a commonsense bill that would prohibit the use of state or local funds for immigration detention, explained, there’s no good reason for local or state dollars to support a massively over-funded federal operation, especially in a state facing a “grim” budget picture. Read more here. Not to mention the moral arguments against our participation.

Here are the action alerts we’ve received from partners for this coming week.

Today – Protect transgender rights.

OPPOSE SB 268, permitting classification of individuals based on biological sex under certain limited circumstances. This bill was a retained bill from 2025. The House passed it on January 8, and now it heads to Governor Ayotte. This bill is nearly identical to the so-called “bathroom bill” she vetoed last spring. Please call the governor and urge her to VETO it (603-271-2121).

Tuesday, January 20 – Protect immigrant tenants, and all tenants

OPPOSE HB 1499, relative to additional grounds for eviction under the landlord and tenant statute. This anti-immigrant bill adds new grounds for termination of tenancy based on a tenant’s immigration status, and certain criminal convictions. Here is an explainer of key points. This bill has a public hearing in the House Housing Committee on Tuesday, January 20 at 10 AM in GP, Room 231. This is a priority bill; please sign in to oppose, and show up to share testimony. And please share this flyer with your networks.

OPPOSE HB 1598, relative to notice for tenants and landlords engaged in eviction processes. This dangerous bill would lead to a dramatic erosion of tenant rights and increase in evictions. You can share these two flyers – here and here – to inform and mobilize your networks. Here is an explainer of key points. This bill has a public hearing in the House Housing Committee on Tuesday, January 20 at 11 AM in GP, Room 231. This is a priority bill; please sign in to oppose, and show up to share testimony.

Tuesday, January 20 – Take action to protect voting rights.

Wednesday, January 21 – Protect marriage equality.

SUPPORT CACR 25, a proposed amendment to the NH constitution that would establish marriage as a fundamental civil right in the Granite State. This protection will be essential as the Supreme Court’s Obergefell decision gets challenged at the federal level. This positive bill has a public hearing in the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, January 21 at 11:30 AM in GP, Room 230. Please sign in to support, and share testimony to urge our lawmakers to enshrine marriage equality in the NH Constitution! For more information, contact 603 Equality.

Thursday, January 22 – Protect public education.

OPPOSE SB 581, modifying education freedom account (EFA) eligibility and removing priority guidelines and the enrollment cap relative to EFA eligibility. This harmful bill would remove any cap on the number of school vouchers. It has a hearing in the Senate Education Finance Committee on Thursday, January 22 at 11:25 AM, in Room 103, SH.

Friday, January 23 - Protect Death Penalty Repeal!

Due to a scheduling mess in the House Criminal Justice Committee last week, three of the death penalty bills have new hearing dates next week. This means we have more time to sign in to oppose these bills, contact the committee, and share testimony. Here are the details for how to take action: Show up in person to sign-in in opposition and submit your written testimony, or sign-in remotely, no later than midnight on January 23, to OPPOSE the three bills – HB 1749, reinstating the death penalty for murder offenses; HB 1413, reinstituting the death penalty in cases of capital murder; and HB 1737, relative to reinstating the death penalty for certain offenses against minors under 13 years of age.

Wearing a neon green vest and equipped with a whistle and walkie-talkie, Brown, an 81-year-old retired lawyer who lives nearby, kept his head on a swivel. His eyes were taking in each passing car and pedestrian near the campus as he stood ready to sound the alarm should federal immigration personnel approach the school, which teaches in English and Spanish and is around the corner from the spot where Good died.

""I never did like bullies, and that's what the federal government has become,"" Brown said, explaining why an octogenarian stood outside for four hours in -2 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chill (-19 Celsius). ""What's happening in my city is nothing more than authoritarian intimidation, and me and my neighbors are not going to put up with it.""

PARENTS PATROL SCHOOLS

The Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 federal agents across the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, making it the latest region targeted by the president's mass deportation program. People who normally might be organizing parent-teacher association meetings are arranging security patrols at their kids' schools to watch for immigration agents.

Some parents not on patrol are escorting foreign-born teachers or staff members, driving them to and from their homes and schools to make them feel safer. Others are delivering groceries and prescription medicines to immigrant families who are too afraid to leave their homes or send their kids to class.

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat representing Minnesota, said on Friday she had met with school principals from her state ""and heard horror stories of kids and parents 'under siege' by ICE.""

""Little kids scared. Dangerous encounters. This is no longer about a fraud investigation,"" Klobuchar wrote on social media, as she urged residents to remain peaceful.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, said this week more than 2,500 people have been arrested during the effort that officials have dubbed Operation Metro Surge. DHS has repeatedly said its agents are not targeting schools.

“ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. ""Criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense. If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened.""

But parents and school leaders say otherwise.

A spokesperson for Saint Paul Public Schools said in a statement that two of its contracted student transportation vans were pulled over by ICE agents this week. Several schools and daycare centers have emailed parents to notify them of teachers and staff who have been detained, according to school leaders and parents.

SOME STUDENTS LEARNING ONLINE

Schools have notified the public that some parents have been detained at bus stops after dropping off kids. Border Patrol agents clashed with protesters on the grounds of Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis as classes ended, just a few hours after Good was shot and killed. DHS said the clash followed agents' pursuit of someone who had rammed one of their vehicles several miles away and fled to the school grounds.

Several school districts — including those in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the state's two largest — have cancelled classes some days and are allowing students to learn online instead of attending classes in person for the next several weeks in response to the immigration operations.

“Many families in my area are afraid to send their kids to school because ICE is staking out our bus stops,” state Representative Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn, a Democrat and co-chair of the Minnesota House of Representatives' Children and Families Finance and Policy Committee, told the Star Tribune newspaper.

Nate Byrne, a spokesperson for Kids Count on Us, a coalition of 500 community-based childcare centers in Minnesota, said it is receiving daily reports about ICE officers on or near childcare center grounds, and that such centers in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods have seen a 50% reduction in attendance.

Kids Count on Us has received reports of childcare workers taken into ICE custody, Byrne said, though he did not have specific figures.

PARENTS DELIVER FOOD, RAISE MONEY

""Parents who are not fearful of being detained by ICE — typically because they are white — are forming teams to patrol outside their childcare centers during drop-off and pick-up and when staff need to come and go,"" Byrne said. ""Parents who are fearful of being detained by ICE due to the color of their skin are being extremely cautious.""

St. Paul parent Kelly, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, citing fears of retribution from the federal government, said she was helping deliver food to immigrant families that attend her children's school but were afraid to leave their homes. Parents are also raising money to help pay rent for the families across the metro area, as the parents are missing work, according to Kelly and other parents.

Kelly, who was attending a Friday night protest against ICE with her husband and two children, ages 6 and 9, said she was bewildered by what has become of her city amid the immigration raids. In years past, she volunteered for parent-teacher association events. Now, she carries a whistle everywhere she goes and said she is ready to confront federal agents if they approach her kids' school.

""There's no parenting handbook for this,"" Kelly said. ""My parents never had to sit me down and explain that my classmates who are suddenly missing from school aren't there because their parents are afraid of being snatched by the government.""

The increase in Rapid Response reports indicates ""there’s heightened interest in protecting our neighbors,"" Roberts said.
""I'd rather falsely assume someone is ICE than falsely assume that they’re not ICE,"" said Maggie Carswell, a Tucson community organizer.
Carrasco said she's been heartened by the swell of support for Derechos Humanos and groups working to monitor and observe ICE activity here.","The phones at Sunnyside High School were ringing with calls from concerned parents on Thursday afternoon, as false reports of immigration agents on campus spread on social media, school officials said.

In fact, Sunnyside High and Los Amigos Elementary went into a precautionary ""soft lockdown"" Thursday — with the perimeter gates locked, but classes still in session — due to a nearby law enforcement operation on Tucson's south side.

Immigration agents were never on campus, and students were not at risk, said Marisela Felix, school district spokesperson.

The incident was one of several incorrect social-media reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Tucson in recent weeks.

Amid the federal government's violent crackdown in Minneapolis, and reports of an impending escalation of ICE enforcement in Phoenix, anxiety is surging among Tucson's immigrant and advocacy communities, advocates say.

Some false rumors have circulated online, and there's been an increase in reports of ICE sightings — some valid, some false alarms — to the local ""Rapid Response"" network, which sends trained observers to bear witness to potential ICE arrests.

Local advocates say they're working to balance the need for an urgent response to good-faith reports of ICE activity, with making efforts to verify initial reports when possible.

It's hard to say if there's been a true surge in ICE activity here this month, or if heightened awareness is leading to more reports, some volunteers say. But likely it's both, said Sarah Roberts, an immigrant-rights advocate and volunteer with Tucson's Coalición de Derechos Humanos, or Human Rights Coalition.

ICE is definitely active in Tucson, Roberts said, noting the hotline got a call Tuesday from a woman who said her husband had just been arrested by ICE and was seeking legal help.

Photos shared Friday by a Facebook user show three agents, wearing green vests that say, ""POLICE/ICE,"" at the Tucson Spectrum shopping center on West Irvington Road.

The increase in Rapid Response reports indicates ""there’s heightened interest in protecting our neighbors,"" Roberts said. ""That's a good thing.""

Immigration agents carry out arrests quickly and are often gone before observers with Rapid Response can arrive; advocates don't want community members to hesitate to report possible ICE activity for fear of making an incorrect report.

""I'd rather falsely assume someone is ICE than falsely assume that they’re not ICE,"" said Maggie Carswell, a Tucson community organizer.

Still, there's a real risk of burnout for activists and members of the immigrant community, who are often in a sustained state of hyper-vigilance, Roberts said. There's also a risk of ""secondary trauma"" from witnessing enforcement actions, she said.

Sunnyside officials are encouraging members of the public to be prudent about what they share online, as unverified rumors can cause unnecessary stress and confusion.

""False rumors have been circulating on social media claiming that 'ICE was at Sunnyside High School.' This is not true,"" Felix said in a Thursday email. ""We ask parents and our community to be part of the solution, and to be aware of the serious consequences of resharing information on social media that is not reliable and from a verified source.""

Local officials have been trying to prepare the public for a possible deployment of National Guard or other federal authorities to the area, though no such deployment has been announced.

ICE's media team has not responded to the Arizona Daily Star’s query about whether more ICE agents will soon be sent to Phoenix or Tucson.

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero directed city staff to create a website to help members of the public know their rights and prepare for potential encounters with federal agents.

Pima County Attorney Laura Conover urged Tucson residents to stay calm during interactions with federal agents and during protest activity.

""Here in Pima County, we expect our community members and our own local police to be safe from recklessness,"" Conover said in a written statement Monday. ""And to that end, I am urging our community not to meet recklessness with more recklessness. We must be smart and fight fire, not with more fire but with water. ... We must move in ways that are wise and pray that keeps us all alive.""

Operation on the south side

The law-enforcement operation near Sunnyside Thursday was led by the U.S. Marshals Service, part of the Arizona ""Wanted"" Task Force that targets violent offenders, U.S. Deputy Marshal Mindy Miller told the Star. The task force comprises local, state and federal agencies.

Border Patrol agents were present at the scene, near the intersection of South Campbell Avenue and Drexel, Miller said.

The Jan. 15 operation targeted Jorge Cardenas-Valencia, who is in the U.S. illegally and was wanted in Pima County on multiple criminal counts: transport of narcotic drugs for sale, misconduct involving weapons in the commission of a drug offense, use of wire communication in the commission of a drug offense, conspiracy, illegally conducting an enterprise and misconduct involving weapons of a prohibited possessor, Miller said in an email.

Maria Carrasco, a leader in Derechos Humanos and Rapid Response, was among those who responded to the scene of the south-side operation before details were known.

Rapid Response has been receiving dozens of calls each day, and Carrasco said she's trying to personally respond to as many reports as she can.

""We are all stressed like crazy. There's 10 of us answering the phone. I had more than 20 calls on my phone today,"" she said Thursday.

Carrasco said she's been heartened by the swell of support for Derechos Humanos and groups working to monitor and observe ICE activity here.

A recent training session for new volunteers was ""a full house,"" Carrasco said. That's good news, she said, because current volunteers are stretched thin.

""We have to be careful because we’re going to get burned out,"" she said. ""I'm very proud the community is coming together with one voice to protect our families and our community. ... I'm very hopeful that we’re going to change this government to the right side.""

Since the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Minneapolis mother Renee Good by an ICE agent, some advocates are newly fearing for their own lives and safety, said Lucia Vindiola, a volunteer with the Coalición de Derechos Humanos.

""There is that concern: If I continue, am I going to die? How far are Trump and ICE and immigration (authorities) going to go with all of this?"" said Vindiola, a seventh-generation Tucsonan, who said her family lived here before Arizona was part of the United States.

ICE's actions, such as wearing face masks, undermine trust in law enforcement broadly, harming public safety by discouraging people from reporting crime, advocates say.

""They don't know who to trust,"" Vindiola said. ""ICE covers up their faces like criminals. Why is that happening? Why are they not behaving like law enforcement agents, with their name tags and actual badges?""

Vindiola leads the emotional-support committee within Derechos Humanos, which holds art therapy sessions for kids and adolescents and offers therapy for adults.

The group is organizing a series of ""healing circle"" events, starting this weekend. The event — invite-only, for now — aims to help volunteers cope with the pressures they're facing, and find ways to manage stress in a sustainable way, she said.

""We are stressing out so much, and we need to be able to have a way to heal our own psyche, to heal our own energy,"" she said. ""We're trying to take care of our emotional health, as well.""

Police in St. Cloud are increasing staffing after a video surfaced showing an ICE agent hitting a man with a baton.

Chase Benjamin, the man in the video, said he was detained after the incident. Benjamin described the situation, saying, “The video shows it all, I’m just walking, trying to get through the crowd and just start getting attacked.”

Benjamin explained he was running errands at the Star City Mall in St. Cloud when clashes occurred between hundreds of people and ICE agents. He said he was attacked and then taken to the Whipple Federal Building in the Twin Cities, where he waited for 8 hours before being released later that night.

“At this point, I’m being kidnapped,” Benjamin said.

St. Cloud City Councilmember Karen Larson was present during the incident to encourage peace. “Tensions are high on both sides right now, and we need to calm ourselves,” Larson said.

She expressed concern about the potential for violence, stating, “We could have had another violent incident.”

ICE officials informed St. Cloud city staff that their operations are “ongoing” but did not provide specifics. Larson emphasized the importance of safety for those who feel targeted and supports both First Amendment rights and lawful law enforcement duties.

“There’s a third path where we can sit down in the middle and talk about the mess that we are all in to try and solve it,” she said.

Benjamin, an American citizen, is considering legal action following the incident. He had this message to the community, saying, “To the people, just protect your community, stand up for yourself. You’ve got the right to.”

Who will take away his ‘License to Kill’?

Let’s examine “License to Kill” lyrics by Bob Dylan from his 1983 album “Infidels” in light of current U.S. leadership and recent events.

“Well, the judge, he holds a six-gun, / And the gospel he delivers / Is one that you can hear / In any saloon or alley”

This verse suggests justice is perverted and the law is enforced with violence, comparing it to the Wild West or urban crime.

“And the man who translates / Is a man who understands / That the law of the land / Is the law of the gun”

This highlights the role of interpreters or translators (possibly referring to U.S. advisers or diplomats) who understand the true law in these conflict zones is the law of the gun, not written laws or international agreements.

“And the man who translates / Is a man who understands / That the law of the land / Is the law of the gun”

This reinforces the idea that the U.S. government’s actions are driven by a desire for power and control, rather than a genuine concern for democracy or human rights.

“And the man who translates / Is a man who understands / That the law of the land / Is the law of the gun”

This suggests the U.S. government is complicit in the violence and suffering caused by its interventions, and that it is willing to sacrifice human lives for its geopolitical goals.

This is not OK

As I watch outrage after outrage in the daily news, and the attempts by many to justify and even normalize such things as much-needed change, I find myself in disbelief.

It is not OK for immigrants to be deported without having their day in court. Even if they have broken the law, it is explicitly stated in our Constitution that everyone has the right to a trial when accused of a crime, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Even the Jan. 6 rioters, who were filmed on TV committing crimes, were given trials before punishment.

It is not OK for a woman to be killed by an untrained paramilitary agent. Real law enforcement personnel are trained in de-escalation; lethal force is used only as a last resort. Whatever happened to shooting the tires to stop a vehicle? The tragedy in Minneapolis was an emotional, non-professional overreaction by an unaccountable militia. Definitely not OK.

It is not OK for the U.S. to pull out of the Paris climate accords. This was done, as usual, by presidential memorandum, without consultation with Congress. We are the only country in the world to leave this treaty. It is an embarrassing and foolish denial of basic climate science, driven by a single man who doesn’t like windmills.

I could go on — the list is long and profoundly un-American. Much of this is enabled by a weak Congress. Call your elected representatives to say what’s going on in this country is not OK.

This was never about immigration reform

The rationale for current immigration enforcement in the U.S. is often presented as an effort to reform a broken system and protect the public. However, the actions of authorities, especially ICE, reveal these stated motivations do not align with reality.

Enforcement is frequently justified as targeting the “worst of the worst,” yet ICE has detained preschool workers described as loving and trustworthy, and apprehending men seeking work at places like Home Depot, as well as hardworking farm laborers. These actions contradict claims that immigrants are draining welfare resources or refusing to work.

ICE has also targeted individuals attending legally mandated court proceedings, undermining the argument that enforcement is only about removing those unwilling to follow the law.

Deportation is not simply a return to home countries; it has resulted in community members being sent to brutal foreign prisons with due process.

Public safety is further called into question by incidents in which ICE endangered communities, such as recent shootings of three people in crowded streets. This $40 billion system of structural violence must end.

Transparency is lacking, with ICE officers operating unmasked and without proper identification. The Trump administration and its sycophants are accused of manipulating public perception to justify these actions, fostering a secretive and brutal police force. The underlying motivation appears to be promoting division and hatred toward immigrants.

Administrations have long failed to address illegal immigration meaningfully. The persistent harm caused by these policies demands action. I vow to fight for justice and humanity in the immigration system.

Khanna and a staff member visited ICE California City Detention Center on January 6, the largest ICE prison in California.","All eyes are on the Trump administration’s brutal “immigration enforcement” operation in Minnesota, where roving squads of federal agents in Minneapolis are demanding proof of citizenship from people of color on the street and lashing out against residents enraged by the deadly shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last week.

Far less visible is the rapidly expanding, nationwide network of jails and prisons where ICE and Border Patrol lock people up after they are arrested, and that is almost certainly by design. Four people died in federal immigration jails so far in 2026, and at least 32 people died in ICE jails over the course of 2025 as President Donald Trump ramped up his mass deportation campaign. The death count for 2025 constituted the most deaths in ICE jails ever recorded outside the COVID-19 pandemic.

“If we are seeing that sort of outward extreme violence in broad daylight in the streets of Minneapolis and streets across the country, imagine what people must be facing behind closed doors and behind bars in ICE detention centers,” said Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at the Detention Watch Network, in an interview with Truthout.

The number of people imprisoned by ICE increased by 75 percent to nearly 66,000 in 2025, and despite repeated claims by administration officials about targeting “the worst of the worst,” nearly 74 percent have no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse immigration database. ICE’s “roving patrols” and “indiscriminate raids” have contributed to a 2,450 percent increase in the number of people with no criminal record held in ICE detention on any given day, according to the American Immigration Council.

Ghandehari told Truthout that ICE has long faced allegations of allowing abuse, medical neglect, inhumane conditions, and solitary confinement in its network of jails and prisons, which are used to incarcerate people facing deportation orders.

ICE’s carceral facilities are often run by for-profit prison companies or local sheriffs acting as contractors. While many detainees are held at remote facilities in Louisiana and Texas, far from families and legal support, Ghandehari said ICE is now operating nearly 200 jails nationwide after opening or reopening more than 130 facilities in 2025.

“What we have seen and are seeing in Minneapolis is enraging; it’s unacceptable, it’s out of control, but unfortunately it is unsurprising given that ICE is inherently a violent agency, and what we are now seeing in Minneapolis is really the manifestation of years of ICE being allowed to act with impunity,” Ghandehari told Truthout.

On January 15, the county medical examiner in El Paso, Texas, announced that the death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old man held at a massive immigration detention center at El Paso’s Fort Bliss military base, was likely a homicide. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Campos was attempting to kill himself and violently resisted when officers intervened but provided no evidence to back up that claim.

The most recent deaths among those imprisoned by ICE also include 46-year-old Parady La from Cambodia, who was arrested and jailed by ICE on January 6 and died three days later after receiving “treatment for severe drug withdrawal at the Federal Detention Center” in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, according to DHS. La was found unresponsive in his cell the next day and was later pronounced dead of brain and organ failure at a nearby hospital.

Withdrawal from certain drugs and alcohol can be fatal but is easily treatable with medical supervision and proper medications. In an attempt to revive La, DHS claims federal officers administered CPR and naloxone, a drug used to treat opioid overdoses, not withdrawal symptoms. The Bureau of Prisons maintains a protocol for safely supervising drug withdrawal in federal detention facilities.

Jonathan Feinberg, an attorney for La’s family, said nobody should die in custody from opiate withdrawal.

“We do not at this point know exactly what happened to Parady La, but the circumstances that have been reported are highly suspicious and concerning,” Feinberg wrote in an email to Truthout on Friday. “We intend to conduct a full investigation and pursue every legal remedy available to his family.”

A 2024 report by Physicians for Human Rights examined 52 deaths in ICE custody from 2017 to 2021 and found that 95 percent were preventable or possibly preventable if appropriate medical care had been provided. Civil liberties and international human rights groups have sounded alarm bells about medical neglect and preventable deaths in ICE custody for over a decade.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment by the time this story was published. However, the official statement on La’s death includes a list of mostly minor drug and alcohol violations and accuses the man of being a “career criminal,” reflecting a larger pattern of ICE smearing people who are harmed at the hands of its agents. After Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis while attempting to pull away from the scene in her vehicle on January 7, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem baselessly accused the mother and poet of being a “domestic terrorist.”

Other recent deaths in ICE custody include Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, 68, who was detained at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in California and died on January 6, and Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, 42, who was detained at the Joe Corley Processing Center in Texas and died on January 5, according to Detention Watch Network.

“You can imagine how bad the conditions have been getting,” Ghandehari said. “It’s not even a full two weeks into this new year, and we already have four deaths in ICE custody.”

ICE cannot place U.S. citizens in detention for extended periods of time, but multiple citizens have reportedly been arrested by ICE under Trump’s crackdown, including George Retes, a U.S. veteran who was wrongly detained by ICE in California for three days after a chaotic raid on a cannabis farm in August.

The Oglala Sioux Tribe, one of the largest tribal nations in the U.S., has accused ICE of illegally holding four members arrested during raids in Minneapolis, according to Axios.

From New Jersey to California to Minnesota, immigration officials have barred Democratic lawmakers from entering ICE jails to conduct unannounced inspections and check on incarcerated constituents. A federal judge recently struck down a policy requiring advance notice from lawmakers, but Noem instituted a new policy that blocked Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Democrats from visiting the central ICE holding facility in the Twin Cities shortly after Good was killed.

“When we appropriate funds as members of Congress, we are expected by the public to do oversight because the public requires their money be used with transparency and accountability,” Omar told reporters on January 10. “And what happened today is ICE agents decided that we were no longer allowed to fulfill our constitutional duties.”

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) says he may be the only member of Congress to conduct an oversight visit to an ICE jail under the Trump administration. Khanna and a staff member visited ICE California City Detention Center on January 6, the largest ICE prison in California. Khanna made the visit after one of his constituents “was beaten, unlawfully detained, and held at this very facility before being deported,” according to a social media post.

Khanna said he was “deeply disturbed” by his visit to the ICE prison, which currently holds nearly 1,500 people. When he spoke to families in the parking lot, they described their loved ones being subjected to “inadequate food, visible mold, and water that tastes like metal.” A lack of medical care was the most alarming failure, Khanna said, with one detainee telling the congressman that he was urinating blood but still had not received medical care.

“For illnesses like the flu, medicine is rarely provided; at best, [an] ibuprofen is given, but more often detainees are told to buy basic medicine from the commissary at exaggerated, unaffordable prices,” Khanna said. “With reportedly only one doctor for hundreds of people, the neglect is structural.”

Congress faces a self-imposed January 30 deadline to pass legislation funding the government, which gives lawmakers a chance to rein in ICE by defunding the infrastructure that makes Trump’s brutal “immigration” crackdown possible, including the expanding network of ICE jails and prisons, according to Ghandehari. ICE’s budget is set to balloon by $170 billion under the megabill championed by Trump and passed by Republicans in July 2025, but some progressive Democrats are now pushing to defund the agency.

“They can’t do what they are doing without infrastructure that has been built up over decades,” Ghandehari told Truthout, explaining that the only way to stop the Trump administration’s violence is by starting to dismantle ICE’s infrastructure. ”That’s why it’s so important that Congress do the right things this week and start the process of cutting ICE off.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2224632175-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 16:57:42.806376

They’re workers.","Donald Trump rode to reelection with racist attacks on immigrants and refugees and promising mass deportations. The first year of his second term was filled with heartbreak, trauma, and fear as his administration escalated its assault on immigrant communities: separating families, occupying cities, targeting workers, and expanding deportations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is using its bloated budget to recruit among Trump’s far right base. This comes amid ICE’s horrific killing of Renée Nicole Good in Minneapolis, staunchly defended by the Trump administration.

At the same time, we’ve seen inspiring community resistance to ICE and Trump across the U.S. Rapid response networks have grown. Teacher unions are defending immigrant students and families. There is growing mass resistance to ICE from Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis.

A year ago, Truthout spoke to several community and farmworker organizations about how they were preparing for the second Trump administration. We reached out to some of those participants again to reflect on the past year in a new roundtable interview. They discuss the anguish of the past year and the challenges immigrant communities have faced, as well as how organizers are proactively responding and what’s keeping people motivated and inspired.

Rossy Alfaro is a former dairy worker in Vermont and organizer with Migrant Justice, which organizes dairy farmworkers in Vermont and oversees the worker-driven Milk with Dignity campaign. María Carrasco is a longtime volunteer with Derechos Humanos, a grassroots organization supporting migrant rights in Tucson, Arizona, and she is closely involved with the group’s rapid response work. Jeannie Economos is the longtime pesticide safety and environmental health project coordinator for the Farmworker Association of Florida, which has organized farmworkers for over four decades.

Note: These interviews took place in December 2025 and were conducted separately and edited into a roundtable format afterward. Alfaro’s interview was done with interpretation provided by Migrant Justice.

Derek Seidman: A year ago, we discussed how you were approaching the new Trump administration. How has the past year been for your community and organizing efforts?

Jeannie Economos: It’s much worse than we expected. The tactics they’re using are very disturbing. Children are being ripped apart from their parents. It’s causing chaos and heartbreak and mental health issues. The community is traumatized. ICE is waiting for people at courthouses and even schools and is intimidating people by wearing masks and dragging people out of their cars. It’s terrible. This is unprecedented.

María Carrasco: We’ve seen so many things already. Bounty hunters are out there doing a lot of damage. Many racist people got jobs with ICE and they don’t respect human rights. Sometimes they’re really violent when they arrest people. Every day it’s becoming more dangerous, and this is barely the beginning, because ICE is receiving more money.

They’ve detained a lot of workers we know. Their families come to our meetings. It’s heartbreaking how the kids whose parents are in detention are suffering. We’re traumatizing them. I’m so worried about that.

So many people are missing in the system. We can’t find them. I try to calm down the families. They call me and they’re desperate. There are a lot of Venezuelans being taken. They’re being picked up and deported even though they’re refugees and have all their paperwork.

Rossy Alfaro: It’s had a huge impact on our community. The attacks have been so extreme. Even though we knew what was coming, you can’t really be prepared for it being so intense. So there’s a certain amount of panic in the farmworker community. People are feeling terrorized.

At the same time, people are really resolute, especially within our farmworker community here in Vermont. We fought hard for the protections that we’ve won, and we’re going to fight to retain them.

Can you discuss more what the administration’s escalating attacks on immigrants has meant for farmworker communities?

Economos: Things were difficult over a year ago with all the anti-immigrant sentiment and rhetoric, but that looks good compared to what we are seeing now, especially some of the tactics they’re using against the immigrant population. Before, farmworkers were afraid to file complaints for workplace violations, but now they’re afraid to go to work at all. Of course, some people still go to work, but they’re taking a risk. Some farmers have planted fewer crops because they are worried they won’t find enough workers to harvest. It’s causing chaos in agriculture.

Many employers in Florida are implementing E-Verify, a system which tracks immigration status, which means a lot of people won’t get jobs. So they end up in the underground economy working for unscrupulous employers who exploit them and commit wage theft because they’re undocumented and they know they’re very vulnerable.

In November, ICE stopped a bus of farmworkers near Immokalee. They were mostly women and asylum seekers going to work, just trying to take care of their families. They dragged them from the bus. Who will take care of their kids? Along with the fear, how do you go about your daily life with so much uncertainty? It’s terrifying. Some farmworkers are leaving the country.

Alfaro: In April 2025, Border Patrol detained eight farmworkers at a farm where workers had really begun to organize and stand up for their rights. This had a big impact. People felt fear and no longer wanted to speak out and organize. Some stopped going out to get groceries. People are just now feeling enough courage to start organizing again.

Migrant Justice spoke with the detained workers and their families and we launched a public campaign. We had marches and rallies, and thousands of people signed our petition calling for their release. This had a huge impact. The workers being held behind bars knew that they weren’t alone and they knew that the community was behind them.

How has your organization responded over the past year to the Trump administration’s intensified attacks?

Alfaro: We’ve really focused on educating people about their rights and how to prepare for potential encounters with federal agents and minimize risk in those situations. We’ve been building a system of support through our rapid response network so people can respond when there’s a detention happening. We have people trained on how to intervene to defend a person’s rights when they see an arrest — though it’s difficult to respond in time in rural areas.

We have people trained to go observe anytime there’s a rumor about ICE or Border Patrol in an area. That lets us differentiate fact from fiction and helps with that sense of panic that the community feels. This rapid response network has been important for our community, because we haven’t felt so alone. There are people here in Vermont who have our backs.

Economos: We have five offices in Florida. We’ve been doing Know Your Rights trainings with workers across the state. We’ve been handing out red cards in the fields. Some employers have actually asked us to do Know Your Rights trainings for their workers, which is unusual. Some local businesses have put up signs saying they’re a safe place for immigrants.

We’ve been working in coalition with other organizations locally, statewide, and nationally. We have a rapid response group. We’re keeping track of detentions and deportations. We hope to publish a report on this soon.

We were lucky to escape any hurricanes this [past] year. We’ve been really worried about what to tell people if there’s an evacuation order or they need to find shelter. We’ve been contacting local governments about their policies around sheltering undocumented workers. We’re trying to protect people. How can people go to shelters if there is no guarantee that ICE won’t target them there? There’s so much fear and uncertainty.

Carrasco: There are so many groups organizing in Tucson. It’s getting bigger and bigger. People are really pissed off. The more they try to oppress us, the more people are coming out.

We tell people to take out their phone and start recording if someone’s being detained. It’s our right. We keep eight feet away from them. As soon as someone starts recording, ICE wants to go hide. They’ll be less violent toward people. They don’t want to be recorded, because they know sooner or later, we’re going to take them to court. We’ve been cataloging their cars and license plates.

We’re just so mad. These ICE agents don’t even show their faces. They kick us and do whatever they want. They’re the criminals. We have the right to protest.

A lady from Chicago is sending me whistles and offered to train us on how to respond to tear gas. But big cities like that are different from Tucson. They’re crunched up, so when ICE shows up, people pour out together. It’s difficult in Tucson because our city is so spread out, and we’re so close to the border, so it’s more militarized.

Can you talk about your hotline in Tucson?

Carrasco: Some days the phone is ringing off the hook. Just now, while we’re talking, I received three calls. We get a lot of calls in the morning because ICE is getting people on their way to work. This is every day. They’re not criminals. They’re workers.

We’re trying to help people get lawyers. We try to help as many people as we can. Every day is a different story. One worker called us last month. A guy hired him and exploited him and then brought him to ICE. Those are the kinds of abuses we’re seeing. They’re dehumanizing people and stealing their wages.

After the Taco Giro raids here, I got 48 calls. People wanted to join our meetings and our rapid response network. Even though we’re in a really bad situation, people who never helped before are coming out to defend the community. There’s hope out there.

We need people to have our number and call us if you see anything. Call me every time. We have more than 200 people who are ready to come out.

Rossy, you were personally impacted this past year. Can you talk about that?

Alfaro: This is really difficult for me to talk about. My family members, Nacho and Heidi, were detained by Border Patrol and then held in ICE detention for a month. They were detained completely in violation of their rights, and it was done very violently. Their window was shattered, and they were pulled out of the car.

They both knew their rights. They refused to provide any information about themselves to those immigration agents. The agents took them in without any cause. But that also gave them the ability to challenge their detention on legal grounds and helped get them released, because they could show there was an unlawful arrest.

My son and I suffered terribly from all the stress and sadness of having our family separated. They were held for several weeks. But they trusted their community to fight for them. They have very high profiles as community leaders and as fighters for human rights. That faith that the community would fight for their release sustained them during those months in detention, until they ultimately came home.

Have you seen any victories this past year that you want to lift up?

Alfaro: One victory we’re most proud of is the passage of the Housing Access for Immigrant Families Act, which makes it easier for immigrant families to find housing in the state. We campaigned for this and won it last year. For farmworkers especially, having access to housing that’s not associated with your job really opens up opportunities.

Also, the Education Equity law we won that went into effect this year allows undocumented students to attend university and pay the same rate and receive the same financial aid as their classmates who were born here. My daughter is one of the students benefiting from that. She’s able to go to college because of this law that we fought for and that she helped get passed.

Amid the challenges and heartbreak of this past year, what is keeping you motivated or even hopeful?

Economos: All I can say is I’m more committed than ever. There’s no way that we can turn our backs now. It’s personal, too. A community member who’s on our leadership committee — her nephew was sent to Alligator Alcatraz. When you know people, you feel their pain and it makes you more committed than ever before.

Seeing what other people are doing — young people, students standing in front of ICE or blocking a road, pastors going to immigration court to try and protect people; seeing the risks people are taking, just an outpouring of resistance around the country to what’s happening — that’s inspiring.

Carrasco: People are waking up. People who’ve never protested are coming out to defend our community. A really old lady called me the other day. She was so mad. She wanted to join us. Even white people want to join us — people who are less afraid and who’ve never been active in the community, but who are waking up to what’s happening.

I’m hopeful. People are always calling me to help. Our communities are coming together and they’re defending each other every day. We’ll keep working and defending our communities regardless of what they do to us.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2195715331-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 15:58:28.651350

(WLS) -- Massive crowds returned to the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Saturday to continue protesting against federal immigration operations.

This comes as the Trump administration is ramping up its immigration crackdown after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minnesota.

Despite the freezing temperatures, demonstrators organized peacefully, saying their message to the Trump administration is more important now than ever before.

""This is our country, and it belongs to we, the people, and it seems to have been taken over by a group of people who don't have our best interests at heart,"" said demonstrator Mary Moreland.

It was the first protest seen at the ICE processing facility in quite some time since thousands gathered there weekly at the peak of immigrations operations across Chicagoland. With escalating tensions in Minneapolis in recent weeks, protesters say, now is the time to keep organizing.

""What's happening here is bad, but Minnesota, my God, that's like, ground zero. And to use that much tear gas on a crowd, for what?"" said demonstrator David Kav.

Of course, Saturday's demonstration, led by the organization American Opposition, came as clashes between protesters and immigration agents continue in Minneapolis, especially after Good's shooting death less than two weeks ago.

And just days ago, tensions flared up in that city once again after a federal agent shot an alleged undocumented immigrant in the leg during a traffic stop. The Department of Homeland Security says the agent was also attacked. Demonstrators could be seen throwing fireworks in response as agents deployed chemical irritants.

Meanwhile, sources told ABC News that federal officials have opened an investigation into Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, looking into whether they may have obstructed law enforcement activity in the state.

And while President Donald Trump and DHS Sec. Kristi Noem have said many anti-ICE protesters are paid agitators, demonstrators in Broadview pushed back against that narrative.

""I'm just an old white guy from the suburbs. I don't have a criminal record. I don't get paid for this. I do it because we have to. We have to get out in bad weather, good weather,"" said one protester, named Tony.

The crowd rallied right outside the west suburban ICE facility for a couple of hours before marching their way down 25th Street.

The Unified Command Center reported no arrests from Saturday's protest.

People there say it was important to send their message peacefully.

""It's about people who see what's happening and want to make a change, and that's why you have people out here in 12-degree weather, however cold it is, because they want to see change,"" Tovar said.

""We are here to send a clear message, that we are going to stay and we are going to stand up for what freedom actually is,"" Kav said.

Alice Valentine and her girlfriend, Sofia Martin, learned through a Signal group chat that ICE agents were swooping down Monday on St. Cloud’s Star City Mall, which is home to many Somali-owned businesses, The Handbasket reports. They are fairly new to protests but wanted to help their neighbors. Both are queer and trans and are U.S. citizens.

“Within a few moments of arriving at the parking lot, they were shoved to the ground by agents, pepper sprayed, thrown in a van and hauled away,” according to the site.

That happened after they confronted ICE agents who got out of a car and brandished guns. “I'm not a gun person, but the guns were really big. They weren't just like standard police pistols,” Valentine said. “And so I started recording.”

When the couple asked why the agents were armed, one agent pushed Martin. “I say, ‘Don't shove my fucking girlfriend,’ and he shoves me,” Valentine told the site, “and then then it evolves really fast from there. Like I have pepper spray in my eyes. It’s all over my body. And they’re putting handcuffs on both of us.”

Then the women were thrown into a van, along with three others. Two of them were likely Somali, Valentine said. They were taken to ICE headquarters at the Whipple Building in Minneapolis, where each received one bottle of water but no treatment for their pepper spray wounds.

ICE agents questioned them separately, and an agent asked Martin about her genitalia and if she’d had gender-confirmation surgery. She answered truthfully to avoid being groped. It occurred to them that LGBTQ+ people were being singled out for mistreatment. In the van, they discussed ICE’s killing of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis last week. Valentine told Martin, “You know, I just realized that they probably knew Renee was a lesbian before they shot her.”

Also, while in her cell, Valentine heard another woman asking to call her girlfriend. What crossed Valentine’s mind was “Why are so many lesbians being fucked up by ICE right now?” she said.

Valentine and Martin were released after several hours. No one told them why they were released or what to expect next. The agents returned their belongings except for their cell phones.

Valentine sprained an ankle when being roughed up by ICE, and she has been unable to work because of that. She and Martin own a salon that provides massages and electrolysis, with a focus on queer and trans clients. But while being treated at urgent care, Valentine met a neighbor who’s also interested in countering ICE, so she remains committed to the effort.

“In retrospect, I would have done it again,” she told The Handbasket. “Like, it was the most miserable day of my whole life. But I would do it again because I think that people need to know how evil ICE is and that this is happening, and that this isn't about putting murderers and rapists away. It's about racism, it's about Nazism, it's about fascism, and we need to do anything we can to stop it.”",https://www.advocate.com/media-library/queer-trans-ice-protester-recounts-abuse-jailing-by-agents.jpg?id=62826547&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C39%2C0%2C39,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:32.229080

“Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” the governor wrote on social platform X, responding to an article.
Now it’s Senators, Governors, and the Fed Chair,” Schumer posted to X, also referring to an investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
A federal judge ordered on Friday that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must limit the tactics ICE uses against protesters in Minnesota.
“My focus remains where it’s always been: keeping our city safe.” The Hill has reached out to the DOJ for comment.","Democrats on Capitol Hill are defending Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) after the Justice Department (DOJ) accused him of obstructing federal law enforcement’s operations in the North Star State.

DOJ issued subpoenas for Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Friday, more than a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot a Minneapolis woman, sparking protests across the state and a brief threat by President Trump to send troops to the city.

“Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” the governor wrote on social platform X, responding to an article. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.”

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar responded to the subpoenas, calling them “an assault on our democracy and the rule of law.”

“Speaking out against what our government is doing is not a crime in America—not now, not ever,” she wrote on X.

Minnesota Reps. Betty McCollum (D) and Angie Craig (D) also expressed their support for the governor, taking a swing at the Trump administration’s actions.

McCollum wrote online that the country “deserves justice” and “not President Trump’s use of DOJ as a weapon against his perceived enemies.”

Craig called the move “even more proof that this has never been about making Minnesota safer.”

“It has always been about political retribution for President Trump and his allies,” the lawmaker wrote in a post on X. “I’m standing with @GovTimWalz and @MayorFrey.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also condemned the news, referencing the administration’s previous investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey.

“First it was Tish James and James Comey. Now it’s Senators, Governors, and the Fed Chair,” Schumer posted to X, also referring to an investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “In Donald Trump’s America you get a bogus investigation for doing your job. Americans reject this kind of totalitarian bullying. Where are Republicans? Hiding.”

Tensions between federal law enforcement and protesters were escalated after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer on Jan. 7 and a second shooting last week when a Venezuelan migrant was injured when he attempted to escape arrest.

A federal judge ordered on Friday that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must limit the tactics ICE uses against protesters in Minnesota. In her order, U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez wrote that the officials cannot retaliate against, arrest or detain “persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed Walz’s comments, blasting Trump for investigating the Minnesota officials “instead of seeking justice for Renee Good.”

“We will not stand by silently and be bullied into submission,” the Massachusetts Democrat wrote on X.

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who is also under investigation by the administration over his and other lawmakers’ decision to appear in a video advising members of the U.S. military not to obey “illegal” orders, called the DOJ’s subpoenas of Walz and Frey “un-American.”

“With each passing day, more and more of Donald Trump’s political opponents are finding themselves targeted by his Justice Department,” Kelly wrote online. “It’s not by accident. This is un-American, and we cannot allow it to continue.”

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said in a video posted to his X account that “Congress plays a big role here,” citing the upcoming vote on DHS’s budget.

“Especially given the escalation that is happening in Minnesota today, we should not be approving that budget unless there are constraints on Donald Trump’s illegality,” he said.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a post on X after news of the DOJ probe broke, wrote, “A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.”

Frey called the investigation “an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city.”

“I will not be intimidated,” he added. “My focus remains where it’s always been: keeping our city safe.”

""ICE needs to get off our streets. They are causing confusion, chaos and fear,"" Klobuchar said during the hearing.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, who has come under consistent attack from President Trump, said the administration is ""operating outside the bounds of law.""

Mayor Jacob Frey was among the witnesses who testified during the shadow hearing.

""This is not about immigration. This is about sewing chaos on the streets of Minnesota,"" Frey said. ""We in Minneapolis are suffering the brunt of it right now.""

The mayor added that as soon as federal agents leave, ""we will have peace, we will have safety and order will be restored.""

A Quinnipiac poll found 57% of voters disapproving of how ICE is enforcing immigration laws, with 40% approving, largely unchanged from Quinnipiac's previous polling in July. Most Democrats and independents disapprove of how ICE is enforcing laws; most Republicans approve.

A 58% majority disapproves of how Trump is handling immigration, while 42% approve, exactly the same as CNN measured in July.

The same poll found a slim 52% majority of Americans saying Trump's efforts to deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally have gone too far, 31% said they have been about right and just 16% said they have not gone far enough.

The CNN poll found 61% of Americans disapproving of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's handling of her job, with just 38% approving -- worse than what Quinnipiac found among registered voters, more of whom voiced no opinion than in CNN's poll (36% approved, 52% disapproved).

The Quinnipiac poll was conducted Jan. 8-12 among 1,133 registered voters and has a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points.

The CNN poll was conducted Jan. 9-12 among 1,209 U.S. adults with an error margin of +/- 3.1 percentage points.

A set of recently released polls found Americans largely at odds with the Trump administration and its defense of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who fatally shot Minneapolis woman Renee Good.

A Quinnipiac University poll found 53% of registered voters saying the shooting of Good was not justified, 35% saying it was justified and 12% with no opinion. Over 9 in 10 Democrats and roughly 6 in 10 independents said the shooting was not justified, but over three-quarters of Republicans said it was.

Similarly, a CNN poll found a 56% majority of Americans saying the shooting was an inappropriate use of force, with just 26% saying it was appropriate. Another 18% said they hadn't heard enough to say. About half (51%) said that the fatal shooting reflects bigger problems with the way ICE is operating.

The CNN poll also found 51% of Americans saying ICE enforcement actions were making cities less safe, with 31% saying they were making cities safer and 18% saying ICE was having little effect on safety.

There's a partisan split here, with 82% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying ICE enforcement was making cities less safe and 67% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents saying it was making cities safer.

More Americans said in the CNN poll that they were concerned about crackdowns against those protesting deportations (47%) rather than the protests getting out of hand (37%).

And Americans voiced little trust in the federal government to carry out a fair and thorough investigation of the shooting in Minneapolis, according to the CNN poll, with 62% saying they had just some or no trust at all -- including nearly half (47%) who said they had no trust at all. Just 17% said they trust the government ""a great deal"" to investigate the shooting.

In all, according to the Quinnipiac poll, 82% of U.S. voters have seen the video of Good being fatally shot by the ICE agent.

A woman who was caught on video getting forcibly pulled from a vehicle by agents in Minneapolis on Tuesday said she feels ""lucky to be alive.""

The woman, Aliya Rahman, said she was driving to an appointment at the Traumatic Brain Injury Center when the incident occurred.

""Masked agents dragged me from my car and bound me like an animal, even after I told them that I was disabled,"" she said in a statement on Thursday. ""This happened just two blocks from where Renee Good was murdered, so I am very aware that this confrontation could have ended differently for me.""

Rahman said that while in federal custody she asked for a doctor but was taken to a detention center, where she said she lost consciousness before being taken to a hospital.

""I may have more to say in the coming days but for now, I am relieved to be safe and ask for privacy as I heal from my injuries and navigate how to move forward from this traumatic experience,"" she said.

In a statement on the incident, Homeland Security said a crowd ""began impeding law enforcement operations"" of ICE officers and that several people were taken into custody for assault.

""One agitator ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene, she was arrested for obstruction,"" the statement, which did not identify Rahman by name, said.

Los Angeles police faced multiple allegations of excessive force during protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown last summer.
The department’s response already spawned lawsuits, including from the Los Angeles Press Club, which pointed to video evidence and scores of testimonials suggesting that law enforcement violated its own guidelines and state law.
Earlier this year a different federal judge issued an order barring the LAPD from using less-lethal munitions against journalists and nonviolent protesters — a ruling that is under appeal.","A federal judge banned Los Angeles Police Department officers from using some so-called less-lethal launchers at protests, after finding that the department violated previous court restrictions by using such projectile weapons to disperse crowds at last summer’s mass demonstrations against immigration enforcement.

In her ruling Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall sided with a contempt motion filed by attorneys for Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles.

That same day LAPD officials sent a department-wide memo announcing an immediate moratorium on the use of the 40-millimeter weapons in light of Marshall’s ruling. The memo advised those seeking further clarity to contact the department’s risk management and legal affairs division.

“Accordingly, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY the 40mm SHALL NOT be used during any CROWD CONTROL situation,” said the memo, a copy of which was reviewed by The Times.

A preliminary injunction handed down by Marshall in 2021 placed certain restrictions on the weapons’ use, including requiring specialized training for handlers; the issuance of a warning before firing such weapons; and restricting their use only to situations in which “the officer reasonably believes that a suspect is violently resisting arrest or poses an immediate threat of violence or physical harm.”

The latest order halts the use of a weapon, recognizable by its neon green handle, that has been used by police during recent protests to clear crowds after demonstrations were declared unlawful. The weapon launches projectiles the size of a mini soda can at speeds of more than 200 mph.

But attorneys for Black Lives Matters-L.A. argued that LAPD routinely flouted the injunction — citing numerous apparent violations in their contempt motion. Officers already were barred from firing their weapons from five feet away or closer, or from targeting a person’s head, groin or spine, but attorneys argued that police repeatedly did so.

One lawyer said the department also seemed to be violating its own guidelines governing the 40-millimeter’s use by shooting journalists and others in sensitive areas such as the head.

“And they’re certainly not supposed to shoot them in the back of the head as they’re trying to leave,” said Carol Sobel, a prominent attorney whose litigation forced the LAPD to scale back aggressive crowd-control practices in the past. “The bottom line is the LAPD is going to bankrupt the city with its refusal to follow the law.”

The motion also cited a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that found such weapons shouldn’t be used to disperse crowds. It was the latest legal challenge to the use of the 40-millimeter, which the LAPD also uses in day-to-day operations. The order doesn’t apply to such uses.

In the past the department issued similar, if temporary moratoriums on the use of other projectile weapons that fire so-called skip and beanbag rounds.

This week the City Council voted in favor of new limits on the deployment of LAPD officers at protests, encouraging a “graded response” in which officers in riot gear would be deployed only if needed.

Buffalo Mayor Sean Ryan announced Friday that his administration is drafting an executive order that will prohibit the Buffalo police and other city departments from working with federal immigration agencies.

The order, he said, would ensure “no apparatus of city government interacts in any way with federal immigration.”

“And that’s going to be from building inspectors, to garbage collectors to police officers,” he said.

“What we don’t want is any chilling effect,” Ryan told civic and advocacy groups assembled at the Buffalo State University Alumni Visitor Center. “We don’t want people not coming to City Hall to avail themselves of services because they’re afraid that somehow their visit … is going to yield a phone call to immigration officials.”

Ryan did not give a timeline for signing the executive order, saying only that it would come “soon.”

Other cities, including Rochester and New York City, have laws in place that prohibit city employees from inquiring about a person’s immigration status and ban police from enforcing federal immigration law.

The mayor’s announcement follows Gov. Kathy Hochul’s endorsement Tuesday of two pieces of immigration-related legislation, part of her State of the State address.

One proposed law would allow New York residents to bring state-level civil lawsuits against federal immigration agents who they believe violate their constitutional rights. The second would ban immigration agents from schools, doctor offices, daycare centers and houses of worship unless they have a judicial warrant.

Hochul has yet to endorse the New York For All Act, which would provide a statewide ban on local law enforcement and other municipal employees from inquiring about a person’s immigration status or sharing information about their status with federal agents. New York Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins endorsed that bill earlier this month.

At Friday’s event — the annual legislative and policy briefing hosted by Partnership for the Public Good — advocates from organizations including Showing Up for Racial Justice, the New York Immigration Coalition, and Justice for Migrant Families voiced support for New York For All and Ryan’s proposed executive order.

“An executive order of non-collusion will send a powerful and needed message of solidarity and hope to those who are now living in shock and fear,” said SURJ Buffalo member Allie Doran. “Stop waiting upon the state, stop hoping police will merely withstand the pressure to comply. We must take responsibility for our own city.”

Jennifer Connor, executive director of Justice for Migrant Families, urged the Ryan administration to implement the proposed executive order.

“As a city, we can ensure that our city resources are not being used to enforce a violent federal agenda against immigrants,” she said. “We can do it and we should do it.”

Investigative Post reported last month that a handful of local agencies, including the Erie County Sheriff’s Office and Cheektowaga Police Department frequently turn detained migrants over to border agents. Those agents then send migrants to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Residents in Cheektowaga this week protested that cooperation at a town council meeting, calling for a prohibition on the police force from working with federal immigration agencies.

Ryan on Friday said city police would still enforce criminal law against migrants but that such enforcement would not result in a call to federal immigration authorities.

“If there’s any criminal activity, regardless of someone’s immigration status, law enforcement gets involved, and that’s gonna continue,” he added. “But we’re going to make sure that no apparatus of the City of Buffalo’s government is working with Homeland Security and ICE to harass people.”

Ryan declined to say that his executive order constituted a “sanctuary city” policy, saying “I don’t know what those words mean.”

He noted that Buffalo has grown in population and tax base due to refugees and immigrants settling in the city.

“We are a city with [fewer] vacant houses and [fewer] vacant storefronts, for one prime reason. We have new Americans moving into the city of Buffalo,” he said. “Stopping immigrants from coming into Buffalo is bad for our economy.”",https://www.investigativepost.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7611.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 14:58:07.244054

He was in the middle of a counterterrorism prosecution so important that President Donald Trump highlighted it in his address to Congress.

Ben'Ary said he was shocked to see his phone had been disabled. He found the explanation later in his personal email account, a letter informing him he had been fired.

A veteran prosecutor, Ben'Ary handled high-profile cases over two decades at the Justice Department, including the murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent and a suicide bomb plot targeting the U.S. Capitol. Most recently he was leading the case arising from a deadly attack on American service members in Afghanistan.

Yet the same credentials that enhanced Ben'Ary's résumé spelled the undoing of his government career.

His termination without explanation came hours after right-wing commentator Julie Kelly told hundreds of thousands of online followers that Ben'Ary had previously served as a senior counsel to Lisa Monaco, the No. 2 Justice Department official in Democratic President Joe Biden's administration. Kelly also suggested Ben'Ary was part of the ""internal resistance"" to prosecuting former FBI Director James Comey, even though Ben'Ary was never involved in the case.

As Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, approaches her first year on the job, the firings of lawyers such as Ben'Ary have defined her turbulent tenure. The terminations and a larger voluntary exodus of lawyers have erased centuries of combined experience and left the department with fewer career employees to act as a bulwark for the rule of law at a time when Trump, a Republican, is testing the limits of executive power by demanding prosecutions of his political enemies.

Interviews by The Associated Press of more than a half-dozen fired employees offer a snapshot of the toll throughout the department. The departures include lawyers who prosecuted violent attacks on police at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021; environmental, civil rights and ethics enforcers; counterterrorism prosecutors; immigration judges; and attorneys who defend administration policies. This week, several prosecutors in Minnesota moved to resign amid turmoil over an investigation into the shooting of a woman in Minneapolis by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

""To lose people at that career level, people who otherwise intended to stay and now are either being discharged or themselves are walking away, is immensely damaging to the public interest,"" said Stuart Gerson, a senior official in the George H.W. Bush administration and acting attorney general early in Bill Clinton's administration. ""We're losing really capable people, people who have never viewed themselves as political and attempted to do the right thing.""

Justice Connection, a network of department alums, estimates that more than 230 lawyers, agents and other employees from across the department were fired last year, apparently because of their work on cases they were assigned or past criticism of Trump, or seemingly no reason. More than 6,400 employees are estimated to have left a department that at the end of 2025 had roughly 108,000, the group says.

The Justice Department says it has hired thousands of career attorneys over the past year. The Trump administration has characterized some of the fired and departed workers as out of step with its agenda.

Ben'Ary left with unfinished business, including the prosecution stemming from the airport bombing in Kabul, the Afghan capital, and the national security unit he led at the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

Left to pack his belongings, he posted a typed note near his door that functioned as a distress call, reminding colleagues they had sworn an oath to follow the facts ""without fear or favor"" and ""unhindered by political interference.""

But, he warned, ""In recent months, the political leadership of the Department have violated these principles, jeopardizing our national security and making American citizens less safe.""

Unparalleled in scale, scope and motivation

Since its founding in 1870, the Justice Department has occupied elevated status in American democracy, sustained through transitions of power by reliance on facts, evidence and law.

To be sure, there has always been a political component to the department, with lawyers appointed by the president.

But even during turbulent times, when attorneys general have been pushed out by presidents or resigned rather than accede to White House demands — as in the Watergate-era ""Saturday Night Massacre"" — the department's rank and file have generally been insulated thanks to long-recognized civil service protections.

""This is completely unprecedented in both its scale and scope and underlying motivation,"" said Peter Keisler, a senior official in the George W. Bush Justice Department.

In his first term, Trump pushed out one attorney general and accepted another's resignation, but the workforce remained largely intact. He returned to office in January 2025 seething over Biden-era prosecutions of him and vowing retribution.

The firings began even before Bondi arrived in February. Prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team that investigated Trump were terminated days after the inauguration, followed by prosecutors hired on temporary assignments for cases resulting from the Capitol insurrection in 2021.

""The people working on these cases were not political agents of any kind,"" said Aliya Khalidi, a Jan. 6 prosecutor who was fired. ""It's all people who just care about the rule of law.""

The firings have continued, at times surgical, at times random and almost always without explanation.

Adam Schleifer, a Los Angeles prosecutor targeted in a social media post by far-right activist Laura Loomer over past critical comments of Trump, was fired in March. The Justice Department the following month fired attorney Erez Reuveni, who conceded in court that Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported. Reuveni later accused the department of trying to mislead judges to execute deportations. Department officials deny the assertion.

Two weeks after Maurene Comey completed a sex trafficking trial against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, the New York prosecutor was fired, also without explanation. Like Ben'Ary, she wrote a pointed farewell, telling colleagues that ""fear is the tool of a tyrant."" Her father, the former FBI director who was a frequent Trump target, said those same words after being indicted in September in a case that has been dismissed.

Among the most affected sections is the storied Civil Rights Division. A recent open letter of protest was signed by more than 200 employees who left in 2025, with several supervisors recently giving notice of plans to depart. The Public Integrity Section, which prosecutes sensitive public corruption cases, has also been hollowed out by resignations.

The Justice Department has disputed the accounts of some of those who have been fired or quit and has defended the termination of those who investigated Trump as ""consistent with the mission of ending the weaponization of government.""

""This is the most efficient Department of Justice in American history, and our attorneys will continue to deliver measurable results for the American people,"" the department said in a statement. More than 3,400 career attorneys have been hired since Trump took office, the department says.

The departures have caused backlogs and staff shortages, with senior leaders soliciting job applications. It has affected the department's daily business as well as efforts to fulfill Trump's desires to prosecute political opponents.

Desperate for lawyers willing to file criminal cases against Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, the administration in September forced out the veteran U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, replacing him with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide with no experience as a federal prosecutor.

Halligan secured the indictments but the win was short-lived.

One judge later identified grave missteps in how Halligan presented the Comey case to a grand jury. Another dismissed both prosecutions outright, calling Halligan's appointment unlawful.

Smith, the special counsel who investigated Trump but left before he could be fired, has himself lamented the losses. ""These are not partisans,"" he recently told lawmakers.

""They just want to do good work,"" he added, ""and I think when you lose that culture, you lose a lot.""

'Our dream was to be federal prosecutors'

Khalidi joined the department in 2023 in a group of new prosecutors hired to help with the hundreds of cases stemming from the Capitol riot.

Upon Trump's return to the White House, she watched cases she prosecuted get dismantled by Trump's sweeping clemency for all 1,500 defendants charged in the riot, including those who attacked police.

Less than two weeks later, a Justice Department demand for the names of FBI agents involved in Jan. 6 investigations triggered rumors of potential mass firings. Worried about the agents she worked with, Khalidi spent the day checking in on them. But as she started preparing dinner one Friday evening, she received an email suggesting she had lost her own job.

Attached was a memo from then-acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordering the firings of prosecutors such as Khalidi who had been hired for temporary assignments but were moved into permanent roles after Trump's win, a maneuver Bove called ""subversive personnel actions by the previous administration."" Neither the email nor memo identified the fired prosecutors, leaving them to guess.

Khalidi grabbed a suitcase to collect family photos and other personal items she kept at work and rushed to the office, retreating with fellow shocked prosecutors to a bar where they received termination emails.

The group of 15 fired attorneys later assembled to surrender their computers and phones, entering the same room where they gathered on their first day in 2023.

""For a lot of us, our dream was to be federal prosecutors,"" Khalidi said. ""And so we had happy memories of that room, of being excited on our first day. So it was just kind of surreal to be back there turning in our stuff.""

The news came for Anam Petit, an immigration judge, during a break between hearings.

Hired during the Biden administration, she said she felt a little uneasy when Trump won the election but also figured her position would probably be safe because immigration judges generally have job stability and because they bear responsibility for issuing removal orders for those who are in the United States illegally, a core presidential priority.

Petit arrived on Sept. 5 bracing for bad news because it was the Friday of the pay period before her two-year work anniversary, when her probationary appointment was poised to become permanent. Though she said she had received strong performance reviews and had already exceeded her case completion goal for the year, she had become anxious as colleagues were fired amid an administration push to accelerate deportations.

She was in the courtroom between hearings when she learned via email that she had been fired. She left to text her husband, then returned to the courtroom to render a decision in the case before her.

""I just put my phone back in my pocket and went into the courtroom and delivered my decision, with a very shaky voice and shaky hands, trying to center myself back to that decision just so that I could relay it,"" Petit said.

Joseph Tirrell was mindful of his job security from the very start of the Trump administration. As the department's chief ethics officer, he had affirmed that Smith, the special counsel, was entitled to a law firm's free legal services, a decision he sensed had the potential to rile incoming leadership.

But he remained in the position and over the ensuing months counseled Bondi's staff on the propriety of accepting various gifts, including a cigar box from mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor.

He was fired in July, just before a FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey that Tirrell had said Bondi could not ethically accept a free invitation to. He was not terribly surprised, he says, when it was later reported that Bondi attended in Trump's box. The Justice Department said in a statement that none of Tirrell's advice ""was ever overruled"" and that ""the Attorney General obtained ethics approval to attend this event in her official capacity as a member of the FIFA Task Force.""

""There's a great deal of fear there just because I was fired and just because so many others were summarily fired,"" Tirrell said. ""Are you going to get fired because you provided ethics advice? Are you going to get fired because you have a pride flag on your desk?""

'Our country depends on you'

Trump was promoting his administration's commitment to counterterrorism during his address to Congress in March when he announced a success: the capture of a militant from the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate who was charged in the Kabul airport bombing that killed 13 American service members during the 2021 withdrawal from the country.

Mohammad Sharifullah arrived the following day in the United States, encountering Ben'Ary in an Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom.

Ben'Ary spent the next several months working on the case, but on Oct. 1, he was fired. It was the apparent result, he told colleagues, of a social media post he said contained ""false information"" — a reference to the one from Kelly, the commentator.

The termination was so abrupt that Ben'Ary could not tell his colleagues where he had saved important filings and notes. Another prosecutor listed on the case, James Comey's son-in-law, Troy Edwards, had resigned days earlier upon Comey's indictment. Once set for trial last month, the case has been postponed.

In his farewell note, Ben'Ary observed that he was not alone, that in ""just a few short months"" career employees like himself had been removed from U.S. attorneys offices, the FBI ""and other critical parts of DOJ.""

""While I am no longer your colleague, I ask that each of you continue to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons,"" Ben'Ary wrote. ""Follow the facts and the law. Stand up for what we all believe in — our Constitution and the rule of law. Our country depends on you.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2026/01/17/AP26009728317687_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-17 17:57:04.448984

Minnesota Democrats alleged to have impeded immigration agents

Walz says Trump has 'weaponized' federal justice system

WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation of Minnesota officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, over an alleged conspiracy to impede immigration agents, a source familiar with the probe said on Friday.

The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said subpoenas were prepared for Walz and Frey as part of the inquiry, but it was not immediately clear whether they had been served.

The investigation, first reported by CBS News, stems from statements made by Walz and Frey about the thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and Border Patrol agents deployed to the Minneapolis region in recent weeks under orders from President Donald Trump, the source said.

Reacting on social media to news of the investigation, Walz, who unsuccessfully ran for the vice presidency in the 2024 election won by Trump, said the federal justice system was being weaponized to intimidate Trump's perceived political enemies.

""Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly. Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic,"" Walz said.

The governor was referring to U.S. Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, Democrats from Michigan and Arizona, who made a video statement urging members of the military to resist illegal orders, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whom Trump has criticized as being too hesitant to raise interest rates.

Reacting to a CNN report on the investigation, Frey said separately: ""This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city.""

The Justice Department declined to comment. But U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a message on social media platform X on Friday evening, saying: ""A reminder to all those in Minnesota; No one is above the law.""

It would be highly unusual for federal prosecutors to bring a criminal conspiracy case based on statements from public officials about government policies.

The Trump administration has sent nearly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota since early last week, triggering angry protests in Minneapolis over the surge in immigration agents on the streets of the state's most populous city.

Confrontations between residents and federal officers have become increasingly tense after an ICE agent fatally shot a U.S. citizen, Renee Good, 37, behind the wheel of her car, in Minneapolis on January 7, triggering daily protests that have spread to other cities.

Although he has urged protesters to remain peaceful, Walz also has encouraged citizens to record video of any arrests or other encounters between ICE agents and members of the public in order to create a database for potential ""future prosecution"" of wrongdoing by law enforcement.

Walz and Frey have repeatedly demanded that Trump end the ICE deployment, saying the militarized deportation drive was a reckless operation aimed at sowing chaos, fear and headlines, and was putting civilians in danger.

Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche earlier this week blamed Walz and Frey for the confrontations and said he was focused on stopping them by ""whatever means necessary, opens new tab

Justice Department officials have not communicated their plans to share the data with DHS with the states.
Legal experts have said the Justice Department's demands for voter roll data are unprecedented and raise privacy concerns.
In his ruling on Thursday, Carter said the Justice Department has not provided an adequate basis for its need to access such sensitive, nonpublic voter roll data.","A federal judge in California this week struck down the Justice Department's demand for the state to hand over sensitive voter roll data, ruling that it would trample on residents' privacy rights and potentially disenfranchise voters.

""The taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece-by-piece until there is nothing left,"" said David Carter, a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of California, in a ruling on Thursday.

""The case before the Court is one of these cuts that imperils all Americans. The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the Legislative Branch, not the Executive. The Constitution demands such respect, and the Executive may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections it seeks to do so here.""

The decision is the first formal court decision of what is expected to be many, after the Justice Department filed nearly two dozen lawsuits around the country ordering states to hand over voter roll data containing sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers, addresses and driver's license numbers.

Another federal judge in Oregon, meanwhile, separately signaled earlier this week he tentatively plans to dismiss the Justice Department's voter roll lawsuit against the state.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division has sent demands to at least 43 states so far asking them to hand over voter roll data, according to a tally kept by the Brennan Center for Justice. On Friday, the division added another, filing a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Virginia for failing to produce its voter registration lists.

The Civil Rights Division has claimed it needs the data to ensure compliance with two federal laws — the Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act — which require states to establish programs for maintaining clean voting lists so people ineligible to vote, such as convicted felons.

But government documents previously reviewed by CBS News show that the Justice Department is actually working with the Department of Homeland Security to hand over the data so that it can be used in pursuit of criminal and immigration investigations.

Justice Department officials have not communicated their plans to share the data with DHS with the states.

In an Aug. 28 virtual meeting with secretaries of state, a former Civil Rights Division official told them the data would only be used to ensure they had clean voter lists and pledged to analyze the information ""securely and discreetly,"" according to notes on the meeting shared with CBS News by a participant.

Legal experts have said the Justice Department's demands for voter roll data are unprecedented and raise privacy concerns. The federal Privacy Act requires the government to provide public notice and comment before it collects records on individuals.

The Justice Department has argued it also has a right to access the data under the Civil Rights Act, which requires states to retain voter registration records for up to 22 months after an election.

The law states that the Justice Department can issue a written demand to inspect the records, but it must provide ""a statement of the basis and the purpose"" for the request.

In his ruling on Thursday, Carter said the Justice Department has not provided an adequate basis for its need to access such sensitive, nonpublic voter roll data.

He also cited prior media reports showing that the true purpose behind the data request is to use it for immigration and criminal enforcement.

""The Court does not take lightly DOJ's obfuscation of its true motives in the present matter,"" Carter wrote. ""Congress passed the NVRA, Civil Rights Act, and HAVA to protect voting rights. If the DOJ wants to instead use these statutes for more than their stated purpose, circumventing the authority granted to them by Congress, it cannot do so under the guise of a pretextual investigative purpose.""

Dax Goldstein, the Election Protection Program Director at the States United Democracy Center, hailed the decision from the court on Thursday.

""Today the court sent a clear message: states run elections, not the administration,"" Goldstein said in a statement to CBS.

""This decision serves as a vindication of what states have been arguing for months: There is no legal basis for the federal government's sweeping demands for voters' most sensitive information.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/16/9d60cdc3-b220-4bdd-bf6c-97278f4c9c47/thumbnail/1200x630/c513578ac422aa0e43a0c4b6511b979b/gettyimages-2244588264.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 15:58:45.057755

Whether ICE or some other law enforcement officer asks you that question, don’t answer it, Hwang said.

He recommends using the same question: “Am I free to go?”

If the officer says no, and you’re undocumented, Hwang said your best bet is to, once again, remain silent and ask to speak with a lawyer.

“ICE needs probable cause to arrest you, and if they don’t know who you are, the only way that they can get that probable cause to arrest you is through things that you say to them,” Hwang said. “That’s why they’re asking you these questions. That’s why they’re going to keep badgering you — to give them enough information that allows them to arrest you.”

What shouldn’t you do?

Don’t try to run away or flee the situation, Hwang said.

In addition, don’t lie to an officer or show any false documents.

“If you do any of these things, then that might give them sort of probable cause to be able to then detain you and arrest you,” Hwang said.

Should you film ICE agents?

Hwang says yes — in fact, bystanders play a more critical role than ever in this moment.

“Having video, graphic evidence of what ICE is actually doing is incredibly important,” he said. “Not just for the person who’s subject to this enforcement … but really to hold ICE accountable — to try to change their actions and show them that they can’t keep pushing the line [and] that what they are doing is improper and illegal.”

Although ICE agents can certainly tell people to stop filming, you don’t have to stop.

“Courts have long recognized the right to record law enforcement carrying out their duties in public spaces,” Hwang said. “We do this because we have to be able to hold officials accountable for their actions.”

But at the same time, Hwang said, use your best judgment.

Before recording, he recommended asking yourself: Will recording escalate the situation? Are you in a safe position? Is the person interacting with ICE in a safer position with you recording?

What should you do with ICE footage?

One thing Hwang asks is that people don’t live stream or post to social media without permission from the detainee.

“There are immigrants and people in our country who come here fleeing persecution, and they may have good reasons to not want their face publicized or their names out there — because they fear harm or some retribution,” he said.

More than 2,000 federal immigration agents are currently operating in Minnesota, a number that officials say is expected to increase.
There's a patchwork of federal agents - all trained in different policing methods – carrying out immigration enforcement.
Historically, immigration enforcement focused on targeted arrests of people with final orders of deportation or conducting workplace raids based on specific intelligence.
The consequences, Iwama and Kerlikowske say, will ripple beyond immigration enforcement, affecting crime reporting, community cooperation and public safety across entire cities.","Since the shooting of Renee Macklin Good, the Trump administration has escalated the federal immigration presence in Minneapolis, turning the city into a flashpoint for a new, more aggressive phase of immigration enforcement.

NPR reporters on the ground in Minneapolis have witnessed federal agents pulling people off the streets and out of their cars or questioning people of color on their immigration status.

In response, community members have protested, throwing snowballs at federal agents and blocking ICE vehicles. In turn, agents have deployed tear gas, tackled, or arrested those demonstrators.

Experts on immigration and policing say what is unfolding in Minneapolis reflects a broader national shift: federal immigration authorities are pushing the limits of their power, deploying to cities with little formal coordination with local officials — a move that is creating confusion, fear and mistrust.

The Trump administration, however, says this is what Americans want, and the actions of immigration in Minnesota are justified.

In a statement to NPR, Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin says, ""President Trump and [DHS] Secretary Noem are delivering on the American people's mandate to deport illegal aliens.""

McLaughlin continues, ""70% of illegal aliens arrested by ICE have been charged with or convicted of a crime in the U.S. The American people, the law, and common sense are on our side, and we will not stop until law and order is restored after Biden's open border chaos flooded our country with the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""

Data published by the University of California Berkeley's Deportation Data Project shows that in the first nine months of President Trump's second term, around 75,000 people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not have a criminal record – over a third of all ICE arrests.

Shifting norms

The scenes in Minneapolis underscore how dramatically immigration enforcement has changed, says Nithya Nathan-Pineau, a policy attorney and strategist with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an advocacy group that provides legal resources for immigrants

""These sort of established ways of working … really seem to have eroded and changed,"" she says, pointing to more physically aggressive tactics by agents when arresting individuals and in responding to protesters.

Just months ago, NPR published a guide explaining what is — and is not — legal during ICE encounters. Even then, legal experts warned it was ""a very confusing time for lawyers and the public alike.""

Since then, advocates say, federal authorities have pushed the boundaries of enforcement practices even further, making it harder for people to know their rights or trust they will be respected.

""There's always a fear of telling somebody, well, these are your rights, and then realizing that that officer might not, at that moment, recognize them,"" says Janice Iwama, a professor at American University in Washington, D.C., who studies immigration and policing.

A confusing collection of federal agencies enforce immigration law

On Thursday, the ACLU and its Minnesota chapter filed another lawsuit against the federal government on the behalf of three Minnesotans challenging ""the administration's policy of racially profiling, unlawfully seizing, and unlawfully arresting people without a warrant and without probable cause.""

More than 2,000 federal immigration agents are currently operating in Minnesota, a number that officials say is expected to increase.

In her statement to NPR, McLaughlin says that Operation Metro Surge, the name of the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, ""is the largest DHS operation in history.""

The Department of Homeland Security declined to get into specific resources or the number of personnel.

Based on NPR reporter observations the deployment in Minneapolis includes agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Bureau of Prisons – agencies typically focused on criminal investigations or running the nation's prisons rather than civil immigration enforcement.

Minneapolis isn't the only place this has happened. Agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives have been involved in immigration operations in other cities, according to analysis by the CATO Institute, a Libertarian think-tank based in Washington, D.C.

Nathan-Pineau said that in her 15 years working in immigration law, she has never seen operations ""of this scale launched in so many locations in such a short period of time.""

That's even considering former President Barack Obama's two terms in office, which were characterized by record-high deportation numbers. The American Immigration Council says from fiscal year 2009-2016, the U.S. saw more than 2.7 million deportations – at the time more people than any other president in U.S. history.

Former U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske agrees, ""this is unique and different [from] anything that's ever been done.""

Tensions arise over tactics and training

Former Commissioner Kerlikowske says immigration law is among the most complex areas of U.S. law, blending civil and criminal elements — and that most federal agents now participating in these operations have no background or training in it.

He says the same is true for policing dense, urban environments.

""The Border Patrol is called the Border Patrol for a reason, and they work best in these isolated areas along the border or within 25 miles of the border at checkpoints. Policing an urban environment is very, very different"" and requires special skills and knowledge, he says.

Those training gaps, he says, are visible in videos from Minneapolis and other cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, where federal agents have used pepper balls and tear gas in ways that violate standard policing practices.

In her statements to NPR, McLaughlin strongly defends the training and experience of agents on the ground and their tactics, explaining they are ""subject to months of training,"" which includes de-escalation and arrest techniques, firearms instruction and conflict management.

But Kerlikowske says he sees officers that are "" totally unprepared and incapable of handling these crowds,"" he said. ""They're not only intense and aggressive – they're operating outside of any of the standard practices of a law enforcement agency.""

He pointed to videos showing officers firing pepper balls directly at people or throwing tear gas canisters from moving vehicles — tactics he said no police department allows.

""They are totally unchecked,"" he says.

However, the Trump administration maintains agents are well-trained, but are dealing with aggressive protesters.

DHS tweeted about a Jan. 13 incident during which ICE arrested four people they call ""illegal aliens."" While officers made these arrests, ""a significant crowd surrounded them and began impeding law enforcement operations — a federal crime. One agitator ignored multiple commands by an officer to move her vehicle away from the scene, she was arrested for obstruction,"" according to the post.

In response to criticism over training, assistant secretary McLaughlin says, ""DHS law enforcement officers are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and our officers.""

Targeted operations are no longer the norm. What does that mean for residents?

Historically, immigration enforcement focused on targeted arrests of people with final orders of deportation or conducting workplace raids based on specific intelligence.

For months now, immigration agents have been seen riding in unmarked vehicles to public spaces and making arrests.

Many of these arrests are being done in public because officers are still required to have a warrant to conduct any type of search or seizure, says Iwama, the American University professor.

ICE and Border Patrol agents have the authority to question and detain people they believe are in the country unlawfully, but experts say the way that authority is being exercised raises serious concerns.

Vice President JD Vance said in a press conference recently that immigration agents plan to go door to door in an attempt to find undocumented immigrants. Whether agents are actually doing this has yet to be confirmed by NPR.

On Monday, NPR witnessed multiple instances where immigration agents drove around Minneapolis and questioned people, including some U.S. citizens, about their immigration status. Some took place in the parking lots of big box stores. All of the people questioned were people of color. All of them were able to prove they were in the U.S. legally after showing documentation.

Kerlikowske says agents are increasingly relying on these so-called ""Kavanaugh stops,"" which are brief detentions based on minimal suspicion, which can quickly escalate.

Assistant Secretary McLaughlin continues to defend the actions of agents, telling NPR ""allegations that ICE engages in 'racial profiling' are disgusting, reckless and categorically FALSE…. A person's immigration status makes them a target for enforcement, not their skin color, race or ethnicity.""

What is the long-term impact of this kind of operation?

It's standard practice for federal agencies and local police to coordinate a joint task force for major crime events. Except for immigration, says Kerlikowske, where there may not be the same level of coordination, since immigration enforcement rests entirely with the federal government.

""You don't want to be a police chief and then have a federal agency parachute into your city and start taking enforcement action without some level of communication and coordination,"" says Kerlikowske, who spent nine years in Seattle as a police chief prior to his work with the federal government.

""But it's very clear that that is not happening in any of these cities,"" he adds.

The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office says they are not working with federal agencies in their immigration enforcement. There are six local law enforcement agencies within the state of Minnesota that have a 287(g) agreement – which means they are coordinating with federal authorities on immigration enforcement, according to ICE's own database.

McLaughlin said in response to NPR's question on current efforts to get Minneapolis-area law enforcement agencies to sign 287(g) agreements, ""We would love for state and local law enforcement to sign 287(g) agreements to help us remove criminal illegal aliens from Minnesota. 287(g) is critical to having the enforcement we need to arrest criminal illegal aliens across the country.""

The Trump administration's position is that these street-level enforcement actions wouldn't be necessary if sanctuary cities, like Minneapolis, didn't prevent ICE from picking up undocumented individuals from local jails.

""Why are DHS law enforcement surging to sanctuary cities? Because sanctuary jurisdictions won't let us in their jails to arrest the violent criminal illegal aliens in their custody,"" says McLaughlin. ""As a result, DHS officers are forced to find the released criminal illegal aliens on the streets WITHOUT the support of local law enforcement.""

But the continued presence of federal agents ""puts local police officers in an impossible position,"" says Iwama. Because most residents are not differentiating between the federal agents they see taking away their immigrant neighbors and local police they see in their communities.

This is especially unfortunate given that local police in Minneapolis have worked in recent years following the killing of George Floyd and the subsequent protests to regain the trust of residents, she said. ""And of course, here now you have this event happening which is out of their control.""

The consequences, Iwama and Kerlikowske say, will ripple beyond immigration enforcement, affecting crime reporting, community cooperation and public safety across entire cities.

""When federal law enforcement leaves, local police officers are going to be required to deal with trying to make amends with a community that might no longer trust any agents,"" Iwama says.

Judge Katherine Menendez ruled on Friday night that federal agents can't arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring and observing ICE agents.

The ruling comes ahead of planned weekend protests against the widespread immigration action in the city and follows the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier this month.

The US Department of Homeland Security said it is taking measures to protect officers from rioters.

On Friday, Minnesota officials urged protesters expected to take to the streets this weekend to stay orderly and peaceful.

The state's National Guard has been placed on alert and other law enforcement officers have been deployed ahead of both expected anti-ICE demonstrations and a counter march being planned by a conservative influencer.

Judge Menendez's 83-page order bars federal agents from arresting and ""using pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity"".

The ruling, which stems from a lawsuit filed by a group of protesters in December, also limits agents from ""stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering"" with their work.

""The act of safely following [immigration agents] at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,"" it says.

In a statement to CBS, the BBC's US partner, in response to the order, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency ""is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters"".

The White House also criticised the ruling.

""This absurd ruling embraces a dishonest, left-wing narrative,"" spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Politico. ""Here's the truth: federal agents have acted lawfully to protect themselves and ensure the integrity of their operations when individuals attempt to intervene.""

Minneapolis has been on edge since Good's 7 January shooting, with protests across the city.

There have been some reported clashes between protesters and federal officers over the past week.

Additionally on Friday, the justice department announced it was investigating two of the state's leading Democrats - Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations.

Both have condemned the ICE operations in the city.

""A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law,"" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an online statement.

The investigation was criticised by Walz and Frey.

The order follows widespread outrage over a fatal shooting, reports of US citizens getting detained and Minnesotans getting asked for documents for no clear reason.

The new restrictions came as word spread that the Department of Justice is investigating Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over possible obstruction of federal law enforcement, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The probe raises the possibility of criminal consequences for the two Democrats, who have repeatedly told protesters to remain peaceful and to “not take the bait” that could lead to a heavier federal response.

Despite wind chills that plummeted below zero, throngs of demonstrators protested in the snow Friday night near the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis.

Demonstrations intensified last week after 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was fatally shot in her car by an ICE agent. Tensions flared again this week when another agent shot and injured a Venezuelan man accused of “violently” resisting arrest, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Ruling protects peaceful protests

Federal agents from Operation Metro Surge are not allowed to arrest or retaliate against peaceful protesters or use “pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools” against them, US District Judge Katherine Menendez ruled in a preliminary injunction issued Friday.

Menendez also said the agents can no longer stop and detain drivers when there is “no reasonable articulable suspicion” they are forcibly obstructing or interfering with federal operations. “The act of safely following” the officers “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,” the judge added.

The order only applies in Minnesota and only to agents involved in the current operation, and does not apply to other federal officers handling routine duties elsewhere, the order specified.

In a response to the ruling, the Department of Homeland Security said it is “taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters.”

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said despite these threats, agents follow training and use “the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property.”

The preliminary injunction was requested by activists who filed a lawsuit last month alleging the federal government was violating their constitutional rights. The case is separate from a different lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the Twin Cities on Monday seeking a court-ordered end to what it calls a “federal invasion” during Operation Metro Surge.

The Trump administration accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of ""actively organizing"" anti-ICE resistance after officials from the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) accused the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) of lying about how the state is handling its illegal immigration problem.

DHS called on Walz and Frey earlier this week to honor federal immigration detainers for the more than 1,300 illegal aliens that the federal agency said the state of Minnesota had in custody, accusing officials in the state of releasing nearly 470 criminal illegal immigrants onto Minneapolis' streets. Walz's office subsequently disputed DHS's claim, calling it ""categorically false"" that the state does not honor federal immigration detainers, meant to hold criminal illegal aliens in custody after committing a crime until Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can come pick them up.

In a press release Thursday, the Minnesota DOC echoed Walz's verbiage that DHS's claims were ""categorically false,"" adding that they are ""unsupported by facts and deeply irresponsible"" as well. The Minnesota DOC also claimed that they have ""always"" coordinated with ICE agents when individuals in custody have detainers.

""DHS’s assertion that 1,360 non-U.S. citizens are in Minnesota’s state custody is inexplicable.

According to the Minnesota DOC, DHS did not identify which ""jurisdictions, systems, or timeframes"" were relied upon by the agency to support their numbers, and said that they did not align ""with DOC records or the reality of Minnesota's prison system.""

But the Trump administration stood behind their numbers and claims in a statement to Fox News Digital from DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, arguing Walz and Frey were ""actively encouraging an organized resistance to ICE and federal law enforcement officers.""

""As DHS stated, across the state of Minnesota nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens including violent criminal illegal aliens have been RELEASED into communities. We have more than 1,360 active detainers on illegal aliens in the custody across all jurisdictions in Minnesota,"" McLaughlin said. ""We are once again calling on Governor Walz and his fellow sanctuary politicians to commit to honoring all ICE detainers.""

REPUBLICANS URGE TRUMP NOT TO INVOKE INSURRECTION ACT IN MINNEAPOLIS AMID UNREST AFTER ICE-INVOLVED SHOOTING

On the heels of a fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month involving federal ICE officers, Minneapolis Mayor Frey told Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials to ""get the f---- out"" of his city, while Walz similarly told the Trump administration to ""leave Minnesota alone."" Mayor Frey has also issued an executive order prohibiting federal agents from using city property to conduct operations, and a city separation ordinance was recently bolstered by local Minneapolis officials to protect illegal immigrants.

Meanwhile, in February, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued a formal opinion arguing state law prohibited state and local law enforcement from holding someone solely on an ICE civil detainer.

The danger of not properly adhering to ICE detainers reared its head in December after an illegal immigrant with a detainer in Northern Virginia was released from custody and then subsequently killed someone a day later.

""ICE BEING SURROUNDED,"" one person transmitted at 11:01 a.m., about 80 minutes after the shooting, according to the report.

The transcripts surfaced hours before news that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating Minnesota officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, over an alleged conspiracy to impede immigration agents.

A source familiar with the matter confirmed reports in the Washington Post, CBS News and other outlets that the probe stems from statements made by Walz and Frey, both Democrats, about the thousands of federal agents deployed to the Minneapolis region in recent weeks. The Justice Department did not immediately comment.

Both officials along with other Minnesota Democrats have denounced the ICE operation and Good's death, and they accused Trump of intentionally fomenting chaos.

THOUSANDS OF FEDERAL AGENTS SENT TO MINNESOTA

Minnesota's most populous city has seen increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers since Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot behind the wheel of her car on January 7 by an ICE officer, Jonathan Ross.

At the time, Good was taking part in one of numerous neighborhood patrols organized by local activists to track and monitor ICE activities.

The shooting came a day after the Trump administration announced the deployment of 2,000 immigration agents to Minneapolis in what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security called its largest such operation in history.

The surge in DHS personnel has since grown to nearly 3,000, dwarfing the ranks of local police officers in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

Since the ICE surge, agents have arrested both immigrants and protesters, at times smashing windows and pulling people from their cars. Some officers have found themselves surrounded by onlookers jeering and shouting at them for stopping Blacks and Latinos who turned out to be U.S. citizens.

Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has floated the idea of creating a public database of people arrested on suspicion of interfering with ICE operations or assaulting officers, saying on Fox News on Thursday their identities would then be known to their employers and neighbors.

Trump administration officials have complained about what they call the ""doxing"" of federal agents, including Ross, saying that puts officers at risk, leading them to wear masks to protect their identities.

In the case of the Good shooting, Trump and other administration officials accused her of deliberately trying to run over Ross and other agents at the scene with her car. Videos showed she turned her wheels away from the officers, and Democratic city and state officials have rejected the government's account as false.

The Trump administration has said Ross was injured during the incident - although video shows him walking around afterward - while noting he was seriously hurt months earlier in an unrelated traffic stop that resulted in him being dragged behind a vehicle.

MINNEAPOLIS ARRESTS

Trump has said the Minneapolis deployment was prompted in part by allegations of fraud among the state's large Somali American community. Trump has called Somali immigrants ""garbage"" and said they should be thrown out of the country.

The DHS said on X that 12 ""agitators"" were arrested on Thursday night for assaulting law enforcement, without providing details.

As Trump's deportation drive in Minneapolis neared the end of its second week, the Good shooting remained the only fatality associated with the surge.

Fire department records showed paramedics were on the scene four minutes after the shooting was reported, finding Good in her car unresponsive with four apparent gunshot wounds, including one to her head and two to her chest.

Emergency personnel tried to revive her, both at the scene and in the ambulance en route to the hospital. She was pronounced dead less than an hour after being shot.

Meanwhile, at the shooting scene, police were trying to prevent more violence, according to an incident report that recorded communications among first responders.

""CROWD GETTING HOSTILE,"" the incident record reads at 9:50 a.m., 12 minutes after the shooting. ""CONTACT WHO IS IN CHARGE OF FEDS AND HAVE THEM LEAVE SCENE.""

At 11:01 a.m., ICE agents were ""being surrounded,"" and protesters were throwing snowballs at them – but not at police, the report says. The agents finally left the scene by 11:20 a.m.

On Friday, at the spot where Good was shot, a makeshift memorial continued to grow and attract visitors, despite frigid temperatures and falling snow.

Residents have cordoned off the area where Good's car slammed into a light pole, while hand-painted signs call for justice and include anti-ICE slogans.

Rand Paul, to convene oversight hearings and call Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to testify, after the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis.

Good's fatal shooting on Jan. 7 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer has sparked days of protests and heated clashes with federal officers, and it's prompted renewed scrutiny of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics.

In a letter first obtained by CBS News, Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, led by ranking member Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, called on Paul, a Kentucky senator, to use the panel's authority to hold hearings and potentially issue subpoenas to senior administration officials.

In addition to Noem and Homan, the lawmakers said ICE acting director Todd Lyons, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott, Border Patrol Chief Michael Banks and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino should be called before the committee.

The senators said the deployment of federal agents has occurred ""without appropriate coordination with state and local law enforcement."" They also accused federal officers of engaging in ""numerous operations involving excessive uses of force,"" including in the case of Good's killing.

Good sustained at least three gunshot wounds, and possibly a fourth, according to a Minneapolis Fire Department incident report obtained by CBS News Minnesota. The newly released details followed a week of protests in Minnesota that prompted President Trump to threaten invoking the Insurrection Act. The rarely used law would allow him to deploy the U.S. military to the state or federalize the National Guard.

Democrats say Good's killing is part of a broader pattern. They catalogued incidents beyond Minnesota, alleging federal agents appear to have used excessive force in firing pepper balls at peaceful protesters, detaining U.S. citizens during immigration raids — despite proof of citizenship — and deploying tear gas and pepper balls against journalists covering demonstrations.

The lawmakers also expressed concern about agents conducting operations while masked and their use of unmarked vehicles, both practices they say have fueled fear and confusion in communities.

The senators accuse DHS leadership of failing to fairly and transparently investigate such incidents. They faulted Noem for claiming publicly that ""no American citizens have been arrested or detained,"" despite lawsuits, rulings and reporting that indicate otherwise, and for stating in the immediate aftermath of Good's killing that she had committed an act of domestic terrorism.

In response to the Democrats' letter, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, ""DHS is a law enforcement agency — enforcing the rule of law passed by Congress. If members don't like the law, it is quite literally their job to change it.""

She added, ""As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, politicians are more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually removing criminals from our streets.""

Noem last testified before Congress on Dec. 11, during a contentious House hearing on immigration enforcement that ended abruptly when she left early, a move Democrats criticized as evading oversight. A subsequent Democratic effort to subpoena her testimony was blocked by Republicans.

The push for Senate hearings comes as Congress negotiates funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Lawmakers passed a three-bill package this week funding several federal agencies, but left DHS unresolved after Democrats said they would not support a funding bill without new accountability measures for ICE.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats in both chambers are demanding changes to ICE's conduct as part of the appropriations process, ahead of a Jan. 30 shutdown deadline.

The oversight demand also comes as ICE operations expand nationwide. CBS News reported Friday that the agency's detainee population has reached a record high of 73,000.

With Republicans in control of the Senate, Democrats cannot compel hearings or subpoenas on their own. But the letter places pressure on the GOP chairman at a moment when scrutiny of ICE operations, DHS leadership and federal enforcement tactics is intensifying.

ICE restraining order granted

What we know:

The order granted late Friday by U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez bans agents from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles who are not interfering with or obstructing federal agents or following them from a safe distance.

The order applies to ""all persons who do or will in the future record, observe, and/or protest Operation Metro Surge and related operations that have been ongoing… since Dec. 4, 2025.""

The backstory:

Menendez initially declined to bring an immediate end to the ICE surge in Minnesota during a court hearing two days earlier, instead ruling to fast-track arguments in the lawsuit, while demanding federal authorities submit its response by Monday, Jan. 19.

The State of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed the lawsuit and motion for a temporary restraining order in an attempt to bring an end to the ICE surge that is underway in Minnesota.

In its argument, the state cites ""harm"" brought by the surge, including the shooting of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an ICE agent a week ago, among other conflicts.

State officials argue the operation isn't about safety or fraud as federal officials claim, but rather political retribution.

Dig deeper:

The lawsuit argues that the recent surge of federal law enforcement officers that has brought at least 2,100 ICE officers and Homeland Security investigators into the state is ""unconstitutional and unlawful.""

It seeks to end the surge, while also blocking the Trump administration from moving forward any similar actions in Minnesota in the future.

The 1924 law set a cap on total immigration to just a fifth of the pre-first world war number.
The Immigration Act also established the category of “illegal alien” for the first time, as well as visa requirements.
A century later, the 1924 Immigration Act still has fans.
With the return of immigration to the United States after the abolition of racial quotas in 1965 came economic growth.","On 14 January, the Trump administration announced a stop on issuing immigrant visas for applicants from 75 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as 10 countries from eastern Europe. The Department of Homeland Security justified the decision by claiming that immigrants from these countries are at “high risk” of reliance on welfare and becoming a “public charge”.

As an immigration scholar, I was immediately struck by the falsehood of this economic justification. The vast majority of immigrants have been legally disqualified from cash welfare since 1996. Those who do qualify for benefits like Snap and Medicaid use them at much lower rates than non-immigrants. Through their taxes, immigrants are net contributors – especially undocumented immigrants who are excluded from federal benefits.

I also noted a pattern uniting the countries on the list: nearly all were also restricted through the 1924 Immigration Act’s racial quotas.

Abolished in 1965, due to the civil-rights movement’s demands for equality of all races under the law, racial quotas were at the heart of the 1924 Immigration Act, also called the Johnson-Reed Act, which for four decades restricted immigration to the United States on the basis of nation of origin.

Albert Johnson, its lead author, was a representative from Washington, and a eugenicist, who believed that “our capacity to maintain our cherished institutions stands diluted by a stream of alien blood”. Johnson, who boasted about participating in Ku Klux Klan violence against south Asians, wrote the Immigration Act to exclude anyone who was not a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.

The 1924 law set a cap on total immigration to just a fifth of the pre-first world war number. It used the 1890 census to determine annual quotas for who could come from where, allocating nearly nine out of 10 slots to people from northern and western Europe, with the remaining largely set aside for people from southern and eastern Europe. Asians were totally barred, save for a few slots for people from the Levant, and total African admissions were capped at 1,200 people each year.

The Immigration Act also established the category of “illegal alien” for the first time, as well as visa requirements. An accompanying act later that year allocated funds for the first border patrol.

Trump’s rhetoric almost a century later bears a jarring resemblance to Johnson’s. The president has also claimed that immigrants are “poisoning the nation’s blood.” He too has said that he prefers the “nice people” of Sweden, Norway and Denmark to people from “filthy, dirty, disgusting” countries like Somalia.

The Johnson and Trump policies also developed in similar ways. Just as this administration is evoking the specter of immigrants becoming a “public charge”, and instructing consular officers to test immigrant’s English through an interview, Johnson ushered through a bill in 1917, as a precursor to the 1924 Immigration Act, that excluded anyone who was a “public charge” and required a literacy test for immigrants. Both sets of policies demanded more stringent testing on immigrant health – Johnson was a proponent of sterilizing the mentally disabled.

At the time, the Johnson-Reed Act was very popular. It passed with over 80% support in both houses of Congress. And it was signed into law by Calvin Coolidge, who believed that “America must be kept American”, echoing the mantra of the Ku Klux Klan, which was a proponent of the law.

The Immigration Act achieved its goals of keeping America white and stopping migration. In the coming four decades, immigration to the United States would come to a screeching halt, dropping from 13% foreign-born in the 1920s to less than 5% in 1970. That year, the US was 87.5% white.

By contrast, today 15% of people in the US are foreign-born, and the country is 57.8% white. The concern that the United States could become majority non-white as of 2045 is likely a driving force for Project 2025’s mass deportation vision that Trump is enacting today.

Then, like now, refugees were also denied. In one harrowing example, in 1939, more than 900 Jewish passengers aboard the SS St Louis were forced to return to Europe, almost a quarter of whom later died in Nazi concentration camps. Even after the horrors of the Holocaust were fully revealed, it was not until 1948 that the United States took in Jewish refugees, and even then, just 200,000 people. Signing that bill into law, Harry Truman described himself as reluctant, denouncing the bill’s restrictions as antisemitic and xenophobic.

It is no surprise then that Adolf Hitler, who wrote about the Johnson-Reed Act in Mein Kampf, praised it, writing that the US was the “one state” that “simply excludes the immigration of certain races”.

A century later, the 1924 Immigration Act still has fans. Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s mass deportation policy as the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security adviser, has praised Coolidge and the four decades of low immigration to the United States.

With the return of immigration to the United States after the abolition of racial quotas in 1965 came economic growth. New arrivals breathed life into US industry at all levels, injecting trillions of dollars into the economy, and filling key labor shortages. Yet, as the number of non-white people increased, pathways to admissions narrowed. The United States spent three times as much on the detention of immigrant detention as adjudicating immigrants’ claims. The idea that Trump is closing an open border belies the fact that $410bn has been spent on border securitization alone in the last two decades.

None of these facts matter. The purpose of this immigration ban, like the other travel bans this administration has passed, has nothing to do with economics. Just as the mass deportation agenda has nothing to do with immigrant criminality – which has long been a myth. The purpose of this latest immigration ban is to whiten the nation, period, just as was the purpose of the ban a century prior. This administration has said and has shown time and time again that there is “no price tag” on accomplishing this goal.

But just as this latest immigration ban has precedent in US history, so too does the resistance to it. We can learn from the civil rights movement, from the Black led multiracial coalition that insisted that the rights of all people of color were deeply connected, that they needed to be treated equally under the law. We can recognize too that the work of that movement continues, that the white supremacy it fought is enduring, and that we need to organize and protest, and fight for a system that once and for all refuses enduring racist reasoning, and recognizes the humanity of all.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/922364ae9aa59ffc69c7c349cf9c2083fd680312/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=64ea0438b87986d4491a0cbca5176d27",N,,2026-01-17 10:58:47.357403

ICE agents would flood Portland and Lewiston as soon as Tuesday to conduct “forceful entry” operations, according to one tip sent to the Portland Press Herald that cited internal communications in the state Department of Health and Human Services. Our cities were potentially about to become the next Minneapolis, or Chicago.

The suggested raids have not yet materialized, but Democratic leaders such as Gov. Janet Mills, Portland Mayor Mark Dion and Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline began issuing statements Wednesday on how they were preparing for operations to begin in the near future. They urged residents to know their rights and asked protesters to remain peaceful.

No one appeared to know the exact origin of the tips, with Mills saying she made an unsuccessful attempt to confirm any plans with federal officials and Dion saying he spoke to someone at the “congressional level” who indicated ICE is planning to send agents to Portland. The federal government has not shared more details.

But all week, Maine was stuck in a state of fear and paranoia. Neighbors in online groups discussed potential sightings of ICE agents at apartment complexes in the Portland area and an arrest of an immigrant in Biddeford. A caller contacted the Press Herald newsroom on Thursday to claim ICE agents were in Portland at Waynflete School and Reiche Elementary School, but that also turned out to not be the case — at least not that our reporters on the scene could see.

The uncertainty coincided with Trump threatening to send the military to quash anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis after a federal agent killed a woman there last week.

It also came as the Trump administration shared its intent to end the Temporary Protected Status humanitarian program for Somali immigrants in the U.S. amid fraud investigations tied to Somalis in Minnesota and Maine.

The unease felt by immigrant communities that have settled in Maine’s two largest cities has manifested itself in different ways.

A parent at Reiche Community School in Portland’s West End shared how she drove her neighbors’ kids to school Monday morning because their parents, who speak Spanish, were scared to stand with their children at the bus stop or walk them to class. A Lewiston property manager told the Bangor Daily News how undocumented parents are receiving forms to designate temporary guardians for their kids in case they are arrested.

Restaurants and companies from Portland to Bath described making sure employees with immigrant backgrounds had their legal paperwork in order. A volunteer with the Maine ICE Watch Hotline said it has seen a surge in calls over the past week.

The presence of ICE in Maine is not new, but what was different about the latest reports is how the looming surge in Portland or Lewiston would purportedly be larger than past ones in the state. ICE reported a spike in Maine apprehensions in the past year, with 230 people detained between January and mid-October, per the Deportation Data Project.

The data indicated 20% of those ICE detainees in Maine had a criminal conviction and 35% had no criminal record, while 43% had pending criminal charges.

Ifraax Saciid-Ciise, founder of IFKA Community Services, a Lewiston-based organization that supports immigrant women, was among those who said immigrants and U.S.-born citizens alike are afraid the color of their skin, their accents and their choice to wear hijabs could make them targets of ICE agents.

“I’ve spoken to a lot of public officials, and they are saying there is not much they can do to impede ICE, that they have the right to be here and follow their federal orders,” Saciid-Ciise said. “It feels like a total lack of support.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/POY-PROTESTS_12.jpg?w=780,N,,2026-01-17 13:57:49.513660

One district court held that the law used to deport Khalil is likely unconstitutionally vague.","The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on Thursday reversed a district court’s decision that released Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention.

The court held that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) stripped the US District for the District of New Jersey of subject-matter jurisdiction because the INA requires deportation challenges be made by filing a petition for review of a final order of removal with a federal appeals court, not a district court.

The Third Circuit held that the statute serves to provide “one bite at the apple” and that Khalil needed to first exhaust his direct appeal before seeking habeas relief. The court stated:

Each of the legal questions Khalil raises in his petition can be decided later, on a [petition for review]. He challenges a broad array of alleged governmental misconduct under the First and Fifth Amendments, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) … addressing any of those claims would require deciding whether removing Khalil would be unlawful—the very issue decided through the [petition for review] process. To be sure, the immigration judge’s order of removal is not yet final; the Board has not affirmed her ruling and has held the parties’ briefing deadlines in abeyance pending this opinion. But if the Board ultimately affirms, Khalil can get meaningful review.

In other words, because Khalil is raising legal questions that a petition for review court can meaningfully review later on, the INA bars him from attacking his removal and detention in a habeas petition. The court ultimately did not decide any of the key constitutional or statutory issues presented in Khalil’s case, specifically whether his removal over campus activism would be unconstitutional.

Mahmoud Khalil, an Algerian-Syrian-born US permanent resident and activist, has been targeted by Donald Trump’s administration for his alleged affiliations with Hamas and anti-semitism.

Lawmakers are working to complete the passage of all 12 annual spending bills for fiscal year (FY) 2026.

On Thursday, the Senate sent three funding bills to the president – Commerce-Justice-Science, Interior-Environment, and Energy-Water – after approving the package by a broadly bipartisan 82-15 vote. That brings the total to six of the 12 bills that have now cleared both chambers.

The Agriculture, Military Construction-VA, and Legislative Branch measures became law late last year as part of the package that ended the government shutdown.

Congress has about two weeks to pass the remaining bills covering Financial Services, National Security-State, Defense, Labor-HHS-Education, Transportation-HUD, and Homeland Security.

However, the path to full funding remains uncertain as partisan tensions flare over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, particularly involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an issue expected to require further negotiations.

Earlier this week, the House approved the National Security-State and Financial Services appropriations bill by a 341-79 vote.

Tech details in the funding package

The $180 billion funding package includes $5 million for the Technology Modernization Fund, to remain available until expended. The provision comes after the fund expired last month for the first time since its creation in 2017, freezing nearly $200 million for federal technology projects.

Lawmakers also agreed to $1.4 million for the General Services Administration’s Office of Technology Policy and Initiatives.

The agreement also largely rejects major spending cuts proposed in the White House’s FY 2026 budget request, instead making modest reductions across multiple agencies.

The package trims funding for the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and NASA. NSF would see nearly a 4% reduction, rejecting a proposed cut of about 57%. NASA would receive about $24.43 billion, a nearly 2% decrease from current spending, while lawmakers rejected proposals to cut its science budget by nearly half and terminate dozens of missions.

The Energy Department’s Office of Science would receive a $160 million increase, about 2%, instead of a more than $1 billion reduction proposed by the administration. Funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology would rise to roughly $1.8 billion, including $55 million for artificial intelligence research and expanded work on AI standards, quantum information science, and cybersecurity.

The legislation also limits unilateral workforce and organizational changes by federal agencies. It would bar agencies from reprogramming funds to create or eliminate programs, relocate offices, or reduce staffing or funding for a program by more than 5% without congressional approval.",https://meritalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_1783076981-min.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 14:57:44.270985

Lunas Campos' death is the second migrant death at Camp East Montana.","Rochester, N.Y. (WHAM) — The death of a Henrietta man in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody is likely to be investigated as a homicide, according to a Washington Post report.

Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died Jan. 3 at Camp East Montana, an ICE detention facility just outside El Paso, Texas.

ICE said Lunas Campos ""became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm"" earlier that day and placed in segregation.

While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance. Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services. Lunas was pronounced deceased by EMS.

The Washington Post reported an El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner employee said Lunas Campos' death is likely to be classified as a homicide, pending the results of a toxicology report.

In a recording Lunas Campos’s daughter shared with The Post, the employee said a doctor “is listing the preliminary cause of death as asphyxia due to neck and chest compression,” which means Lunas Campos did not get enough oxygen because of pressure on his neck and chest. A fellow detainee says he witnessed Lunas Campos being choked to death by guards at an ICE detention center in Texas on Jan. 3.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson provided a statement to 13WHAM Friday, saying Lunas Campos attempted to take his own life, and security staff intervened to save him.

Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life. During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness. Medical staff was immediately called and responded. After repeated attempts to resuscitate him, EMTs declared him deceased on the scene.

ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody. This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming. ICE investigates the circumstances of all deaths in custody.

ICE said Lunas Campos, a Cuban citizen, entered the U.S. in 1996 and was convicted of several crimes between 1998 and 2009. The list includes a 2003 conviction in Rochester for sexual contact with a child under age 11 that led to a one-year jail sentence and required him to register as a sex offender.

Lunas Campos’ adult daughter told the Associated Press the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.

“My father was not a child molester,” Kary Lunas, 25, told the AP. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”

AP says Lunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.

Immigration authorities arrested Lunas Campos during a planned enforcement operation in Rochester July 14, according to ICE, before he was transferred Sept. 6 to Camp East Montana and remained in custody pending removal proceedings.

An immigration judge ordered Lunas Campos to be removed from the U.S. in 2005, according to ICE, but he wasn't removed because the government couldn't obtain travel documents.

Jeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, told AP the day after he died, the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened. Pagan-Lopez, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results.

Pagan-Lopez said she was also told the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated. Pagan-Lopez declined and told 13WHAM on Friday that she is seeking help from family and friends to raise money to ship his body home.

Lunas Campos' death is the second migrant death at Camp East Montana.

The investigation comes during a weekslong immigration crackdown in Minneapolis and St. Paul that the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest recent immigration enforcement operation, resulting in more than 2,500 arrests.

The operation has become more confrontational since the fatal shooting of Renee Good on Jan. 7, with agents pulling people from cars and homes and frequently being confronted by angry bystanders demanding they leave. State and local officials have repeatedly told protesters to remain peaceful.

In response to reports of the investigation, Walz said in a statement: “Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly. Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic.”

U.S. senators Kelly, from Arizona, and Slotkin, from Michigan, are under investigation from the President Donald Trump administration after appearing with other Democratic lawmakers in a video urging members of the military to resist “illegal orders.” The administration has also launched a criminal investigation of Powell, a first for a sitting federal reserve chair.

Walz’s office said it has not received any notice of an investigation.

Frey described the investigation as an attempt to intimidate him for “standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our streets.”

The U.S. attorney’s office in Minneapolis did not immediately comment.

In a post on the social media platform X following reports of the investigation, Attorney General Pam Bondi said: “A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.” She did not specifically mention the investigation.

State calls for peaceful protests

With more protests expected in the Twin Cities this weekend, state authorities urged demonstrators to avoid confrontation.

“While peaceful expression is protected, any actions that harm people, destroy property or jeopardize public safety will not be tolerated,” said Commissioner Bob Jacobson of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

His comments came after Trump backed off a bit from his threat a day earlier to invoke an 1807 law, the Insurrection Act, to send troops to suppress demonstrations.

“I don’t think there’s any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I’d use it,” Trump told reporters outside the White House.

A U.S. judge in Minnesota ruled on Friday that the federal officers working in the Minneapolis-area enforcement operation can’t detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who aren’t obstructing authorities, including when they’re observing agents.

The case was filed before Good’s shooting on behalf of six Minnesota activists represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota.

Government attorneys had argued that the officers have been acting within their legal authority to enforce immigration laws and protect themselves. But the ACLU has said government officers are violating the constitutional rights of Twin Cities residents.

Detention whiplash

A Liberian man who has been shuttled in and out of custody since immigration agents broke down his door with a battering ram was released again Friday, hours after a routine check-in with authorities led to his second arrest.

The dramatic initial arrest of Garrison Gibson last weekend was captured on video. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan ruled the arrest unlawful Thursday and freed him, but Gibson was detained again Friday when he appeared at an immigration office.

A few hours later, Gibson was free again, attorney Marc Prokosch said.

Gibson, 37, who fled the civil war in his West African home country as a child, had been ordered removed from the U.S., apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed. He has remained in the country legally under what’s known as an order of supervision, Prokosch said, and complied with the requirement that he meet regularly with immigration authorities.

In his Thursday order, the judge agreed that officials violated regulations by not giving Gibson enough notice that his supervision status had been revoked. Prokosch said he was told by ICE that they are “now going through their proper channels” to revoke the order.

911 caller: Good was shot ‘point blank’

Minneapolis authorities released police and fire dispatch logs and transcripts of 911 calls related to the fatal shooting of Good. Firefighters found what appeared to be two gunshot wounds in her right chest, one in her left forearm and a possible gunshot wound on the left side of her head, records show.

“They shot her, like, cause she wouldn’t open her car door,” a caller said. “Point blank range in her car.”

Good, 37, was at the wheel of her Honda Pilot, which was partially blocking a street. Video showed an officer approached the SUV, demanded that she open the door and grabbed the handle.

Good began to pull forward and turned the vehicle’s wheel to the right. Another ICE officer, Jonathan Ross, pulled his gun and fired at close range, jumping back as the SUV moved past him. DHS claims the agent shot Good in self-defense.

To me, at a certain point, a mass mobilization becomes something qualitatively new.” History shows how mass protests can grow into mass strikes.","Minnesota appears to be in gear for a mass uprising. Unions, community organizations, faith leaders, and small businesses there are calling for a statewide day of “no work (except for emergency services), no school, and no shopping” on January 23.

Festering grievances swelled into a national outcry on January 7, after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed poet and mother of three Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis while she and her wife were observing federal agents swarming her neighborhood.

A week later, another federal agent shot a Latino immigrant from Venezuela in the leg. ICE agents have sprayed chemical agents in protesters’ eyes. On Wednesday night, they detonated a tear gas canister underneath the car of a family just trying to get home from basketball practice; the baby, strapped in his car seat, was knocked unconscious.

Trump’s regime has ramped up racist attacks targeting Somali and Latino communities —battering down doors, raiding small businesses and forcing them to shutter, trailing school buses, dropping tear gas outside schools, circling hospitals. He has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military to Minneapolis.

Under siege, Minnesotans are leaning on organizations at work and in their neighborhoods to end the terror.

“We are not going to shop. We are not going to work. We are not going to school on Friday, January 23. For some people they call that a strike,” said JaNaé Bates Imari of Camphor Memorial United Methodist Church at a press conference on Tuesday. “For many of us, this is our right to refusal until something changes.”

UNIONS STEP UP

Among the unions endorsing the call are Service Employees Local 26, UNITE HERE Local 17, International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local 13, Communications Workers Local 7250, the St. Paul Federation of Educators Local 28, Minneapolis Federation of Educators (AFT Local 59), the Transit Union (ATU) Local 1005, the Committee of Interns and Residents (SEIU), and the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO.

“Our labor federations are encouraging everyone to participate on January 23rd,” said Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of the Minneapolis federation. “It’s time for every single Minnesotan who loves this state and the notion of truth and freedom to raise their voices and deepen their solidarity for our neighbors and co-workers living under this federal occupation.”

Other endorsers include Faith in Minnesota, Tending the Soil, United Renters for Justice, Unidos Minnesota, Communities Against Police Brutality, Indivisible Twin Cities, Women’s March Minnesota, the worker center Centro de Trabajadores Unidos en la Lucha, and Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee. In all, 90 organizations, big and small, have endorsed the call.

Under the banner “ICE Out of MN: Day of Truth and Freedom,” they are calling for ICE to leave the state, for the officer who killed Good to be held legally accountable, for no additional federal funding for ICE, and for businesses to sever any economic ties with the federal agency.

Three thousand ICE agents have swarmed the Minneapolis area in recent weeks, and they’ve become more aggressive, emboldened by the Trump administration’s offer of immunity.

Workers are facing them on the job. Letter carriers organized a rally in December to kick ICE agents off two postal parking lots in South Minneapolis. ATU Metro Transit workers are calling on ICE to stop interfering with bus operations after a violent arrest at a bus stop on January 10 and the detention of a Somali-American Metro Transit worker last December.

“They’re walking onto Metro Transit buses,” said bus driver Ryan Timlin, a steward in ATU Local 1005. “It’s getting to knocking down doors. They’re just doing whatever they can to haul people off. They call this a democratic society here in the United States—it doesn’t feel like it in Minneapolis. It’s a nightmare. The garage I work at in South Minneapolis has a massive East African population. Our co-workers are walking around with passports, especially the Somali community, which Trump is really going after. They’re U.S. citizens!”

He and his co-workers got the local to pass a resolution saying members should not cooperate with ICE—for instance by letting them onto trains and buses—and establishing a rapid-response network. At a January 14 press conference, Local 1005 President David Stiggers called ICE’s repression “a throwback to the darkest times of human history, 1940s Germany.”

ICE OUT OF MN

Nat Anderson-Lippert, organizing director for the Minneapolis Federation of Educators, says the Minneapolis teachers have drawn inspiration from the Chicago Teachers Union’s sanctuary schools model, which has brought parents and teachers together to deepen school-community organizing. “The level of infrastructure and organizing is so impressive and humbling,” he said.

“The attack on immigrants is not new, but the intensity we are seeing is just extreme, and so many more people are stepping up right now to meet the moment,” said Jason Rodney, an assistant special education teacher at Anishinabe Academy in Minneapolis Public Schools.

In last November’s contract fight, MFE won stronger language from the district to refuse ICE on school grounds unless the agent can show a judicial warrant, including data privacy protections and mental health support for staff. School workers’ jobs are also protected should they be detained or lose their legal status, putting them on the job recall list.

The organizing includes mutual aid, which can mean grocery runs, rent support, and setting up carpools. The union also won the right for families scared for their safety to do virtual learning, and the school has hosted know-your-rights trainings.

Much of it boils down to a foundation of trust built over time, including during the George Floyd uprising. “More people know their neighbors since 2020 than they did before that, and that has absolutely helped us respond more quickly, building neighborhood response networks and mutual aid support right on our blocks,” Rodney said.

Under the pressures of the moment, he said the union has tried to be a steadying force. “We’re in a hundred Signal loops and it can get draining to follow things we aren’t going to take action on,” he said. So teachers are talking to their co-workers and deciding where to focus. “This is a crisis,” he said, but “I think we’re going to leave this stronger. We’re going to get ICE out.”

Trump has used a fraud scandal as a pretext to racially profile Somali U.S. citizens and threaten to denaturalize them. But the repression has sparked brave defiance in some Somali-American workers, like Uber driver Ahmed Bin Hassan, who defied federal agents at an airport parking lot in a video that circulated on social media. “They couldn’t hear my voice when they knocked on my window, but they could see my color,” Bin Hassan told The Intercept. “I knew if these people are going to take me out here today, it’s going to happen. So I’m just going to be me.”

A DECADE OF ORGANIZING

The momentum is growing from mass protests, like the one in downtown Minneapolis on January 10 that drew 10,000. But the bold demands also build on at least a decade of organizing.

In 2020, half a million Americans turned out to Black Lives Matter protests for racial justice following the murder of George Floyd, not far from where ICE killed Renee Good.

In 2022, MFE struck to raise wages for the lowest-paid educators, education support professionals, who were mostly people of color, while the higher-paid teachers were mostly white. The BLM uprising had helped build solidarity between these groups and highlight the racial justice dimension of their contract fight.

It also seeded networks of resistance, which have been reactivated now as Roosevelt High School has been engulfed in a warzone; ICE agents have gassed students and teachers, and the school has emerged as a key site of student walkouts. Marcia Howard, now president of MFE, taught English at Roosevelt when Floyd was killed feet away from her front door. She took a leave of absence to lead in that struggle, turning George Floyd Square into a memorial and protest hub.

CWA Local 7250 President Kieran Knutson says the police murders of Jamar Clark in North Minneapolis and Philando Castile in a suburb of St. Paul also fueled resistance networks and raised consciousness. Now Trump’s attacks on immigrants have opened up tough conversations inside his local.

“If we’re going to discuss something that’s controversial, we’re going to put it all on the table,” said Knutson. We’re gonna have a discussion about it at the membership level, and we’re going to move forward with what the majority believes is right.”

The conversations reflect experiences that members are having in their own neighborhoods. When Knutson was handing out flyers about ICE, two union women told him they were already part of the immigrant defense network, and showed him their ICE alert whistles.

“We fight like hell on all issues of wages, benefits, and discipline,” said Knutson. “And that gives us some credibility to talk about things more broadly. So we talk about the philosophy that an injury to one is an injury to all. I tell people that’s my religion.”

Last December, ICE abducted two CWA Local 7304 members from Laos at the electric-bus manufacturer New Flyer in St. Cloud, Minnesota. They had worked at New Flyer for more than 20 years.

GROUNDWORK FOR DISRUPTION

Since 2011, a constellation of forces in Minnesota has been building power by bringing together workers, tenants, and community members to contest for power and transform the economy state-wide.

They’ve organized joint weeks of action, strategized together about how their corporate foes are linked, and begun lining up contract expirations. All this helps lay the groundwork for what may be possible next week.

“Over the last two decades in Minnesota, our labor, faith and community groups have built relationships that allowed us to take on more strategic campaigns together,” said SEIU Local 26 President Greg Nammacher. “We’ve taken on the corporations who run our state to address the racial and economic inequalities they have caused, and won big things.

“Now our communities are now under attack directly from the federal government. And we are going to do everything in our power to defend the workers and people who honor that call.”

GET ON OFFENSE

To go on offense, you also need backup. The Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation is backing an eviction moratorium, because many workers are afraid to report to work lest they risk being kidnapped by ICE.

“We don’t need to be adding to our houseless population,” said Stacie Balkaran, a spokesperson for the federation. Through its nonprofit arm Working Partnerships, the federation has also funded a network of mutual aid groups. These networks have helped keep people fed after federal attacks to strip the state of SNAP funding, and they are coordinating aid for groceries and rides to and from work.

The federation has established a legal fund to support illegally detained workers, aiming to raise $150,000. (You can donate here.) According to Balkaran, these funds will go to any worker regardless of whether they are in a union or not.

In preparation for the January 23 day of action, the Minnesota AFL-CIO will dispatch union peacekeepers, “so that we can actually keep us safe… and know that they are safe in exercising their First Amendment rights,” said Balkaran.

NO WORK, SCHOOL, SHOPPING

Although unions have endorsed the calls for Minnesotans to refuse work, school, and shopping on January 23, no union has agreed to strike yet.

“We have not voted on a strike, but our union is calling on people to support this call,” said Knutson. “People can say, ‘This is not a real general strike.’ This is a mass mobilization. To me, at a certain point, a mass mobilization becomes something qualitatively new.”

History shows how mass protests can grow into mass strikes. The 1934 San Francisco general strike began after longshore workers and their supporters shut down the city’s commercial district in a mass funeral procession, following the killing of two strikers and beatings of thousands.

“The funeral march made the general strike, until then at best a threat, all but inevitable,” writes historian Nelson Lichtenstein in his forthcoming book Why Labor Unions Matter, because seeing 40,000 longshore workers and their supporters bring the city’s commercial district to a halt gave the city’s working class a surge of confidence in its own power. Six days later, with backing from the San Francisco labor council, 150,000 workers stopped working.

Unions can advance democracy against authoritarian governments, Lichtenstein writes, but to do so, the unions “have to transcend themselves,” going beyond representing just members to become social movements that can reach for “a vast new set of energies and aspirations.”

That moment may have arrived. “Our actions now will determine what kind of country we will have for a generation,” said Nammacher of SEIU Local 26.

Could the mobilization expand beyond Minnesota soon? “May Day Strong stands firmly in support of our affiliates in Minneapolis who are doing tremendous organizing to stand up a day of no school, no work, and no shopping next Friday,” said Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jackson Potter, speaking for a national coalition of unions and community groups that has been organizing days of action nationwide. “The way things are going, we will have no choice but to emulate this fearless example as a nation on May 1st.”",https://labornotes.org/sites/default/files/main/articles/image%20%2837%29.png,N,,2026-01-17 10:59:01.497482

Although officials in Portland and Lewiston have warned that enforcement could ramp up as early as next week, they have not disclosed the source of that information.

Despite the lack of public confirmation, local leaders said they believe the threat is real enough to begin preparing.

Recent national events have raised tensions, particularly in light of a deadly ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis that led to mass protests and political fallout. President Trump’s response included threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act to send federal troops to the city. Against this backdrop, Maine leaders say they want to ensure the public is informed and protected.

Cumberland County District Attorney Jacqueline Sartoris had planned to join Portland Mayor Mark Dion for a press conference on Friday to address the issue, but the event was canceled due to security concerns.

In an interview with NEWS CENTER Maine, Sartoris emphasized the importance of reminding everyone—including federal agents—that they are not above state law.

""It's certainly possible that if you commit a criminal act in Maine and we have adequate evidence, you could be charged with that crime in a couple of years. It could absolutely be that the statute of limitations carries you past the length of time of this administration.""

While she says her office would be prepared to file charges if laws are broken, Sartoris clarified that her office cannot conduct investigations directly. She urged the public not to send potential evidence to the district attorney’s office, stressing that proper investigative channels must go through law enforcement.

Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce echoed that message, stating his department is ready to investigate any wrongdoing—whether by ICE agents or by members of the public.

""We’re held to a standard as law enforcement,"" Joyce said. ""If we see things that don't look good... we take information down on what's going on, whether we have body camera footage, and we look at potential charges on whether or not ICE was doing the right thing.""

However, Joyce also stressed that local law enforcement has limited authority when it comes to federal agents, particularly in the midst of active enforcement operations.

If officers are called to a scene where ICE is present, their role would likely focus on ensuring that any protests or public responses remain peaceful and safe. They do not have jurisdiction over ICE operations, and Joyce cautioned people not to interfere.

The court ruling hands a victory to activists in Minneapolis, the state’s most populous ⁠city, two weeks after the Trump administration announced the deployment of 2,000 immigration agents to ​the area.

Their numbers have since grown to nearly 3,000, dwarfing the ranks of the local police. The DHS calls it the largest operation of its kind in the country’s history.

Crowds of protesters across Minneapolis have clashed with the immigration officers, opposing their efforts to target undocumented migrants, with some officers responding with violence.

Amid the escalating dispute between Trump and local state and city leaders, the president threatened on Thursday to invoke the Insurrection Act, allowing him to deploy the military to police the protests.

“If I needed it, I would use it. I don’t think there is any reason right now to use it,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the move.

The Insurrection Act allows a president to sidestep the 19th-century Posse Comitatus Act, which removes the military from regular civil law enforcement, to suppress “armed rebellion” or “domestic violence” and deploy soldiers on US soil “as he considers necessary”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016081467327-1768633254.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-17 07:57:04.230442

Katie Glueck: Hi guys!
Katie Glueck: I’ve definitely heard from some moderates who are worried that “Abolish ICE” becomes the next “Defund the Police” and ends up backfiring.
Lisa, immigration has historically been a challenging issue for Democrats to navigate.
Katie Glueck: Are there places either of you are watching where this feels especially urgent electorally?","It’s hard to look away from the scenes in Minneapolis. A 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. A young man shouting “I’m a U.S. citizen!” as federal agents hauled him away. Protests this week after a federal agent shot and injured someone.

As tensions flare in the city, I wanted to try to make sense of the political implications — with the caveats that this is a rapidly evolving situation, and that the Trump administration and local officials are in dispute over what happened in the chaotic moments before Good was shot.

So I turned to my friends and colleagues Jenny Medina and Lisa Lerer for a Slack conversation on Friday morning about ICE, immigration politics and how both could play a role in the midterm elections. Here’s what we discussed, edited and condensed for clarity.

Katie Glueck: Hi guys! Jenny, you had a great story this week looking at how Democrats are grappling with the way to talk about ICE raids. Tell us a little about the competing pressures for Democrats.

Jennifer Medina: The vast majority of Democrats — both elected leaders and voters — believe that the Trump administration is being far too aggressive with its immigration enforcement tactics. The question for Democrats is what to do, and how to talk about it.

Some think the only way to get lasting change is by starting over and eliminating the agency, hence the renewed “Abolish ICE” calls. But plenty of others worry that embracing that message could have devastating consequences, politically and practically.

Katie Glueck: I’ve definitely heard from some moderates who are worried that “Abolish ICE” becomes the next “Defund the Police” and ends up backfiring. In Minnesota, officials are also urging protesters to demonstrate peacefully, warning that any other approach would play into President Trump’s hands.

Lisa, immigration has historically been a challenging issue for Democrats to navigate. You and I spent some time yesterday with Democratic House candidates who are running in battleground districts. What were your impressions of how they’re thinking about this?

Lisa Lerer: Democrats in purple districts are not embracing full-throated calls to eliminate ICE. Instead, they are first saying that the country needs a “secure” border. And then, they are quickly pivoting to attacking ICE’s aggressive tactics, arguing that this approach makes cities less safe. But, honestly, how intense of an issue this is electorally depends a bit on where you are running.

Katie Glueck: Are there places either of you are watching where this feels especially urgent electorally?

Lisa Lerer: Well, most of the highest-profile efforts have been focused on blue cities — Chicago, Minneapolis, Charlotte and the Research Triangle in North Carolina, and Los Angeles — so any nearby suburban swing seats for the House are certainly places where this issue could be more resonant.

Jennifer Medina: There are several competitive House districts in the Southwest that have a large number of Hispanic voters and have swung toward Trump in recent presidential elections. How those voters react to the second Trump administration could decide control of the House.

Katie Glueck: This issue could also factor into races for Senate and governor, right?

Jennifer Medina: Definitely — I’m especially curious how this all plays out in North Carolina and Georgia.

Lisa Lerer: I do wonder if the Minnesota unrest will end up being a turning point in how this issue is playing politically. I was struck by a national Quinnipiac poll this week showing that 82 percent of voters had seen video of Good being shot by the agent. And, Katie, some of the Democratic candidates we talked to this week — ones in areas that haven’t had the same level of immigration enforcement — told us they are starting to get asked about ICE for the first time.

America is definitely paying attention to this issue now.

Katie Glueck: Pat Ryan, a House Democrat in New York, told me recently that at least some Trump voters in his district thought that ICE was overreaching, AND that their affordability concerns weren’t being met.

In 2024, Republicans were effective in arguing that Democrats were more focused on culture wars than on Americans’ pocketbooks. I wonder if some Democrats try the reverse of that argument and suggest that Republicans are more focused on violent crackdowns than on affordability.

Jennifer Medina: I spoke to several Democrats this week who said that should be their precise strategy — that prices keep going up while billions of dollars are being spent on harsh immigration enforcement tactics.

Katie Glueck: Jenny, you’ve written extensively about Hispanic voters. Do we know whether some who voted for Trump in 2024 are swinging back to the Democrats now, or is it too early to say?

Jennifer Medina: Several polls suggest that some Hispanic Trump voters are having buyer’s remorse and are particularly frustrated about both the economy and deportation operations. But it isn’t necessarily the case that those voters will turn toward Democrats, particularly in the midterms. Many of those voters chose Trump out of frustration and could simply sit this year out.

Katie Glueck: How are Republicans thinking about the politics of this issue? I saw Joe Rogan, the influential right-leaning podcaster, suggesting that some of the tactics were reminiscent of the Gestapo.

Lisa Lerer: There is uneasiness in some quarters. Strategists and candidates were already bracing for a tough midterm election. A sense of chaos in the country is never good for the party in power. There’s plenty of polling showing that independents disapprove of ICE tactics.

While polling indicates that Republicans are largely sticking with Trump, some of those voters have a history of not showing up when he’s not on the ballot. That makes winning over self-described independents even more important in those purple areas.

Jennifer Medina: Some Republicans are taking a page from the White House and projecting utter confidence. But I’ve also heard from Republicans like Representative Maria Elvira Salazar, who represents Miami and is deeply concerned that her party is going far beyond what public sentiment supports. She is worried the party will erase the gains it has made with Hispanic voters.

Katie Glueck: Yes, I was struck by what Salazar said in your article — “I don’t want the Hispanic community, my community, to believe or to think that the G.O.P. doesn’t love them.” Representative Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat, recently told me that part of her party’s problem in 2024 was that some voters simply thought Democrats didn’t like them.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/newsletter-1-hmjf/newsletter-1-hmjf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:57:02.303320

The report, obtained by Fox News Digital, included an incident report from the Minneapolis Fire and Police departments, 911 call transcripts, and witness reports.

The documents were released late Thursday.

The 911 call transcripts consisted of 17 pages of calls made out of the area in the moments after Good was shot and offered a profane, splintered glimpse into eyewitness accounts.

Calls began shortly after 9:38 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 7, and according to the reports, there were ""[multiple] voices yelling [and] screaming in the background.""

[I] a vehicle as well and I saw blood all over the river and then the partner who was trying to provide assistance.""

The operator questioned the caller if she was near Good, and she detailed that she was across the street and said ICE made her move away from the incident.

Another caller described their account of the moment agents shot at Good's vehicle.

""They just shot a lady. Point-blank range in her car,"" described the caller. ""They shot her, like, [be]cause she wouldn’t open her car door.""

The same caller mentioned someone on scene was recording a video and captured the moment Good was shot. In the hours after the shooting, multiple videos of the incident began circulating online.

Another caller in the transcript appeared to be calling on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The caller requested emergency assistance and relaying messages from agents on the scene, according to the transcript.

The caller reported, ""officers stuck in a vehicle,"" ""agitators on scene,"" and ""shots fired by our locals."" The operator asked for a description of the shooter and the caller replied, ""I don’t have any of that stuff, we’re just trying to get assistance.""

According to the police report, the fire department began giving ""medical aid"" at 9:45 a.m. after arriving on scene. The report also detailed a crowd was beginning to form in the area and requested ""crowd control and [the] area blocked off.""

At 9:50 a.m. the report indicates the crowd began to get hostile and at 9:52 a.m., more law enforcement was deployed to the scene to assist in crowd control efforts. The report also indicated later that ""agitators"" were cutting the crime scene tape established by law enforcement.

The agent who fired shots at Good was no longer on the scene as of 10:04 a.m. According to the report, the agent was transported to the ""federal building"" and police on scene requested that federal agents ""evacuate [the] scene when safe and as fast as [possible].""

At 11:01 a.m., the report indicates ICE agents were ""being surrounded"" and by 11:20 a.m. all agents left the scene.

The report also included mentions of flag burning and individuals who remained on scene that were reported throwing ice and snowballs at officers. The incident was closed at approximately 4:59 p.m. local time.

Good suffered four gunshot wounds, two to the chest, one on her left forearm and one on the left side of her head, according to the fire department report. Initial reports indicated Good had been shot three times.

DHS officials said the ICE officer fired in self-defense after Good used her Honda Pilot SUV in a way that posed a threat. DHS said video showed Good interfering with ICE officers by parking her vehicle in the roadway in an apparent attempt to block federal vehicles.

Lifesaving efforts continued at the scene, as she was being transported in an ambulance and then to Hennepin County Medical Center, according to previous Fox News Digital reporting. CPR was discontinued at 10:30 a.m.

But so far, only two Pennsylvania Democrats have signed on to an effort to remove Noem from office.
Initial emails were sent before articles of impeachment were introduced this past Wednesday, and follow-ups were sent afterward.
“I would support articles of impeachment against this lawless administration.” “It’s past time to abolish ICE once and for all,” Lee added.
“I condemn this brutal murder in Minneapolis by ICE agents,” Evans wrote.","Pennsylvania’s Democratic congressional delegation is in broad agreement that investigations and accountability are needed following the aggressive tactics of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minneapolis and around the country.

But at this point, they haven’t landed on a united path forward.

Last week, Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly introduced three articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has defended the confrontational actions of ICE and Border Patrol agents. Kelly’s district includes a Chicago area that saw heavy ICE deployment in the fall and the articles she submitted cite obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust and self-dealing.

Other Democrats have called for investigations, and reforms, cutting funding for immigration enforcement, or abolishing ICE altogether.

But so far, only two Pennsylvania Democrats have signed on to an effort to remove Noem from office. Rep. Summer Lee, was among the first co-sponsors on the impeachment articles, while Chris Deluzio, who represents the broader Pittsburgh area, committed to adding his name to the co-sponsors, according to a spokesperson.

More than a week ago, an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, as she tried to drive away from agents.

Pa. lawmaker moves to ban warrantless civil immigration arrests near state buildings

Footage of the shooting and the moments proceeding it went viral, stoking outrage and focusing the nation’s attention on the Trump administration’s militarized deportation campaign. But views among lawmakers split largely along partisan lines over whether the agent, who walked around the car to position himself in front of it when he fired the first shot, was acting in self-defense or using force unjustifiably. The second and third shots were fired from the side of the vehicle.

The Capital-Star asked all eight Democrats in Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation how the House and Senate should respond to the shooting and the resulting unrest. Initial emails were sent before articles of impeachment were introduced this past Wednesday, and follow-ups were sent afterward.

While the Capital-Star’s questions included whether they supported impeachment, only Deluzio and Lee responded to the question directly.

“DHS agencies have demonstrated a pattern of violence against people with little to no accountability, emboldened by an administration that acts without impunity and adds fuel to the fire,” Lee said in a statement before articles of impeachment were introduced. “I would support articles of impeachment against this lawless administration.”

“It’s past time to abolish ICE once and for all,” Lee added.

“Renee Good’s killing in Minneapolis is a tragedy, and my heart goes out to her grieving family and community,” Deluzio said in a statement.” From what I’ve seen so far, it is outrageous and disturbing that the Trump Administration immediately called this a ‘domestic terrorism’ incident. We need an independent investigation — and for the Congress to bring real oversight and accountability to ICE and Secretary Noem’s failed leadership.”

Congressional Republicans have largely rallied around the federal officers and DHS’ defense of the shooting.

The Capital-Star also reached out to the nine Republican members, but only one, Rep. Dan Meuser from Luzerne County, responded. A spokesperson sent the Capital-Star a Fox News interview from shortly after the killing of Good.

“I mean, law enforcement says, ‘Hey, stop, open up your door, let me see your ID,’ and then not only do you take off, but you go right at somebody as they jump out of the way of the car, basically you’re trying to run them over,” Meuser said. “That’s not what a normal person does to anyone, let alone law enforcement.”

President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security have claimed that Good was trying to hit the officer with her vehicle, and he was acting in self defense. The administration has also called Good’s a “domestic terrorist.” Immediately following the shooting, Noem said that Good, “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.”

But Open Source Intelligence analysts at the New York Times, Bellingcat and the Washington Post all concluded that Good appeared to be driving away from the officer when he fired at her.

In the days following the shooting, protests against ICE erupted around the country, including in Pennsylvania. DHS ordered additional federal agents to Minneapolis, where daily life has been disrupted for residents, schools and businesses.

Where Pennsylvania’s other Democratic reps stand

Many of Deluzio and Lee’s Pennsylvania Democratic colleagues have stopped short of further action beyond calls for investigations and increased oversight. But, none ruled out support for impeachment.

Successfully removing Noem from office is unlikely. Impeachment would require a majority vote in the House, which Democrats don’t hold by a 218-213 margin. A two-thirds vote in the Senate to convict, which would require significant support from the Republican majority.

Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-05), who has a background in immigration advocacy, agreed to an interview with the Capital-Star. She was unequivocal in her condemnation of the shooting of Good, and ICE’s use of force across the country under the Trump administration.

“The whole enforcement push with armed and masked agents in American cities has been dangerous from the start,” Scanlon said. “There have been multiple incidents where these ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents have pulled their guns on people on American streets. There seem to be some serious questions about training, about the conditions in which they should be engaging with people, and huge questions about who it is they’re pursuing.”

Asked what she would support to rein in the agency, including impeachment, Scanlon said that effective measures would require a “Democratic majority.”

“I think we’re constantly struggling with the gap between what we should be doing and what we can be doing in the minority,” Scanlon said. The reality is Congress can’t act without a majority, and right now Congressional Republicans are too afraid of Donald Trump to do what the country needs.”

She called for investigations into the shooting and how ICE is spending its money.

Scanlon, Lee and Deluzio were also among the six of Pennsylvania’s seven Democratic representatives in the House who signed onto a letter to Noem calling for DHS “to take immediate steps to preserve evidence, bring in unbiased investigative partners like the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and ensure the officers involved comply fully with investigators.”

The letter also included specific questions for DHS, including what kind of training the officers involved in Good’s shooting received and what steps the agency is taking to prevent recurring violence against civilians.

Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-02) was the lone Pennsylvania Democrat who did not sign the petition. He did, however, call for Noem’s resignation in a post on the social media platform X.

A spokesperson for Boyle did not respond to multiple questions from the Capital-Star about what steps the congressman would support to provide a check on immigration enforcement, including impeachment, but referred to a social media post he made.

“Kristi Noem is lying,” Boyle said. “We all saw the video. She must resign. And this heinous killing must be criminally investigated to the full extent of the law.”

A spokesperson for Rep. Dwight Evans (D-03) referred the Capital-Star to a social media post.

“I condemn this brutal murder in Minneapolis by ICE agents,” Evans wrote. “There should be bipartisan outrage about this tragedy. The Republican majorities in Congress need to join with Democrats to demand reform and accountability. This violence cannot and should not be normalized.”

Democratic Reps. Madeleine Dean (D-04) and Chrissy Houlahan (D-06) did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star, but both called for investigations on social media. Houlahan also called for the firing of any official who lied about the circumstances of the shooting.

Pennsylvania Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman did not respond to the Capital-Star, but called the incident a tragedy in statements to the press last week.

U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal — the Democrat from the state of Washington who is the ranking member on a subcommittee on immigration — chaired the meeting alongside U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis and some surrounding suburbs.

It was the sixth hearing in a series focusing on federal immigration enforcement, but none have seen the response and turnout from members of Congress like this one, she said.

It followed two shootings by ICE in Minneapolis in a week's time, including the killing of Renee Good that sparked national outcry and set off protests. Jayapal and Omar were joined by all DFL members of Minnesota's Congressional delegation and 24 other House Democrats from 18 states.

""We will do everything in our power to hold the administration accountable and stop this lawlessness,"" Jayapal said.

The Trump administration has doubled down on its presence here, maintaining that federal officers are focused on arresting immigrants here illegally who are ""the worst of the worst."" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Krisi Noem told reporters at the White House on Thursday that there are ""no plans"" to pull out of Minnesota.

President Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in the state.

""It is increasingly clear that the entire purpose of these actions is to provoke chaos and fear in order to justify invoking the Insurrection Act and expand the president's ability to reign terror upon American cities who do not vote for him,"" Omar said.

Patty O'Keefe, a 36-year-old U.S. citizen who lives in Minneapolis, shared with lawmakers her experience being detained by ICE. She said she was arrested after observing ICE operations and was held in custody for more than eight hours before being released with no charges.

""About two minutes into the ride, one agent said, 'You guys got to stop obstructing us. That's why this lesbian b**** is dead,' speaking of Renee Good, which filled me with rage and sadness,"" she said. ""How could you say that?""

Officers, she said, also didn't identify themselves at the time of the arrest and they put her in ankle shackles when she arrived at the Whipple Federal Building in Fort Snelling to the detention facility.

""At the detention center, I was made to feel intimidated and as though my constitutional rights and biological needs didn't matter. After all that I was released without charges, which makes it clear to me that this is more of a campaign to spread fear and terror than it is to enforce the law,"" O'Keefe said.

The 3,000 agents and officers on the ground amounts to five times the number of Minneapolis police officers patrolling the city.

Mendota Heights Police Chief Kelly McCarthy – who was the onetime chair of the state Peace Officer Standards and Training board – said ICE's conduct in Minnesota is not how local police are trained.

Many members questioned her about some of ICE's tactics. She said their actions are eroding hard-fought efforts to rebuild relationships with communities after George Floyd's murder more than five years ago.

""We have to acknowledge that the tactics of some ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge are reducing the public's trust in local police, making the job of our cops harder and making us all less safe."" McCarthy said.

WCCO reached out to all GOP members of Minnesota's Congressional delegation. Majority Whip Tom Emmer and U.S. Rep. Brad Finstad's offices both said neither Congressmen was invited to participate.

""Minnesota Democrats in Congress had zero interest in asking questions during last week's Oversight hearing on fraud, so their sudden interest to exercise their oversight authorities is almost comical,"" Emmer said in a statement, referencing GOP state lawmakers' testimony to the House Oversight Committee last week about ongoing investigations into alleged fraud in state programs. ""Their political charade of a hearing will do nothing to help turn down the temperature in the Twin Cities. They'll come, they'll rail against law enforcement and the rule of law, and will accomplish nothing.""

A spokesperson for Finstad said he ""doesn't attend Democrat anti-police events.""

Many Democrats during the hearing criticized the influx of $170 billion to the Department of Homeland Security approved by Republicans in the so-called ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" last summer — the largest infusion of money Congress has ever allocated for federal immigration enforcement.

Some threatened not to support an additional appropriations bill for the agency as Congress again stares down a deadline for government funding at the end of the month.

""We have the power of the purse and we can demand accountability before giving a single dime more to DHS, to ICE and [Customs and Border Protection],"" Jayapal said.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/16/54ad8776-ffdc-4d97-b805-66587be88315/thumbnail/1200x630/38dc8de8c5e4eead10523cce93b82a53/5p-sot-rep-omar-hearing-wcco9m1d-00-00-0607.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:57:05.796533

It also saw the birth of the modern national security state.
Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly.
For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency.
Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them.","The Trump administration frequently uses fear as a weapon, whether stoking it, pledging to shield some populations from it, or endeavoring to inflict it on others. For example, the administration has engaged in what “border czar” Tom Homan describes as a “shock and awe” campaign that has included aggressively raiding communities around the country, shipping some migrants to dangerous prisons, and publicizing these actions through highly stylized videos and memes. The administration portrays its targets as “the worst of the worst,” as “pedophiles, armed robbers, and drug traffickers” whom law-abiding citizens should fear. The government’s own data, however, suggests otherwise. According to Reuters, “some 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation.” Citizens, too, have been swept up in raids. Entire communities thus have been placed in terror by an administration that claims to be protecting them.

The administration also has employed fear-based governing outside of the immigration context, including against the federal workforce. Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, famously said before the 2024 election that a second Trump administration should inflict “trauma” on federal career employees. He explained that when “‘bureaucrats … wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down …. We want to put them in trauma.’” Vought’s wish has come true, with thousands of federal employees chased out of their jobs through a combination of ideological targeting and large-scale gutting of agencies.

Although Donald Trump, Russell Vought, and their colleagues excel at wielding fear as a tool of governance, they did not invent the practice. In his important new book, “The Triumph of Fear: Domestic Surveillance and Political Repression from McKinley to Eisenhower,” Patrick G. Eddington explores several earlier periods in American history during which federal officials and politicians regularly stoked fear against, and instilled fear in, disfavored targets. Eddington, a senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute who has worked as a CIA analyst, focuses his book on the late 19th century to the 1950s. This era encompassed two world wars, the height of the Cold War, and domestic social and cultural upheaval. It also saw the birth of the modern national security state. Eddington draws on extensive archival research to describe and explain the many ways in which fear pervaded the government and politics of the time and was built into the national security state’s DNA.

Although Eddington navigates the era in a mostly straightforward, chronological manner, several themes and subthemes recur throughout the book. As its title suggests, the book’s overarching theme is fear. Eddington underscores this point from the outset, observing in the introduction that “the driving force” behind the developments he studies—principally the government’s “surveilling, penetrating, and actively subverting domestic political activities”—was “fear.” One aspect of that fear is that felt by “executive branch officials, members of Congress, and those on the federal bench—fear that challenges to existing political, economic, or social paradigms would alter the country in ways that would disempower those who benefitted from the status quo.” As Eddington’s subsequent chapters make clear, fear played a still more ubiquitous role in the events of the time. Politicians and officials not only felt fear themselves; they sought to make others afraid—afraid of their own government and of one another.

Beneath this overarching theme lie the details, spanning decades, of the means that powerful actors in the executive branch, in Congress, and in compliant parts of the private sector used to instill and to respond to fear. Because Eddington covers so much ground, I highlight just three such means here, by way of illustration: the growth of the federal government’s surveillance and secrecy capacities; the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ethnicity and nationality; and the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ideology.

The six decades Eddington explores were pivotal for the growth of the U.S. national security state, including the government’s capacities for surveillance and secrecy. With respect to the federal government’s surveillance activities, Eddington illuminates, among other things, the way that its growth was a product of executive initiative as well as congressional, judicial, and corporate enabling. He explains, for example, that the Treasury Department’s Secret Service Division was the dominant agent of domestic surveillance by the early 20th century, and that it went largely unchecked by Congress for years, even after the press revealed that the division had spied on members of Congress at President Theodore Roosevelt’s direction. Roosevelt had ordered the surveillance in an effort to uncover the source of an earlier media story. A subsequent spying scandal did lead Congress to adopt legislation in 1908, restricting the Secret Service Division’s activities to “defeating counterfeiting and presidential protection.” The scandal was a sensational one: The Navy had directed the division to spy on a naval officer at the urging of the mother of a woman with whom the officer allegedly had had an affair. Even after this scandal and subsequent legislation, however, the Theodore Roosevelt administration remained undeterred. It found a way around the legislative bar by creating a new organization: the Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice. It did so by using the Justice Department’s general revenue fund to employ 30 part-time agents, including many veterans of the Secret Service Division. As employees of the new bureau, these agents conducted domestic surveillance that the Secret Service Division was now barred from conducting.

Eddington traces iterations of this pattern—a mixture of executive initiative, occasional congressional pushback, and more frequent congressional cooperation or willful ignorance—throughout the decades that he chronicles. Take, for example, his coverage of the period from the outbreak of World War I in Europe through the aftermath of both the war and the Russian Revolution. In the months following the sinking of the Lusitania, the Wilson administration grew desperate to surveil suspected German agents and their sympathizers in the United States, leading Wilson to authorize a renewed domestic surveillance role for the Secret Service Division. This action “effectively violate[d] the 1908 law” limiting the division’s activity, and Eddington “found no evidence that Congress was informed” of it. Shortly after the United States entered the war, however, Congress authorized some forms of surveillance by the division—for example, to conduct investigations under the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Food and Fuel Control Act. By the end of World War I, “the [division] and [the bureau had] full-fledged domestic spying counterparts in the [Army and Navy].”

These capacities were augmented through cooperation by corporate and civil society actors. For example, the Bureau of Investigation arranged for the major telecommunications providers to transmit copies, without warrants, of “incoming and outgoing telegrams of individuals or organizations of interest to investigators.” The bureau also partnered with a private organization comprised of volunteer investigators, “the American Protective League,” whose members were known to go rogue, “masquerading as [Secret Service] agents” and “in one case ordering a Des Moines, Iowa, resident to raise the American flag over his home.” Eddington also describes how these surveillance precedents and capabilities continued to be utilized after the war’s end. In the postwar years, “the Bolshevik threat [became] the prime, but not exclusive, focus.” As I elaborate below, other targets would include Japanese Americans and critics of their internment.

Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly. Although secrecy is frequently used to bypass congressional and judicial oversight, Congress and the judiciary enabled executive secrecy in significant ways. For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency. The Espionage Act of 1917 bars a much wider range of speech, including information disclosures. Eddington stresses the Espionage Act’s importance in this regard, focusing especially on its use to punish anti-war speech and other forms of dissent throughout World War I and the Cold War. The Supreme Court also enabled broad prosecutorial discretion to punish anti-establishment but not imminently dangerous speech in a well-known line of cases beginning in 1919. The Supreme Court’s decisions in those cases, including Schenck v. United States, Debs v. United States, and Abrams v. United States, endorsed a narrow view of speakers’ First Amendment protections, particularly during wartime.

Eddington also emphasizes the significance of the state secrets privilege and the Supreme Court’s 1953 decision recognizing it in United States v. Reynolds. The privilege may be invoked by the federal government in litigation where “‘there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.’” A significant problem with the ruling, as Eddington points out, is its suggestion that in some cases judges should not require disclosure even to themselves, for in camera inspection. The danger of abuse that this creates is evidenced in the aftermath of Reynolds itself. The case originated as a tort suit brought by a group of widows whose husbands, all civilian engineers, had perished in a crash of an Air Force B-29 bomber. The Air Force successfully resisted disclosing the accident report on the basis that it contained state secrets, and the Supreme Court refused to order even in camera disclosure. Decades later, the accident report, which by then had been declassified, was obtained by the grown child of one of the passengers. She learned that the Air Force had lied so many years ago. The report contained no state secrets but instead revealed negligence on the part of the Air Force.

The scope of the surveillance and secrecy capacities that Eddington explores is breathtaking, but their greatest significance lies in their wielding by government actors as tools to target disfavored groups and ideas. Among the most notorious instances of ethnic or nationality-based targeting was that perpetrated against Japanese Americans during World War II. Eddington’s research sheds new light on the extent of the government’s surveillance of Japanese Americans before and during World War II, and on the gulf between the information it gathered and the lies it told to stoke fear against, and justify the mass internment of, this group. For example, John Franklin Carter, whom President Franklin Roosevelt had secretly commissioned to perform intelligence work for FDR directly, concluded that “98 percent of the Japanese in Hawaii were ‘loyal to the U.S., and that those who are not’” had already been identified by the Navy and the FBI. In a cover letter forwarding one of his reports to FDR, Carter wrote, chillingly and prophetically, that his investigator “‘feels that the Japanese are more in danger from the whites than the other way around.’”

Eddington also highlights the political considerations that led FDR not only to support mass internment for Japanese Americans, but to prolong it. For example, he cites a memo that FDR wrote to two officials, explaining his view that “it would be a mistake to do anything drastic or sudden” in ending internment. FDR “wanted to determine ‘how many Japanese families would be acceptable to public opinion’ for relocation back to the West Coast” and suggested distributing Japanese Americans around the United States to “avoid[] public outcry” on the West coast. As an intelligence report that Eddington quotes acknowledged, the violent public backlash that did follow Japanese Americans’ return home stemmed both from “racial hatred” and “from whites who [did] not want to resume business competition with returning Japanese.”

Surveillance was also used to target ideological dissenters, including those who criticized the federal government’s actions against Japanese Americans. As Eddington recounts, “Such was the fate of a young Army private and aspiring singer-songwriter named Pete Seeger.” Seeger, who had a Japanese American fiancée (who eventually became his wife of nearly 70 years), wrote to the California American Legion to protest its passage of a resolution calling to deport all Japanese and Japanese Americans from the United States and to bar citizenship for all Japanese descendants. The Legion forwarded Seeger’s letter to the FBI, which eventually built an intelligence file on Seeger that ran more than 1,700 pages.

Seeger’s case is just the tip of the iceberg of ideological surveillance and punishment in American history. Eddington chronicles much of this history, ranging from the Secret Service Division’s targeting of anarchists and the nascent Bureau of Investigation’s surveillance of socialists, through the Palmer Raids, Espionage Act prosecutions of socialist and other speakers, “anti-red” scares stoked by members of Congress and the executive branch, and the efforts across many presidential administrations to surveil and target participants in the civil rights movement.

Among the many striking elements in Eddington’s account of ideological targeting is the way that politicians stoked and wielded fears of socialism and communism to aggrandize themselves and to intimidate and control rival politicians. Eddington recounts, for example, that the House Select Committee on Un-American Activities had lost public and institutional support by 1944 but was revived and turned into a permanent committee after Rep. John Rankin, partnering with the American Legion, launched a public campaign to support it. The resuscitated committee went on to “do massive professional, personal, and political damage to thousands of individual Americans and domestic civil society organizations.” The prospect of committee “witch hunt[s]” also led some congressional Democrats, including Rep. Jennings Randolph, successfully to pressure President Truman to employ harsh internal loyalty measures throughout the executive branch. Eddington also gives their due to those administration members, representatives, and other high-profile figures who resisted the “anti-red” race to the bottom. Eleanor Roosevelt, for one, was a voice of conscience, writing to Truman: “I feel we have capitulated to our fear of Communism, and instead of fighting to improve Democracy, we are doing what the Soviets would do in trying to repress anything which we are afraid might not command public support.”

Eddington’s book is a rich, important contribution to our understanding of a pivotal time in American history, and of the growth of America’s national security state in particular. Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them. As he notes in his introduction, however, “The Triumph of Fear” is extraordinary in its scale and in its use of primary as well as secondary literature to illuminate its subject. And Eddington is particularly effective in his choice of stories to highlight and to connect to the book’s larger theme of fear-based governing and politics.

My one criticism of the book is that Eddington occasionally adds a conclusory statement about legality to an otherwise compelling, evidence-based description of government activity. For example, in discussing proposed legislation to criminalize certain disclosures about cryptology, Eddington states: “This was not an encroachment on the First Amendment—it was a proposal to destroy it in the name of national security.” Having written a great deal myself on the law of national security disclosures and the First Amendment, I am extremely sympathetic to Eddington’s point. It is, however, a complicated legal topic to which justice cannot be done in a single sentence. That said, my quibble is a small one because statements like the quoted one make up a tiny part of an otherwise excellent book. I mention this quibble only because the book on the whole is so strong and because its strength stems largely from its intensely research-driven approach.

Because Eddington does, admirably, let his exhaustive research do most of the talking, he does not step outside of the studied time period to explicitly draw comparisons to the current administration. But readers will do as they please, and I suspect I will not be alone in seeing parallels between some of the terrible developments that Eddington chronicles and events now taking place on a regular basis in the United States. Readers likely will see not only parallels but roots, as today’s abuses are enabled in part by the growth in the national security state that Eddington recounts. Eddington’s book would still be an important contribution even if it were not so lamentably relevant to current events. But in this moment, especially, I am grateful for Eddington’s work. The historical context that it provides enables us better to understand what it is that we are living through.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/surveillance-camera-(1).png?sfvrsn=1f2a75b9_5,N,,2026-01-17 05:58:01.496369

In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), ESA Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virg.), and U.S. Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) warned the changes would gut environmental review, strip protections from hundreds of vulnerable species, and let politics override science in listing decisions—all while the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service face unprecedented staffing and budget shortfalls thanks to the Trump administration.

“These sweeping changes would fundamentally weaken our nation's most important wildlife conservation law at a time when one million species face extinction globally,” wrote the lawmakers. “We urge the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service to withdraw these proposed rulemakings and instead work to implement the ESA as Congress intended: any regulatory changes should further the objectives of the ESA to conserve species and prevent extinction.”

The ESA has prevented more than 99 percent of listed species from going extinct and has helped hundreds move toward recovery. Section 7 consultations typically take just two weeks for informal review and two months for formal review—contrary to conventional wisdom, the ESA does not stop projects from moving forward. According to one peer-reviewed study, the ESA did not halt a single project between 2008 and 2015.

The lawmakers highlighted how the proposed rules would:

Gut Section 7 consultation requirements by letting agencies claim project impacts “would occur regardless of whether the proposed action goes forward” — a loophole that could exempt highways, pipelines, and development projects from meaningful scrutiny;

Strip protections from threatened species — by rescinding the “blanket 4(d) rule” that extends baseline protections to all threatened species, creating dangerous years-long protection gaps that resource-agencies can’t fill. The blanket 4(d) rule provides automatic protections to species such as the piping plover and the West Indian Manatee, species listed as threatened in the future would not receive those same baseline protections; and

Let politics override science by injecting cherry-picked ‘economic’ considerations into listing decisions. Congress explicitly required that listing decisions be based solely on the best available science, not on arbitrary evaluations of certain impacts or political pressures.

“With reduced staff and resources, the Services should prioritize addressing the backlog of species awaiting protection and advancing recovery efforts for those already listed, rather than redirecting attention to rewriting long-standing and effective regulations,” continued the lawmakers. “Habitat destruction and climate change are accelerating species extinction to alarming rates, and we should be working to uphold and strengthen the ESA, not weaken it.”

The letter notes that roughly 90 percent of listed species are threatened by habitat loss, making the proposed restrictions on critical habitat designation particularly damaging to recovery efforts.",https://beyer.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 13:57:27.126306

New Jersey Democrats are objecting to reported plans to build yet another immigrant detention center within the state; some of them have signed onto articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; and there may be an effort to block new funding for the Department of Homeland Security as part of the annual appropriations process. Here’s some of what New Jersey’s members of Congress did in Washington this week.

What not to warehouse

A report in the Washington Post that DHS is looking into converting warehouses in Morris County’s Roxbury Township into an immigrant detention facility has caused a significant stir.

On Wednesday, all ten Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation sent a letter to top DHS officials objecting to the reported proposal, saying that DHS needed to “immediately abandon” any plans to come to Roxbury. (Roxbury’s local GOP congressman, Tom Kean Jr., was not included on the letter and has so far declined to comment on the report.)

“Any expansion of immigrant detention in New Jersey, especially under warehouse conditions that are fundamentally inappropriate for human habitation, contradicts both the interests and values of our state,” states the letter, which was led by Reps. Rob Menendez (D-Jersey City), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing), and LaMonica McIver (D-Newark).

Roxbury local officials, too, have reacted to the report with alarm; following local protests, the all-Republican township council passed a resolution opposing the placement of a detention facility in the town.

New Jersey is already home to two operational immigrant detention facilities, one in Newark and another in Elizabeth, and plans are underway to create more detention capacity at the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst military installation.

Noem more!

After a woman was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week, calls to impeach or otherwise remove Secretary Noem have exploded among Democrats, and at least three of New Jersey’s Democratic House members are on board. Articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Rep. Robin Kelly earlier this week, with Reps. Menendez, Watson Coleman, and McIver all listed as co-sponsors.

“Every day that Secretary Noem remains in office is a day that communities across our country are unsafe and that Americans are at risk,” Menendez said. “We cannot allow this to continue. Since President Trump won’t remove Secretary Noem, I am supporting articles of impeachment.”

Plenty of other Democrats have also called for Noem to go, including for reasons beyond immigration; Reps. Frank Pallone (D-Long Branch) led a letter this week demanding that President Donald Trump remove Noem from office due to her “misguided leadership” of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a call that Rep. Herb Conaway (D-Delran) signed onto as well.

“Kristi Noem has proven herself no better suited for a leadership role, and we urge you to immediately remove her and submit qualified nominees to lead DHS and FEMA to the Senate as soon as possible,” the letter states. “The American people deserve better.”

Freezing out ICE

Government funding bills continued to wend their way through Congress this week, lessening the prospect of another government shutdown at the end of the month. But not every New Jersey Democrat is on board: Senators Kim and Booker both voted against one appropriations package in the Senate, while Reps. McIver, Watson Coleman, and Menendez opposed another in the House.

And one of the bills that has yet to make it through either chamber of Congress, funding the DHS, could prove to be a particular challenge. Some Democrats are signaling their disapproval of any measure that would give more money to the government’s controversial immigration enforcement efforts, among them Booker.

“I am not going to support a budget that gives more money to an agency right now that is out of control,” Booker said, per Pix11. “That’s not even a question for me. I will not be voting to support this budget until we start seeing some true accountability and high professional standards.”

Booker also introduced a pair of bills this week to reign in the power of ICE and the DHS: one requiring immigration enforcement officers to wear body cameras, and a second that would establish higher training standards for federal law enforcement officers. Rep. Donald Norcross (D-Camden), too, introduced a separate body camera-related bill in the House.

The failed votes will continue until morale improves

A relatively obscure bill that would have limited overtime pay for voluntary worker training programs unexpectedly failed on the House floor this week, with two of New Jersey’s Republican congressmen among those responsible.

Reps. Chris Smith (R-Manchester) and Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis) – both of whom have longstanding ties to organized labor despite their party affiliation – joined a breakaway group of six Republicans who sank the bill, and GOP leaders pulled two other labor-related bills from consideration soon afterwards. According to NJ Spotlight News, both congressmen felt that the bill would be a blow to organized labor, with Smith even brandishing a letter from the AFL-CIO to make his point.

“Once I really understood and looked at the bill, I didn’t feel comfortable,” Van Drew told NJ Spotlight after the vote. “Bottom line: People who got a certain amount in their paychecks would get less. I don’t agree with that.”

Tuesday’s vote wasn’t the first time New Jersey’s Republicans defected on a labor bill this Congress; in December, Van Drew, Smith, and Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-Westfield) all teamed up to support a Democratic-led bill restoring collective bargaining rights for federal workers.

War powerless

Last week, it looked like the GOP-controlled Senate might take the remarkable step of rebuking President Trump’s military actions in Venezuela via a war powers resolution, which would have required congressional approval for further operations. But while five Republican senators voted to advance the resolution last week, two of them returned to the Republican fold when it came up for a further vote on Wednesday, dooming it to failure.

Senators Booker and Andy Kim both strongly supported the resolution, and Booker said that Republicans “refused to do their jobs” to reassert congressional authority over acts of war.

“The Constitution is unambiguous: Congress has the power and responsibility to authorize the use of military force and declare war,” Booker said. “Congress has a duty of oversight. Congress must serve as a check, not a rubber stamp, to the President. Congressional Republicans have failed on all of these counts.”

En banc shot

A month and a half after her disqualification from service as acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey by a three-judge federal appellate panel, Alina Habba made a move this week to get the entire Third Circuit to reconsider her case.

Habba resigned from her contested office in December after the Third Circuit ruled against her, but said at the time that she would be interested in returning if the courts allowed it. Now, with its new petition to get an en banc rehearing, the Justice Department is once again gearing up to make the argument that President Trump’s unusual appointment of Habba was lawful and proper.

“The panel’s interpretation of the [Federal Vacancies Reform Act] would hobble Presidential transitions and has been routinely violated by the last four administrations without any court holding the practice unlawful,” the motion states. “Rehearing en banc is warranted.”

In the month since Habba resigned, New Jersey’s U.S. Attorney’s office has been led by a triumvirate of officials who each have jurisdiction over different divisions of the office – though the Trump administration said that arrangement, too, has come under legal challenge.

Congressman names a bill after the thing that nearly killed him

Rep. Norcross nearly died last year after a gallbladder infection progressed to sepsis, and he’s now putting forward legislation to help others like him. The SEPSIS Act – which, of course, stands for the Securing Enhanced Programs, Systems and Initiatives for Sepsis Act – would direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create a new sepsis education program and direct staff and resources to focus on the condition.

“I am here today because of the excellent doctors and nurses who saved my life, but too many families aren’t as lucky,” Norcross said. “With the SEPSIS Act, we can change that. We can save lives and reduce the devastating toll this condition has on our loved ones.”

Norcross has a bipartisan pair of New Jersey co-sponsors in Rep. Kean and Senator Kim; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) are also taking up the charge in the upper chamber.

“New Jersey has long been a leader in the fight against sepsis, and I am grateful to partner with a fellow member of our state’s delegation to bring this critical effort to the federal level,” Kean said.

Other Garden State plots

• With an especially aggressive strain of the flu sweeping the nation, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-Tenafly) put forward a set of proposals this week for states to fight back, including via his FIGHT FLU Act, which would give states more money for mobile flu vaccination centers.

“This flu season is particularly deadly, and we need more people to get their flu shots,” Gottheimer said. “Again, let me be as clear as day: Politicians should not overrule doctors. Ideology should never replace science. And when families get confused, fewer kids get vaccinated – and more kids end up in hospitals like this one.”

• Late on Tuesday, the Trump administration suddenly cut off $2 billion worth of funding for mental health and drug addiction services – then, after an outcry, reversed course just 24 hours later. Democrats reacted to the entire saga with derision and alarm.

“This series of events showcase the ineptitude of Secretary Kennedy and the overzealous nature of his team,” Rep. Watson Coleman said. “I’m working with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to put in guardrails to prevent Secretary Kennedy and the extremists in the Trump administration from ever doing this again.”

• Rep. Van Drew announced this week that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has completed its restructuring of the Atlantic City Housing Authority after taking it over last year, and said that there will be 25-40 new job opportunities at the agency.

“I have always said the residents living under the previous ACHA deserved better, and now we are finally seeing some real progress,” Van Drew said. “HUD came in, did a full overhaul, and focused on what actually matters: putting residents first. Now that work is paying off.”",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bonnie-impeachment.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 04:57:13.938719

“This operation was never about safety, it’s a targeted political operation and Minnesota won’t stand for it,” Walz said after the lawsuit against ICE and DHS was filed.
“Mayor Frey and Governor Walz have to get their city under control,” Noem said in a DHS press release.","The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — both Democrats — marking a striking escalation in an already volatile standoff between the state and federal government.

The investigation centers on whether Walz and Frey violated federal law by allegedly conspiring to impede immigration agents during the Trump administration’s sweeping enforcement operation in the Twin Cities, sources told CBS News.

“Two days ago it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly. Weaponizing the justice system and threatening political opponents is a dangerous, authoritarian tactic,” Walz said in a statement following reports of the probe. “The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.”

The move comes after weeks of mass Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deployments in Minneapolis and St. Paul, public protests following deadly encounters involving federal agents and repeated threats from the Trump administration to further escalate its response.

At issue is 18 U.S.C. § 372, a rarely used statute that criminalizes conspiracies to prevent federal officers from performing their duties through force, intimidation or threats. In plain terms, the administration is advancing the theory that criticism and opposition by elected officials may have crossed the line from protected political speech into criminal obstruction.

The reported probe lands amid extraordinary tensions.

Since December, the Department of Homeland Security has flooded Minneapolis with thousands of federal agents under what it calls Operation Metro Surge. The deployment was followed by the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good during an ICE operation and a second shooting days later.

The incidents ignited protests across the Twin Cities and prompted Walz to activate the National Guard to prevent further unrest.

Earlier this week, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, joined by Minneapolis and St. Paul, sued DHS and ICE, alleging the surge violates the Constitution, unlawfully commandeers state resources and targets Minnesota for political retaliation.

“This operation was never about safety, it’s a targeted political operation and Minnesota won’t stand for it,” Walz said after the lawsuit against ICE and DHS was filed.

Frey has argued that the overwhelming federal presence has made Minneapolis less safe by diverting local law enforcement resources and inflaming tensions.

“No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable,” Frey said after the second shooting involving an ICE agent. “America, this is not the path we can be on.”

The Trump administration has responded with increasingly incendiary rhetoric.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has accused Walz and Frey of encouraging criminal obstruction.

“Mayor Frey and Governor Walz have to get their city under control,” Noem said in a DHS press release. “They are encouraging impeding and assault against our law enforcement which is a federal crime, a felony.”

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche went further, framing the conflict in explicitly punitive terms.

Ron Gochez, a teacher and member of Unión del Barrio, said volunteers who respond to the operations are dispatched around the clock.

""These operations are literally happening 24 hours a day. We get calls at 3 in the morning, 5 in the morning,"" he said.

Civil rights groups reported at least 20 immigration enforcement operations in a single day this week, including in Montebello where agents were captured on video getting out of an unmarked truck and climbing a ladder to chase construction workers on a rooftop.

Those types of scenes, activists say, have kept many families in a constant state of fear for months.

Baristas at Vida Pura, a coffee shop in East L.A., said the raids have directly impacted their families. Alexa Ibarra said her family shut down its food truck out of fear. Elias Reyes said he's taken on a second job and is worried his father - a U.S. citizen - may be targeted because of the color of his skin and line of work.

Gochez said that while the enforcement actions have been constant and intensified, so has the community response.

""Now we have thousands of people patrolling all over Southern California. Literally all the way from Riverside to Santa Barbara to San Ysidro at the border, to Lancaster,"" he said. ""They failed to take as many people as they wanted to, and we attribute that to the organized resistance.""

In East L.A., workers at Vida Pura said the raids weigh heavily on the community.

""Just knowing that people are living in fear right now, it's not fair,"" Ibarra said.

The shop displays a sign in Spanish stating that it proudly welcomes immigrants.

""We all have to stay strong together,"" Ibarra said. ""We all have to stay united and protect each other, honestly.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18418371_web-ice-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-17 02:57:39.949999

The Cherokee Nation has recently informed its citizens to be aware of a potential presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the area.

Local leaders, including the Cherokee Nation, are advising residents to exercise caution, stay informed, and know their rights when interacting with federal immigration officials.

""Every day we get phone calls from clients or potential clients or just members of the community concerned with what is going on in this country and what they are seeing on the news, on social media,"" Rivas & Associates CEO and Immigration Attorney Lorena Rivas said.

The Cherokee Nation has received calls and messages from citizens about ICE potentially operating in some manner in northeast Oklahoma. Local legal experts encourage citizens to carry identification, assert their identity respectfully, and report any concerns to trusted authorities.

""Do tell your identity and if you definitely have some lawful status here, you’re a green card holder or again a U.S Citizen express that and hopefully you have the evidence to show that you should not be detained or questioned by ICE,"" said Rivas.

Experts emphasize the importance of knowing one's rights if approached by immigration officials and recommend not fleeing when encountered by ICE. They note that federal agents must follow specific protocols.

""They are a law enforcement agency. They have their own set of rules but at the same time they have to respect the constitution rights of people, which is due process and not be subject to unlawful arrests of people without the proper warrants or the proper justification,"" said Rivas.

The Cherokee Nation is reaching out to federal contacts to determine if an ICE presence is factual and, if so, what the scope of any ICE operation is in the area. Regardless, the guidance remains the same: stay informed, know your rights, and communicate concerns with trusted authorities.

""Hopefully many of our law-abiding immigrants don’t have to encounter this situation if they do, it's good to be prepared by having a telephone number memorized who they can call, contact once they are detained. Also making preparations in case you are detained for your kids, your businesses, your home. Also, an advice try to talk to an immigration attorney now before being detained,"" advised Rivas.

The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests.","Two videos add new details to what happened before and after an immigration agent shot a man in the leg in the Hawthorne neighborhood in north Minneapolis Wednesday night.

One video, a livestream of a 911 call from inside the house, includes a woman saying that the immigration agent shot the man, who she said is her husband, as he was entering the house. The livestream also shows at least one child present in the house.

Another video, taken by a north Minneapolis resident from across the street and shared with the Reformer, shows federal agents firing numerous times into the house, breaking a second-floor window.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in an email to the Reformer on Friday that the agents had fired tear gas, not live rounds.

The incident began on Interstate 94, where federal agents were trying to apprehend a man, federal law enforcement and Minneapolis police said. The man drove toward a house on the 600 block of 24th Avenue North in north Minneapolis, where he wrecked the car outside the house and ran towards the house, federal and local law enforcement said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Thursday that the man who was shot is Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, an undocumented Venezuelan national, and that he “began to resist and violently assault the officer.”

“While Sosa-Celis and law enforcement were in a struggle on the ground, two subjects came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle,” the official federal statement said. The statement goes on to say that Sosa-Celis then began striking an officer with a shovel or broom stick.

According to the DHS statement, the officer, fearing for his life and safety, then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life,” after which the three men ran into the house.

Federal immigration agents arrested all three men, the statement said, and Sosa-Celis and the officer who shot him were at the hospital when the statement was published.

The Washington Post interviewed Sosa-Celis’s mother, Alicia Celis, who said her son told her that the man who was pursued by federal agents was actually Sosa-Celis’s friend, one of the three men arrested.

Facebook livestream of 911 call and observer video

According to Celis, Sosa-Celis opened the door to let his friend inside, and as Sosa-Celis went to close the door, an ICE officer shot him in the leg, reported the Post.

A Facebook livestream video, which appears to show the moments after the man was shot from the perspective of his wife and other people inside the house, partly lines up with Sosa-Celis’s account. The video was published by an account by the name of Lachamaka Mendoza and is timestamped to Wednesday 6:51 p.m., the exact time Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said local police started receiving 911 calls about the shooting.

The Reformer has requested records of the 911 calls made after the shooting to further verify the video.

In the video, at least five people, including one small child, are in a house while law enforcement lights flash outside. They speak on the phone in Spanish to what sounds like a 911 operator, saying that someone has been shot in the leg by “guys from ICE.”

“Please help, we have kids,” one person said.

A woman then tells the operator: “It was ICE, they were chasing my husband for like half an hour and they were trying to crash into him. He got to the house and as we were closing the door they shot him.”

Another woman adds: “Tell them that they shot the door.” It is not clear from the video whether she meant that the agents shot through the doorway or at a door.

The 911 call suggests that the agent shot at the man as he was trying to escape into the house, which would contradict the Department of Homeland Security account that the federal immigration agent fired a shot defensively.

A separate video taken by a north Minneapolis resident starts around 7:26 p.m. and shows the vantage from across 24th Avenue North.

In that video, over a dozen agents surround the house. At minute 2:55 in the video, the agents fire what DHS said was tear gas into the house, shattering the second floor window; at least three more shots are heard later.

At around 5 minutes into the video, federal agents enter the house. One observer yells that there are children in the house. Around 16 minutes into the video, a woman who appears to be wearing a pink shirt exits the house — the Facebook livestream video also included a woman with a pink shirt.

“This is something I would have never expected to see in my life,” said the man who took the video and was granted anonymity by the Reformer. “It’s still hard for me to believe that this is actually happening in my city, so close to my home.”

The BCA’s independent investigation

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the state agency that investigates law enforcement shootings, was on the scene Wednesday night along with FBI agents to process evidence.

Also present at the scene were Minnesota State Patrol and Hennepin County sheriff’s deputies, which O’Hara said were there to help control the crowd of over 100 protestors and observers who had gathered, as well as Federal Bureau of Prisons officers.

The BCA said in an X post Wednesday night that it is investigating the shooting in an independent investigation.

The shooting comes one week after the killing of Renee Good by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in south Minneapolis touched off a wave of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the killing of Renee Good, the Trump administration said she was attempting to run over the ICE officer and kill him. But bystander footage shows a chaotic scene with the officer to the side of her car when he shoots her as she seemingly tries to flee.

All three men are from Venezuela and came to the U.S. in 2022 and 2023, according to the DHS statement. The statement describes two of the men as criminals, though the only listed offenses for Sosa-Celis are driving without a license and giving a false name to a law enforcement officer.

Minnesota court records show that a 24-year-old Julio Cesar Sosa Celis has been fined for speeding and driving without a license or proof of insurance.

Last week, an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, 37-year-old mother of three, in Minneapolis, sparking nationwide protests. On Thursday, President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and send troops to Minnesota.

Following the shooting of Renee Good, ICE’s violent tactics have come under increasing scrutiny. A new investigation by ProPublica documents more than 40 cases of immigration agents using banned chokeholds and other moves that can cut off breathing.

In one case, ICE agents violently arrested an ICU nurse in California named Amanda Trebach while she was documenting ICE operations in the Los Angeles area. Two plainclothes, masked agents were filmed pinning her against the pavement as they knelt on her back. One agent put his knee on Trebach’s head for a brief moment.

EYEWITNESS 1: Filming you.

EYEWITNESS 2: Get off her head!

AMANDA TREBACH: Get off me!

EYEWITNESS 2: Get off! Your knee is on her [bleep] head!

AMANDA TREBACH: Get off me!

EYEWITNESS 2: Get it off!

AMANDA TREBACH: Get off me!

ICE AGENT 1: Get back. Get back. Get back.

EYEWITNESS 2: Get off her head!

AMANDA TREBACH: Get off me!

ICE AGENT 1: Get back. Get back.

ICE AGENT 2: You better get back.

AMANDA TREBACH: Get off me!

ICE AGENT 1: Get back. Get back.

EYEWITNESS 1: This is public property, sir. This is public property.

EYEWITNESS 2: Streaming live, this is ICE beating her up. They’ve got a knee on her head.

ICE AGENT 1: Scoot back.

EYEWITNESS 2: I am where I need to be: 10 feet. So…

ICE AGENT 2: Can you guys get her in the van?

AMANDA TREBACH: Sir?

EYEWITNESS 2: You OK?

AMANDA TREBACH: Yeah.

AMY GOODMAN: Amanda Trebach was then held in federal custody. After her release, she appeared on Democracy Now!

AMANDA TREBACH: They came out in a convoy. They jumped out of the vehicle. As you could see, they pinned me to the ground, and they handcuffed me. They took me into an unmarked vehicle. They did not read me my rights. They didn’t tell me where I was going. They shut the vehicle. They drove me to the other side of the noncivilian side of Terminal Island. And basically, they kidnapped me.

AMY GOODMAN: We’re joined now by ProPublica reporter Nicole Foy, her latest article headlined “We Found More Than 40 Cases of Immigration Agents Using Banned Chokeholds and Other Moves That Can Cut Off Breathing.” In October, Nicole also revealed how ICE detained more than 170 U.S. citizens.

Nicole Foy, welcome to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. Why don’t you lay out your latest findings? Talk about these potentially lethal chokeholds — which are, in fact, illegal?

NICOLE FOY: Yes. My co-worker McKenzie Funk and I, we spent of this last year documenting aggressive tactics by immigration agents. And what we found is that over the last year, immigration agents across the country have used these really dangerous and banned — by their own policy — chokehold and carotid restraints, as well as many of these also dangerous kneeling on people’s necks, kneeling on backs, like we saw with Amanda, in ways that can really restrict your breathing and your blood flow, which is one of the reasons why their own training actually highly discourages these types of arrest. But we’ve seen it across the country.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Nicole, can you talk about some of the specific examples that you document — for instance, Arnoldo Bazan, a 10th grader in Texas?

NICOLE FOY: Yes, he was — that’s a case that I think really sticks out, because he is a 16-year-old U.S. citizen, and he was really violently arrested with his father in a store in Houston. You can hear him in the video, as officers are putting him in a chokehold, screaming that he’s a minor, that he’s 16, he was going to school, that he’s a U.S. citizen. And yet he told us that that didn’t matter. The agent continued to use a chokehold on him, that, again, is banned unless there is a call for deadly force.

And when we showed videos like this one to a number of police officers, other former immigration officials and top DHS officials, they were really appalled, and they had no idea what could have prompted this level of deadly force, especially against someone like a 16-year-old U.S. citizen, who really had really difficult and dramatic injuries to deal with in the aftermath.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Now, there is a federal ban on chokeholds and similar tactics. Have any officers, from your reporting, who’ve used these tactics faced disciplinary measures?

NICOLE FOY: We’ve yet to find any evidence that they have. We asked the Department of Homeland Security if they have disciplined any officers, especially in cases where we showed them these videos and said, “Your own policy bans the use of a carotid restraint, the use of a chokehold. Have these officers been disciplined?” And they did not answer us, would not tell us if any had been disciplined for these tactics. And they stood very firmly behind their officers’ actions and said that they were acting with the utmost professionalism and even using a reasonable amount of force.

AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to read from your piece. “Immigration agents have put civilians’ lives at risk using more than their guns. An agent in Houston put a teenage citizen into a chokehold, wrapping his arm around the boy’s neck, choking him so hard … his neck had red welts hours later. A black-masked agent in Los Angeles pressed his knee into a woman’s neck while she was handcuffed; [she] then appeared to pass out. An agent in Massachusetts jabbed his finger and thumb into the neck and arteries of a young father who refused to be separated from his wife and 1-year-old daughter. The man’s eyes rolled back in his head and he started convulsing.” That’s what you wrote. Tell us more about these cases.

NICOLE FOY: I think the case of the young father in Massachusetts is particularly disturbing, and was really disturbing for so many of the bystanders who were there witnessing it and recording it. Like you said, he refused to be separated from his young daughter, a 1-year-old, who was in the car with him in between him and his wife. Agents had come to arrest his wife, but she also didn’t want to leave her 1-year-old behind. She said that she was still breastfeeding, and she couldn’t leave the child behind. And in an effort — and we know this because we reviewed bodycam footage and bystander footage — we know that officers really wanted them, specifically this young man, Carlos, to let go, and he wouldn’t let go of his daughter or his wife.

And so, you can see in the video the moment when an agent decides to reach around from the back and press his fingers and thumb into his neck. And he appears to start having a seizure. And he shakes so violently that his young daughter, who is, of course, crying, is shaking with him.

He did end up getting to be released with his daughter, but he’s filed a lawsuit alleging not only excessive force, but also alleging that ICE officers delayed medical attention when he requested it on the scene. And so, it was — it’s really a difficult video to watch, but these arrests are playing out around the country, and often in full view of cameras and witnesses.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And this issue of ICE arresting American citizens? You mentioned there have been about 130 of them, including about a dozen elected officials. Could you talk about some of those cases, especially the case of Dulce Consuelo Díaz Morales?

NICOLE FOY: Yes. So, last year in October — and this count was only updated as of October 2025 — we had found that more than 170 U.S. citizens in total were arrested around the country by immigration agents. Around 130 of those were actually arrested after accusations of assaulting officers or during protests or because they were alleged to be obstructing ICE activities. But there were also many other U.S. citizens, like Dulce, who were arrested and detained because of the fact that immigration agents believed that they were not U.S. citizens. And this is despite evidence that was often presented to them at the time of arrest or afterwards by family members. I believe that is the case of what happened with Dulce, that she — they presented a birth certificate, and yet she was still detained for a number of days over the holidays, if I’m remembering correctly.

AMY GOODMAN: Dulce Consuelo Díaz Morales’s case first gained national attention when one of her attorneys took to the internet out of frustration with the lack of legal process and progress in the case.

VICTORA SLATTON: My name is Victoria Slatton. I’m an immigration attorney. I currently have a client who is a U.S. citizen who is in ICE custody. … They are blatantly ignoring orders from the court. They are not allowing me access to my client. And I am at a loss, and I’m incredibly angry.

AMY GOODMAN: Dulce Consuelo Díaz Morales was finally released from ICE detention earlier this month. And this is how NBC4 Washington reported on her release and reunion with her 5-year-old son.

MAURICIO CASILLAS: This is the moment when Dulce Consuelo Díaz Morales is once again able to embrace her son. The 22-year-old mother says she was overjoyed, and it was an incredibly emotional moment when she saw her son once again. She says she was detained by ICE agents on December 14th in front of her family near her home in Baltimore. She says ICE agents told her to get out of the car because she was being detained. She says she tried to explain to them that she was born here in Maryland, but she says they didn’t believe her.

AMY GOODMAN: In your ProPublica exposé, what has surprised you most, Nicole?

NICOLE FOY: I think one of the most surprising things is maybe that both — like, this is just happening around the country, and often just really in full view of cameras, whether people — whether immigration agents are arresting U.S. citizens —

AMY GOODMAN: And they’re grabbing cameras.

NICOLE FOY: And grabbing cameras. I think that is really, like, as someone who is a journalist, and so, of course, as a huge advocate of the free press — it is perfectly legal to document these activities, and yet many of the U.S. citizens who have been arrested by immigration agents believe that they were arrested because they were filming, and after they were told to stop filming.

AMY GOODMAN: And agents are usually masked. How can they be held accountable? You are documenting illegal actions.

NICOLE FOY: I think it’s really difficult. We’re, of course, seeing a number of states and other municipalities try to find some way to allow their residents to file — to file lawsuits against officers. But that’s really difficult when not only have — are these agents masked, the government is not telling us, usually, who someone is that has committed an act of excessive force or something like that. But on top of that, the institutions within ICE and DHS that are supposed to hold these officers accountable and at least conduct some type of internal review have been just completely stripped of personnel and authority.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you very much for being with us. Nicole Foy is a reporter for ProPublica covering immigration and labor. We’ll link to all your recent pieces.

Coming up, President Trump threatens to invoke the Insurrection Act and send troops to Minneapolis. We’ll talk about the significance of this and also speak with Mahmoud Khalil about a ruling that came down in court yesterday. Could it lead to his rearrest and possible deportation? Stay with us.

Grace Eliza Goodwin

The US justice department is investigating two prominent Minnesota liberals over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations, an escalation of the Trump's administration's clash with Democrats.

Gov Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are facing an inquiry over comments made about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.

The investigation came as a federal judge limited what actions thousands of federal law enforcement officers could use in Minneapolis, blocking the use of pepper spray and arrests of peaceful protesters.

Protests have ramped up in the city after Renee Good, 37, was shot and killed by an ICE agent last week.

New details also came to light on Friday about Good's death. The Minneapolis woman was found by paramedics with at least three gunshot wounds and possibly a fourth to the head, according to official reports viewed by CBS.

Governor Walz responded on Friday to news of the inquiry against him by posting on X: ""Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic.

""The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.""

In a statement to the BBC, Mayor Frey said ""I will not be intimidated"".

""This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our streets,"" he said.

The BBC has reached out to the justice department about the apparent investigation.

The governor has urged Minnesotans to protest peacefully, but members of the Trump administration have accused him of inflammatory rhetoric, like describing ICE as a ""modern-day Gestapo"". Frey has demanded that immigration agents get out of Minneapolis.

The inquiry is focused on a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 372, which makes it a crime for two or more people to conspire to prevent federal officers from carrying out their official duties through ""force, intimidation or threats"", a US official told CBS.

Protests continued in Minneapolis on Friday as US District Judge Katherine Menendez blocked federal authorities from using pepper spray and other non-lethal force on those demonstrating.

The 83-page order halts the thousands of federal officers currently deployed to the city as part of immigration operations from arresting peaceful protesters.

It also blocks them from stopping or detaining those who are driving or passengers in vehicles ""where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering"".

The judge notes that a person following federal law enforcement in their vehicle ""does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop"".

Before she was killed, footage showed Good in her SUV, appearing to honk the vehicle to alert neighbours in the area of the presence of immigration authorities.

The Trump administration has said that Good was impeding federal law enforcement and tried to run the agent over before he opened fire. Local officials say Good was a legal observer who posed no danger.

Video of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is blocking traffic and parked in the middle of the street. An officer instructs her to get out of the car.

As Good turns her wheel apparently trying to drive away, her Honda Pilot SUV pulls forward with one of the agents standing near the front of the vehicle. He pulls his gun and fires.

An incident report from the Minneapolis Fire Department, which was viewed by CBS News, said when they responded to the shooting scene last week, it appeared Good had been shot twice in the chest, once in her left forearm and a fourth wound, possibly from a gunshot, was seen ""on the left side of the patient's head"".

Paramedics found Good unresponsive with an irregular pulse, and she was pronounced dead in the ambulance on the way to hospital, according to the report seen by CBS.

Footage from the scene shows the agent walking off afterwards.

But Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have told CBS the officer suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the incident. No further details have been disclosed.

The FBI is investigating the incident, although there is no federal civil rights inquiry into the agent who opened fire. Local officials and authorities say they have been shut out of the investigation.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump blasted demonstrators and local leaders on Friday.

On Truth Social, he accused protesters of being ""highly paid professionals"", adding that Walz and Frey had ""totally lost control"".

Later, the Republican president told reporters at the White House that he did not plan to invoke the Insurrection Act and send in troops to quell unrest in Minnesota, after earlier this week suggesting he might do so.

This act would essentially revoke the $75 billion budget Congress gave ICE last year, in addition to the $10 billion that ICE had already been appropriated.

The House Appropriations Committee chair, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., indicated that he was optimistic about a deal earlier this week.","Support for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement is surging in the wake of the killing of Renee Nicole Good and officers’ increasingly violent conduct in Minneapolis and across the United States. Democrats in Congress, however, are clinging to the idea that the agency, which has become the tip of the spear in President Donald Trump’s authoritarian crackdown, can be reformed instead.

On Jan. 9, ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed Good, a Minneapolis resident. Since then, multiple surveys have been published showing support nearing all-time highs for abolishing ICE.

A Civiqs poll published Monday found that 42% of respondents supported abolishing ICE, while 49% opposed, with support for abolishing the agency rising from 25% at the beginning of 2025. On Tuesday, a survey from the Economist and YouGov found that 46% of respondents support abolishing the agency, while 43% oppose doing so.

So far, however, calls to abolish ICE have gone unheard by political leadership, with only a handful of Congressional Democrats supporting the move.

It’s not clear, however, that Democrats will even use the leverage they have ahead of the Jan. 30 appropriations deadline to force reforms on the Department of Homeland Security. If Congress does not pass appropriations bills before the deadline, they risk a partial shutdown of Trump’s government, with shutdowns corresponding to which funding bills are passed. The most recent government shutdown was the longest in U.S. history.

In the Senate, members of the self-fashioned “Fight Club,” a group of Democrats aiming to challenge current leadership, have responded with reform bills aimed at reining in ICE.

“These actions have no place in our democratic republic, and we cannot allow these secret police tactics and attacks on our fundamental freedoms.”

The most drastic measure, known as the PUBLIC SAFETY Act, has been proposed by Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev. The bill would redirect some $75 billion from ICE toward local law enforcement agencies. This act would essentially revoke the $75 billion budget Congress gave ICE last year, in addition to the $10 billion that ICE had already been appropriated.

“On streets in Oregon and across the country in recent weeks, we’ve witnessed the dangerous, lawless actions of ICE and federal agents, a manifestation of Trump’s authoritarian regime,” Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told Salon. “ICE agents shot and killed Renee Good in Minnesota. In Portland and other cities, heavily armed, unidentified federal forces in unmarked vehicles are grabbing protesters off the street, even detaining U.S. citizens. These actions have no place in our democratic republic, and we cannot allow these secret police tactics and attacks on our fundamental freedoms.”

In response, Merkley is calling for the removal of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, and the passage of the Preventing Authoritarian Policing Tactics on America’s Streets Act, which would force ICE to display officers’ identities and limit ICE’s crowd control functions, among other provisions. Merkley is also backing the Restoring Access for Detainees Act, proposed by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., which would require DHS to allow detainees to contact their families and legal counsel.

Similarly, in the House, Democrats have eyed changes to ICE. Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., who sits on the Committee on Homeland Security, told The Hill last week that “I think there is a pathway to accountability through the appropriations process.”

The Congressional Progressive Caucus announced Tuesday that it would oppose new funding for DHS until meaningful reforms are enacted.

“Our caucus members will oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriation bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices,” Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said at a press conference Tuesday. “We cannot and we should not continue to fund agencies that operate with impunity, that escalate violence and that undermine the very freedoms this country claims to uphold.”

Similarly, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus indicated to Politico that it would also be supporting reforms to ICE. The Democrats who favor reforms, however, have yet to consolidate around a list of demands.

Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., a House progressive, has proposed multiple bills relating to the agency. The first would end qualified federal immunity for ICE officers. The second would fully dismantle the agency, with Thanedar explaining that the U.S. was able to effectively manage immigration enforcement, a civil issue, before ICE’s creation in 2003.

“Before 2003, without ICE, various federal agencies were able to take care of business, and we can do this without ICE. But we do not need the murderers. We do not need this paramilitary organizations’ members on our street terrorizing US citizens,” Thanedar said at a press conference on Wednesday.

Some House Democrats have also banded together to present articles of impeachment for Noem, accusing her of obstruction of Congress, violation of the public trust, and self-dealing. However, these articles aren’t likely to go anywhere in the GOP-controlled House, and are even less likely to result in a conviction in the Senate.

So far, however, it’s not clear whether the appetite for major reforms for ICE, let alone discussion of eliminating the agency, has percolated into Democratic leadership in Congress.

The leader of the Democrats in the House, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., laid responsibility for Good’s death at the feet of administration officials and promised a decisive response. Jeffries has separately indicated that he’s planning to speak with other members of Congress on the issue this week. However, he has yet to make demands other than for a comprehensive investigation into the killing, an investigation which the administration has made clear isn’t going to happen.

“Blood is clearly on the hands of those individuals within the administration who’ve been pushing an extreme policy that has nothing to do with immigration enforcement connected to removing violent felons from this country,” Jeffries told reporters last week.

The leader of Democrats in the Senate, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has also demanded an investigation, but little else. On separate occasions, Schumer blamed the shooting first on a lack of cooperation between ICE officers and local police, and then on a lack of training for ICE agents, though these don’t appear to be new policy proposals. Notably, the killer has been working with ICE since 2015. While ICE has often been criticized for its low standards for its officers, Ross had more than enough time to receive training.

All of this is coming to a head just weeks before the Jan. 30 appropriations deadline. While there are some congressional Democrats who are poised to put up a fight, all that the party has secured so far is a delay in the vote on DHS funding. The House Appropriations Committee chair, Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., indicated that he was optimistic about a deal earlier this week.

The Trump administration has repeatedly said the surge of immigration enforcement in Minnesota is the result of “sanctuary politicians who release criminal illegal aliens directly from jails onto the streets to terrorize more innocent Americans,” but Minnesota officials say the state’s prisons work directly with ICE.

Since President Donald Trump took office, Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey “have released nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens back onto the streets of Minneapolis,” said U.S. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin this week, calling on the state “to stop this dangerous policy and commit to honoring the ICE arrest detainers of the more than 1,360 criminal illegal aliens in Minnesota’s custody.”

The Minnesota Department of Corrections, however, said Thursday night those numbers are “categorically false.”

Of about 8,000 people incarcerated in the state’s prisons, 207 are non-U.S. citizens, according to the DOC statement. The state’s prisons notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement when someone with a detention hold is being released from custody to coordinate a pick-up from immigration officials.

County jails and workhouses are a different matter. State law says local law enforcement cannot hold people in custody solely based on civil immigration detainer requests from ICE, according to a legal opinion last year from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.

County boards, however, can enter into such agreements with ICE, according to another advisory opinion from Ellison. Seven of Minnesota’s 87 counties have agreements with ICE. They are Cass, Crow Wing, Freeborn, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Mille Lacs and Sherburne counties, according to ICE.

Ramsey County said in 2014 that the county jail would no longer hold people on ICE detainers without a judge’s order, adopting a policy that was already in place for the Hennepin County jail. At the time, ICE directives and federal court decisions had made such holds discretionary.

In 2017, Ramsey County notified ICE they would stop housing people suspected of violating immigration rules effective Jan. 1, 2018; the sheriff’s office said they were losing money in the detentions.

“The ongoing misstatements by DHS leadership reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of how the criminal justice system operates,” DOC said in its statement. “Conflating local jail populations with state prison operations and confusing immigration enforcement authority with correctional custody misleads the public and obscures the truth.”

The DOC pointed out that Homeland Security hasn’t specified which jurisdictions or timeframes they’re using for their numbers. DHS and ICE spokespeople did not respond to Pioneer Press messages Friday.

Additionally, “DHS has not identified a single instance in which the Minnesota Department of Corrections released an individual from state prison custody in violation of an ICE detainer,” the statement said.

Last year, 84 people with ICE detainers were released from prison and DOC staff notified ICE in advance and coordinated with ICE officials to facilitate the custody transfer when requested.

Many on DHS’s ‘worst of worst’ list weren’t in state prison

According to Homeland Security, their operation targets “criminal illegal aliens” with prior convictions for serious crimes such as sexual assault, domestic violence and gang affiliation, as well as individuals with final deportation orders.

Although DHS has not released a complete list of those arrested, the agency has said in several news releases they’ve included “pedophiles, rapists and violent thugs” who were “allowed to roam Minnesota’s streets thanks to sanctuary policies.”

DHS has highlighted some of the people they’ve arrested, calling them “the worst of the worst” and listing their charges or convictions; however, in most cases, where those took place are not included. The names do not include dates of births, making independent verification by the Pioneer Press through Minnesota and federal court records systems unreliable.

Minnesota’s Department of Corrections operates state prisons, not local jails. Many people who DHS recently listed as the “worst of the worst” were never in DOC custody and instead held in county jails, were under ICE-only custody or were in other states’ correctional systems, according to DOC.

A Homeland Security news release Wednesday highlighted the case of German Adriano Llangari Inga, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador charged in a drunken driving crash that killed 31-year-old Victoria Eileen Harwell in north Minneapolis on Aug. 3, 2024.

According to DHS, the Hennepin County jail refused to honor two ICE detainers: first after his arrest and again after he was charged with criminal vehicular homicide.

Court records show that Llangari Inga, 36, was charged on May 2, 2025, after testing on his blood-alcohol content was complete, and arrested eight days later. Three days after his arrest, he was released from the Hennepin County jail after posting a $100,000 bond, despite, according to ICE, a second detainer placed on him.

ICE arrested Llangari Inga on May 16, 2025.

“Victoria Eileen Harwell’s killer NEVER should have been RELEASED from Minnesota jails,” DHS’s McLaughlin said in this week’s news release.

White House, governor at odds

Minnesota law requires DOC to notify ICE when a person in prison is not a U.S. citizen. “DOC fully complies with this requirement and goes further by honoring all detainers as a matter of policy, even though state law does not require detainer compliance,” DOC said in its statement. “ICE alone determines whether to place a detainer and is responsible for arranging pick-up.”

The White House said in a Friday statement that “Minnesota’s ‘leaders’ have chosen defiance over partnership. Instead of working with the Trump Administration to uphold the law and protect public safety, the state’s Democrat politicians have repeatedly boasted of their so-called ‘sanctuary’ status, encouraged resistance, and smeared ICE officers.”

But Walz’s office said the Minnesota legislature “has not passed legislation making Minnesota a sanctuary state, and the governor has not signed any such legislation into law. The fact is, Minnesota cooperates with federal immigration authorities in a number of ways.”

“The federal government seems to suggest that Minnesota’s reluctance to divert its own resources to implement federal policy somehow frustrates the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration laws,” the governor’s office statement said.

“That is simply not the case. It is ridiculous to suggest that Minnesota — a state that is over 1,500 miles away from the Southern border, and a thousand miles from lawmakers in Washington, D.C. who decide and implement border policy — is somehow responsible for a failure of immigration enforcement,” the statement continued.

The White House, meanwhile, said Friday that a “toxic combination of ‘sanctuary’ policies and anti-ICE rhetoric” is endangering federal officers and inciting violence.

“Make no mistake: the responsibility for the enhanced enforcement operations in Minnesota — and the tension and violence — lies squarely with these officials who refuse to partner with the Trump Administration and instead put their Radical Left agenda over public safety and the rule of law,” the White House statement said.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/STP-Z-ICESTPAUL-0117-01.jpg?w=1024&h=706,N,,2026-01-17 00:58:03.773292

During the hold on the deportation agreement between the U.S. and Venezuela, hundreds of Venezuelans were deported to Mexico.","A plane carrying deported immigrants landed in Venezuela on Friday — the first removals from the United States since the Trump administration captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.

The six-hour flight departed from the Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix and landed in Simón Bolívar International Airport, according to U.S. watchdog group Human Rights First, a flight monitor of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and journalists in Caracas. Eastern Air Express, which carries out a significant number of deportations for ICE, was the carrier. Local media reported that the manifesto listed 231 people but that 199 passengers had arrived. It also published photos of the plane arriving on the tarmac.

The flight appears to be the first U.S. deportation flight in over a month to Venezuela. The last one that advocates, experts and journalists tracked was on Dec. 10. Two days later, the Venezuelan government announced the U.S. had unilaterally suspended flights amid escalating tensions. Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to a request for comment from the Miami Herald about who was deported and how many people were on the flight.

Friday’s flight raises questions about how negotiations between Caracas and Washington will affect future deportations. President Donald Trump has made Venezuelans a principal target of his aggressive mass deportation efforts. He stripped deportation protections for more than a half-million Venezuelans who had Temporary Protected Status, leaving them vulnerable to being sent back to Venezuela, where millions have fled political repression and extreme poverty.

Between February and December 2025, the government sent 14,310 deportees to Venezuela on 76 flights, according to watchdog group Human Rights First.

During the hold on the deportation agreement between the U.S. and Venezuela, hundreds of Venezuelans were deported to Mexico. The Herald reported that deported and detained Venezuelans, as well as their families, said immigration agents had offered to send them to countries like Honduras, Colombia, Nicaragua and Ecuador, as well as Uganda, an East African nation with no shared language or cultural ties to Venezuela.

A day after meeting Trump in Washington, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado told reporters that the Venezuelan government has used migration from the South American country as a bargaining chip. When asked about the first deportation flight of Venezuelans after Maduro’s capture, she said the only pathway for the millions Venezuelans to return is to “give the people certainty that we will have a democratic future.”

Venezuela has been experiencing a humanitarian crisis for more than a decade, forcing over 8 million people to flee their country amid economic collapse, political turmoil and shortage of necessities. The U.S. has become one of the primary destinations for the exodus, with over 800,00 Venezuelans living in the country, many in South Florida.

About 5.1 million people in Venezuela face hunger, according to the United Nations, and over half of the population is living in extreme poverty. There are shortages of basic supplies like gasoline and medicine, power and water outages are common, and healthcare infrastructure is inadequate. Violent crime is also common, and the government violently represses journalists and dissidents.

The news comes a little more than a week after an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good during a federal immigration enforcement raid in Minneapolis on January 7. Her death has sparked protests throughout the area and beyond.

The agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, fired his gun after Good allegedly tried to ram him and other officers with her SUV. Ross reportedly suffered internal bleeding when he was hit by her vehicle.

The Trump administration said Good was an agitator, with Vice President JD Vance saying the agent acted in self-defense.

In a separate case, a federal officer shot an illegal migrant in the leg on Wednesday night in Minnesota after being attacked with an object described as a shovel or a broom during an arrest.

DHS later identified the suspects in connection to the case as Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, a criminal illegal migrant from Venezuela, who was previously convicted for driving without a license and arrested for two counts of giving a false name to a police officer.

The other two individuals involved were identified as Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma.

In a social media post on Friday, Noem praised President Donald Trump, saying U.S. borders ""are safer than any time in our nation’s history"" thanks to his crackdown on illegal immigration.

""What President [Donald] Trump and our CBP agents and officers have been able to do in a single year is nothing short of extraordinary,"" she wrote.

""Once again, we have a record low number of encounters at the border and the 8th straight month of zero releases,"" she added. ""Month after month, we are delivering results that were once thought impossible: the most secure border in history and unmatched enforcement successes.""

Good's family released a statement earlier this week to honor her life, as well as their love for her. They also thanked the public for an outpouring of support.

""We want to thank everyone who has reached out in support of Renee and our family,"" Good's parents, Tim and Donna Ganger, along with her four siblings, said in the statement. ""The kind of unending care we’ve been given during this time is exactly the kind that she gave to everyone.""",https://news3lv.com/resources/media2/16x9/5620/1320/0x15/90/3a41bb60-53db-44a5-9997-7a66b0a0380d-GettyImages2256445450.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 22:59:28.033247

“To all the Republicans out there, to all the conservatives out there: You’re about to lose the midterms,” Smith said during an episode of his SiriusXM show. “You’re going to lose, and you might lose the presidency in 2028, and it’s going to be at the fault of your president, Donald Trump.”

He claimed Trump is “blowing it,” pointing to escalating tensions over the administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota and his failure to meet campaign promises to lower the cost of living.

“He’s blowing it for himself, he’s going to blow it for the GOP, he’s going to blow it for Congress, he’s going to blow it for the Senate, and he’s likely going to blow it for the White House, all because of what I said from day 1: The man don’t know how to act,” Smith said.

He added that the president’s claim to return to the country to “normalcy” falls short amid the deployment of federal agents to the North Star State.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is expected to send more than 2,000 agents to Minnesota as part of its immigration operations in the state. Ongoing protests over the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer have led to intense clashes between federal officials and demonstrators. The demonstrations were exacerbated a week later by a second ICE-involved shooting in Minneapolis.

The incidents have sparked concerns among Democrats who have called for DHS reforms.

Now more Americans are taking up the call,"Claire Wang, www.theguardian.com, claire-wang",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/16/abolish-ice-movement-renee-nicole-good,"In the summer of 2018, “abolish ICE” became a rallying cry as thousands took to the streets to protest against immigrant family separations under Trump’s first term.
“There are lessons about taking to the streets,” said Jacinta González, a leading immigrant rights organizer for more than 15 years.
But the phrase “abolish ICE” became a call to arms seemingly overnight when political strategist Sean McElwee typed it in a tweet that went viral.
The momentum behind the “abolish ICE” campaign grew so strong that a dozen legislators endorsed the cause.
“ICE losing credibility in the public’s eye, the recognition of how much power there is in showing up, all that is thanks to the work that happened under the first eruption of the ‘abolish ICE’ movement,” Prieto said.","As mass protests erupted over the past week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent killed Renee Nicole Good, thousands of Americans hoisted signs and marched to thunderous chants of “abolish ICE”.

The mantra has quickly captured the bursting anger and grief of a nation; activists and progressive lawmakers like the representative Ayanna Pressley, and even the conservative commentator Bill Kristol have embraced the demand. Shri Thanedar, a Democratic representative from Michigan, said he planned to introduce the “Abolish ICE act”, a bill that would dismantle the federal agency and its current enforcement authority. For the first time, more US adults now support eliminating ICE than those who oppose it, according to a new Economist/YouGov poll.

It wasn’t just the 7 January shooting of Good, a mother of three and US citizen, in Minneapolis, that has sparked outrage over Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. In 2025, 32 people died in ICE custody, making it the agency’s deadliest year in two decades. Worksite raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Portland and Chicago have led to the arrest of thousands of immigrants without due process and triggered massive protests demanding that federal agents leave their communities and be held accountable for alleged human rights abuses.

To longtime immigrant rights activists, the reckoning may feel familiar.

Juan Prieto, the digital communications manager for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, said the movement today to end or rein in ICE was “so much realization” of the legwork and learnings laid down by the first iteration of “abolish ICE”. “A lot of directly impacted advocates taught American citizens how to look out for immigrants,” he said.

In the summer of 2018, “abolish ICE” became a rallying cry as thousands took to the streets to protest against immigrant family separations under Trump’s first term. Top Democrats, such as 2020 presidential hopefuls and senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand, adopted the demand. Just as quickly, though, the momentum spluttered. Party leaders and strategists declared the slogan a divisive, unpopular policy demand that would hurt Democrats’ electoral chances, and it fell from mainstream political discourse even as deportations soared under the Joe Biden presidency. Eight years later, with the country again in the throes of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns, activists at the forefront of “abolish ICE” say the campaign set in motion today’s anti-ICE resistance. The movement’s setbacks can also form a blueprint for building a stronger movement.

“There are lessons about taking to the streets,” said Jacinta González, a leading immigrant rights organizer for more than 15 years. “But this time around, we’re building community and building a vision about what having a world without ICE can look like.”

The rise of ‘abolish ICE’

The push to abolish ICE has its roots in the police and prison abolition movement that Black scholars like Angela Davis had long advocated for. But the phrase “abolish ICE” became a call to arms seemingly overnight when political strategist Sean McElwee typed it in a tweet that went viral.

“The central assumption of ICE in 2018 is that any undocumented immigrant is inherently a threat,” McElwee wrote in an article for the Nation that same year. “In that way, ICE’s tactics are philosophically aligned with racist thinkers like Richard Spencer and the writers at the white-supremacist journal VDare.”

ICE was created in 2003 as a unit of the brand-new Department of Homeland Security, in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The agency is primarily tasked with locating, detaining and forcibly removing undocumented immigrants. Securing the border and enforcing Trump’s family separation policy are functions of Customs and Border Protection, another federal agency established in 2003.

While it seemed to come out of nowhere, the movement to abolish ICE was built on many years of grassroots organizing led by undocumented immigrants. Anti-ICE organizing started practically as soon as the agency formed, but it gained momentum during the record number of deportations under Barack Obama’s administration, said Amy Gottlieb, an immigrant rights lawyer and activist with the group American Friends Service Committee.

Obama’s policy of deporting “felons, not families”, Gottlieb said, also perpetuated the enduring narrative of “good” and “bad” immigrants – the idea that some are more deserving of citizenship than others – that would drive a wedge among immigrant rights groups. “As we moved into that first Trump administration, I think there was a sense of real anger at how many people were deported,” she said.

González, the head of programs at digital rights non-profit MediaJustice and a founding organizer of the No Tech for Ice campaign, said the early Trump years pulled back the curtains on how ICE operated. “The first Trump administration was a moment when they were very unapologetic about the fact that the cruelty was the point,” said González, who was a senior campaign organizer for the Latinx rights group Mijente at the time. “We saw it as our goal to free people from those types of surveillance and detention and deportation.”

Throughout the sweltering summer months, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated and camped outside federal detention centers across the country, shutting down facilities in several cities. One woman, Patricia Okoumou, scaled the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty in protest against Trump’s hardline immigration policies.

The momentum behind the “abolish ICE” campaign grew so strong that a dozen legislators endorsed the cause. In the 2018 midterm elections, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made dismantling ICE a central campaign demand in her upset victory over the representative Joe Crowley. The representative Mark Pocan introduced legislation to eliminate the agency, though it didn’t gain much traction in the House.

“I think our wins against detention centers really started to happen after that point,” said Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network and author of Unbuild Walls: Why Immigrant Justice Needs Abolition. “I think a lot of that was because new people were entering the fight, new people really understanding the role of ICE in their local communities and the sort of entanglements that existed.”

The fall

Shah said the “abolish ICE” campaign faltered after Biden took office because his administration failed to establish itself as a foil to Republicans on immigration matters.

“The movement didn’t know how to pressure the Biden administration because they didn’t signal they cared to do much about immigration,” Shah said. “People were pushing for some sort of relief, but because of the narrative around the border, Biden shied away from the issue and didn’t put forth much of a pro-immigrant stance.”

Though Biden didn’t conduct the same scale of interior enforcement as Trump did, Shah said, the focus quickly shifted away from fighting deportations to addressing the border crisis. Much of the legislation and policy changes that emerged from the “abolish ICE” movement, she said, was focused on reviewing or replacing the agency rather than shuttering it.

For some who have been fighting the agency’s deportation machine since the beginning, even “abolish ICE” doesn’t fully capture the movement’s goals, given that ridding the agency still leaves behind enforcement mechanisms that allow for the mass detention and deportation of immigrants.

“Abolishing ICE needs to be the floor, not the pinnacle,” Shah said. “Going back to a system with fewer agents and more collaboration with local police is not the solution.”

Prieto, at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, said the movement struggled against a lack of courage and “political imagination” from the Democratic party. Rather than capitalizing on the popular, unflinching demand to abolish ICE and the deportation apparatus, Prieto said, Democrats ended up capitulating to Republicans as the country moved right. Kamala Harris, who called for a restructuring of ICE ahead of her 2020 presidential bid, adopted a tough-on-immigration stance in her presidential run four years later. Last January, shortly after Trump’s inauguration, 46 House Democrats voted with Republicans for a bill that required the detention of undocumented immigrants charged with theft-related crimes.

“Democrats consistently struggle with utilizing grassroots momentum to actually create tangible change that better reflects the needs of people on the ground,” said Prieto, who was organizing with the California Immigrant Youth Justice Alliance in 2018.

The rise again

Despite the setbacks, Prieto said the 2018 “abolish ICE” campaign laid the groundwork for much of the grassroots resistance against the agency today, including “know your rights” workshops, the many rapid-response groups supporting families targeted by raids, and the growing efforts to close detention facilities across the country.

“ICE losing credibility in the public’s eye, the recognition of how much power there is in showing up, all that is thanks to the work that happened under the first eruption of the ‘abolish ICE’ movement,” Prieto said.

Mantras and chants have shaped the movements of Trump’s second term. But the slogans that mobilized the masses over the past year, such as the “No Kings” and “Hands Off” protests, were expressions engineered by national organizations, rather than organic phrases that took off on social media. Over the past week, fervent calls to abolish ICE found new life because Good’s death sparked a collective outrage reminiscent of that during the immigrant family separations.

González said explicit calls for abolition have not gained as much traction until now because the stakes – the danger of engaging in activism under this administration – are higher. But that doesn’t mean the work has stopped.

“We just witnessed someone lose her life just being a civilian present,” she said, “and you still have people showing up to do the same thing, coming together to make sure people are fed, are still going to school is astounding.”

To capitalize on the current moment of reckoning, Prieto said, the Democratic party has to engage with the demands of protesters and immigrant rights activists to abolish all systems of policing, detention and enforcement – a campaign that does not end with the dismantling of ICE.

“It’s coming to terms with the reality that we’re living in and really having the political imagination necessary to get us out,” Prieto said. “Our opposition has a vision of an authoritarian white nationalist utopia that they’re working day in and day out to accomplish. I don’t think our leaders have that level of progressive envisioning.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16773dc38d6792f2e5932e67db6559ce7aff4710/456_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a545dd063da37a1fd88446187ab8ff3",N,,2026-01-16 22:59:02.261988

Laura Kelly and Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach have clashed over taking legal action on behalf of the state.

The Kansas Supreme Court justices listened to arguments from both sides Friday.

Kelly sued Kobach over her ability to represent Kansas late last year. The political divisions between the offices has led to disagreements on when the state should sue in court or join existing lawsuits.

Kelly had asked Kobach to sue the Trump administration over the distribution of food benefits and the release of federal funds for public health and safety programs.

But Kobach refused Kelly’s requests and challenged her authority to join multistate lawsuits on the state’s behalf.

Stephen McAllister, representing Kelly, told the justices that the governor is not seeking to completely take over authority to represent the state of Kansas.

“The governor seeks a ruling from this court that her supreme executive authority includes the power to litigate to protect her executive interest,” McAllister said.

But the justices said “interests” were difficult to legally define.

McAllister said the governor can request the attorney general to take up matters on behalf of the state, but Kobach too often declines.

“If he declines, which he often does, then she has the power to hire her own counsel and proceed with litigation,” McAllister said.

Kobach disagreed with this, and argued that the governor is “dead wrong” about her executive authority.

He said he has no problem with the governor suing on behalf of her office, but she can’t sue on behalf of the people of Kansas.

“The opposing counsel said she can sue on behalf of her executive interests. What are executive interests? That's that's the whole waterfront,” Kobach said

Kobach equated the state's legal power to a set of blocks. The governor’s authority, the attorney general and others fit together.

“Ultimately, this is a question of constitutionality, which this court has already previously established,” Kobach said.

This week, ICT, a nonprofit news group that shares stories from Indigenous communities, reported that at least five Native Americans were detained during ICE operations in Minneapolis, Minnesota, despite being U.S. citizens.

Tensions in Minneapolis, and nationwide, have grown in the wake of the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman by ICE agents in the city, and a second non-fatal shooting. Protests took place across the country on Sunday, Jan. 11, against ICE even as President Donald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to send in soldiers to stop protests.

In addition to the the warning by the Grand Traverse Band, the Bay Mills Indian Community, the Sault Ste.

The 15th Amendment, passed in 1870, granted all U.S. citizens the right to vote regardless of race, but it wasn't until the 1924 that American Indians and Alaska Native Americans could enjoy the rights granted by the amendment, the Department of the Interior said.","https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/15/PSTC/88189399007-agent.jpg?crop=2047,1152,x0,y68&width=2047&height=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-16 22:59:31.137921

Judge Kate M. Menendez ordered agents not to retaliate against people “engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity,” and not to use pepper spray or other “crowd dispersal tools” in retaliation for protected speech. The judge also said agents could not stop or detain protesters in vehicles who were not “forcibly obstructing or interfering with” agents.

The ruling, which granted a preliminary injunction, stems from a lawsuit brought by activists who said agents had violated their rights. The suit was filed before an immigration agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.

Ms. Good, 37, had partially blocked a roadway where agents were working and did not follow commands to get out of her S.U.V. As she began to drive, an agent near the front of her car opened fire.

Minnesota residents have clashed with federal agents since late 2025, when the federal government began an immigration enforcement campaign that it named Operation Metro Surge. Judge Menendez’s order applies only to federal agents in Minnesota who are participating in that campaign.

Judge Menendez, who was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., clarified in her order that “the court’s injunction does nothing to prevent defendants from continuing to enforce immigration laws.” The injunction did not include explicit protections for recording of agents or other provisions sought by the plaintiffs.

In Illinois, where immigration agents amassed for several weeks last year, a federal judge issued a sweeping injunction that placed several limits on how agents could use force and interact with protesters. An appellate court later blocked that ruling, calling it too broad and too prescriptive.

Tensions have been especially high in Minnesota since the killing of Ms. Good last week and the shooting of another man, who was injured, by an agent this week. Federal officials have accused Ms. Good of trying to ram the agent who shot her with her car. Minnesota officials have disputed that notion, and a New York Times video analysis suggests that Ms. Good, a U.S. citizen, was steering away from the agent when he opened fire. In the most recent shooting, officials said that the man, whom they described as being in the country illegally, was resisting arrest and had assaulted an agent with a shovel or a broom.

In recent weeks, protesters have been gathering in small groups and in large crowds, yelling at agents to leave Minnesota. In the lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota and law firms on behalf of activists, the plaintiffs claimed that federal agents had violated their constitutional rights by using excessive force. They said agents had intimidated, harassed or arrested protesters who had not interfered with agents.

Lawyers for the Trump administration pushed back against those claims in court and have repeatedly described protesters in Minnesota as violent and unruly. They also argued against the injunction, saying that it “would place this court in the business of micromanaging D.H.S. officers’ conduct throughout Minnesota.” Federal officials have said their surge of immigration agents in Minnesota, a state led by Democrats, is necessary to crack down on illegal immigration and root out fraud in social service programs.

A separate lawsuit filed by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seeks to have a judge find the surge to be unconstitutional and order a stop to the campaign. No ruling has been reached in that case.

On Friday, the Trump administration was said to have opened a criminal investigation into Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and whether they had conspired to impede federal agents. Mr. Walz and Mr. Frey both described the inquiry as a weaponized use of law enforcement power.

“The space finishes are damaged, peeling, and antiquated,” said the memo, which added that less than two percent of the project was for Scott’s personal office.
The remaining $1.9 million project — renovations much of which were related to mold remediation, improvements to security systems and IT infrastructure, according to the memo — was allowed to proceed.
That leads other DHS agencies to have to deal with problems because of Scott, according to the officials.
They’ve done such a bang up job at the border that it’s almost not an issue anymore for the public.”","That has focused attention on the DHS division, which is a linchpin not only of Trump’s mass-deportation agenda but efforts to build the border wall and collect tariff revenue. Scott’s renovation budget has become a concern of the department’s top political leadership, who also said that Scott is not delivering results at the speed that they want, according to the three officials.

“Don’t waste our time with silly things like this when we have other priorities we want to focus on,” said one of the officials. “The last thing that should be in mind is making your office fancier.”

A fall memo that Customs and Border Protection facilities and asset management official Yvonne Medina sent to DHS’ acting chief financial officer explained the remodeling project was long overdue because the commissioner’s suite hadn’t been properly updated for 25 years. A spokesperson for the division defended the proposed renovations as part of “a routine and responsible part of managing government contracts.” Scott didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The fixer upper

Top officials working for Scott, a longtime law enforcement official who came up through the ranks of the U.S. Border Patrol, started drafting a $2.1 million request for the renovation project in September. It included a budget for $299,850 on furniture, $86,733 on “services” related to the furniture and $33,000 on “window treatments, millwork, and equipment” for the 1,100 square-foot commissioner suite, according to the memo. POLITICO obtained a copy of the memo that was approved by DHS acting CFO Holly Mehringer on Nov. 17. Much of the rest of the money was slated for renovations related to mold remediation, improvements to security systems and IT infrastructure, according to the memo.

“The space finishes are damaged, peeling, and antiquated,” said the memo, which added that less than two percent of the project was for Scott’s personal office.

That request was met with befuddlement by Noem’s team, who were surprised that such an ask was made because they felt the proposed amount of money to spend was excessive, according to the three officials granted anonymity because they’re not authorized to speak to the media. They noted that the agency’s offices in the Ronald Reagan Building complex will be turned over to the FBI for its long overdue headquarters, although there’s no timeline yet on when the FBI would start to move in.

“We were like, what? This seems totally insane,” said the second official about the proposed renovation.

In line with federal law requiring a notification for political appointee office renovations over $5,000, Mehringer notified the Senate and House homeland security appropriations subcommittees that the agency intended to “make improvements to the commissioner’s suite” and that the total project cost was $2,064,765, according to a letter obtained by POLITICO. The letter was sent on Dec. 11, according to the third official. Spokespeople for the subcommittees didn’t respond to requests for comment.

“This contract began under the Biden administration and was reviewed and updated, a standard procurement practice,” the division spokesperson said in a statement. “During the standard review it was decided to proceed only with necessary, mission-critical updates. These fixes included addressing fire alarm deficiencies, mold concerns, and installing furniture needed to accommodate staff members now that they have returned to work.”

The letter noted that there had been two recent renovations as well of the commissioner’s offices. It said that DHS had notified the relevant congressional committees in June 2023 for an intention to renovate “general finishes” within the suite for a cost of $966,636 and in February 2024 notified Congress of “additional work required to improve fire protection and life safety” for a total project cost of $1,167,665.

Noem’s team and DHS general counsel’s office rejected the $137,000 portion of upgrades to Scott’s suite at the end of December, according to the three officials. The remaining $1.9 million project — renovations much of which were related to mold remediation, improvements to security systems and IT infrastructure, according to the memo — was allowed to proceed.

“Secretary Noem personally reviews and approves any contract above $100,000 to ensure every penny is spent to advance DHS’s mission of protecting the American people and safeguarding our nation,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Through this thorough review and prudent financial stewardship, she has saved the American people over $13 billion in less than a year.”

Notwithstanding those numbers, Noem has received criticism from Democrats for DHS’ purchase of two Gulfstream private planes for her and other top DHS officials, which the department defended by saying they were needed for safety and to replace a jet more than 20 years old. She also got flack for staying rent-free in a military house reserved for the Coast Guard’s top admiral, which the department also defended by saying she had been doxed and had to live in a secure location.

Earlier renovations to the agency in the Biden administration led to replacing carpets in the office and getting rid of mold in wallpaper and window frames, according to a Biden official granted anonymity to avoid angering the agency’s current leadership. The division also added in new flooring and kitchen appliances including a refrigerator and dishwasher as part of the project, according to the former official. The former official also noted that there’s been a series of renovations of different floors of the division’s space in recent years.

What it’s really about

As the Trump administration faces internal fallout from the deadly Minneapolis shooting, top DHS political leadership, including Noem and top aide Corey Lewandowski, have told people they’re frustrated that Scott is not delivering results at the speed that they want, according to the three officials. His critics say he appears to have trouble focusing on Trump’s priorities and, even though he has a couple dozen hours of meetings a week, is slow to make decisions. That leads other DHS agencies to have to deal with problems because of Scott, according to the officials.

Scott is being blamed for slow progress on construction of a wall along the border with Mexico. Builders have to contend with the Biden administration’s decision to mostly stop the work, forcing the division to restart anew with funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Finalizing contracts for the border wall “should be the focus each and every day, and it’s clearly not,” said the third official. “That’s the president’s priority, that was the president’s campaign promise and so to not prioritize that as top of the billet is pretty unacceptable.”

Scott has also rejected DHS requests on several occasions to appear on cable news defending the administration’s immigration policies, the third official said, angering colleagues in a TV-focused administration.

Scott served as the Border Patrol’s chief at the end of the first Trump administration and beginning of the Biden administration before he was forced out. His nomination, backed by groups which favor restrictions on immigration, cleared the Senate last June despite reports he was part of a private Border Patrol Facebook group where racist and misogynistic memes were shared and members joked about the deaths of migrants. He has said at the time he joined the group to monitor his workforce.

Mike Howell, president of the Oversight Project, a conservative non-profit organization that works on immigration, said Scott “has done a legendary job in securing the border.”

“This is why all the conservative border organizations pushed hard for his nomination and confirmation,” he said in an interview. “His support remains absolutely strong with those who are tracking the issue closely and behind the president’s agenda.”

The renovation plan was one of the reasons Noem moved one of her own into his agency at around the same time that Scott lost one of his top allies that diminished his influence in the administration.

Scott’s chief of staff, James Kernochan, in recent weeks moved to be deputy director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in what was seen as a loss to Scott’s juice in Trump world, according to one of the officials and another person familiar with the matter. The imbroglio over the office renovation was also among the factors that led DHS in late December to install DHS’ acting general counsel Joseph Mazzara as deputy director of Customs and Border Protection, according to two of the officials.

The two officials said DHS leadership hopes Mazzara can help Customs and Border Protection to better assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement to increase the number of deportations and develop the border wall. One of the officials said it was intentional to put the department’s top attorney in a powerful role usually occupied by a career agency official.

Kernochan and Mazzara didn’t respond to requests for comment.

In an interview, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that pushes for less immigration, said Scott has done a “pretty good job” and pointed to how border crossings have virtually stopped under his tenure.

“He’s almost kind of like the Maytag repairman in those commercials,” said Krikorian, who supported Scott’s nomination. “The Maytag repairman was the loneliest guy in town because Maytag was so reliable that he had nothing to do. It’s sort of a similar thing here. They’ve done such a bang up job at the border that it’s almost not an issue anymore for the public.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F62%2Fb4%2Ffa65d99146cd982b868f976b8c15%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2212766393,N,,2026-01-16 22:59:33.949639

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Friday announced the arrest of what it called the ""worst of the worst"" criminal illegal immigrants during Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota, including a man with 24 criminal convictions.

The agency blasted state and local leaders for refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

DHS said the arrests show the results of ICE enforcement operations in sanctuary jurisdictions, contrasting the agency’s actions with what it described as the refusal of Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to honor ICE detainers.

That policy, DHS claims, has resulted in hundreds of criminal illegal aliens being released back into local Minnesota communities.

""As our law enforcement are facing rampant violence against them, they arrested murderers, drug traffickers and an illegal with 24 criminal convictions in Minneapolis,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. ""These are the criminals Governor [Tim] Walz and Mayor [Jacob] Frey are protecting. No American wants these criminals for neighbors.""

DHS said the arrests were made as part of Operation Metro Surge, a targeted enforcement effort focused on removing criminal illegal aliens from Minnesota neighborhoods. The department said the operation prioritizes offenders with serious criminal histories, including violent crimes.

According to DHS, criminals arrested in the state during the operation include Hien Quoc Thai, a Vietnamese national who was previously convicted of murder.

Brian Anjain from the Marshall Islands has 24 criminal convictions, including assault causing bodily injury, domestic abuse, public nudity, theft, interference with official acts, public intoxication and trespassing, DHS said.

DHS said the operation also resulted in the arrests of people convicted of crimes including domestic violence, assault, fraud, identity theft, forgery, restraining order violations, property damage and multiple drunken driving offenses, with several facing prior charges involving kidnapping, robbery with deadly weapons, gun possession and narcotics offenses.

The department claims that since President Donald Trump took office, nearly 470 criminal illegal immigrants have been released back into Minnesota communities due to sanctuary-style policies.

El Paso medical examiner likely to classify death as homicide, Washington Post reports

DHS claims detainee attempted suicide, resisted security staff

ACLU urges closure of criticized detention facility

WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials on Friday provided a new but incomplete account of an immigrant detainee's death in Texas after a report emerged suggesting it may have been homicide.

The Washington Post on Thursday reported, opens new tab the El Paso County medical examiner is likely to classify the death as a homicide, raising more questions about how it unfolded.

The January 3 death was one of four deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody over a 10-day period at the start of the year. Detention deaths reached a 20-year high in 2025 as President Donald Trump's administration ramped up the number of people held for alleged immigration violations.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security initially said in a January 9 press release it was investigating the death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, which occurred after he experienced ""medical distress.""

Lunas was being held in Camp East Montana, a detention site opened by the Trump administration inside Fort Bliss that has been criticized by immigrant rights advocates.

DHS did not provide a cause of death, but the Washington Post reported that the medical examiner's office planned to list the cause of death as a lack of oxygen due to pressure on the neck and chest, citing a recording of a conversation between the medical examiner's office and the detainee's daughter.

The Post also interviewed a detainee held at the Camp East Montana site who said he saw guards choking Lunas when he refused to enter solitary confinement.

In a new statement on Friday, a DHS spokesperson said Lunas, who had lived in the U.S. since 1996 and had multiple criminal convictions, attempted to take his own life while detained at the detention site.

DHS said the security staff ""immediately intervened to save his life"" but that Lunas ""violently resisted"" the security staff.

""During the ensuing struggle, [Lunas] stopped breathing and lost consciousness,"" DHS said. ""Medical staff was immediately called and responded. After repeated attempts to resuscitate him, EMTs declared him deceased on the scene.""

The DHS statement did not mention the Washington Post story. The department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment regarding the report and DHS' decision to issue a new statement on Friday.

The El Paso medical examiner's office said the autopsy was pending and declined to comment further.

In the months that follow detainee deaths, ICE typically publishes detailed individual reports, with the last such report published in September 2025.

In a December letter, the American Civil Liberties Union urged ICE and the Defense Department to close Camp East Montana, citing reports and allegations around use of force and poor living conditions.

It was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor.
Lunas Campos’ adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.
The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate.
Pagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A Cuban immigrant died in a Texas immigration detention facility earlier this month during an altercation with guards, and the local medical examiner has indicated that his death will likely be classified as a homicide.

The federal government has provided a differing account surrounding the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, saying the detainee was attempting suicide and staff tried to save him.

A witness told The Associated Press that Lunas Campos died after he was handcuffed, tackled by guards and placed in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. The immigrant’s family was told by the El Paso County Medical Examiner’s Office on Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy report said the death was a homicide resulting from asphyxia from chest and neck compression, according to a recording of the call reviewed by the AP.

The death and conflicting accounts have intensified scrutiny into the conditions of immigration jails at a time when the government has been rounding up immigrants in large numbers around the country and detaining them at facilities like the one in El Paso where Lunas Campos died.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is legally required to issue public notification of detainee deaths. Last week, it said Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old father of four and registered sex offender, had died at Camp East Montana, but made no mention of him being involved in an altercation with staff immediately before his death.

In response to questions from the AP, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, on Thursday amended its account of Lunas Campos’ death, saying he tried to kill himself.

“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”

In an interview before DHS updated its account, detainee Santos Jesús Flores, 47, from El Salvador, said he witnessed the incident through the window of his cell in the special housing unit, where detainees are held in isolation for disciplinary infractions.

“He didn’t want to enter the cell where they were going to put him,” Flores told the AP on Thursday, speaking in Spanish from a phone in the facility. “The last thing he said was that he couldn’t breathe.”

Among the first sent to Camp Montana East

Camp Montana East is a sprawling tent facility hastily constructed in the desert on the grounds of Fort Bliss, an Army base. The AP reported in August that the $1.2 billion facility, expected to become the largest detention facility in the United States, was being built and operated by a private contractor headquartered in a single-family home in Richmond, Virginia. The company, Acquisition Logistics LLC, had no prior experience running a corrections facility.

It was not immediately clear whether the guards present when Lunas Campos died were government employees or those of the private contractor. Emails seeking comment on Thursday from Acquisition Logistics executives received no response.

Lunas Campos was among the first detainees sent to Camp Montana East, arriving in September after ICE arrested him in Rochester, New York, where he lived for more than two decades. He was legally admitted to the U.S. in 1996, part of a wave of Cuban immigrants seeking to reach Florida by boat.

ICE said he was picked up in July as part of a planned immigration enforcement operation due to criminal convictions that made him eligible for removal.

New York court records show Lunas Campos was convicted in 2003 of sexual contact with an individual under 11, a felony for which he was sentenced to one year in jail and placed on the state’s sex offender registry.

Lunas Campos was also sentenced to five years in prison and three years of supervision in 2009 after being convicted of attempting to sell a controlled substance, according to the New York corrections records. He completed the sentence in January 2017.

Lunas Campos’ adult daughter said the child sexual abuse accusation was false, made as part of a contentious custody battle.

“My father was not a child molester,” said Kary Lunas, 25. “He was a good dad. He was a human being.”

Conflicting accounts

On the day he died, according to ICE, Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm. He was then taken to the segregation block.

“While in segregation, staff observed him in distress and contacted on-site medical personnel for assistance,” the agency said in its Jan. 9 release. “Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services.”

Lunas Campos was pronounced dead after paramedics arrived.

Flores said that account omitted key details — Lunas Campos was already handcuffed when at least five guards pinned him to the floor, and at least one squeezed his arm around the detainee’s neck.

Within about five minutes, Flores said, Lunas Campos was no longer moving.

“After he stopped breathing, they removed the handcuffs,” Flores said.

Flores is not represented by a lawyer and said he has already consented to deportation to his home country. Though he acknowledged he was taking a risk by speaking to the AP, Flores said he wanted to highlight that “in this place, guards abuse people a lot.”

He said multiple detainees in the unit witnessed the altercation, and security cameras there should have captured the events. Flores also said investigators had not interviewed him.

DHS did not respond to questions about whether Lunas Campos was handcuffed when they say he attempted suicide, or exactly how he had tried to kill himself.

“ICE takes seriously the health and safety of all those detained in our custody,” McLaughlin said. “This is still an active investigation, and more details are forthcoming.”

DHS wouldn’t say whether other agencies were investigating. The El Paso medical examiner’s office confirmed Thursday that it conducted an autopsy, but declined further comment.

A final determination of homicide by the medical examiner would typically be critical in determining whether any guards are held criminally or civilly liable. When such deaths are ruled accidental or something other than homicide, they are less likely to trigger criminal investigations, while civil wrongful death lawsuits become harder to prove.

The fact that Lunas Campos died on an Army base could also limit state and local officials’ legal jurisdiction to investigate. An El Paso County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson declined to comment Thursday on whether it was involved in an investigation.

The deaths of inmates and other detainees after officers hold them face down and put pressure on their backs and necks to restrain them have been a problem in law enforcement for decades. A 2024 AP investigation documented hundreds of deaths during police encounters in which people were restrained in a prone position. Many uttered “I can’t breathe” before suffocating, according to scores of body camera and bystander videos. Authorities often attempt to shift the blame for such deaths to preexisting medical conditions or drug use.

Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who has studied prone restraint deaths, said the preliminary autopsy ruling of homicide indicates guards’ actions caused Lunas Campos’ death, but does not mean they intended to kill. He said the medical examiner’s office could come under pressure to stop short of calling it a homicide, but will probably “stick to its guns.”

“This probably passes the ‘but for’ test. ‘But for’ the actions of the officers, he would not have died. For us, that’s generally a homicide,” he said.

‘I just want justice, and his body here’

Jeanette Pagan-Lopez, the mother of Lunas Campos’ two youngest children, said the day after he died the medical examiner’s office called to inform her that his body was at the county morgue. She immediately called ICE to find out what happened.

Pagan-Lopez, who lives in Rochester, said the assistant director of the El Paso ICE field office eventually called her back. She said the official told her the cause of death was still pending and that they were awaiting toxicology report results. He also told her the only way Lunas Campos’ body could be returned to Rochester free of charge was if she consented to his being cremated, she said.

Pagan-Lopez declined and is now seeking help from family and friends to raise the money needed to ship his body home and pay for a funeral.

After failing to get details about the circumstances surrounding his death from ICE, Pagan-Lopez said she got a call from a detainee at Camp Montana East who then put her in touch with Flores, who first told her about the altercation with guards.

Since then, she said she has repeatedly called ICE, but is no longer getting a response. Pagan-Lopez, who is a U.S. citizen, said she also twice called the FBI, where an agent took her information and then hung up.

Pagan-Lopez said she and Lunas Campos were together about 15 years before breaking up eight years ago. She described him as an attentive father who, until his detention, had worked in a minimum-wage job at a furniture store, the only employment she said he could find due to his criminal record.

She said that in the family’s last phone call the week after Christmas, Lunas Campos talked to his kids about his expected deportation back to Cuba. He said he wanted them to visit the island, so that he could stay in their lives.

“He wasn’t a bad guy,” Pagan-Lopez said. “I just want justice, and his body here. That’s all I want.”

On Wednesday, Heber Sanchez Domínguez, a 34-year-old Mexican citizen, died while in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody at the Robert A. Deyton Detention Center in Clayton County, south of Atlanta, DHS said in a statement Friday. The cause of death is currently under investigation.

Sanchaz was in ICE custody for six days and was awaiting a hearing when he was discovered ""hanging by the neck and unresponsive in his sleeping quarters"" at about 2:05 a.m. local time, DHS said. Medical staff immediately attempted lifesaving measures and then transported him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead about one hour later.

ICE said it first encountered Sanchez on Jan. 7 after he was arrested for driving without a license, DHS said. Two days later, on Jan. 9, ICE filed a notice requiring Sanchez to appear before an immigration judge.

DHS said Sanchez entered the U.S. illegally on Dec. 22, 2023, at or near Nogales, Arizona. Border Patrol agents arrested him that same day and issued him a notice to appear. He was later released without bond.

After his Jan. 7 arrest, ICE transferred Sanchez to the Robert A. Deyton Detention Center as he awaited removal proceedings. Medical staff conducted an intake evaluation and reported no signs of distress at the time.

On Thursday, Mexico's consulate in Atlanta said it was ""closely monitoring"" the death of a Mexican citizen Wednesday at the Robert A. Deyton Detention Facility and was maintaining ""permanent communication"" with the ICE field office in Atlanta.

Mexican officials requested ""that the circumstances of the incident be clarified,"" the consulate said, adding that it was ""collaborating on the necessary procedures to ensure that the investigation is conducted promptly and transparently.""

The consulate said it planned to return the remains to Mexico as soon as possible.

ICE has been at the forefront of President Trump's mass deportation campaign.

About 73,000 people facing deportation were being held by ICE as of Thursday, according to internal DHS data obtained by CBS News. This marks the first time in the deportation agency's 23-year history that the number of ICE detainees has surpassed the 70,000 mark.

As outrage grows in response to the ICE crackdown in Minnesota, a Massachusetts state representative released a video this week echoing some of the expletive-laden rhetoric used by leaders there.

State Rep. Erika Uyterhoeven, a Democrat from Somerville, delivered a forceful renunciation of ICE in a video she posted to social media Wednesday.

“We need to get ICE the f— out of Massachusetts,” she said in the video.

Uyterhoeven’s language is reminiscent of how Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to “get the f— out of” his city in the immediate aftermath of the killing of Renee Good.

Federal officers have surged into Minneapolis this month in an operation purportedly targeted at immigration enforcement and fraud. But reports of abuse and other unlawful actions are rampant, with residents regularly documenting alleged instances of racial profiling and unnecessary force on unarmed protesters and other citizens.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration maintains that Good was a “domestic terrorist,” and that the actions of the ICE agent who shot her were justified. Videos from the shooting directly contradict the administration’s claims.

In Massachusetts, reports circulated this week of a large shipment of vehicles being delivered to an ICE facility in Burlington, raising fears about a possible escalation in and around Boston.

It is in this context that Uyterhoeven called on state leaders to take new actions that would reign in ICE.

“The Massachusetts State House needs to be doing everything it can to stop ICE from killing, abducting, detaining, and deporting our neighbors,” she said.

Speaking as protests were ongoing in Boston Common, Uyterhoeven advocated for the passage of legislation that would prevent ICE from being able to deputize local law enforcement officers to act as federal immigration agents.

Immigrant advocates have been pushing for lawmakers to pass the Safe Communities Act since 2017. The bill would limit how officials can question people about their immigration status, require that authorities require consent before a person in custody is questioned by ICE, bar officials from contacting ICE about a person’s impending release from custody, and prohibit the agreements that allow for the deputization of local officers.

Uyterhoeven went on to criticize the “surveillance state” that allows federal authorities to get personal information from residents.

“Right now, anyone can buy your geolocation data, and ICE has been doing just that,” she said.

Finally, Uyterhoeven said that Massachusetts lawmakers need to be unafraid of holding ICE agents accountable if they break the law.

“Federal agents do not have absolute immunity from state prosecution. ICE has not been held accountable, and we need to strengthen our Massachusetts state laws now,” she said.",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_turner030822METROumass248-696a80f827eb6-768x432.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 21:57:56.904282

The announcement came as part of a list of orders released from the justices’ private conference earlier in the day.

Just two days after the court issued its decision in one Fourth Amendment case, Case v. Montana, the justices agreed to take up Chatrie v. United States, another case involving the Fourth Amendment. Chatrie is a challenge to the constitutionality of “geofence warrants” – a warrant that allows law enforcement officials to obtain the identities of cell phone users who were in a particular area at a specific time.

The defendant in the case is Okello Chatrie, who was convicted of robbing a credit union outside Richmond, Virginia, at gunpoint in 2019, stealing $195,000. He was arrested as a result of information obtained from Google using a geofence warrant. When Chatrie challenged the constitutionality of the geofence warrant, a federal district judge agreed with him that the use of the warrant likely violated the Fourth Amendment. But the judge nonetheless allowed prosecutors to use the evidence that they had gathered as a result of the warrant on the ground that detectives had acted in good faith. Chatrie pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld Chatrie’s conviction. By a vote of 2-1, the majority concluded that there had not been a “search” that would trigger the Fourth Amendment because Chatrie had voluntarily provided his information to Google. The full 4th Circuit agreed to rehear the case and, in a one-sentence unsigned opinion, affirmed the three-judge panel’s ruling. Chatrie then came to the Supreme Court, which agreed on Friday to weigh in on the constitutionality of the execution of the geofence warrant.

The justices also agreed to tackle a dispute arising from one of the thousands of lawsuits filed against Monsanto over its Roundup weedkiller. The plaintiff in the case, John Durnell, contends (among other things) that Monsanto failed to warn him that Roundup causes non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. A jury awarded him $1.25 million in damages.

Monsanto argues that federal law trumps Durnell’s failure-to-warn claim brought under state law, and on Friday the justices agreed to decide whether that is true for failure-to-warn claims based on labels when the Environmental Protection Agency has not required the warning.

The court also granted two other cases:

Hikma Pharmaceuticals v. Amarin Pharma, involving a lawsuit against a generic drugmaker for encouraging patent infringement.

Anderson v. Intel Corporation Investment Policy Committee, involving the standards for pleading a claim, based on the underperformance of a fund, that a fiduciary has violated the duty of prudence required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

The justices will release more orders from Friday’s conference on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. EST.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2176485427.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 22:59:53.361150

We’re representing 12 members of Congress in their lawsuit against the Trump administration for obstructing their access to immigration detention centers. Last month, a federal court ruled that the administration cannot block members’ unannounced access to ICE facilities to conduct oversight.

But over the weekend, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem quietly reinstated restrictions on congressional visits to ICE facilities. On Monday, the 12 Congressional members filed a motion asking the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to order the administration to explain how this new policy is not a violation of federal law.

The Trump administration has “made clear that it is willing to defy both Congress and the courts to conceal conditions inside immigration detention facilities, effectively enabling — if not openly endorsing — ongoing abuse and neglect,” our Executive Director Chioma Chukwu said.

We previously filed FOIA requests about troubling themes in ICE recruitment campaigns. Both DHS and ICE have been posting stylized arrest videos and recruitment ads that invoke white nationalist themes. We have also sent FOIA requests for social media strategy documents that could show who the agencies’ target audiences are and why they are using this imagery. We’ve asked for communications, budgets, and strategy documents regarding recruitment tactics.

Trump’s first-term records become FOIA eligible next week

Records from the first Trump administration will become eligible for public access on Jan. 20, five years after the end of Trump’s first term. It’s a huge opportunity to learn more about how Trump operates — but his former defense attorney is overseeing the process.

On Friday, we sent a letter calling on Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to remove himself from any role overseeing access to those records. We also filed FOIA requests on Thursday to determine how the administration plans to comply with transparency laws like the Presidential Records Act, which was enacted in the wake of the Watergate scandal to make sure no single officeholder is the owner of Presidential records.

We raised serious concerns about Blanche’s suitability as President Trump’s designated representative regarding presidential records from his first administration. Trump selected Blanche for that role in 2023, while Blanche was representing Trump in his criminal cases. During his Senate confirmation hearing, Blanche affirmed he has a “continuing duty” to Trump in terms of confidentiality and loyalty.

“Presidential records belong to the American people, period,” Chukwu said. “As records from Trump’s first administration come due, the public is entitled to know what actually happened, who designed the policies that devastated communities across the country, and how those same actors may be shaping the administration today.”

Trump’s “Chief Enforcer” allegedly using personal devices, auto-delete for official business

Ed Martin, the “chief enforcer” of Trump’s political agenda within the Justice Department, has played a key role in the Trump administration’s attacks on the president’s perceived political enemies. Martin is reportedly covering his tracks by conducting official business on personal devices and autodeleting messaging apps.

We expanded our lawsuit for records related to Martin this week. Our amended complaint details DOJ’s ongoing failure to respond to our Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests seeking records involving Martin, despite credible allegations that he has been trying to hide records of his activities.

We are asking that Martin’s communications be preserved and made public so that he can be held accountable.

“The public has a right to know how Ed Martin is wielding power at the DOJ to advance Trump’s political retribution campaign,” said Chukwu.

The strain has erupted in violence.

Last week, Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, was killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot into her vehicle during an encounter in Minneapolis. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the agent was defending himself and other officers, while leaders in the city and the state disagreed.

Immigrant rights advocates in Colorado say ICE’s excessive force is documented locally.

“Just in Colorado, we've seen ICE agents pepper-spray protestors in the face. We've seen ICE drag elderly women on the ground,” said Judith Marquez, a volunteer for the Colorado Rapid Response Network and a campaign manager for the Colorado Immigrants Rights Coalition. “We don't want to wait for another Renee Nicole Good to be murdered.”

ICE arrests have more than quadrupled since Trump took office, while average daily detention has doubled, according to the Migration Policy Institute. In Colorado, arrest rates quadrupled compared with the same period last year.

Regardless of immigration status, people in the U.S. have rights. So what do you do if you encounter an ICE agent in a tense situation?

ICE did not respond to our request for comment at the time of publication, but here’s what immigrant rights activists say.

Know your rights

The coalition encourages people to familiarize themselves with their legal rights during encounters with ICE. Things like seeing a warrant, and invoking your right to a lawyer, as well as the right to remain silent and the right to record interactions — despite what agents might say — are all emphasized during the group’s “Know Your Rights” trainings.

“Magic words to remember, like, ‘I do not consent to a search. I'm going to remain silent. I want to speak to a lawyer. Am I free to leave? Have I done something wrong?’” said Nayda Benitez, the director of organizing for the Colorado Immigrants Rights Coalition.

Protesting from observers during these encounters is well within people’s rights, said Tim Macdonald, the legal director for the ACLU of Colorado.

“People are a hundred percent within their rights to express their views peacefully without obstructing law enforcement. That is a right guaranteed by the First Amendment to our Constitution,” he said. “That includes filming officers and speaking to them and sharing their speech, letting the officers know what they think of what the officers are doing.”

He said observers and protesters need to be cautious about what could be construed as obstructing. He also advised against being in that close of proximity for safety reasons.

“What we've seen, however, is more often than not, people are not doing anything that could remotely be called obstruction. And yet agents may claim they're engaging in obstruction,” he said.

Record at a safe distance

The Colorado Immigrants Rights Coalition advises people to record interactions at a safe distance and to pull out their phones before the encounter so it’s not mistaken for a weapon.

Macdonald with the ACLU said those videos keep the record straight.

“Filming law enforcement … is so important because that documents what actually happened,” Macdonald said. “We saw that in spades with the murder of Renee Good in Minnesota.”

He also added that it may be safer for observers to exit their cars so they can’t be accused of presenting a danger to ICE.

De-escalate

In addition to a hotline for reporting ICE presence, the coalition documents stories of people who’ve been detained. Both Benitez and Marquez said many protesters and detainees have been met with violence.

“All we can do is be calm and de-escalate, but I think that what we already know is that law enforcement, including ICE, can still harm us and use lethal force,” Marquez said. “This should not, and it will not, stop us from exerting our right to peacefully protest and our right to stand up and protect our neighbors.”

If an officer is issuing an order, Macdonald said the ACLU of Colorado recommends people comply for their personal safety. If there are conflicting orders from officers, he said, people should verbally seek clarification on which orders to follow.

Understand the risk

Despite all these precautionary measures, there’s still risk involved, said Whitney Leeds, a former criminal defense attorney who practiced in Colorado and gave guidance to people interacting with ICE during Trump’s first administration.

“There's no advice that anybody could give that's going to be like, ‘Yep, just do this, and you're going to be safe.’ The safest that we can be in light of that is knowing what our rights are, calmly asserting those rights, not giving an inch,” Leeds said.

Leeds said this time around, the administration is targeting people of color more. The ACLU in Minnesota has filed a lawsuit against the federal government for racially profiling Minnesotans.

“There used to be a general understanding of, OK, ICE agents, when they go out, they're going to have a specific person that they're looking for. They might have a mugshot of that person. If they had ever had any interaction with authorities previously, they'll have their name, they might have their date of birth,” Leeds said. “At this point, this strategy is less tied to specific persons of interest and is much more tied to ‘Well, just go and find somebody.’”

Those people, and observers attempting to occupy agents’ time, are facing risks unlike those she’s seen before.

“I think the questions around the use of force that we're seeing with the recent shootings of community members by ICE agents and this overuse and abuse of force, those are, I think, pretty candidly illegal and no amount of knowing your rights is necessarily going to be able to address that larger challenge.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2026/01/ICE-IMMIGRATION-DETAINMENT-MINNESOTA-FILE-AP-202601.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 22:59:22.294101

BOSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) – The top U.S. immigration judge has told her colleagues that they are not bound by a federal court ruling that declared the Trump administration cannot place thousands of people in mandatory detention without an opportunity to ‍be released on bond.

That directive came in an email Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley sent her colleagues on Tuesday that the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts attached to a filing on Friday in Boston federal court in a lawsuit challenging the administration’s policy of denying bond hearings.

The ACLU said the email was evidence that “the government has deliberately and systematically instructed every Immigration Judge in the country not to comply ‌with final declaratory judgments.”

The civil rights group said the statement directs judges ‌to disregard court rulings by U.S. District Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, and U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston in separate class action lawsuits brought on behalf of people who were already living in the United States when they were detained. Both judges held that denying people bond hearings ​was unlawful.

“We have asked for a status conference to update the court on this troubling development — which significantly impacts the rights of our class members — and anticipate seeking additional relief to ‍protect the class,” Dan McFadden, managing attorney at the ​ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement.

At the ACLU’s request, Saris scheduled ​a Tuesday hearing.

The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, did not respond to a request for ‍comment.

Immigration judges are not part of the federal judiciary but are instead employees of the Justice Department, which is part of the Trump administration.

Under federal immigration law, “applicants for admission” to the United States are subject to mandatory detention while their cases proceed in immigration courts.

Bucking a longstanding interpretation of the law, the Trump administration in July said non-citizens already residing in the United ‍States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.

The Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a ‍decision in September that adopted the ‍administration’s interpretation.

But Sykes, whose case is a nationwide class action, in ​a ruling in December said that the administration’s interpretation was contrary to law ​and that, ⁠as a result, the board’s ruling was “no longer controlling.”

Yet Riley in ‌Tuesday’s email told her colleagues that because Sykes did not issue an injunction, the board’s decision “remains binding precedent on agency adjudicators.”

Lawyers with the ACLU said that prior to that email, the immigration court in Massachusetts had begun holding bond hearings again, consistent with Saris’ decision.

Yet the lawyers said they received multiple reports on Thursday that an immigration judge was denying detainee requests for bond hearings.

Some Ohio Republicans had hoped to recruit state Senate President Rob McColley, but gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy instead tapped him as his running mate.","ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan resigned Thursday and launched a House bid for an Ohio district that is a top pickup target for Republicans.

Why it matters: The 2026 midterms could hinge on races like Ohio's 9th, and Sheahan enters a crowded Republican primary as ICE battles blowback over the shooting of Renee Good.

""President Trump deserves a Congress that stands firmly behind his agenda,"" Sheahan wrote in a resignation letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, a copy of which was obtained by Axios.

""For that reason, effective immediately, I respectfully submit this letter of resignation so that I may continue serving my country in a different capacity.""

State of play: Sheahan is running in Ohio's 9th congressional district, held by Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio).

President Trump won Kaptur's current district in the 2024 election, and mid-decade redistricting in Ohio will make it even more favorable to Republicans.

But Kaptur, 79, has proven difficult for Republicans to dislodge, having defeated GOP challengers in 2022 and 2024 despite being seen as highly vulnerable.

Driving the news: Sheahan launched a campaign website with a video touting her ICE tenure and branding herself a ""Trump conservative.""

""In less than one year at ICE, I've stopped more illegal immigration than Marcy Kaptur has in her 43 years in Washington,"" Sheahan says in the video.

The 28-year-old is a district native who attended Ohio State University and worked for the Ohio Republican Party before working as political director in Noem's South Dakota gubernatorial office.

She served for just over a year as Louisiana's secretary of wildlife and fisheries before rejoining Noem as the deputy director of ICE.

The other side: ""While Republicans from near and far will fight through a messy primary in this district they gerrymandered again just this fall, Congresswoman Kaptur is focused on delivering real results for her constituents,"" Kaptur's campaign said in a statement.

""Voters are tired of the self-dealing corruption and culture of lawlessness they've seen over the last year. They want a leader focused on affordability and real results, and Marcy Kaptur consistently works across the aisle to deliver both.""

Zoom in: Sheahan joins a primary field that includes state Rep. Josh Williams and former state Rep. Derek Merrin, who lost to Kaptur in 2024.

ST. PAUL, MN — U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Integrity, Security, and Enforcement, and Ilhan Omar (MN-05) today hosted a shadow hearing titled Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s Deadly Assault on Minnesota. Twenty-seven Members of Congress attended from across the country to conduct oversight.

“Today, I hosted the the sixth hearing in my series Kidnapped and Disappeared, to continue my congressional fact-finding duties at a time of intense trauma and terror for Minnesotans who are being subjected to the lawlessness and violence of ICE and Border Patrol agents,” said Jayapal. “We heard from incredibly powerful witnesses — members of the community who are standing up for their neighbors, and even who have been detained and had their rights violated for no reason. Instead of making us safer, Trump is deliberately escalating tensions in a city where crime rates have been declining. And the tactics are only accelerating. Let me be clear: this pattern of reckless, even lethal, use of force cannot continue, and we will do everything in our power to hold this Administration accountable and stop this lawlessness.”

“I was honored to host this crucial hearing with Rep. Jayapal,” said Omar. “The Twin Cities is under attack from the Trump administration. There is no modern precedent for this level of federal overreach, violence, and lawlessness carried out in the name of immigration enforcement. I’m grateful to my congressional colleagues from all across the country who joined us to raise the alarm and learn what has been happening on the ground.”

“Every Minnesotan has the right to feel safe and welcome. The actions of the Trump administration and Kristi Noem’s DHS are an attack on our state that is making our community more dangerous. ICE and DHS agents have threatened and assaulted workers in their workplaces, families on the way to day care, and students outside their schools. These actions must end,” said Representative Betty McCollum (MN-04). “At our hearing today, we heard from Minnesotans whose lives have been impacted by the Trump administration’s actions. I thank every one of our witnesses for sharing their testimony. I also want to thank my House Democratic colleagues for traveling to Minnesota’s Fourth Congressional District to stand in solidarity against Trump and Kristi Noem’s assault on our state. The appalling conduct at ICE and DHS starts with its leadership. Kristi Noem needs to go, and ICE must cease operations in Minnesota.”

This hearing featured testimony from a slate of local elected leaders, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and Saint Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, followed by a panel of witnesses including Executive Director of the ACLU of Minnesota Deepinder Mayell, Executive Director of Unidos MN Emilia González Avalos, Executive Director of Minnesota Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MN) Jaylani Hussein, Chief of Police of Mendota Heights Police Department Kelly McCarthy, and community members Patty and Mubashir.

“Our work aims to vindicate the rights of Minnesotans who have been victimized by their own government simply for exercising their First Amendment rights, to end the false sense of impunity that fuels the worst of federal agents’ misconduct, and to ensure that Minnesotans can assemble, observe, document and criticize – without fear of retaliation,” said Deepinder Mayell, Executive Director of the ACLU of Minnesota.

“I was made to feel scared and humiliated throughout the arrest process, and at the detention center, I was made to feel intimidated and as though my constitutional rights and biological needs didn’t matter,” said Patty, a community member. “After all that, I was released without charges, which makes it clear to me that this is more of a campaign to spread fear and terror than it is to enforce the law. My neighbors and I are collateral damage to the Trump administration’s political theater — a campaign to paint Black and brown people, and ‘liberals,’ as villains to distract from an unprecedented reign of corruption and criminality at the federal level, while at the same time making it clear to all of us — even U.S. citizens — that this administration does not and will not honor the basic constitutional rights to which we are all entitled.”

“At no time did any officer ask me whether I was a citizen or if I had any immigration status,” said Mubashir, a community member. “They did not ask for any identifying information, nor did they ask about my ties to the community, how long I had lived in the Twin Cities, my family in Minnesota, or anything else about my circumstances.”

“We have to acknowledge that the tactics being used by some ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge are reducing the public’s trust in local police, making the jobs of our cops harder, and making us all less safe,” said Chief of Police of Mendota Heights Police Department Kelly McCarthy.

This was the sixth shadow hearing in this series, each of which has focused on a different aspect of immigration oversight. The others have focused on detention abuses, Trump’s assault on Chicago, families that have been torn apart, unlawful third-country deportations, and efforts to undermine due process.

Sartoris and Portland Mayor Mark Dion had scheduled a joint news conference at the Cumberland County Courthouse for 10 a.m., as city officials attempt to prepare for an expected U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation.

Several city councilors were also planning to attend, according to city officials.

Sartoris said the state court administrator’s office in Maine’s Judicial Branch “expressed concern” about providing security for both a press conference and regular court business.

“I think there is also, understandably, genuine concern about holding a fairly public conversation proximate to the Courts about this issue at this time,” Sartoris said.

Barbara Cardone, a spokesperson for the Maine Judicial Branch, said in an email Friday morning that the court administrator did not ask Sartoris to cancel the press conference, but rather asked her not to hold it in the courthouse.

“The actions of ICE can be seen as divisive and political,” Cardone said in the statement. “It is critical that the courts remain neutral on these issues. The State Court Administrator and the Chief Justice did not want anyone to mistake the District Attorney as speaking in a courthouse for the Judicial Branch.”

Cardone added that the state’s court system will “do nothing to assist or to deter ICE investigations, except that we will not allow ICE to disrupt court activities.”

Sartoris said Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce was also scheduled to join the event, which was “intended simply to be a clear statement of the need for everyone — residents and visitors alike — to follow the rule of law and Maine’s laws in the days ahead.”

Dion and other state and local leaders issued statements Wednesday about ICE operations potentially targeting Portland or Lewiston as early as next week, responding to rumors about increased enforcement that have been swirling for days. Dion said the Portland community “rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods.”

“There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents,” he said. “While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. The consequence of law enforcement should not be chaos and violence, which only results in making Portland less safe.”

Gov. Janet Mills also issued a video statement later Wednesday and said her office had not yet confirmed with federal officials whether any immigration enforcement operations are planned for Maine.

“To the federal government, I say this,” Mills said. “If your plan is to come here, to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused: Those tactics are not welcome here.”

Orange County Commissioner Nicole Wilson, who represents District 1, drove by the site Friday.","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. — Federal immigration officials are considering Orange County as the site of a new detention facility for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

ICE Senior Advisor David Venturella confirmed this with Channel 9 Investigative Reporter Ashlyn Webb after more than 30 people, including ICE officials and federal contractors, were seen leaving a site visit at a vacant warehouse off Transport Drive Friday.

Venturella says it’s “exploratory,” and ICE is in very early talks.

Several sources told 9 Investigates ahead of the site tour that ICE may be looking at this specific property.

The warehouse is located at 8660 Transport Drive in the back of an industrial park in Sunbridge and is surrounded by woods.

We found the property’s lease listing online, showing the inside of the more than 400,000 square foot warehouse. It’s marketed as a “state-of-the-art facility” with a prime location within minutes of Orlando’s major highways, right off of State Road 528, and within a 30-minute drive from Orlando International Airport.

It has 98 exterior dock doors and four drive-in bays.

The listing says “the facility’s advanced cross-dock configuration enables efficient unloading and loading of goods from inbound to outbound transportation.”

Records show the property is currently owned by Beachline Logistics Center LLC tied to Atlanta-based developers, TPA Group. We have not heard back from the developers.

“Has the contract been signed yet?,” 9 Investigates asked.

“Oh no,” Venturella replied.

“You guys are just in talks,” 9 Investigates replied.

“We’re not even close,” Venturella replied.

Venturella didn’t say how many detainees this facility could potentially hold or how soon a facility could open.

Orange County Commissioner Nicole Wilson, who represents District 1, drove by the site Friday. She says local leaders against this proposed facility may have their hands tied, but she has questions on the zoning.

“Typically, when things are zoned for this type of use, warehouse type use or loading docks and that type of activity, you’re not thinking about where the water goes, where water comes in, and what we do with the human waste,” Wilson said.

Venturella wouldn’t say whether this site would need to be rezoned or if it needed to get any conditional use permit if used as a detention facility

“Don’t know what those requirements are. But obviously, we have to factor all that in,” Venturella told 9 Investigates.

The property falls within Orlando City’s zoning. When asked about this, the city said in a statement, “The city has not received any information or rezoning requests for the specified address nor any further information.”

It’s a pattern of vehicles being used as weapons by violent agitators to attack our law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
He then drove the van directly at ICE officers, DHS officials said.
Who fired shots: Unnamed federal law enforcement officer Description: According to DHS, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” on Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022.
An officer chased him on foot and tried to arrest him, and Sosa-Celis “began to resist and violently assault” the officer, DHS said.","Federal immigration officers have shot 11 people since September as the Department of Homeland Security has ramped up deportation operations around the country. In the majority of the shootings, officers have fired into cars — a tactic that law enforcement authorities and policing experts have been trying for decades to curtail.

The vehicle shootings raise serious concerns among policing experts about the rapidly expanding deployment of DHS personnel into American communities, where officers are regularly captured on video clashing with immigrants who are in the country illegally as well as citizens who protest the arrests.

The shootings “are not one-offs,” said Jim Bueermann, the former police chief in Redlands, California, who now runs the Future Policing Institute, a research group. “This is clearly developing into a pattern and practice of how they deal with people in the enforcement of immigration laws, and to me that’s the most alarming thing we’re seeing.”

DHS says that in each case, the officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection believed their lives were in danger and that in several of the incidents, officers were injured.

“The pattern is NOT of law enforcement using deadly force. It’s a pattern of vehicles being used as weapons by violent agitators to attack our law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Dangerous criminals — whether they be illegal aliens or U.S. citizens — are assaulting law enforcement and turning their vehicles into weapons to attack law enforcement.”

The 10 shootings, detailed below, show the varied circumstances and places where ICE and CBP officers have opened fire on people while they were conducting President Donald Trump’s campaign to crack down on immigrants in the U.S. The effort has unleashed thousands of officers across the country, raiding homes and workplaces, approaching people in courthouses, immigration offices and stores, and stopping people on the street. A protest movement has grown to resist the operations, leading to confrontations.

The people who were shot include suspected criminals, immigrants who lack permanent legal status and U.S. citizens. Three died. It is not clear how many of the shootings federal authorities have fully investigated; there have been no public reports of any findings, including whether the gunfire was deemed justified or whether officers have been disciplined. In at least four cases, people shot by agents have been charged with crimes; in two of those cases, the charges were later dismissed.

Firing on cars is one common thread. In seven cases, officers said they shot because a car was moving and they believed it posed a threat.

Chris Burbank, a former police chief in Salt Lake City who has helped the Justice Department investigate agencies suspected of civil rights abuses, said it was unsettling to see repeated cases of federal immigration officers’ firing on drivers. Since at least the 1990s, he said, police departments have tried to curb such shootings by adopting new standards guiding how officers deal with motorists. The movement, he said, was largely driven by cases in which people were needlessly injured or killed because officers said they were afraid they were going to get run over.

The new guidelines have been published by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit organization that studies policing nationwide, and adopted by many police departments. They aimed to prevent officers from positioning themselves in front of or behind vehicles and sought to limit when an officer was allowed to open fire, Burbank said.

DHS has been a focus of that effort. In 2013, the Police Executive Research Forum released a report that indicated CBP officers were deliberately putting themselves in the paths of cars, “exposing themselves to additional risk and creating justification for the use of deadly force.” The group recommended teaching officers that shooting at a car is dangerous and should be avoided and to adopt policies restricting it. DHS’ current policy prohibits officers from firing at moving vehicles, unless they have “reasonable belief” that the drivers pose imminent threats of death or serious injury. Officers should consider the hazards of out-of-control cars, the policy says.

Burbank said he wondered whether officers were being trained on that policy.

Based on his experience and observations of ICE conduct in recent months, including several of the shootings, Burbank said he felt that “there is not a lot of training, not a lot of accountability going on, and you have the feeling of ‘do your jobs at all costs.’” He added, “That’s a really difficult situation to put any law enforcement in, because it takes away your ability to de-escalate.”

Homeland Security officials have forcefully defended their officers, saying they are increasingly in danger, facing a steep uptick in attacks and violent protesters. “Officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said. She said officers are also trained to use “the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations and to prioritize the safety of the public and our officers.”

DHS requires every use of force incident and any discharge of an ICE firearm to be reported and reviewed, and all shootings are examined by “an appropriate law enforcement agency,” McLaughlin said. Those investigations are then followed by an internal ICE review.

DHS has not provided updates on any internal investigations into the shootings. The FBI, which is reviewing at least some of the encounters, said it does not talk about its investigations.

DHS shootings since September 2025

Place: Franklin Park, Illinois

Date: Sept. 12, 2025

Who was shot: Silverio Villegas González was killed.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Villegas González, 38, an immigrant from Mexico living in the U.S. illegally, was pulled over by ICE officers during a vehicle stop. The officers parked their Jeep in front of Villegas González’s car, with one officer approaching the vehicle from the driver’s side and the other from the passenger’s side. Neither was wearing body cameras, but some of the initial interaction was caught on business security video: An officer appeared to reach inside the car, just as Villegas González backed up and then pulled forward. DHS said Villegas González hit and dragged one of the officers, who opened fire on the vehicle. Villegas González crashed into a nearby truck; he was taken to the hospital, where he later died. His autopsy indicated he was shot in the neck. ICE said he had a history of reckless driving.

Latest: The status of the federal investigation into the shooting is unclear.

Place: Chicago

Date: Oct. 4, 2025

Who was shot: Marimar Martinez was injured.

Who fired shots: CBP agent Charles Exum

Description: Martinez, 30, a U.S. citizen, was driving in the city’s Southwest Side when, federal officials said, she intentionally struck a vehicle belonging to three Border Patrol agents and worked with another driver to box in the agents’ car. Exum was unable to move or get out of the vehicle and fired about five shots at Martinez, federal officials said. Martinez then drove off, but paramedics found her at a nearby repair shop; she was taken to the hospital, where she was treated for gunshot wounds. She was arrested on charges of impeding law enforcement, but her lawyers said it was the federal agents who rammed her car with their vehicle. Exum bragged about the shooting in text messages to other agents, according to records presented in court. During a hearing in the case, Exum testified that “I did what I had to do to save my life.” Almost two months after the shooting, a judge dismissed the charges against Martinez after federal prosecutors agreed to drop the case. The judge also denied a request to release body camera video.

Latest: Martinez intends to file a lawsuit, according to her attorney, Christopher Parente.

Place: Los Angeles

Date: Oct. 21, 2025

Who was shot: Carlitos Ricardo Parias was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Parias, 44, a Mexican national who is known on TikTok as “Richard LA,” and who federal authorities said was living illegally in the U.S., left his southern Los Angeles home at 8:45 a.m. and was followed by federal officers executing an arrest warrant for him related to a federal immigration proceeding, federal officials said. Parias’ Toyota Camry was boxed in by three government vehicles. Federal officials said that Parias failed to comply with commands to get out of his car and submit to an arrest and that he tried to dislodge his vehicle by driving it back and forth, putting the officers in danger. Body camera video from an ICE officer showed the officer boxing in Parias’ car, then getting out and breaking open the passenger-side window. Holding a gun, the officer shouted commands for Parias to turn off the car. Amid the chaos, the officer opened fire, striking Parias in the arm. One bullet ricocheted and hit a U.S. marshal in the hand, federal officials said. Parias was charged with assault on a federal officer. Two months later, a federal judge dismissed the charge, citing constitutional violations by the government for depriving Parias of access to counsel while he was being detained and failing to meet deadlines.

Latest: Parias remains at a detention center in Adelanto, California. Federal prosecutors filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal of his criminal charge.

Place: Phoenix

Date: Oct. 29, 2025

Who was shot: Jose Garcia-Sorto was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Garcia-Sorto, whom DHS described as a Honduran in the U.S. illegally, was stopped by ICE officers around 4 a.m. along Interstate 17. DHS officials said Garcia-Sorto began to pull away when officers approached his car. An officer who was in the path of the vehicle “defensively discharged his service weapon” twice, officials added. The officer was taken to the hospital for evaluation; the extent of any injuries was unclear. DHS said that Garcia-Sorto was also treated at the hospital for a wound and was stable and that he was later released. It is unknown whether the interaction was captured on video.

Latest: Garcia-Sorto is being held at a detention center in Florence, Arizona. No criminal charges have been announced against him in the shooting.

Place: Ontario, California

Date: Oct. 30, 2025

Who was shot: Carlos Jimenez was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Jimenez, 25, a U.S. citizen, was driving a Lexus SUV near his home in Ontario when, federal officials said, he pulled up to immigration enforcement officers who were stopping another vehicle. Federal officials said that Jimenez did not initially comply with commands to leave the scene and that after he pulled forward, he backed up and accelerated toward the officers and the other vehicle. That’s when one of the officers fired their weapon, striking Jimenez in the shoulder, federal officials said. Jimenez drove from the scene and checked himself into a hospital. He was later taken into custody. It is unclear whether there is video from the incident. Federal prosecutors charged Jimenez with assault of a federal officer and said in a complaint that the officer “feared” he was going to hit them, although it did not specify whether any officers were injured. His lawyers said that he wanted to warn the officers that they were blocking a school bus stop where children would be arriving and that he did try to leave the scene. Jimenez pleaded not guilty and was released on a $10,000 bond.

Latest: A trial is scheduled for April 13.

Place: Starr County, Texas

Date: Dec. 11, 2025

Who was shot: Isaias Sanchez Barboza was killed.

Who fired shots: Unnamed CBP agent

Description: A 31-year-old Mexican national was one of several people wearing camouflage clothing spotted by Border Patrol agents on the riverbank along the U.S.-Mexico border, west of the Rio Grande City Port of Entry, CBP officials said. As the agents approached just after 4 p.m., the group scattered, with some running back toward Mexico. Agents tried to apprehend one of the men, later identified by Texas officials as Barboza, according to DHS. An agent reported he was engaged in an “active struggle” for about two minutes, and ultimately the agent opened fire at least three times. Other Border Patrol agents arrived at the scene, requested emergency medical help and performed CPR, the DHS said. Barboza was pronounced dead at a hospital, CBP officials said. It is unclear whether there is video of the encounter.

Latest: Barboza’s body was returned to Mexico, according to the Texas Rangers, which said their investigation continues.

Place: Glen Burnie, Maryland

Date: Dec. 24, 2025

Who was shot: Tiago Alexandre Sousa-Martins was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Sousa-Martins, a Portuguese national who DHS said overstayed a visa that expired in 2009, was in his van when ICE officers approached him in a Baltimore suburb where they were conducting an operation. DHS officials said Sousa-Martins did not comply with their request to turn off the engine and instead rammed the van into several ICE vehicles as he tried to flee. He then drove the van directly at ICE officers, DHS officials said. The officers opened fire, striking Sousa-Martins, who was hospitalized. It is unclear whether there is video from the incident.

Latest: No criminal charges were announced against Sousa-Martins, who remains in ICE custody. The shooting is under investigation by the Anne Arundel County Police Department. Three weeks after the shooting, police contradicted DHS’ initial narrative that Sousa-Martins had a passenger in the van who was injured when the van crashed; they said the other man was already in custody in an ICE vehicle at the time. In a subsequent statement to NBC News, DHS corroborated that detail.

Place: Minneapolis

Date: Jan. 7, 2026

Who was shot: Renee Good was killed.

Who fired shots: ICE officer Jonathan Ross

Description: Good, 37, a Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen, was behind the wheel of a Honda Pilot SUV on Portland Avenue, parked perpendicular to one-way traffic as federal law enforcement vehicles were trying to get through. Ross got out of his vehicle and circled the SUV while he was recording with his cellphone. Two other officers approached Good from the driver’s side, ordering her to get out of the car, according to video from bystanders, as well as Ross’ cellphone. One officer pulled on the driver’s door handle. Good briefly reversed, then moved forward, turning the SUV’s wheels to the right, away from the officers and in the direction of traffic. At that moment, Ross, who was by then at the driver’s-side corner of the hood, fired three times, striking Good in the chest and head. Good lost control of the SUV, which accelerated down the street and crashed. She was pronounced dead soon after. A DHS official said Ross fired in self-defense and sustained internal bleeding to the torso but did not provide any more details about his injuries.

Latest: The shooting is under investigation by the FBI, which has cut out state and local authorities, although Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said she is collecting evidence on her own. Good’s family hired civil rights attorney Antonio Romanucci, who also represented the loved ones of George Floyd. Romanucci said he is dedicated to “fervently pursuing justice on behalf” of Good.

Place: Portland, Oregon

Date: Jan. 8, 2026

Who was shot: Luis David Nino Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras were injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed CBP agent

Description: Nino Moncada, 33, a Venezuelan national who authorities say had been ordered removed from the country in 2024, was driving a vehicle targeted during an enforcement operation tied to a prostitution ring of the Tren de Aragua gang, federal officials said. Nino Moncada did not comply with commands to get out the car and instead reversed and struck an unoccupied Border Patrol vehicle multiple times, according to federal officials. In response, an agent opened fire, hitting Nino Moncada and a female passenger, Zambrano-Contreras, a Venezuelan national who authorities say entered the U.S. illegally in 2023. The pair fled. Nino Moncada, who was struck in the arm, and Zambrano-Contreras, who was hit in the chest, were hospitalized and later released. The FBI said there was no body camera video of the shooting. Nino Moncada was charged with aggravated assault of a federal officer with a deadly or dangerous weapon and depredation of federal property in excess of $1,000. Zambrano-Contreras was charged with entering the U.S. illegally.

Latest: Nino Moncada, who is being held in a Multnomah County jail, has pleaded not guilty. Zambrano-Contreras remains at a detention center in Tacoma, Washington. The Oregon attorney general said he is opening an investigation into the shooting while the FBI’s investigation is ongoing.

Place: Minneapolis

Date: Jan. 14, 2026

Who was shot: Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed federal law enforcement officer

Description: According to DHS, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” on Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022. He fled in his car, crashed into a parked car and ran away, DHS said. An officer chased him on foot and tried to arrest him, and Sosa-Celis “began to resist and violently assault” the officer, DHS said. During the struggle, two people came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, DHS said. Sosa-Celis broke loose and began hitting the officer with either the shovel or a broomstick, DHS said. The officer fired, hitting Sosa-Celis in the leg. ICE officers then arrested all three of the alleged attackers. DHS said the man who was shot and the officer were taken to a hospital.

There are thousands of federal immigration agents in Minnesota, and protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown continue. Those protests grew after an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis last week. Another Department of Homeland Security officer shot a man in the leg this week during an arrest. And that has all raised questions about the training immigration officers get and the protocols they're supposed to follow. NPR's Ximena Bustillo has been looking into this, and she's with us now to tell us more. Good morning.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: So the administration has made it clear from the beginning it wants to increase deportations. It wants to do that fast. And to do that, it's going to hire a lot more immigration agents, so that invites the question of just how these people are being trained. So what are the concerns about that?

BUSTILLO: Immigration advocates have questioned how immigration officers are being trained to not just conduct arrests but also engage with U.S. citizens, and particularly protesters or observers. For example, the woman who was killed in Minneapolis, Renee Macklin Good, was a U.S. citizen. I will note the officer involved in that incident had been with the agency for several years and not a part of this larger hiring surge. But, you know, I've been looking over the ICE and Customs and Border Protection handbooks, which both provide various procedures for how and when to use force, such as discharging a firearm. But it can also depend on the situation.

MARTIN: So say more about what situations these officers are now facing in their jobs.

BUSTILLO: Officers from both agencies were already interacting with the public in various places. For example, the Department of Homeland Security often provides security at major sporting events and national events. And that's different from an immigration arrest at the border, which is different from an immigration arrest in a parking lot in the interior of the country. But for - over the past year, there has been an increase in what immigration agents call at-large arrests, which means that they're out in the community, like on a street in the interior. And we've seen other agencies, such as Border Patrol, play a bigger role in these operations. Of course, they're facing a lot of protesters and more engagement with citizens as well.

Mark Brown is a use-of-force expert who used to train ICE officers. He's now a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law. And he says ICE officers might be working in new situations under President Trump.

MARK BROWN: When you have incidents, you have to look at training. You have to look at, was this - was there a gap in the training? Is there something? You can't train for everything, but training has to adapt to what's current.

BUSTILLO: But in all these situations and in my reviews of the handbooks, there is a certain amount of discretion on what agents are allowed to do.

MARTIN: And say more about that. What do you mean by discretion?

BUSTILLO: So let's look at the fatal shooting of Renee Macklin Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. The officer, Jonathan Ross, was in front of her vehicle when she was at the wheel. The agency says that he was acting in self-defense when he shot her in her car. The law enforcement experts and officials have pointed out that officers are often told not to shoot into vehicles or step in front of them. ICE's own handbook includes this, as well. It explicitly says firearms shall not be discharged solely to disable moving vehicles. But it also gives DHS officers the right to use deadly force when there's, quote, ""reasonable belief that the subject"" poses an imminent threat.

And that second part is what this administration is really leaning into. The claim that she was a threat is disputed by local leaders and contradicted by video evidence. The shooting is also still under various investigations. And a lot of claims from the administration that it is a felony to interfere? It's not always that simple. Just because the administration thinks something's a felony doesn't mean a judge in court will agree.

MARTIN: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thanks.

BUSTILLO: Thank you.

The Democrats gave general outlines for how they intend to use legislation and the budget process to increase health care access, protect immigrants and improve public safety all within 30 days. House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) predicted the Legislature’s achievements will offer a stark contrast to the “dysfunction” in Washington, D.C.

“We will have to make hard choices as we build the state budget, because, unlike the federal government, we have to have a balanced budget every single day,” he said. “So we’ll have to make sure that we put families first and not balance those budgets on their backs, which I can assure you, we will not.”

NM Governor’s office proposes $11.3B state budget and increased spending

In addition to passing a roughly $11 billion operating budget, the Legislature will consider legislation regarding medical malpractice and other health care reforms, a ban on local government involvement in immigrant detention, public safety and road repairs.

According to the speakers and a news release the House released Friday afternoon, House Democrats are hoping to attract and retain more doctors; hold gun dealers accountable for straw purchases; protect license plate data from being shared with the federal government; and create an independent commission overseeing the Children, Youth and Families Department, among other proposals.

“We may not know all that the future holds, but we’re ready to protect our people, regardless of the immigration status, the color of their skin or the languages they speak,” said Rep. Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque). “Because all New Mexicans deserve to feel safe in their communities.”

Advocacy groups push to expand immigrant services, driver protections during session

Much of the news conference focused on the Democrats’ plans for health care amid a statewide doctor shortage that has prompted sharp criticism from Republicans and advocacy groups.

Martinez and Rep. Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe) described a medical malpractice reform bill that aims to reduce the number of malpractice lawsuits as well as protect doctors from losing their practices if they get sued.

Liz Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee, told Source New Mexico after the news conference that House lawmakers are still working with the governor’s office on the reforms, which she expects to be wrapped into one piece of legislation.

Republicans and Senate Democrats are expected to introduce their own legislation on the topic, as well, including measures that will cap the amount of damages that can be paid or raise the standard at which a jury can find health care workers liable for injuries.

The prosecution of crimes against humanity has been central to these efforts. German courts convicted members of the regime of Bashar al-Assad as well as foreign terrorist fighters, male and female, most of them cumulatively, for membership in a terrorist organization and crimes against humanity.

Focusing on the atrocities members of ISIS committed—for example, against the Yazidis—police, prosecutors, and judges faced many challenges. Questions that had to be answered were:

How to prove the widespread and systematic attack of ISIS against Yazidis?

How to identify perpetrators – especially those who could be tried in Germany?

How to cooperate effectively with a wide variety of stakeholders?

How to prove intention of individual male or female ISIS members who committed acts of murder, torture, rape, and enslavement against Yazidis.

These questions had to be raised at every step of the way – at the beginning of building a criminal case, during the preliminary investigation against individual suspects, as well as at the trial proceedings.

Looking at the contextual elements – the widespread and systematic attack – we established the grounds for suspicion of core international crimes by witness testimony of many Yazidi witnesses in Germany who were able to name and describe higher-ranking ISIS fighters who were involved in the initial attack on the Sinjar region of Iraq in August 2014 and who were involved in the initiation of the slave trade with Yazidi women and girls. However, we faced the problem that it would be a huge challenge to bring cases to court as it was so difficult to build a case against individuals with a link to Germany.

The first trials for ISIS-crimes against Yazidis started in 2019 and 2020 against three female ISIS members. In the course of the investigation into the terrorist crimes of these three returnees, the cooperation with several NGOs, especially YAZDA, brought to light that Yazidi slaves were held captive in their households. So, we cumulatively charged these women with the crime against humanity of murder, enslavement, torture, and aiding and abetting rape.

At the time of the trials, we had established the facts for the contextual elements by collecting many witness statements of Yazidis, police reports, ISIS documents, and NGO and expert witness reports. The question was: how was the evidence going to be introduced into the court proceedings?

According to German procedural law everything of relevance for the assessment of someone’s guilt has to be part of the court hearings. As the witness statements of more than 100 Yazidi witnesses built the foundation of our general findings, we were aware that German courts might think it necessary to have many Yazidi witnesses testify about the atrocities they endured, even if they were not directly affected by the acts of the defendants. This was something we didn’t want to happen as it would have caused a lot of stress for many witnesses and the risk of re-traumatization. Ultimately, proof of ISIS’ destructive agenda toward the Yazidi religion was found through other evidence. For example, the court heard statements from police officers who carried out numerous interviews with Yazidi witnesses about the killings during the initial attack on the Sinjar region as well as the established slave trade and the cruel treatment of women and girls. Furthermore, we presented police reports about documented ISIS attacks on Yazidi villages and cultural heritage. Expert witnesses also testified on the Yazidi religion and culture and on ISIS’ structure, the terrorist attacks and crimes it committed, and the group’s propaganda and aim to establish a global caliphate.

Having established the facts for the contextual element, German courts had to examine the evidence for the individual crimes committed by the defendants. Proving this was the most important part – and the heaviest task – and it rested on the shoulders of Yazidi witnesses who had to give evidence about the incredibly cruel treatment by their enslavers.

There were challenges to questioning Yazidi witnesses in court. First of all, there was the challenging situation for the witnesses: In Germany, it is not sufficient to resort to the protocol of the interviews taken during the preliminary investigation. So, in general, witnesses have to go through the painful process of testifying in court again. They are entitled to legal representation, but still the courtroom clearly is a difficult environment to speak about the most terrible events in their lives: They have to speak in the presence of the defendant, the defense counsels, the judges, the prosecutors, and, in most cases, the public, representatives of NGOs, and journalists.

Another challenge can be the lack of specialization of German courts. During the preliminary investigation a lot of specialists are involved in the process, like police officers from war crimes units, prosecutors, and experts. German courts, on the other hand, do not only deal with core international crime cases. They also try cases of Islamic extremists, right-wing and left-wing terrorism, espionage, and weapons proliferation.

When it came to inter-cultural competence, it proved to be very helpful that some of the court chambers in Germany took the time to become familiar with the specifics of the Yazidi cases. Before the Yazidi witnesses were heard, experts explained the religious and cultural background of the Yazidis. It led to the conclusion that exact details of age and time or perceptions in chronological order are atypical and cannot always be expected from Yazidi witnesses. Instead, classifications of time are typically linked to historical events and sensations. These explanations gave the judges the opportunity to adjust their way of questioning the witnesses.

Interpretation was another issue of the criminal proceedings. It was not always easy to find interpreters who speak the “Shingali-Kurmanji” dialect of the Yazidis of Sinjar, a dialect mixing Kurdish Kurmanji with Arabic.

In the end, Yazidi witnesses proved to be survivors in the courtroom as well. One of the witnesses testified in five different cases before Higher Regional Courts, contributing to five convictions. With great patience and resilience, they managed and tolerated endless interrogations by all parties. In every case, judges concluded that the Yazidi witness statements were reliable, credible, and authentic and courts based their convictions on their testimony.

More than 20 years of investigations have demonstrated that crimes against humanity can be effectively prosecuted under the provisions of Section 7 of the German Code of Crimes Against International Law. However, every conflict is unique and every investigation inevitably starts with huge problems. Solving these problems requires clear rules, creativity, and sometimes a lot of patience. Above all, international cooperation is indispensable. I cannot think of any aspect of prosecuting crimes against humanity where it has not been of significant importance to cooperate with international partners. International cooperation is a quintessential element at every step of the way toward holding perpetrators accountable for crimes against humanity. An international convention on prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity would be a visible step toward accountability.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-9213117081.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 23:00:02.903682

BOSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The top U.S. immigration judge has told her colleagues that they are not bound by a federal court ruling that declared the Trump administration cannot place thousands ​of people in mandatory detention without an opportunity to be released on bond.

Immigration judges are not part of the federal judiciary but are instead employees of the Justice Department, which is part of the Trump administration.

Under federal immigration law, ""applicants for admission"" to the United States are subject to mandatory detention while their cases proceed in immigration courts.

Bucking a longstanding interpretation of the law, the Trump administration in July said non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those ⁠who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify ​as applicants for admission.

The Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part ​of the Justice Department, issued a decision in September that adopted the administration's interpretation.

But Sykes, whose case is a nationwide class action, in a ruling in December said that the administration's interpretation was ‍contrary to law and that, ⁠as a result, the board's ruling was ""no longer controlling.""

Yet Riley in Tuesday's email told her colleagues that because Sykes did not issue an injunction, the board's decision ""remains binding precedent on agency adjudicators.""

Lawyers with the ACLU said ⁠that prior to that email, the immigration court in Massachusetts had begun holding bond hearings again, consistent with Saris' decision.

Yet the lawyers said ‌they received multiple reports on Thursday that an immigration judge was denying detainee requests for bond ‌hearings.

President Trump has threatened to use the military to stop the protests in Minneapolis by invoking the Insurrection Act. We'll have more on what that would mean in a few minutes, but we're going to start with a report about the situation on the ground.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

On Wednesday, immigration officers shot another man, this time in the leg, which sparked unrest on the city's north side.

MARTIN: NPR's Meg Anderson is in Minneapolis and is with us now to give us the latest. Good morning, Meg.

MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: You know, looking at this from the outside, things seem pretty volatile. But thankfully, you're there. So could you just describe what you're seeing?

ANDERSON: Yeah. There are now as many as 3,000 federal immigration officers on the ground or arriving soon here in the Twin Cities. That's nearly five times the number of Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, the city is sometimes quiet until it is really, really not. And that's because the fierce resistance to this ICE surge continues to be noisy as community members are following immigration officers in their car, honking and whistling. Here's how that sounds.

(SOUNDBITE OF HONKING)

ANDERSON: And I should note the observers filming and making noise. Those peaceful acts of resistance, even though they're chaotic, are protected by the Constitution. But ICE has responded to some confrontations over the last week with a lot of aggression. Over the last five days, NPR reporters, myself included, we've seen ICE officers using tear gas, flash bangs and pepper balls to disperse crowds. But the community here, you know, it's responding in quieter ways, too.

MARTIN: Well, say more about that, if you would. How so?

ANDERSON: Yeah. So if you drive around the Twin Cities, you'll see parents and other community members standing guard outside of schools and day cares with whistles around their necks. Residents are collecting food donations and giving rides to people who are afraid to leave the house. And people are afraid to leave their homes. I spoke to one woman, an asylum-seeker with two young U.S. citizen children. She asked to only be identified by her first initial, A, because she's afraid she'll be deported if she's identified. She has not left her home in several weeks.

A: (Non-English language spoken).

ANDERSON: She said she feels like she can't see a future, a stable tomorrow for herself or her family. And these fears, being afraid to leave the house, they're not unfounded. NPR reporters have witnessed immigration officers stopping and even detaining people of color seemingly at random on the street. I should note that just yesterday, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of racial profiling against Latino and Somali people here.

MARTIN: And President Trump also threatened yesterday to use the Insurrection Act against Minnesota. Would you explain exactly what that would mean?

ANDERSON: Yeah. So first, the president has threatened to use that law many times before and hasn't. Still, in a post on Truth Social, he said he would invoke the act if state officials, quote, don't ""stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the patriots of ICE."" That law is more than 200 years old. It's controversial. Basically, it would give the president sweeping powers to deploy the military here without the state's consent. The last time it was invoked was during the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.

MARTIN: And how are local leaders responding to this?

ANDERSON: So Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he would challenge the use of the law in court. He emphasized in a statement to NPR that Minnesotans are responding peacefully. There's no reason for that law to be invoked. Senator Amy Klobuchar has said the administration is escalating the situation and not the other way around.

MARTIN: That is NPR's Meg Anderson. Meg, thank you.

ANDERSON: You're welcome.

The ruling by Judge David O. Carter of the U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Calif., appears to thwart the federal government’s efforts to comb through the election rolls in the nation’s most populous state to potentially challenge voters’ eligibility.

About two dozen states are defending themselves from similar lawsuits filed by the Trump administration, which has sought to build a national voter roll with the information.

Many of those states are governed by Democrats, who have argued that the release of sensitive information, such as driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers, would be unconstitutional and would have a chilling effect on elections.

President Trump and his allies have continued to spread false claims about voter fraud and states’ allowing noncitizens to cast ballots.

“The taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece-by-piece until there is nothing left,” Judge Carter wrote. “The case before the court is one of these cuts that imperils all Americans. The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the legislative branch, not the executive.”

In the 33-page decision, Judge Carter, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said that releasing voters’ personal information would violate a plethora of federal and state privacy laws. He said the Justice Department was seeking to use civil rights legislation to “amass and retain an unprecedented amount of confidential voter data.”

“The Constitution demands such respect, and the executive may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections it seeks to do so here,” Judge Carter wrote.

It was not immediately clear if the Trump administration planned to appeal the decision.

The White House referred questions on the ruling on Thursday to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a statement on Thursday, Shirley N. Weber, California’s secretary of state and a Democrat who was named as a defendant in the case, praised the lawsuit’s dismissal.

“As California secretary of state, I am entrusted with ensuring that California’s state election laws are enforced — including state laws that protect the privacy of Californians’ data,” Ms. Weber said. “I will continue to uphold my promise to Californians to protect our democracy, and I will continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”

A day earlier, a federal court upheld California’s new congressional maps, rejecting claims by Republicans and the Trump administration that they were unconstitutional.

“Back-to-back days now of Trump and his Administration losing to California,” the press office of Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media on Thursday.

The Democratic National Committee had filed a brief in the case that raised concerns about the release of voter data.

“This should be a five-alarm fire for Americans everywhere — it opens the door to privacy concerns and further political retribution,” Ken Martin, the D.N.C. chairman, said after Thursday’s decision.

Despite carrying all seven battleground states in the 2024 presidential election, which he won by more than two million votes, Mr. Trump has clung to unsupported claims about widespread voter fraud and clashed with political adversaries over voter lists.

In Oregon, another state that is being sued, the Justice Department’s case also appeared to be unraveling.

On Wednesday, a federal judge in that state, voicing skepticism about giving the federal government unfettered access to voter data, signaled that he was leaning toward dismissing that lawsuit, the newspaper The Oregonian reported.

In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and ESA Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virg.) warned the changes would gut environmental review, strip protections from hundreds of vulnerable species, and let politics override science in listing decisions—all while the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service face unprecedented staffing and budget shortfalls thanks to the Trump administration.

""These sweeping changes would fundamentally weaken our nation's most important wildlife conservation law at a time when one million species face extinction globally,"" wrote the lawmakers. ""We urge the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service to withdraw these proposed rulemakings and instead work to implement the ESA as Congress intended: any regulatory changes should further the objectives of the ESA to conserve species and prevent extinction.""

The ESA has prevented more than 99 percent of listed species from going extinct and has helped hundreds move toward recovery. Section 7 consultations typically take just two weeks for informal review and two months for formal review—contrary to conventional wisdom, the ESA does not stop projects from moving forward. According to one peer-reviewed study, the ESA did not halt a single project between 2008 and 2015.

The lawmakers highlighted how the proposed rules would:

Gut Section 7 consultation requirements by letting agencies claim project impacts ""would occur regardless of whether the proposed action goes forward"" — a loophole that could exempt highways, pipelines, and development projects from meaningful scrutiny;

Strip protections from threatened species by rescinding the ""blanket 4(d) rule"" that extends baseline protections to all threatened species, creating dangerous years-long protection gaps that resource-agencies can’t fill. The blanket 4(d) rule provides automatic protections to species such as the piping plover and the West Indian Manatee, species listed as threatened in the future would not receive those same baseline protections; and

Let politics override science by injecting cherry-picked 'economic considerations into listing decisions. Congress explicitly required that listing decisions be based solely on the best available science, not on arbitrary evaluations of certain impacts or political pressures.

""With reduced staff and resources, the Services should prioritize addressing the backlog of species awaiting protection and advancing recovery efforts for those already listed, rather than redirecting attention to rewriting long-standing and effective regulations,"" continued the lawmakers. ""Habitat destruction and climate change are accelerating species extinction to alarming rates, and we should be working to uphold and strengthen the ESA, not weaken it.""

The letter notes that roughly 90 percent of listed species are threatened by habitat loss, making the proposed restrictions on critical habitat designation particularly damaging to recovery efforts.

ACLU says top immigration judge instructed colleagues to ignore court ruling

Federal judges have ruled Trump administration's practice of denying bond hearing is unlawful

Board of Immigration Appeals adopted administration's interpretation of law

BOSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The top U.S. immigration judge has told her colleagues that they are not bound by a federal court ruling that declared the Trump administration cannot place thousands of people in mandatory detention without an opportunity to be released on bond.

That directive came in an email Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley sent her colleagues on Tuesday that the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts attached to a filing on Friday, opens new tab in Boston federal court in a lawsuit challenging the administration's policy of denying bond hearings.

The ACLU said the email was evidence that ""the government has deliberately and systematically instructed every Immigration Judge in the country not to comply with final declaratory judgments.""

The civil rights group said the statement directs judges to disregard court rulings by U.S. District Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, and U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston in separate class action lawsuits brought on behalf of people who were already living in the United States when they were detained. Both judges held that denying people bond hearings was unlawful.

""We have asked for a status conference to update the court on this troubling development — which significantly impacts the rights of our class members — and anticipate seeking additional relief to protect the class,"" Dan McFadden, managing attorney at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement.

At the ACLU's request, Saris scheduled a Tuesday hearing.

The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, did not respond to a request for comment.

The Hope CommUnity Center said in a Friday evening statement it confirmed about 300 people had been booked into the Orange County Jail on immigration holds in the previous 48 hours alone — which would mark a steep increase compared to the roughly 70 people booked on such holds on a normal day.

“We have received multiple verifiable and credible reports that ICE and Border Patrol agents are stopping individuals in our communities, requesting documentation, and detaining people, often without a clear explanation,” said Felipe Sousa-Lazaballet, the executive director of the center and a Democratic candidate for the Florida House.

A spokesperson for the jail told the Sentinel that a total of 831 people had been booked on such holds since Jan. 1. County Commissioner Nicole Wilson said that number was a shocking total, since only about 300 people had been booked in December.

Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said he was advised by his jail chief that a significant number of the recent bookings were people who were rebooked into the jail. Under the county’s agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency can only keep a person booked there for 72 hours before transporting them to a federal facility — though the agency apparently has been taking detainees elsewhere, only to bring them back to the jail.

Rumors had swirled on social media this week that ICE had booked 200 hotel rooms for its officers throughout the region this weekend, as well as that officials were touring an east Orlando warehouse Friday for a potential new detainee processing facility.

WFTV reported that a senior ICE advisor confirmed the agency toured the facility, though no contracts have been signed. WKMG later reported that they joined ICE representatives on their tour.

Frost, D-Orlando, said in a video posted to his Facebook page Thursday that “ICE is in the community and that they have made pretty large hotel reservations in surrounding hotels as well.”

The post included a flyer informing people how they can interact with federal authorities, including to ask to see a warrant before opening the door, that you don’t need to provide your immigration status or place of birth, and to let a trusted family member know how to find important documents.

In recent days, the Central Florida area stretching west from Lakeland to east Orange appeared to be a hotspot for immigration enforcement according to People Over Papers, which documents the presence of ICE and other authorities using witness reports. One alleged sighting of four uniformed officers was reported at Disney Springs Thursday evening.

Wilson said she’s received accounts of authorities stopping people across her district in western Orange County, including a landscaping crew on Plant Street in downtown Winter Garden.

Demings said his staff had been unable to confirm if such a surge was planned for this week, but urged county residents to respond in a peaceful manner.

“Whatever response we have in this community, I would always implore our community to respond in a peaceful way,” he said.

Florida has already aggressively participated with federal authorities in immigration enforcement, requiring counties to sign agreements to cooperate with ICE and deputizing the Florida Highway Patrol and other law enforcement agencies to provide enforcement as well.

Under the so-called Operation Tidal Wave, which Gov. Ron DeSantis touted as “the largest joint immigration enforcement operation in ICE’s history,” state authorities have arrested more than 10,000 undocumented immigrants across the state.

While there is an ICE Field Office in Orlando, a processing facility could further ramp up efforts. The Washington Post reported last month that a document it obtained laid out a plan to detain immigrants in warehouses across the country, with a total capacity of 80,000. That includes a network of facilities that could hold about 1,500 a piece.

The document didn’t name Orlando as a location, though it did mention a possible facility in Jupiter, the northern coastal Palm Beach County town.

The Orlando property reportedly toured by ICE is east of Sunbridge Parkway, zoned for industrial uses and is surrounded by land that Tavistock plans to build its massive Sunbridge community with thousands of homes. Today nearly all of those thousands of acres are wooded with pines, palmettos and brush.

The warehouse park, though, is one of the few parcels not controlled by Tavistock, a spokesperson said. A real estate agent listed as marketing the 440,000 square foot warehouse for lease didn’t return a call for comment.

City officials say nobody has inquired about the property, which may require a zoning change if it truly was pursued as an immigration facility. Such usage may even require a conditional-use permit, which requires the approval of the City Council, though it’s unclear if the federal government can work around city rules.

Soto, D-Kissimmee, said his office hasn’t been informed of such a facility in Central Florida, He added he was monitoring increased ICE activity in the region.

“President Trump promised to only deport violent criminals. He has broken this promise countless times in Central Florida,” he said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t respond to emailed questions.

But Alex Lanfranconi, DeSantis’ communications director, stoked the flames Thursday by responding to an X account reporting about the warehouse’s alleged 1,500-person capacity. “This is ridiculous,” Lanfranconi wrote. “It needs to hold wayyyy more people.”

Lazaballet told the Sentinel that seeking an immigrant processing center in Orlando is plausible, since the city is also home to one of three immigration courts in Florida, with the other two located in Miami.

“Logistically speaking, it would make sense,” said Sousa-Lazaballet, also the executive director of Hope CommUnity Center.

Amid the talk of an ICE surge, local activists have looked for signs of businesses collaborating with ICE or its sister agency U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, with some groups this week targeting a pet resort in Lake Nona.

Pet Paradise Resort & Spa, which is headquartered in Jacksonville and has multiple locations around the country, took to Instagram to defend its partnership with CBP, saying the dogs they house are used at nearby airports like Orlando International. They denied housing animals brought in by ICE.

Further alarms were raised in light of rumors of ICE agents booking rooms at local hotels at a time when its presence appears to have increased.

“It does track that it feels overwhelming,” Sousa-Lazaballet said. “If they got 200 rooms, that’s in addition to the agents they already have here.”

The Sentinel reached out to area hotels this week but did not find any confirmation of increased ICE bookings. ICE did hold a recruitment event at a Tampa-area Hilton on Thursday and Friday, which drew protests.

At a press conference on Thursday at The Gathering Place Church in Orlando, the Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition and senior pastor at the church, said “we do not want to see any replication of what’s happening in Minnesota.”

Alongside other religious leaders and immigrant advocates, he called on residents to protest ICE actions peacefully and for ICE agents to give undocumented immigrants due process and respect.

“We are telling the administration that any discriminatory action on immigration that puts in danger our families, that separates families, that affects the religious liberty of our churches, the Evangelical community will raise its voice in solidarity,” Salguero said. “It’s very important for everyone to know that our commitment is rooted in non-violence.”",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tos-l-ice-nalec1150.jpg?w=1024&h=592,N,,2026-01-16 17:58:55.153959

The topline figure, coming in at $50 billion, represents a 16 percent cut compared to FY25, but that’s before subtracting select emergency funding and rescissions. And unlike last year’s continuing resolution extending funding at prior levels, lawmakers put their own stamp on the new spending bill. A host of reporting requirements and mandated briefings will ensure that key actors on Capitol Hill remain engaged with a range of development and humanitarian policy issues in the months ahead.

That said, there are plenty of lingering questions about the extent to which the vision for future international assistance—as sketched out in the bill—comes to fruition, given both the Department of State’s lean staffing and the administration’s views on impoundment and its penchant for withholding funds. Nevertheless, appropriators are voicing a desire to see continued US leadership in the provision of foreign aid and in various multilateral fora. The deal is yet to pass the Senate, but here’s a rundown of how several major accounts fared and what might come next. (You can find the link to the bill text HERE and the joint explanatory statement HERE.)

Global health gets by

Despite years of bipartisan backing and the administration’s stated commitment, the president’s budget proposed a staggering 60 percent cut to funding for global health programs. In contrast, appropriators signaled support for strong US leadership in global health, providing $9.4 billion for the primary global health account, previously split between the Department of State and USAID. That’s $5.6 billion above the administration’s request. That figure is allocated largely to familiar funding priorities, including HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, and even areas left out of the America First Global Health Strategy, such as nutrition, neglected tropical diseases, and family planning and reproductive health.

The compromise bill reaffirms Congress’s desire to keep the US engaged in major health multilaterals—save the World Health Organization—directing US contributions to the Global Fund, Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance), the World Bank-hosted Pandemic Fund, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

Despite breaking with the administration on funding levels, the measure and accompanying report lean into several components of the America First Global Health Strategy. The bill directs a new strategy to expand market access for US biomedical firms and requires a PEPFAR transition strategy that shifts toward country-led programming without sacrificing results. Appropriators also included a mandate to support research and development for breakthrough technologies targeting HIV/AIDs, malaria, and other infectious diseases, which could be read (in part) as an endorsement of the kind of partnership demonstrated by the State Department’s purchase agreement supporting the rollout of the game-changing HIV prevention drug lenacapavir through the Global Fund.

State Department officials have outlined lofty goals for the US global health portfolio as they negotiate and sign a slew of bilateral memoranda of understanding charting global health cooperation with partner countries in the years ahead. Still, lawmakers have questions about precisely how an America First global health agenda might proceed, instituting new reporting requirements on multilateral health engagement, the bilateral global health agreements, and the Global Health Bureau’s plans to launch an innovation fund.

Humanitarian spending on the horizon?

For years, the United States has been the world’s leading provider of humanitarian aid—with structures and systems that, while deeply fragmented, have been capable of responding to urgent needs across a host of contexts. But the Trump administration’s stop-work order, award terminations, and dismantling of USAID threw an enormous wrench in the gears. Humanitarian relief efforts could surely benefit from constructive reforms, and with so many protracted crises around the world, the US would be wise to revisit its response toolkit. But what we’ve witnessed over the past year is simply much less US humanitarian aid. The State Department has touted its responses in the wake of Hurricane Melissa and Typhoon Tino, and, more recently, struck a deal with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs—suggesting a level of continued commitment to humanitarian support so long as it can shape the parameters. Still, it doesn’t negate the fact that humanitarian spending fell well behind pace in FY25. The most generous interpretation may be that intent ran headlong into limited capacity.

Appropriators acquiesce to the administration’s desire for a central humanitarian account—combining the State Department’s Migration and Refugee Assistance with the International Disaster Assistance pot once managed by USAID—but would provide more than double the requested funds. The administration had hoped to channel more funding through the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance account, which the president can draw down at his discretion. With passage of the FY26 Agriculture spending bill last year, lawmakers also rejected the administration’s plans to defund a separate international food aid account that can be used to respond to humanitarian needs.

As the joint explanatory statement suggests, in requesting detailed administration plans for spending humanitarian funds, this will be a key area to watch.

The death of Development Assistance?

Provisions in the bill text and explanatory statement suggest a durable interest in continued investment in aid-supported work previously managed by USAID, with spending directives for advancing food security and agricultural development ($720 million), women’s economic empowerment ($150 million), and global education programs ($691.5 million).

In its FY26 budget, the White House sought to zero out traditional bilateral economic assistance accounts and replace them with a wildly flexible America First Opportunity Fund. Notably, the administration also rescinded billions of dollars in previously appropriated economic aid. Lawmakers seem eager for a more measured approach, rolling the two core accounts (Development Assistance and the Economic Support Fund) into a new National Security Investment Programs (NSIP) bucket meant to link traditional economic development priorities with strategic objectives. Appropriators would provide significantly more resources than the White House requested, and, of those resources, the bill specifies that at least 15 percent should be allocated to Africa, focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, and with just $575 million of the new account carved out for the administration’s America First Opportunity Fund. Democracy programs survive as a separate line item, but with a steep, roughly 40 percent haircut from FY24 and FY25 enacted levels before rescissions.

Safeguarding US shareholding at the IFIs

US engagement with and support for international financial institutions have remained a bright spot in the broader story of recent US development spending. The Trump administration has continued to make commitments and contributions to a number of international financial institutions (IFIs), and the back-to-basics agenda advocated by Treasury officials enjoys some bipartisan buy-in and has received support from other major shareholders (along with some think tank experts). The new spending bill would deliver the first payment toward the administration’s revised pledge to the replenishment of the World Bank’s International Development Association, IDA21, and the first payment for a level pledge at the last Asian Development Fund replenishment; it likewise includes the necessary authorizations for both contributions. With credit to the House Financial Services Committee, the measure also carries a sought-after, money-saving fix that exempts IDA from certain US Securities and Exchange Commission registration requirements. The concessional lending arms of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank remain vital sources of affordable finance for a number of the world’s poorest countries, where continued US leadership and financial support matter.

In addition, under the bill, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) would receive the first payment of a long-awaited capital increase, with $87.5 million teed up after authorization cleared in the continuing resolution. The bill also greenlights US participation in the IDB Invest capital increase—and while stopping short of an explicit appropriation, it provides $75 million in flexible Treasury funding that could enable the administration to make a first payment. Appropriators deflected on IMF quota reform and provided no resources for the African Development Fund, adding to US arrears at the institution. Still, the measure would keep the taps open for both the Global Environment Facility and the International Fund for Agricultural Development even without formal asks from the administration.

Big hopes and a stable budget for DFC

Both the White House and lawmakers have endorsed a bigger, bolder US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). But will resources match ambition? Appropriators would level fund the agency, with language in the explanatory statement encouraging DFC to operationalize the changes in its recent reauthorization bill. After a sluggish FY25 in which, according to recent data, DFC made just over $3 billion in new commitments, DFC enters the new year with plenty of headroom to expand and the ability to invest almost anywhere in the world (with some guardrails). The president’s budget request sought to capitalize a proposed revolving fund that would enable DFC to make better use of its direct equity authority by providing a workaround to longstanding budget scoring constraints. While appropriators didn’t deliver the $3 billion bump requested by the administration, the joint explanatory statement notes that DFC can make transfers to the new DFC Equity Investment Account, subject to congressional notification procedures.

With reauthorization complete and new funding on the horizon, the big question ahead is whether the agency can deliver on its mandate to pursue strategic deals while still generating meaningful development impact. Appropriators also hope DFC’s transparency practices improve further—reminding the agency of its statutory authority to report its transactions to the central foreign aid dashboard, foreignassistance.gov. The agency has been working with the team at the State Department that manages the site, but has struggled with how to present loans, guarantees, and insurance commitments alongside more traditional grant-based aid.

MCC rides again

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) had a tumultuous last year. It narrowly avoided the fate that befell USAID thanks to a bipartisan cadre of champions, but the agency weathered a slew of program terminations and significant workforce reductions. The new bill would provide $830 million for MCC, roughly 11 percent lower than in recent years, but nowhere near the 75 percent cut envisioned in the president’s budget request.

However, the measure would resume the unfortunate recent trend of subjecting the agency to rescissions of unspent funds. As we’ve highlighted previously, MCC’s multi-year country agreements require the agency to bank substantial sums that it spends down over time. In the wake of recent program terminations, the minibus would claw back more than $661 million—though, again, less than the administration initially sought.

And overall, things may be looking up for the little agency. In the joint explanatory statement, appropriators direct MCC’s CEO (notably, still waiting on a nominee) to notify relevant committees before terminating assistance, specifying a raft of information that must be provided in advance. Meanwhile, key administration officials appear increasingly keen to deploy MCC’s model. With greater budget certainty, a refreshed scorecard, and newly selected partners, the prospects for MCC’s data-driven, good-governance-oriented approach appear promising.

But how do we know any of this spending will achieve its objectives?

If you’ve made it this far, you’re a real one—as the kids say—so we’ll acknowledge that we’ve been struggling more than usual when it comes to talking about two of our favorite topics: evidence and evaluation. On the one hand, amid scarce resources, it seems more important than ever to ensure that US assistance delivers value for money—that is, that programs achieve their intended impact in as cost-effective a manner as possible. On the other hand, we’re acutely aware (as noted above) that in the wake of USAID’s shuttering and other federal workforce reductions, bandwidth is limited. Prior to its dismantling, USAID had taken steps to improve its use and generation of evidence, including establishing an office with precisely that remit. The State Department has historically lagged behind in this area, but in 2023 began endeavoring to make evidence more accessible and actionable—with the goal of informing better decision-making. Despite increased invocation of the importance of outcomes and results, over the last year, we’ve seen no signs (at least shared publicly) that commissioning evaluations of aid-supported programming (to understand what programming actually achieved) or facilitating greater use of rigorous evidence (to design interventions to work well from the start) is a priority for the State Department. It’s encouraging that Capitol Hill still identifies the significance of rigorous evaluation in advancing aid effectiveness (see Section 7011)—and maybe the required strategy will provide an opportunity for the State Department to set new goals that will help it move from more basic but still critical data management (and transparency), to integrating evidence into decision-making and even generating quality evidence through rigorous evaluation.",https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/corruption-and-poverty-blog-gupta.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:58:46.676954

MINNEAPOLIS

On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty troops into Minneapolis, MN, where widespread demonstrations continue against the aggressive tactics of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Gregory Svirnovskiy, Kyle Cheney, and Myah Ward report for POLITICO.

The Editorial Board of the Minnesota Star Tribune said the situation in Minneapolis feels like “a military occupation.” The city is “under siege,” the paper said, with “battalions of armed federal agents … moving through neighborhoods, transit hubs, malls and parking lots and staging near churches, mosques and schools. Strangers with guns have metastasized in spaces where daily life should be routine and safe.” The paper urged public protest and civil disobedience to remain peaceful, but wrote “The occupation of Minnesota by ICE cannot stand.”

Minneapolis police and fire departments released new records Thursday night about the killing of Renee Good including the location of gunshot wounds. The New York Times reports.

Some Minnesota school districts are offering students the option to do remote learning as fear spreads through the state’s immigrant communities. Sarah Mervosh reports for the New York Times.

Several Native Americans are being swept up by ICE in Minneapolis. “Tribal leaders and members who live in the greater Minneapolis area say Indigenous family members, friends and neighbors have been stopped, questioned, harassed and, in some cases, detained solely on the basis of their skin color or their names,” Mariana Alfaro reports for the Washington Post.

The ACLU of Minnesota is filing a class action lawsuit against the U.S. government for constitutional rights violations by federal agents. The violations include racially profiling residents, conducting illegal search and seizures, and making arrests without warrants. Stephen Swanson reports for CBS News.

ICE

The Office of the Medical Examiner in El Paso County believes that the death of a man at a Texas detention camp was homicide, according to a recording shared with the Washington Post. When ICE announced the death of Geraldo Lunas Campos on Jan. 3, it gave no cause of death. But “according to an eyewitness account and an internal ICE document reviewed by The Post,” Lunas Campos died following a struggle with detention staff. The new recording suggests he died from “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression.”

ICE relied on AI to process thousands of new applications but an error caused the agency to wrongly categorize many of the new applicants as having law enforcement experience when they’d actually had none. “A DHS spokesperson called it a ‘technological snag’ that was quickly rectified,” Julia Ainsley reports for NBC News.

The deputy director of ICE announced on Thursday that she’s stepping down to run for office in Ohio. Madison Sheahan, 28, said she would enter the Republican primary race to oppose Democratic Representative Marcy Kaptur. Reid J. Epstein and Madeleine Ngo report for the New York Times.

ICE’s principal legal adviser will replace Sheahan as the No. 2 at ICE. Charles Wall, who began his career with ICE as an assistant chief counsel in Louisiana in 2012, will become the new deputy director, Reuters reports.

Maine officials told residents on Wednesday that they were expecting federal immigration authorities to arrive in the state in the coming days. ICE agents are expected in the cities of Lewiston and Portland, according to the mayors there. Ashleigh Fields report for The Hill.

IRAN

After encouraging Iranians to take to the streets and declaring “help is on its way” on Wednesday, Trump appears to have backed off the idea of striking Iran. On Thursday, he said “very important sources on the other side” had told him the killing inside the country had stopped, surprising some of his own officials. His statement prompted speculation that the president could be attempting misdirection, similar to the lead up to U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June. Kevin Liptak, Zachary Cohen, Alayna Treene, Kristen Holmes report for CNN.

On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Trump to postpone any plans for an American military attack. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt also asked the administration to hold off on any U.S. military operation, saying it could cause wider regional conflict. Edward Wong, Tyler Pager, and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

On Thursday, Iran reopened its airspace after Trump’s comments about the killing having stopped. However, European airlines are still choosing not to fly over the country. Reuters reports.

Iran’s judiciary said it “had not issued a death sentence for Erfan Soltani, 26, a protester whose execution had been widely reported as imminent and had drawn intense international attention,” Abdi Latif Dahir and Sanam Mahoozi report for the New York Times.

The director of Israel’s Mossad spy agency is in the United States to discuss the situation in Iran. David Barnea is expected to “meet in Miami with White House envoy Steve Witkoff, who is managing the direct channel of communication between the U.S. and Iran,” Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

VENEZUELA

María Corina Machado, Venezuela’s opposition leader, met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and gave him her Nobel Peace Prize, which she won last year. After a large-scale U.S. military operation removed Venezuela’s longtime leader Nicolás Maduro from power earlier this month, Trump declined to replace him with Machado. Instead, he elevated other members of the Maduro regime into leadership positions. “It is unclear what Ms. Machado gained out of her meeting with Mr. Trump,” Max Bearak and Henrik Pryser Libell report for the New York Times.

While Machado met with Trump, CIA Director John Ratcliffe was in Caracas meeting with Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president of Venezuela. A U.S. official told the New York Times Ratcliffe’s meeting with Rodríguez was at Trump’s direction and it was meant “to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship.”

On Thursday, U.S. forces in the Caribbean seized a sixth sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration said has ties to Venezuela. The U.S. military said the ship was seized “without incident.” Konstantin Toropin and Michael Biesecker report for the AP.

The new leadership in Venezuela promised last week to release an “important number” of political prisoners, but their families say they are still waiting. The Venezuelan government claims several hundred have been released, but “Foro Penal, a leading rights organization that tracks and advocates for Venezuelan prisoners, says 79 had been released as of Wednesday night. An estimated 800 to 900 political prisoners were believed to have been incarcerated in Venezuela at the time of Maduro’s capture.” Mariana Zuñiga and Carmen Sesin report for NBC News.

The first U.S. sale of Venezuelan oil was to Vitol, “a company whose senior oil trader donated to Trump’s re-election campaign and attended a White House meeting with the president last week.” Malcolm Moore and Jamie Smyth report for the Financial Times.

GREENLAND

European troops arrived in Greenland on Thursday as Trump continued to threaten U.S. annexation of the Danish territory. “Small numbers of military personnel from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway and Sweden were arriving in the Arctic island early Thursday,” Yuliya Talmazan reports for NBC News.

Two new polls show that most Americans oppose Trump’s threats to take over Greenland. “Eighty-six percent of voters nationwide questioned in a Quinnipiac University poll said they would oppose military action to take over Greenland.” And “three-quarters of Americans questioned in a CNN poll conducted at the same time said they opposed a U.S. takeover of Greenland.” Paul Steinhauser reports for FOX News.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers were set to introduce a resolution on Thursday that would repudiate Trump’s threats to seize Greenland. The effort was led by Sens. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Don Bacon (R-NE). Joe Gould reports for POLITICO.

CHINA

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is on a landmark state visit to Beijing, where on Friday it was announced that “Canada will lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles and China will do the same for Canadian canola products.” Carney announced on X that “Canada and China are forging a new strategic partnership.” Canada’s shift in trade policy comes after Trump has repeatedly threatened Canadian sovereignty. “The tariff changes Mr. Carney announced were modest, but they signal an important break with the United States as Canada seeks to urgently diversify its trading partners and reduce its reliance on the United States,” Matina Stevis-Gridneff reports for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY

The U.S. Commerce Department announced on Thursday that Taiwan will invest $250 billion in U.S. chipmaking under a new trade deal. In exchange, the United States will lower its tariff rate on Taiwan, bringing it down to 15 percent. It will also commit to zero “reciprocal” tariffs on certain goods, including generic pharmaceuticals. Kif Leswing reports for CNBC.

The United States is stepping up its pressure on Mexico to allow U.S. forces, either Special Operation troops or C.I.A. officers, to conduct joint operations to dismantle fentanyl labs inside the country. The country’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, opposes the idea of sending U.S. troops across the border. ​​Maria Abi-Habib, Julian E. Barnes, Eric Schmitt, and Tyler Pager report for the New York Times.

U.S. PRESS DEVELOPMENTS

The Pentagon announced on Thursday that it is overhauling the historically editorially independent newspaper Stars and Stripes. “The statement appears to challenge the editorial independence of Stars and Stripes, which while a part of the Pentagon’s Defense Media Activity has long retained independence from editorial oversight from the Pentagon under a congressional mandate that it be governed by First Amendment principles.” Corey Dickstein reports for Stars and Stripes.

After the FBI raided a Washington Post reporter’s home on Wednesday, journalists from multiple outlets are taking new precautions to protect their reporting. “Many journalists said they saw the FBI raid as a jarring new step aimed at limiting news organizations’ ability to gather information that the government does not want to be made public.” Sarah Ellison, Patrick Marley and Colby Itkowitz report for the Washington Post.

Staffers at CBS News expressed their concern and skepticism when the newsroom cited two anonymous “U.S. officials” on Wednesday to report that the ICE officer who fatally shot Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis “suffered internal bleeding to the torso” after the incident. Jeremy Barr reports for the Guardian.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Elon Musk’s company X said it had disabled, “in some locations, a controversial Grok tool that allows users to digitally undress photos of real people,” but the tool remains functional on the stand-alone Grok app. Karla Adam, Faiz Siddiqui, and Tatum Hunter report for the Washington Post.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge said on Thursday that Trump Cabinet secretaries had conspired to violate the Constitution. “In remarks laced with outrage and disbelief, U.S. District Judge William Young said Donald Trump and top officials have a ‘fearful approach’ to freedom of speech that would seek to ‘exclude from participation everyone who doesn’t agree with them.’” Young was appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan. Joanna Slater reports for the Washington Post.

At a different court hearing, the Trump administration admitted it had made a mistake when it deported Any Lucia López Belloza, 19, a freshman at Babson College, when she was flying home for Thanksgiving. Still, the government has not moved to drop the case, Adam Sella reports for the New York Times.

A federal appeals panel on Thursday reversed a lower court decision that released Mahmoud Khalil from an immigration jail. “In a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled that federal immigration laws require deportation challenges to be made by filing a petition for review of a final order of removal with a federal appeals court — not a lower-level district court.” The Associated Press reports.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-73086221-1-e1512768873185.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:59:28.397238

Snowballs arcing toward ranks of men armored in tactical gear. Protesters gleefully dumping water to make streets even more hazardous.

If there is a third character in the story of immigration agents versus protesters in Minnesota, it is the January weather.

This weekend, temperatures in Minneapolis are expected to plunge even lower, to around zero degrees, an Arctic blast that could hinder the Trump administration’s continuing immigration crackdown and the angry demonstrations over the death of Renee Good, 37.

Local and state officials in Minnesota are anxiously watching the forecast. In daily meetings this week, they have shared information on planned protests and gatherings, news conferences, arrests and unrest. Without exception, the weather is on the list, and though officials are reluctant to say it publicly, they are quietly hoping for a few days of brutal cold.

That could calm residents in a city whose nerves are collectively frayed, city and state leaders reason, and make it harder for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to make arrests and disrupt life in Minneapolis any further.

But bundled-up residents who have been protesting for days said that a seriously cold stretch would play only to their advantage.

“I want it to get cold,” said Chris Foreman, a military veteran who has joined protesters outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, just outside Minneapolis, for six days in a row. “People know that a lot of these ICE guys are from the South. They’re coming into a different environment and they’re not used to it.”

On Thursday, Mr. Foreman saw a man in his 60s toss a bucket of water onto the road in front of the Whipple building, where ICE vehicles zip in and out all day.

“What’s the prank you do to your friends in the winter in Minnesota? You throw a bucket of water on their stoop,” Mr. Foreman said. “We’re playing off of the joke.”

Minneapolis is unusually icy — literally — at the moment. Walking on sidewalks is treacherous, as an immigration agent in a viral video learned this week. Patches of black ice on residential streets are sending cars skidding.

Some of the ice is created by protesters: At a demonstration this week, protesters slowly drove a car outside the Whipple building with its hatch wide open, revealing several open jugs rigged to stream water into the street. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said the act could “potentially kill” federal agents by causing them to crash their vehicles.

On Friday afternoon, snow began to fall sideways, pelting pedestrians and bicyclists with big, icy, wet flakes.

Protesters who are originally from Minnesota say that they are ready with the proper winter gear. Standing outside at demonstrations, they wear woolen socks, double layers of long sleeves and tights, and sometimes ski goggles for a little extra warmth or insulated bibs from Carhartt that might look more fitting in an ice fishing shanty.

To avoid taking a nasty fall on an icy sidewalk, many Minnesotans have been wearing crampons or microspikes that strap onto the soles of their boots. At Nicollet Hardware in Minneapolis, protesters have been snapping them up from a display in the front of the store.

There is also the experience factor, a lifetime of acclimation.

“Our bodies are just ready for it,” said Jason Chavez, a City Council member who was born and raised in Minneapolis. “People here in Minnesota are strong and resilient and they know how to take on the weather. They are able to be outside for a long time.”

But Mr. Chavez said he was not rooting for a blizzard or a cold snap. If a snow emergency is declared, city rules require residents to move their cars to allow snowplows to get through, an inconvenience that would force people outside — and perhaps into the clutches of federal agents.

“At the beginning of this, I was like, ‘I hope it snows a lot,’” he said of the ICE crackdown. But now, he added, “I’m not sure if the weather hurts us or helps us.”

Outside the Whipple building on Friday, Jalyn Strain, wearing sturdy boots and a plaid scarf wrapped around her face, walked around with a jug of Dunkin’ coffee, offering it to protesters who needed to warm up. Most people politely declined.

“It’s not that cold yet,” she said, as the snow began to fall and the temperature hovered around 25 degrees. “People are used to being outside, going out and skiing. We’d be outside anyway.”

Jeremy Kalin, a former state representative and lawyer from Minneapolis who used to work outside in the cold, said it takes more than just experience to know how to endure Minnesota in January.

“You have to live through these winters to build the kind of resilience it takes to know how to stomach the cold — and how many layers of clothing go where,” he said, adding that if temperatures plunge further, the early mornings could be especially tough for ICE agents unaccustomed to the cold.

“I doubt they know what’s coming at them,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/nat-minnesota-cold-slip-qpbg/nat-minnesota-cold-slip-qpbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:59:00.528320

Why it matters: The unprecedented ICE surge has the hallmarks of an occupation in some neighborhoods, as masked and heavily armed agents drive around in large SUVs, tussle with protesters and observers, and break into people's cars and houses to make arrests.

Driving the news: ""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,"" Trump posted Thursday on Truth Social.

Trump's immigration crackdown is tied in part to allegations of widespread fraud in Minnesota involving Somali residents. According to U.S. Census figures, of the more than 80,000 Somalis living in Minnesota, about 4,200 are not U.S. citizens, per PBS.

A few hours after Trump's post, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) made a ""direct appeal"" to Trump to ""turn the temperature down.""

""Stop this campaign of retribution,"" Walz said in a statement. ""This is not who we are.""

And to Minnesotans, he said: ""I know this is scary. We can — we must — speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That's what he wants.""

The latest: Tensions ratcheted up Wednesday after a confrontation in North Minneapolis, where U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said a federal agent shot a man following an attack with a snow shovel and broom.

DHS' account has not been independently verified.

That followed last week's killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother shot in her vehicle by an ICE officer, bringing global attention to the agency's actions in the city.

Zoom in: Minneapolis' Lake Street corridor — the same area that burned during the 2020 unrest over the police murder of George Floyd, and just a few blocks from where Good was killed — has been an epicenter of ICE activity.

The area's Midtown Global Market is usually a buzzy hub for immigrant-owned businesses and customers, but several vendors have closed shop with their customers afraid to leave home.

Longtime vendor Manny's Tortas is suffering a 40% decline in business, owner Manny González tells Axios. He said it's worse than 2020, and he won't last another month like this.

School districts with big Latino populations are reporting a sharp drop in attendance amid similar fears.

Minneapolis and St. Paul schools are offering remote learning for families who don't feel safe sending their kids outside.

Spanish immersion day care centers have cut their hours and asked parents to keep their kids home if possible.

What we're watching: A massive network of observers is trailing immigration agents around the Twin Cities, standing watch near immigrant businesses and alerting potential ICE targets with whistles and car horns.

These observers have recorded agents repeatedly kneeing a detainee in the face and dragging a woman from her vehicle as she said she was trying to get to a doctor's appointment, among other clips that have gone viral nationally and beyond.

By the numbers: Homeland Security says it has arrested 2,500 people in Minnesota since Nov. 29, including 13 gang members.

A Fox 9 analysis showed that 103 of those arrested are violent criminals. DHS has not said how many have been deported, charged or released.

Between the lines: While raids are happening across the Twin Cities area, life remains mostly normal in many neighborhoods and suburbs.

What's next: An abnormally warm January so far has made both immigration enforcement and protesting more tenable.

“It feels a bit like a pressure cooker over here,” Eau Claire City Council President Emily Berge said Friday in an interview with WPR’s “Wisconsin Today.”

The Trump administration has surged some 2,000 federal agents in the Twin Cities, with plans to add 1,000 more. Many of them are agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and protests have broken out over their aggressive enforcement tactics. Those protests have intensified since an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Macklin Good in her car last week. On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said an ICE agent had shot a man in the leg in an enforcement action.

In Wisconsin border communities including Hudson, many people make daily commutes to the Twin Cities for work, shopping or recreation. A Hudson resident who asked to remain anonymous over safety concerns said she has been involved in organizing to support protesters in the area. She said people all across the metro area have been making sure protesters and organizers have rides, are fed and are safe.

But the psychological effects of the unrest have been widespread. She said some of the students at the elementary school where she teaches are afraid to come to class.

“It is just the saddest thing to see tiny children who are just starting school have this kind of fear and uncertainty,” she said.

That echoes the experience of others in immigrant communities.

“Everybody is terrified,” immigration attorney Marc Christopher told “Wisconsin Today.” “They see what’s been broadcast on TV. They see the indiscriminate arrest of people. … The level of fear and anxiety in our immigrant community is off the charts.”

And Berge, who is also a Democratic candidate for Congress, said people in the Hmong community worry they will be targeted for being members of a minority group, regardless of legal status.

“Even though they’re American citizens,” she said, “they have to bring their documents with them, their passports or ID with them when they leave the house — even to walk their dog or bring their kids to school.”

In an interview with PBS Wisconsin’s “Here and Now,” GOP U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson placed the blame for the unrest squarely on Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other politicians he said were “inciting people to resist and obstruct justice.”

Local officials respond to rumors, concerns about ICE enforcement

With attention focused on Minneapolis, unfounded rumors of ICE agents staging or planning large-scale operations in Wisconsin spread widely on social media. Officials in Baldwin, Wausau and Stevens Point all told WPR that social media chatter was false.

Still, officials in many communities have felt pressure to review policies and plans should federal immigration enforcements scale up.

The Hudson School District this week sent a message to parents reiterating its visitors policy and how district officials work with law enforcement.

Superintendent Nick Ouellette said there is not a separate policy for ICE, nor any branch of law enforcement.

“We’re not taking a political side of the argument,” Ouellette said. “We’re just saying this is how we handle things.”

If a district employee is approached on school property by a federal agent requesting information about a student or the student’s family, district policy and federal law prohibit the employee from sharing any student information without a valid judicial warrant or subpoena.

This includes confirming whether a student is enrolled at the school or within the district.

The Hudson School District serves about 5,000 students. Ouellette said it does not keep records of students who are not U.S. citizens.

In the past year, the Trump administration has aimed to drastically change immigration policy in the United States, including by stripping millions of immigrants of their legal status and attempting to redefine the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.

The moves have often run directly against the judiciary branch.

Federal judges briefly stalled the Trump administration’s plans to deploy the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, for immigration enforcement. They also blocked the invocation of an archaic wartime law to expel immigrants from the country — a move that raised concerns, all the way up to the Supreme Court, about skirting the due process rights of immigrants.

In response, the president for the last year frequently battled with federal judges, such as in June, when the Justice Department sued all judges in federal court in Maryland over a two-day pause in deportations to ensure due process rights for immigrants.

Trump also fixated on certain judges that put his policies on hold, such as the District of Columbia’s Chief Judge James Emanuel Boasberg.

Boasberg blocked the Trump administration from deporting certain immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and ordered the return of deportation flights that, despite his restraining order, still landed at a brutal prison in El Salvador.

Trump’s singling out of Boasberg in late March, and calling for his impeachment, prompted a rare rebuke from conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.

But the Supreme Court has often handed wins to the Trump administration on numerous emergency appeals. The high court allowed for deportations of immigrants to countries they have no ties to, referred to as third-country removals, and allowed the use of race in immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.

The president has found himself at odds with a range of groups in response to his harsh immigration policy.

A group of Quakers sued the Department of Homeland Security after officials removed a so-called sensitive locations policy that limited immigration enforcement in places of worship.

The Trump administration also faced backlash in its attempt to quickly deport Guatemalan children in the middle of the night, where a Trump nominated judge said the Department of Justice’s arguments for the move “crumbled like a house of cards.”

Out of the dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration, here are the five most significant court cases related to the president’s immigration policies:

Alien Enemies Act

Last March, two deportation planes carrying immigrants removed under an 18th-century wartime law were ordered to return to the U.S. by Boasberg, chief judge for the District Court for the District of Columbia.

But the planes still landed in El Salvador, and 137 Venezuelan men were sent to a brutal prison known as CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The wartime law would apply to any Venezuelan national 14 and older who was suspected of being a member of the Tren de Aragua gang.

Boasberg then spent months probing whether Trump officials defied his order to turn the planes around. Last month, he concluded that the deportations were illegal and carried out in defiance of his order.

The 137 Venezuelan men were eventually released from CECOT last summer through a prisoner exchange. Boasberg determined that even though the men are no longer imprisoned, they still need to be afforded their due process rights and he ordered the Trump administration to propose a way to afford those due process rights.

In the latest major development, last month he directed the administration to create a plan on how to do that, such as providing some form of video interview before an immigration judge.

The Trump administration has argued because of the U.S. military operations to extract Venezuela's president from the county, the situation is fluid, and they cannot provide a timeline for complying with Boasberg's order from last month.

The Justice Department’s most recent filing, from Jan. 12, objects to the court's order to facilitate remote due process hearings, and “given the current political instability in Venezuela, there is a serious risk of intentional interference with remote proceedings.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also submitted a Jan. 12 declaration to the court, saying that “introducing the matter of the disposition of the 137 class members into these discussions at this time would risk material damage to U.S. foreign policy interests in Venezuela.”

He added that the U.S. does not know where the 137 Venezuelan men are.

“Given the passage of time, the U.S. government does not know—nor does it have any way of knowing—the whereabouts of class members, including whether anyone has departed Venezuela or whether the regime subsequently took anyone back into custody,” Rubio said.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia

The wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and longtime Maryland man, cast a national spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

Abrego Garcia’s case has highlighted the Trump administration's appetite for mass deportations. The case started last March in the District Court of the District of Maryland, after Trump officials mistakenly removed Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite removal protections placed by an immigration judge in 2019 because it was likely Abrego Garcia would face violence if returned to his home country.

But in March, Abrego Garcia was placed on a plane, along with Venezuelans removed under the Alien Enemies Act, to the brutal El Salvador mega-prison known as CECOT.

Federal Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return, but the Trump administration took the issue all the way to the Supreme Court, arguing that it could not force another government to comply with the U.S.

The Supreme Court sided with Abrego Garcia, but stopped short of ordering his return.

Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. several months later to face a criminal indictment in Tennessee over allegations of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges, and another federal judge has found cause that the Justice Department brought the indictment in a vindictive move against Abrego Garcia.

Since his return, Abrego Garcia has detailed psychological and physical torture he experienced at CECOT. The Trump administration has also tried to remove him to a country to which he has no ties because of the 2019 removal protections.

Trump officials re-detained Abrego Garcia and have tried to remove him to the African nations of Eswatini, Ghana, Uganda and Liberia, despite Costa Rica’s willingness to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and his willingness to go.

For that reason, Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia’s release from an ICE facility in Pennsylvania and barred the Trump administration from re-detaining him.

She is currently overseeing Abrego Garcia’s challenge to his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal.

A Jan. 14 hearing was the most recent development in Abrego Garcia’s case.

There, Xinis briefly conferred with his lawyers and Department of Justice attorneys regarding the timing of a final order of removal for Abrego Garcia was issued — the question was whether it was in 2019 or January 2025.

The timing of the order of removal could determine whether the Trump administration can re-detain Abrego Garcia for removal. Xinis in December ordered Abrego Garcia’s release, because she determined the Trump administration was unlawfully detaining him and said ICE failed repeatedly to show a final order of removal existed.

Xinis said she plans to make a final decision in Abrego Garcia’s case by Feb. 12.

Birthright Citizenship

One of Trump’s first executive orders he signed on Inauguration Day was ending the constitutional right to birthright citizenship.

Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status. There is a small carve-out for the children born of diplomats.

If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship and it would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.

In response to Trump’s executive order, multiple lawsuits were filed and lower courts across the country have granted preliminary injunctions against the order.

One of the challenges to birthright citizenship, brought by Democratic attorneys general, made its way to the Supreme Court, but the Trump administration asked the justices to weigh in on the issue of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts, rather than the merits of birthright citizenship.

The justices decided on an order that limited nationwide injunctions, such as class action suits.

The merits of birthright citizenship are now before the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear oral arguments in February.

That birthright citizenship case is Barbara v. Trump, which stems from a case in New Hampshire. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction to bar the executive order from taking effect against a class of babies born on or after Feb. 20, 2025. Those children would have been denied citizenship under the president's executive order.

Lawmakers’ Access to ICE Facilities

As the Trump administration continues with aggressive immigration enforcement and detention, one of the few tools Democrats have, as the minority party, is oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

More than 60,000 immigrants are detained across various ICE facilities in the country, and Democrats argue they need access to conduct oversight at the facilities. Under a 2019 appropriations law, any lawmaker can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants.

But after several Democrats were denied access to ICE facilities in July, due to a policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that required seven days notice, a dozen House Democrats sued.

Last month, a federal judge granted the lawmakers' request to stay the new policy by Noem. But after Minnesota lawmakers said they were denied an oversight visit to an ICE facility following a deadly shooting by an immigration officer in Minneapolis, Democrats were back in court Jan. 14.

Noem required a seven-day notice, nearly identical to the policy that initially prompted the suit from Democrats last year.

The federal judge handling the case, Jia Cobb, is probing whether the Trump administration has violated her court order.

Democrats who sued include: Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.

Expanded Use of Expedited Removal

A pillar of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign is the expanded use of expedited removal. The Trump policy allows the removal of immigrants through the interior of the country without an appearance before an immigration judge.

In March, immigration advocacy groups sued the Trump administration over the policy, arguing it stripped due process rights of immigrants.

In August, the District Court for the District of Columbia issued a stay in the policy, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from using it. The Department of Justice appealed, and in September a panel of appellate judges denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the lower courts’ stay.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/abregogarciaaug25.JPG?h=9f66a723&itok=m-qZbdD7,N,,2026-01-16 16:59:23.372204

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officer Brian Palacios shot Keith Porter Jr. late on Dec. 31 at a Northridge apartment complex, according to a sworn declaration submitted by attorney Michelle Diaz in a custody dispute between Palacios’ girlfriend and her ex-husband, which was made public Thursday. The document alleges that Palacios is the shooter “based on information and belief,” citing records and testimony identifying him as an ICE agent who lives in the complex.

A review of court transcripts, proof of service documents and motions related to the custody battle shows Palacios is an ICE agent and confirms that he lives in a unit at the Village Pointe Apartments. The unit number reflects an apartment that is just a short distance from the location where neighbors say Porter was killed.

An attorney for Palacios claimed the child abuse allegations were unfounded and denied that he made any racist remarks. “He acted in self defense and he was being shot at that night,” said the attorney, Stacie Halpern.

No one answered the door at the apartment listed for Palacios on Friday.

Friends and advocates say Porter — a 43-year-old Compton native and father of two — was firing a gun into the air to celebrate the new year on the night of his death.

Tricia McLaughlin, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary of public affairs, initially said a suspected “active shooter” was killed following an exchange of gunfire with an off-duty ICE agent. In her statement, McLaughlin said the agent “bravely responded to an active shooter situation at his apartment complex.”

McLaughlin did not immediately address questions about the agent’s identity and the allegations against him in response to an inquiry from The Times.

Los Angeles police said no one else was injured in the incident. An LAPD spokesman declined to comment.

Jamal Tooson, an attorney for Porter’s family, said in a statement: “Should this individual be confirmed as the person responsible for Keith’s death, based on his deeply disturbing past allegations it is unimaginable that any human being with a conscience on this earth could regard him as a hero.”

A spokesperson for the L.A. County district attorney’s office declined to confirm or deny that Palacios was the off-duty agent responsible for the shooting and said the incident is under investigation by the Justice System Integrity Division, which investigates killings by law enforcement officers.

A meeting of the Los Angeles Police Commission was packed last week with angry activists and residents, many of whom called for authorities to release the ICE agent’s name. Although the names of LAPD officers involved in fatal use-of-force incidents are normally made public within weeks, there is no such rule for federal agencies.

Court records filed last year in the custody dispute repeatedly describe Palacios as an “ICE officer” and “federal law enforcement officer.” An attorney for Palacios’ girlfriend said they lived together, according to a court transcript. The woman’s home address listed in court records is the same as the address for the Village Pointe complex.

The document filed this week sought to temporarily bar Palacios’ girlfriend from seeing her daughter from her first marriage, based on the potential danger posed by the ICE agent’s alleged involvement in the shooting.

“Palacios is presently prohibited by Court Order from being in the presence of the parties’ minor children because of his abusive conduct,” read the filing from Diaz, who represents the ex-husband of Palacios’ girlfriend. “There is a very valid concern that the stress of having shot and killed another man on 12/31/2025, and the ongoing aftermath, will materially and substantially impair Mother’s mental health, and impact her ability to provide a safe and stable parenting schedule for their youngest child.”

In an email to The Times, Diaz said she did not have direct knowledge that Palacios killed Porter but had reached that conclusion based on the evidence laid out in her court filing, including his living arrangements and his employment as an ICE agent. An attorney for Palacios’ girlfriend also confirmed that they lived together and that he is an ICE agent during a February 2025 court hearing, according to court records.

Emails attached to the filing show Diaz asked her client’s ex-wife if Palacios was the shooter, and the woman referred Diaz to a criminal defense attorney.

The fatal New Year’s Eve incident follows several others in recent weeks in which ICE agents have used deadly force against U.S. citizens.

Last week, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good. President Trump and other federal officials have accused Good of obstructing immigration efforts and said she tried to hit Ross with her car, but cellphone video from the scene shows Good was trying to drive away and that Ross shot at her through the driver’s side window. The killing has drawn widespread condemnation and protests; Trump administration officials have staunchly defended the agent and accused Good of weaponizing her vehicle in “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Unlike the Minnesota incident, which was captured on multiple videos, no recordings have surfaced from the confrontation that led to Porter’s killing.

It remains unclear exactly what happened in Northridge around 10:40 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. Palacios was off duty, so there is no body camera video. None of the building’s security cameras captured the shooting either, according to a message from the property management company.

Two law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, told The Times that Porter was found in possession of a rifle. One of those officials said investigators also found evidence of two bullet impacts behind where the agent would have been standing at the time of the shooting, which would support federal authorities claims that he was fired upon by Porter. The official also said the agent identified himself as law enforcement before opening fire.

Porter’s friends and family have argued he was firing a gun in the air to celebrate the new year. Los Angeles police officials have warned people against the practice for years, and doing so is a felony. Still, Porter’s supporters contend that the agent overreacted and should have waited for the LAPD to respond.

Last year, a Los Angeles County judge barred Palacios from being around his girlfriend’s children from a previous marriage in the wake of allegations that he had whipped his biological sons with a belt, according to a transcript of a 2025 hearing.

Through an attorney, the children also accused Palacios of using homophobic slurs and making racist remarks about Black and Latino people, according to a court transcript. Palacios also referred to the children’s biological father as an “illegal alien,” according to the allegations contained in court records.

Omar Escorcia, the ex-husband of Palacios’ girlfriend, told The Times that Palacios routinely made disparaging remarks about Latinos before and after custody hearings, referring to them as “wetbacks.” Palacios’ attorney denied her client made any such comments.

Escorcia also described an alleged incident in which Palacios showed up to a youth soccer game carrying a gun, which was visible to other parents and left several people upset and concerned for their kids’ safety.

“What law enforcement officer who is mindful of gun safety, shows up to a children’s sporting event with a gun that is not holstered, but stuck in their waistband, and they’re holding a toddler?” asked Escorcia’s attorney, Diaz, according to a transcript of a 2025 court hearing. “There are all kinds of red flags here.”

Palacios also threatened Escorcia’s son with violence, according to claims made by an attorney for the minors in multiple court filings.

“If you were my son, I would punch you in the chest the same way,” he told Escorcia’s son after striking one of his own children, the child’s attorney alleged, according to a transcript of a 2025 custody hearing.

As President and CEO Uzra Zeya said: “Over the past year, the authoritarian playbook the United States spent decades fighting overseas has come home to our shores, but it’s on steroids. From weaponizing government power to target perceived enemies and enrich cronies; to vilifying immigrants, LGBTQI+ people, women and girls, and communities of color; to purging nonpartisan public servants and smearing civil society; this administration is mirroring tactics long used by governments in Egypt, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, China, and India, among others.”

What sets the United States apart in this grim pantheon is not only the speed of democratic regression, but its scope. This underscores the urgency and importance of HRF’s integrated, multi-pronged response:

1) Protection Abandoned in Favor of Mass Detention and Deportation

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. asylum and refugee systems have been gravely undermined. People with pending asylum cases have been denied fair hearings, detained far from family and counsel, and in some cases disappeared to third countries. Since late November 2025, all asylum adjudications by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have been unjustifiably suspended, leaving thousands trapped in indefinite limbo. After U.S. refugee admissions reached their highest level in 30 years in 2024, the Trump administration sharply cut and restricted resettlement solely to white Afrikaners from South Africa last year—injecting racial discrimination into a historically bipartisan humanitarian program. HRF is defending resettled refugees with lawful status, including Hmong and Somali families, now being rounded up and threatened with deportation.

The administration has massively expanded detention through H.R.1, pouring over $170 billion into DHS. ICE’s detention budget has grown 265 percent—larger than the entire federal prison system—with capacity to detain up to 116,000 people daily. ICE now holds about 73,000 people, the largest detained immigrant population in its history. HRF co-led opposition to the most extreme proposals in this bill and continues to fight further funding increases.

HRF is documenting the deadly consequences. In 2025, at least 32 people died in ICE custody, with five more deaths in the first two weeks of 2026. We have exposed disappearances from custody and abusive conditions, including severe harm to children at the reopened Dilley family detention facility.

Through HRF’s ICE Flight Monitor, we documented a record 2,138 deportation flights to 79 countries, many carried out without due process. Our joint project with Refugees International—Banished by Bargain: Third Country Deportation Watch—exposed secretive deals concluded by the Trump administration with third-countries that have sent people to at least 14 countries where they face detention, torture, or refoulement. This includes transfers to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison and to maximum-security facilities in Eswatini and South Sudan, sometimes in defiance of court orders. HRF is challenging these practices in federal court, winning protection for individual clients, and working with global allies to condemn and stop these rights-violating schemes. In individual cases, HRF has blocked unlawful removals, including securing asylum for a Jewish Iranian man fleeing persecution, after the U.S. government imprisoned him for nine months tried to send him to multiple third countries.

We are also tracking widespread due process violations, including racial profiling, denial of hearings, and the wrongful detention of hundreds of U.S. citizens, among whom are Native Americans. Immigration judges have been mass terminated, further undermining the capacity and integrity of their role. At the same time, the administration has stripped over a million people of lawful status by ending TPS and humanitarian parole programs, which HRF is challenging in court, including securing an early restraining order blocking mass revocations and family separations.

2) Assaults on Democracy and the Constitution

HRF is advancing democracy protection in the United States through an integrated strategy that combines advocacy, litigation, and civic activism to counter ongoing authoritarian drift. At the core of this work is curbing militarization of U.S. cities and ICE overreach, while defending the right to dissent. We have done so by mobilizing national and local advocacy, elevating the voices of veterans to reinforce civilian control and military nonpartisanship, and pursuing strategic litigation to uphold constitutional protections, including free speech and the right to protest. At the same time, HRF is pushing for legislative reforms that protect freedom of peaceful assembly and free expression, and prevent abuse of military power. We are also developing tools to track and expose attacks on civic space, and building broad, bipartisan coalitions—across civil rights, faith, student, and veteran communities.

3) Repudiating International Law and Alliances

The Trump administration’s unfounded criticisms and attacks on democratic U.S. allies – including threats to illegally annex Greenland by force and interference in legitimate efforts in other countries to hold leaders to account – have encouraged extremists and produced turmoil in transatlantic relations and other alliances that underpin U.S. national security. Drastic funding cuts to civil society in Ukraine and elsewhere have undermined democracy and human rights in favor of kleptocrats worldwide. By flouting international law and turning against treaties and accountability institutions like the International Criminal Court, the administration is tearing down the pillars that uphold stability, peace, and prosperity.

HRF is confronting this authoritarian turn on multiple fronts—as co-counsel in litigation against third-country removals and political targeting, pressing for accountability before international bodies, and mobilizing a global defense of the Refugee Convention and human rights treaties and institutions, including an open letter signed by more than 300 organizations worldwide. We have successfully sued to keep international war crimes prosecutors on the job in spite of U.S. sanctions, and helped human rights defenders at the front lines of the war on Ukraine find alternative sources of funding following U.S. government cuts.

The Urgency of Now

The abuses documented here reflect an authoritarian project taking shape in real time. Immigrants and refugees are being used as test subjects for broader assaults on the Constitution, dissent is being criminalized, and international law is being dismantled piece by piece. HRF is standing at the front lines by defending people in court, mobilizing peaceful opposition that transcends partisan and regional divides, holding governments to account, and building broader coalitions needed to protect democracy at home and human rights around the world. The stakes could not be higher. HRF will continue to meet this moment with the urgency, independence, and resolve it demands.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/placeholder.png,N,,2026-01-16 16:58:56.637864

Here, we summarize some of the most important recent developments in immigration policy on the federal, legal, state, and local levels.

Federal

Trump Threatens to Invoke Insurrection Act in Minnesota Amid Intensified Immigration Operations

President Trump threatened on January 15 to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to ongoing protests in Minneapolis. The Trump administration announced on January 12 that it was deploying approximately 1,000 additional Customs and Border Protection officers to Minnesota, expanding federal law enforcement presence beyond the 2,000 agents and officers already sent to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has described the operation as its largest immigration enforcement action to date. The deployment follows the January 8 fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Response Team officer. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated the additional officers will ensure safe operations for federal agents and warned that individuals who engage in “violent activities against law enforcement” or obstruct operations will face consequences.

Faith communities across the Twin Cities have mobilized in response to intensified enforcement. Congregations have posted “ICE Free Zone” signs at churches and community centers. Volunteers have been blowing whistles and honking horns as alerts when enforcement operations are underway in neighborhoods. Community members are driving immigrants to work to help them avoid public transportation where enforcement actions have occurred. Several hundred people participated in a recent vigil that wound through south Minneapolis near the site where Good was killed, pausing at locations where federal agents had recently detained people. Tensions between protesters and federal agents have been heightened in recent days, with demonstrations occurring on January 14 and 15 outside federal buildings and in neighborhoods where ICE operations have taken place, leading the federal officers to deploy tear gas and other crowd control devices.

Administration Suspends Immigrant Visa Processing from 75 Countries Under Expanded Public Charge Policy

The State Department announced on January 14 that it will pause immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries beginning January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations “utilize welfare resources from American taxpayers at unacceptable levels”. The suspension affects countries including Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Haiti, Somalia, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Thailand, though the department did not disclose the specific percentage of immigrants from these nations who rely on public assistance. The pause applies only to immigrant visas for permanent residency and does not affect nonimmigrant visas for tourists, students, or business travelers, which represent the majority of visa applications.

The suspension follows the administration’s January 1 implementation of Presidential Proclamation 10998, which imposed visa restrictions on 39 countries, and represents a significant expansion of enforcement under the longstanding public charge inadmissibility provision. On November 19, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled “Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility,” outlining major changes to how immigration officials assess whether certain immigrants are likely to become a “public charge”. The proposed rule seeks to rescind the 2022 public charge regulations, which DHS argued were “overly restrictive” and prevented officers from considering all relevant factors in determining whether an applicant might rely on public benefits. The visa pause will continue indefinitely until the State Department completes a reassessment of visa processing protocols.

DHS Announces Termination of TPS for Somalia as ICE Arrests Dozens of Resettled Refugees in Minnesota

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on January 13 that it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somalia, requiring approximately 2,400 Somali nationals with TPS to leave the United States by March 17, 2026, when the designation expires. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that “country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status” and that allowing Somali nationals to remain is “contrary to our national interests”. The termination comes as DHS continues large-scale immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis, home to a significant Somali population, and as the administration has moved to end TPS for 11 countries total, affecting more than 1 million immigrants who will lose their protections by February.

Concurrently, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested dozens of resettled refugees in Minnesota, many of them Somali, and transferred them to detention facilities in Texas. The arrests followed an administration announcement that it would reexamine thousands of refugee cases through new background checks, focusing on refugees who entered legally but have not yet obtained green cards. Immigration attorneys estimate at least 100 people have been detained, including families with children and individuals who had already applied for permanent residency. The detained refugees passed extensive security screenings by the State Department, DHS, and other agencies before receiving invitations to resettle in the United States under the Refugee Admissions Program. Advocates note that while refugees are required to apply for green cards within a year of arrival, some delayed the process due to cost and bureaucratic hurdles, and historically have not faced arrest or deportation for the delay.

Administration Accelerates Installation of Migrant-Deterring Buoy Barriers in Texas

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began installing a 500-mile barrier of large floating buoys in the Rio Grande on January 7, expanding on a controversial Texas strategy that Governor Greg Abbott first deployed in 2023. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced during a January 8 visit to the Rio Grande Valley that 130 miles of the water barrier were already under contract and installation began that day. The floating barriers are part of President Trump’s “Smart Wall” strategy combining steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras, and detection technology, funded through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July 2025.

The buoys are anchored deep in the soil beneath the river to prevent people from swimming under them and include tamper devices to alert agents if someone breaches the barrier. Noem stated the barriers would deter illegal crossings and “save the lives of illegal aliens by deterring them from daring to attempt to cross through this treacherous water.” The expansion has drawn criticism from environmental activists concerned about access to nature along the Rio Grande, while Mexico previously complained that Texas’s original buoy deployment violated water treaties between the two countries. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed Texas’s existing buoys to remain in place while litigation over the Biden administration’s lawsuit against the state moves forward in a lower court.

Senate Hearing Addresses Screening Processes for Afghan Parolees Following D.C. Shooting

On January 14, the Senate Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration and the Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism held a joint hearing examining the Biden Administration’s Afghan parolee program. Inspectors General from the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), State (DoS), and Defense (DoD) testified and identified systemic weaknesses in evacuee vetting, tracking, and post-entry monitoring, noting that many audit recommendations remain open. The hearing also referenced 50 Afghan nationals already in the United States whose records indicated significant security concerns, such as latent fingerprints linked to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or suspected terrorist associations, though the government has not publicly disclosed the current status of those individuals. In addition, DHS acknowledged difficulties tracking approximately 11,700 evacuees who departed military base safe havens without formal coordination.

Despite these concerns, several committee members emphasized that criminal activity among the roughly 77,000 Afghan parolees has been very low overall and reiterated that Afghan US allies should not be punished for the actions of a single individual. The recent shooting of two National Guardsmen was discussed but remains under active investigation, limiting public comment; it was noted that the alleged shooter entered through the parole program and was later granted asylum, and displayed possible indicators of declining mental health. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) also raised allegations that more than $16 million in federal resettlement funds were directed to organizations alleged to have ties to terrorist groups and were not used for their intended purposes; those allegations remain subject to further review but were not substantively challenged during the hearing.

Legal

Minnesota and Illinois File Federal Lawsuits as Prosecutors Resign Over Response to Minneapolis Shooting

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, along with the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, filed a federal lawsuit on January 12 against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), asserting that the mass deployment of federal immigration officers violated the First and Tenth Amendments and the Administrative Procedure Act. The lawsuit claims the surge of agents has undermined public safety, strained municipal resources, and exceeded constitutional limits on federal power. Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a separate lawsuit the same day alleging dangerous tactics and unlawful use of force by ICE and Border Patrol agents. A federal judge denied Minnesota’s request for an immediate temporary restraining order during the first hearing in the case.

Separately, at least six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned on January 13 amid pressure from Justice Department leadership to investigate Renee Good’s widow for alleged ties to activist groups. These resignations followed separate resignations by four top officials in the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, including the chief, principal deputy chief, deputy chief, and acting deputy chief, after division leadership announced it would not investigate the shooting. The resignations come amid reports that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is also examining Good’s possible ties to activist groups as part of its own inquiry into the shooting.

State and Local

ICE Detains New York City Council Employee at Routine Immigration Appointment

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez, a data analyst for the New York City Council, on January 12 while he attended a routine immigration appointment in Bethpage, Long Island. City Council Speaker Julie Menin stated that Rubio Bohorquez had legal authorization to remain and work in the United States until October, cleared standard background checks for city employment, and was doing everything required of him by appearing at his scheduled appointment. The New York Legal Assistance Group filed an emergency habeas petition challenging his detention, which prevented his removal from New York State pending court review.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) disputed the city’s characterization, with spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stating that Rubio Bohorquez entered the United States on a B visa in 2017 which required him to depart by July 22, 2017, had no legal right to remain in the country, was not authorized to work, and had a prior arrest for assault. Representative Dan Goldman (D-NY) countered that the employee had Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and subsequently obtained work authorization, calling DHS’s statement “a bald-faced lie”. City officials stated the employee provided documentation showing he was authorized under TPS and extended his work authorization even after President Trump terminated TPS for Venezuelans.

Conclusion Although they all too often get mischaracterized in the debate over “illegal immigration,” temporary protections and statuses related to humanitarian parole, TPS, DACA, refugees, and asylum afford lawful presence and protections to those who possess them.","Introduction

Much overlooked in the ongoing debate over immigration is the Trump administration’s termination of many different types of temporary protections and statuses. With hundreds of thousands of people losing protections and work authorization throughout 2025, addressing and clarifying these populations is important to understanding the risks faced by these once-protected individuals who no longer are able to legally work and may now face deportation.

In a time when mass deportation efforts threaten large numbers of noncitizens with arrest, detention, and removal, it is increasingly common for political actors to refer to those with temporary statuses as undocumented or “illegal.”[1] Given this circumstance, it is important to clarify that these hundreds of thousands of people have been legally admitted to the United States, and/or have been lawfully permitted to reside in the United States on a temporary basis across multiple administrations.

Recent actions by the Trump administration to end various temporary protections have impacted these group’s lawful presence and exposed these individuals to arrest, detention, and removal. Accordingly, this paper seeks to highlight some of these temporary statuses and discuss how immigrants are impacted when their previously lawful presence has been terminated.

What would qualify as “illegal” immigration?

Whether a noncitizen is referred to as “illegal,” “undocumented,” “unauthorized,” “lacking status,” or another term, this category of individuals without legal authorization continues to be a flashpoint in the immigration debate. While there is currently no single definition of “illegal” in this context, the term generally refers to either 1) individuals who entered the U.S. without authorization or 2) individuals who entered lawfully,[2] but no longer have lawful status.

Historically, most of the individuals in the second category have overstayed a visa. More recently, hundreds of thousands of individuals have found themselves in this second category after obtaining temporary presence that was later terminated by the current administration.

Humanitarian Parole

Humanitarian parole is a temporary and discretionary immigration designation, not to be confused with “parole” in the criminal law context, and is provided under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Humanitarian parole refers to the temporary and discretionary admission of a non-U.S. national into the United States for a limited period of stay. Under the INA, “the Secretary of Homeland Security can use their discretion to parole any noncitizen applying for admission into the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” Grants of humanitarian parole are assessed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on a case-by-case basis. Humanitarian parole is granted for a limited period of time, typically not longer than one year, but the period can be anywhere from 24 hours up to two years. Parole is often used for witnesses in court cases and for emergency evacuation situations because it is discretionary and provides the flexibility needed in an urgent situation.

The Biden administration used humanitarian parole expansively, often in novel and controversial ways. In response to conflicts overseas, the administration admitted tens of thousands of Afghans, as well as Ukrainians, the latter under the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) parole program. The Biden administration also extensively used parole to help ease influxes and processing strains along the U.S. southern border, reducing the number of people coming to the southern border in an irregular manner through various programs like the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) parole program, the Keeping Families Together program, and temporarily admitting asylum seekers and others who utilized CBP One, a mobile app developed to enhance border processing and expedite entry.

In 2025, however, under the second Trump administration, many of these programs were either ended, allowed to lapse, or repurposed. For example, the CBP One app has been rebranded and is now used to help facilitate self-deportation. While humanitarian parole remains in place for discretionary use by the Trump administration, the tool has been used sparingly.

Although the Biden administration’s expansive use of humanitarian parole has at times been controversial, the result of its widespread use and subsequent termination is that hundreds of thousands of people who were temporarily paroled into the U.S. now find themselves without its protections. They are now out of status and at risk of arrest, detention, and deportation.

Temporary Protected Status

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a legal and temporary immigration status that was created in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990 (INA). Under the law, the DHS Secretary is empowered to grant TPS to populations of foreign-born individuals who are unable to safely return to their home countries, due to situations such as military conflicts or national disasters. TPS is granted for six, twelve, or eighteen-month renewable periods, with DHS regularly reviewing country conditions to determine whether to extend or terminate a particular TPS grant based on current country conditions. If an extension is granted, it is done so at least 60 days before the expiration date. The extension decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of country conditions, and TPS is restricted to those who arrived before a “required arrival date.” This means that TPS holders must be physically present in the United States at the time of the TPS grant. Those who arrive in the U.S. after this date are not covered by the TPS grant.

It is important to note that TPS is available to individuals who meet its qualifications, regardless of their prior immigration status. That is, TPS protections apply to covered foreign nationals currently in the U.S. regardless of whether they were lawfully present, overstayed a visa, or entered unlawfully in the first place. However, TPS protection is only temporary – it is not a pathway to legal status or citizenship in the U.S. Longtime TPS holders are not able to adjust to lawful permanent resident status under the terms of TPS, regardless of how long they have resided in the U.S.

TPS can be extended indefinitely, and TPS protections for some populations have been in place for more than two decades. In 2025 and in the beginning of 2026, the Trump administration has regularly terminated or declined to renew TPS for countries including Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Honduras, Haiti, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Burma, and Somali. Some of these TPS terminations have been challenged in court and litigation remains pending as of early 2026. It is expected that most, if not all, of the remaining active TPS grants will be terminated or allowed to lapse by the Trump administration. Nationals from terminated countries represent hundreds of thousands of individuals, some of whom have been in the United States for decades, and who have now lost, or will shortly lose, their legal status – making them targets for arrest, detention, and deportation.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a temporary protection from removal based on the legal concept of deferred action. DACA was first established in 2012 by the Obama administration. It provides work authorization and protection from deportation to certain Dreamers, young people brought to the United States as children, who entered the U.S. before their 16th birthday and have lived in the U.S. since June 15, 2007. DACA must be renewed every two years. DACA does not provide a pathway to permanent lawful status or citizenship.

Since its creation, DACA has faced several legal challenges. Texas and other states litigated against DACA and blocked its expansion, and the first Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to rescind the program, although it was successful in preventing new applicants from being considered for DACA protections. In 2022, in an attempt to fortify DACA, the Biden administration issued a new DACA rule which replaced the 2012 DACA policy. The 2012 DACA policy was subsequently found to be unlawful in litigation. The 2022 DACA rule was also challenged in court and is still being litigated. In 2025, the 5th Circuit issued a decision finding DACA’s protections from deportations to be a lawful application of prosecutorial discretion but providing DACA recipients with accompanying work authorization was inconsistent with federal law. DACA remains largely in place, with courts currently only looking to terminate work authorization for residents of Texas. The case is now back in federal district court, which is expected to issue a ruling on the future of the program.

The second Trump administration has yet to take action to terminate DACA, but the pending litigation has only added to the uncertainty DACA recipients face.

Refugee Protections

As reflected in the Refugee Act of 1980, a refugee is a person outside the country of his or her nationality, who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An individual who receives refugee status is granted permission to permanently resettle in the United States, including a pathway to LPR status and citizenship.

Refugees are lawfully admitted into the U.S. under a formal process involving extensive screening and vetting. The Department of State preliminarily approves a refugee application and then the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency within DHS, makes the final refugee status determination. Refugee status is a temporary status but, unlike many of the other statuses described above, it can lead to permanent status. A refugee is required to wait for one year but is then obligated to apply for LPR status. Refugee status is an indefinite status, so it is not automatically terminated if a refugee does not apply for LPR status. In rare cases of fraud or material misrepresentation during the application process, refugee status can be challenged in a formal proceeding that follows due process. These legal limitations in revoking refugee status have significant implications for the entire process USCIS has announced regarding the re-review of refugees who have already been resettled in the US.

In 2025, the Trump administration scaled back refugee protections. In November, USCIS issued an internal memo calling for the individual review of all the refugees who arrived between January 20, 2021, and February 20, 2025, and halted all processing of green card applications for refugees who entered during the same period. Such actions will have detrimental impacts on the refugee populations in the U.S. and could result in the removal of status for some refugees.

Asylum Seekers

Asylum seekers have garnered significant attention due to the multiple border influxes going back to 2013. Because hundreds of thousands of individuals seeking asylum have been encountered at the border, this status is most commonly part of discussions about border security and unlawful entry.

While most immigration-related offenses are civil offenses, federal law makes unlawful entry and reentry criminal offenses. Violations of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1325 and 1326 carry criminal penalties. Section 1325, enacted in 1929, makes it a misdemeanor for noncitizens to enter into the U.S. at unauthorized places or time, by evading examination, or entering by making false claims. Section 1326, enacted in 1952, makes unlawful reentry a felony, outlawing the practice of attempting to return and reenter the U.S. after being denied, removed, or deported. Violators of these laws risk fines and imprisonment, with § 1326 violations carrying higher penalties. For more than a decade, these two statutory violations have been among the most commonly-prosecuted federal crimes, carrying criminal penalties in addition to negative immigration consequences.

However, the criminal prohibition against unlawful entry and reentry bump up against the statutory right to seek asylum, created through treaty and enshrined in federal law by Congress. An asylee seeks to secure protection from persecution from inside the United States or at a U.S. border. An asylee is an individual who meets the same definition as a refugee – as detailed above.

Under the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution for reason of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion have a right to seek protection from the U.S. government by applying for asylum within one year of their arrival-with limited exemptions. As the statute notes, they may seek protection “whether or not at a designated port of arrival . . . irrespective of such alien’s status.” Under the statute, “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States” may apply for asylum and can do so either at ports of entry, between ports of entry, or after having arrived inside the U.S. Successful asylum seekers become asylees, who can pursue LPR status after one year of physical presence in the U.S. and eventual citizenship.

Under federal law, those eligible for asylum are permitted to remain in the United States to pursue their claims and can receive an employment authorization document (EAD) after 180 days. If denied asylum, work authorization terminates at the time the EAD expired or 60 days after the denial of the asylum application – whichever is later.

In tension with this framework, the Trump administration has placed significant restrictions on individuals seeking asylum at ports of entry and, more recently, halted processing of affirmative asylum claims. These actions, alongside other actions that limit access to humanitarian relief and reduce the validity period of work authorizations, will have a negative impact on current and future asylum seekers.

Relevant to this discussion of lawfulness and status, the intersection of sections 1325, 1326 and 1158 lay out the complex set of protections for those seeking asylum after an otherwise unlawful entry or reentry. In short, while longstanding federal criminal prohibitions exist for irregular entry or reentry into the United States, federal law also allows those fleeing persecution to seek asylum regardless of their status or method of entry. And federal law provides that asylum seekers can remain in the United States to pursue their claims and seek work authorization. As the Trump administration takes steps to limit access to asylum and the duration of work authorizations, the temporary protections afforded to asylum seekers become increasingly relevant to this conversation.

Conclusion

Although they all too often get mischaracterized in the debate over “illegal immigration,” temporary protections and statuses related to humanitarian parole, TPS, DACA, refugees, and asylum afford lawful presence and protections to those who possess them.

Given this context, it is important to consider the role of these temporary protections and statuses and recognize that hundreds of thousands of people have only recently seen, or may soon see, their lawful presence terminated due to current Trump administration policy changes. In many instances, strong policy considerations exist for affording these protections in the first place and removing them without careful consideration leads to significant harm, especially for those now faced with arrest or deportation. Going forward it is essential that policymakers share a common understanding of these concepts in order to finally advance the permanent legislative reforms needed to fix our broken immigration system.

Wax told the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday that the district court improperly relied on Penn’s characterization of “hotly disputed facts” in disciplinary reports about her controversial statements concerning race and defined retaliation too narrowly when it dismissed her claims.

Wax, who is white, sued the university in January 2025, alleging Penn violated her tenure rights in October 2024 when it suspended her from teaching for one year with half pay following an investigation into public statements she made about minority groups that many deemed racist.

Senior U.S. District Judge Timothy Savage in Philadelphia dismissed the case in August, calling her racial bias claims “implausible.”

A Penn spokesperson declined to comment on Wax’ appeal. Wax, who has denied allegations of racism, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. She has previously defended her right to hold unpopular opinions about race and referred to herself as a ""casualty in the culture wars.”

Wax's attorney, Jason Torchinsky of law firm Holtzman Vogel, said he and his client hope the Third Circuit ""see the law the same way we do.""

A social welfare law and policy scholar who has taught at UPenn’s law school since 2001, Wax has clashed for years with administrators. Students and faculty first called for her firing in 2017, after she co-authored a newspaper opinion piece arguing that Anglo-Protestant cultural norms are superior.

The law school in 2018 banned Wax from teaching required first-year courses after she said on a podcast that she had never seen a Black law student graduate in the top quarter of his or her class, and rarely in the top half.

In 2022, Wax wrote a blog post saying the United States is “better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration” as long as most Asians vote for Democrats. UPenn law dean Ted Ruger asked the university’s faculty senate to impose a “major sanction” against her for her statements.

Wax said in her brief to the appeals court that Penn employs a ""race-based double standard"" in disciplinary procedures and academic freedom protections, arguing that she was punished more harshly while the university overlooked similar conduct by racial minorities.

She separately sued the university a second time in Pennsylvania state court in November, alleging the university violated her academic freedom when it sanctioned her over controversial statements about race. That case is on hold pending her federal appeal.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has grown its network of private industry partners since the start of the second Trump administration to support its agents as they storm into cities and detain people they suspect of being undocumented immigrants.

Last year, the ICE agency obligated more money than ever to private contractors, and this year it’s on pace to easily top last year’s record. More than 600 companies have been working with Trump’s ICE, including businesses in nearly every state.

Using USAspending.gov data, Sludge created an interactive map that shows every company in the U.S. that has either entered into a new contract with ICE during the second Trump administration or has been awarded new obligations under an existing contract. Click on the map for details including amounts and contract service descriptions.

Since President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025, ICE has approved contract obligations totaling $5.2 billion. While most of ICE’s contracting dollars go to large prison and technology companies, the agency's network of private-sector partners extends across the country and spans a wide range of industries. Nearly every state is home to ICE contractors, including companies with million dollar-plus contracts that operate out of unexpected locations like suburban neighborhoods or rural areas.

Almost two-thirds of ICE’s spending obligations so far under Trump’s second term have gone to just seven companies. The top recipient has been ​​Albuquerque-based CSI Aviation, ICE’s main contractor for deportation flights, which has received more than $1.2 billion in contract obligations. CSI Aviation, which hosted a rally for Trump days before the 2024 election, has seen its ICE revenue soar since the start of last year—around a 10x increase compared with May, before the passage of the Trump-GOP reconciliation bill.

GEO Group, the largest private prison operator in the country, has received $683.4 million worth of contract obligations since Trump reentered the White House, and another prison company CoreCivic has received $269 million. The companies’ stock prices rose last year under a $45 billion plan in the Trump-signed ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)"" to expand ICE’s detention facilities, and their CEOs cheered their soaring revenue from ICE in August earnings calls. Each contractor bestowed $500,000 to the Trump–Vance inaugural in December 2024 (the former via its PAC), with their executives giving millions of dollars more last cycle to Trump campaign groups.

The Richmond, Virginia-based company Acquisition Logistics has seen a staggering rise in obligated ICE revenue under Trump: nearly $600 million so far. Last year, the small company, which had little record of operating immigration detention centers, won a $1.2 billion Army contract to build what it touted as the largest immigration detention complex in the nation near El Paso, Texas. Owned by a retired Navy flight officer, the company had previously never received a contract award above $16 million.

Three more companies have been awarded nine-figure amounts in ICE contract obligations since the start of last year: Bethesda-based telecommunications company Tribalco ($206 million); Virginia-headquartered conglomerate Akima ($181.7 million), which runs the Guantánamo Bay detention center; and Virginia-based defense contractor MVM, Inc. ($135 million).

Palantir, the MAGA-aligned software and analytics contractor, has received payments from ICE toward $81 million in contract obligations since Trump’s inauguration. Internal ICE materials seen by 404 Media reveal that Palantir is building an app being used by ICE agents, named ELITE, that locates targets on a map-like interface, drawing in data from sources like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Palantir’s overall government contract obligations, including from the Army, Air Force, and other federal departments, jumped to $1 billion last year. Palantir CEO Alex Karp gave $1 million to both the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and the inauguration, and the company reportedly donated to the president’s White House ballroom project. One of the company’s projects with the Army, the Project Maven AI tool, was expanded last year to a ceiling of $1.3 billion through 2029.

Some brand-name companies are keeping up contracts with ICE as the agency has tackled, tased, and shot American citizens and immigrants in what civil rights groups including the ACLU argue is a violation of due process. The New York City-based consulting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP has been given more than $48.8 million in obligated payments from ICE under Trump for services including logistical and administrative support. Dell’s government contracting arm has raked in ICE payments toward more than $25.2 million in contracts for licensing of Microsoft’s “business intelligence” platform Power BI. Media company Thomson Reuters has been awarded $7.5 million for subscription services to law enforcement databases.

The options for Democrats on Homeland Security are all rather bleak.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is halfway home in approving government funding for the current budget year that began Oct. 1 after the Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed a three-bill package.

Now comes the hard part. Lawmakers still must negotiate a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security amid soaring tensions on Capitol Hill after the shooting of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.

Lawmakers are working to complete passage of all 12 annual spending bills before Jan. 30, the deadline set in a funding patch that ended a 43-day government shutdown in November. With the Senate’s action on Thursday, six of those bills have now passed through both chambers of Congress. The measure before the Senate passed by a broadly bipartisan vote of 82-15. It now goes to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.

That recent success would greatly reduce the impact of a shutdown, in the unlikely event that there is one at the end of January, since lawmakers have now provided full-year funding for such agencies as the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Interior and Justice.

Lawmakers from both parties are determined to prevent another lapse in funding for the remaining agencies. The House’s approval of a separate two-bill package this week nudges them closer to getting all 12 done in the next two weeks.

“Our goal, Mr. President is to get all of these bills signed into law. No continuing resolutions that lock in previous priorities and don’t reflect today’s realities,” said Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “No more disastrous government shutdowns that are totally unnecessary and so harmful.”

ICE shooting inflames debate on funding

The biggest hurdle ahead is the funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. The plan was to bring that bill before the House this week, but Rep. Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the decision was made to pull the bill and “buy some time” as lawmakers respond to the Minneapolis shooting.

Democrats are seeking what Rep. Rosa DeLauro called “guardrails” that would come with funding for ICE.

“We can’t deal with the lawlessness and terrorizing of communities,” said DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. “We’re going back and forth with offers, and that’s where we are.”

Trump’s deportation crackdown, focused on cities in Democratic-leaning states, has incensed many House Democrats who demand a strong legislative response. Last week, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good in a shooting that federal officials said was an act of self-defense but that the mayor described as reckless and unnecessary.

Some 70 Democrats have signed onto an effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Others are seeking specific changes to how the agency operates, such as requiring ICE agents to wear body cameras.

“There are a variety of different things that can be done that we have put on the table and will continue to put on the table to get ICE under control so that they are actually conducting themselves like every other law enforcement agency in the country, as opposed to operating as if they’re above the law, somehow thinking they’ve got absolute immunity,” said Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus, which includes nearly 100 Democratic members, formally announced opposition to any funding to immigration enforcement agencies within the Department of Homeland Security “unless there are meaningful and significant reforms to immigration enforcement practices.”

Looking for a solution

Cole said any changes to the Homeland Security funding bill would need sign-on from the White House. He said one possible answer would be to let Democrats have a separate vote on the Homeland Security bill. If passed, it would then be combined with some other spending bills for transmittal to the Senate. Republicans used a similar procedural tactic to get a previous spending package over the finish line in the House.

The options for Democrats on Homeland Security are all rather bleak. If Congress passes a continuing resolution to fund the agency at current levels, that gives the Trump administration more discretion to spend the money as it wants.

Meanwhile, any vote to eliminate funding for ICE won’t stop massive sums from flowing to the agency because Trump’s tax cut and border security bill, passed last summer, injects roughly $170 billion into immigration enforcement over the next four years.

Also, any vote to eliminate funding could put some Democrats in tough reelection battles in a difficult position this fall as Republicans accuse them of insufficiently supporting law enforcement.

• Dismantled or sharply reduced civil rights offices across federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education.","One year after Donald Trump’s second inauguration, a pattern emerges. Across dozens of executive orders, agency memos, funding decisions and enforcement changes, the administration has weakened federal civil rights law and the foundations of the country’s racially inclusive democracy.

From the start, the U.S. was not built to include everyone equally. The Constitution protected and promoted slavery. Most states limited voting to white men. Congress restricted naturalized citizenship to “free white persons.” These choices were not accidents. They shaped who could belong and who could exercise political power, and they entrenched a racial political majority that lasted for generations.

That began to change in the 1960s. After decades of protest and pressure, Congress enacted laws that prohibited discrimination in employment, education, voting, immigration and housing.

Federal agencies were charged with enforcing those laws, collecting data to identify discrimination and conditioning public funds on compliance. These choices reshaped U.S. demographics and institutions, with the current Congress “the most racially and ethnically diverse in history,” according to the Pew Research Center. The laws did not eliminate racial inequality, but they made exclusion easier to see and harder to defend.

The first year of the second Trump administration marks a sharp reversal.

Cumulative retreat

Rather than repealing civil rights statutes outright, the administration has focused on disabling the mechanisms that make those laws work.

Drawing on over two decades of teaching and writing about civil rights and my experience directing a GW Law project on inclusive democracy, I believe this pattern reflects not isolated administrative actions but a cumulative retreat from the federal government’s role as an enforcer of civil rights law.

Over the past year, the president and his administration have taken a series of connected actions:

• On its first day in office, announced the end of all federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, including diversity officers, equity plans and related grants and contracts.

• Shut down or sharply cut funding for federal programs aimed at reducing inequality, including offices focused on minority health, minority-owned businesses, fair federal contracting, environmental justice and closing the digital divide in broadband.

• Warned schools that diversity programs could jeopardize their federal funding, opened investigations into colleges offering scholarships to students protected under DACA – the Obama-era policy providing deportation protection for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children – and signaled that colleges risk losing federal student aid if their accrediting agencies consider diversity.

• Revoked security clearances and access to federal buildings for employees at law firms with diversity policies. The FCC investigated media companies for promoting diversity and threatened to block mergers by companies with similar programs, leading several companies to drop their initiatives.

• Issued a government-wide memo labeling common best practices in hiring, admissions and other selection and evaluation processes – such as compiling diverse applicant pools, valuing cultural competence, considering first-generation or low-income status and seeking geographic and demographic representation – as potentially legally suspect. The memo warned that federal funding could be cut to schools, employers and state and local governments using such practices. Federal prosecutors reportedly investigated federal contractors that consider diversity, characterizing such initiatives as fraud.

• Weakened enforcement against discrimination by ordering agencies to stop using disparate impact analysis. That kind of analysis identifies disparities in outcomes, assesses whether they are justified by legitimate objectives, and intervenes when they are not. The Department of Justice, the EEOC, the National Credit Union Administration and other agencies complied and dropped disparate impact analysis. Because algorithmic systems typically operate without explicit intent, eliminating disparate impact analysis reduces federal agencies’ ability to detect and address discriminatory outcomes produced by increasingly automated government and private-sector decision-making.

• Rescinded an executive order that barred discrimination by federal contractors, required steps to ensure nondiscriminatory hiring and employment, and subjected contractors to federal compliance reviews and record-keeping. This weakened a key mechanism used since 1965 to detect and remedy workplace discrimination.

• Eliminated data used to track inequality, including rolling back guidance encouraging schools to collect data on racial disparities in discipline and special education. The administration also removed data used to identify racial disparities in environmental harms.

• Dismantled or sharply reduced civil rights offices across federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education. About three-quarters of lawyers in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division left.

• Pressured the Smithsonian to remove exhibits about racial injustice, restored Confederate monuments and military base names, and barred schools and teacher training programs from including material the administration labeled divisive, such as unconscious bias.

• Declared English the nation’s only official language, repealed a requirement that federal agencies provide meaningful access to government programs and services for people with limited English proficiency, and prompted the General Services Admininistration and the departments of Justice, Education and other agencies to scale back language-assistance requirements and services.

• Attempted to limit birthright citizenship guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and adopted practices that treat ethnicity and non-English accents as legitimate reasons for immigration stops.

The pattern is hard to miss

Taken together, these shifts have practical consequences.

When agencies stop collecting data on racial disparities, discrimination becomes harder to detect. When disparate impact analysis is abandoned, unfair practices with no legitimate purpose go unchallenged. When diversity programs are chilled through investigations and funding threats, institutions respond by narrowing opportunity. When history and language are recast as threats to unity, truth and freedom of speech and thought are suppressed and undermined.

Administration officials argue that these steps are needed to prevent discrimination against white people, promote unity, ensure “colorblind equality” and comply with a Supreme Court decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions. But that ruling did not ban awareness of racial inequality, or neutral policies aimed at reducing it. Many of the administration’s actions rely on broad claims of illegality without providing specific violations.

The selective nature of enforcement is also telling.

Books about racism and civil rights were removed from military libraries, while books praising Nazi ideas or claiming racial intelligence differences were left untouched. The administration suspended admissions of refugees – over 90% of whom have been from Africa, Asia and Latin America in recent years – but then reopened the refugee program for white South Africans.

One year in, the pattern is hard to miss.

The administration is not simply applying neutral rules. It is dismantling the systems that once helped the U.S. move toward a more open and equal democracy. It is replacing them with policies that selectively narrow access to economic, cultural and educational participation.

The result is not simply a change in policy, but a fundamental shift in the trajectory of American democracy.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/712890/original/file-20260116-56-n2sjl5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C55%2C2239%2C1119&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:33.394058

Dozens of members of Congress gathered in Minnesota to hear on-the-ground testimony and bear witness to how federal agents have menaced Minnesotans in recent weeks, especially Somalis and Latinos. But they also learned of how immigration agents’ actions have hardened Minnesotans’ resolve to fight for their constitutional rights.

Immigration raids are resulting in injuries, idling vehicles left in the streets, abandoned dogs wandering through neighborhoods and destruction of property, testifiers said. Agents are also scanning the streets for Minnesotans of color and asking for their papers.

“People are walking around on the street with their passports. That’s not American. That’s the furthest thing from it,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told the federal lawmakers. “Please take back to your respective constituencies and your colleagues the message of, if you love your own community, do not let this happen in ours.”

Friday’s hearing was not a formal hearing, but the sixth in a series conducted by U.S. House Democrats to highlight the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. The committee also invited both Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. No Republicans attended.

Newly elected St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Laos, told the committee that advisors recommended she carry her passport in case she gets stopped by federal agents. Her’s parents, who are U.S. citizens, are afraid to leave their homes for fear that their “neighbors would tell (federal agents) that that house was an Asian house.”

Trump has used fraud in Minnesota’s public programs to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community and justify sending 3,000 immigration agents to the state.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Minnesota, said many Somali Minnesotans are afraid to send their children to school, and elders are carrying immigration documents to their mosque.

“Do your job. Stand up for the Constitution of the American people. Our lives depend on it,” Hussein said.

Emilia Gonzalez Avalos, executive director of Unidos Minnesota, said the immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota have caused many to distrust the federal government.

“People should not have to worry that an encounter with a masked, armed federal agent could cost them their lives. This is not about whether immigration law exists. This is about how power is exercised,” Gonzalez Avalos said.

A lawsuit filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union alleges immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens. Minnesota and the Twin Cities are also suing the Trump administration to stop the immigration surge.

U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu of California encouraged Minnesotans to keep documenting the unlawful actions of federal agents and noted that the statute of limitations for violations of federal law is five years.

“While this administration may not hold anyone accountable, I guarantee you a future administration will,” Lieu said. “All of us are here today to let the people in Minnesota know that you are not alone, that the Constitution protects you and you are on the right side of history.”

In D.C., Congress is rushing to pass annual appropriations by the end of January to avoid another government shutdown.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan hinted that House Democrats may use the actions of federal agents in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, as leverage in the upcoming budget battle.

“We have passed policies to tell them not to do ICE actions in front of schools, health centers, funerals … but we still have violations,” Tlaib said. “When Speaker (Mike) Johnson says ICE is doing what it was created to do, remember this when the funding comes up next week.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ilhan--scaled-e1768590794467-2048x1331.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:42.340471

It also saw the birth of the modern national security state.
Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly.
For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency.
Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them.","The Trump administration frequently uses fear as a weapon, whether stoking it, pledging to shield some populations from it, or endeavoring to inflict it on others. For example, the administration has engaged in what “border czar” Tom Homan describes as a “shock and awe” campaign that has included aggressively raiding communities around the country, shipping some migrants to dangerous prisons, and publicizing these actions through highly stylized videos and memes. The administration portrays its targets as “the worst of the worst,” as “pedophiles, armed robbers, and drug traffickers” whom law-abiding citizens should fear. The government’s own data, however, suggests otherwise. According to Reuters, “some 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation.” Citizens, too, have been swept up in raids. Entire communities thus have been placed in terror by an administration that claims to be protecting them.

The administration also has employed fear-based governing outside of the immigration context, including against the federal workforce. Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, famously said before the 2024 election that a second Trump administration should inflict “trauma” on federal career employees. He explained that when “‘bureaucrats … wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down …. We want to put them in trauma.’” Vought’s wish has come true, with thousands of federal employees chased out of their jobs through a combination of ideological targeting and large-scale gutting of agencies.

Although Donald Trump, Russell Vought, and their colleagues excel at wielding fear as a tool of governance, they did not invent the practice. In his important new book, “The Triumph of Fear: Domestic Surveillance and Political Repression from McKinley to Eisenhower,” Patrick G. Eddington explores several earlier periods in American history during which federal officials and politicians regularly stoked fear against, and instilled fear in, disfavored targets. Eddington, a senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute who has worked as a CIA analyst, focuses his book on the late 19th century to the 1950s. This era encompassed two world wars, the height of the Cold War, and domestic social and cultural upheaval. It also saw the birth of the modern national security state. Eddington draws on extensive archival research to describe and explain the many ways in which fear pervaded the government and politics of the time and was built into the national security state’s DNA.

Although Eddington navigates the era in a mostly straightforward, chronological manner, several themes and subthemes recur throughout the book. As its title suggests, the book’s overarching theme is fear. Eddington underscores this point from the outset, observing in the introduction that “the driving force” behind the developments he studies—principally the government’s “surveilling, penetrating, and actively subverting domestic political activities”—was “fear.” One aspect of that fear is that felt by “executive branch officials, members of Congress, and those on the federal bench—fear that challenges to existing political, economic, or social paradigms would alter the country in ways that would disempower those who benefitted from the status quo.” As Eddington’s subsequent chapters make clear, fear played a still more ubiquitous role in the events of the time. Politicians and officials not only felt fear themselves; they sought to make others afraid—afraid of their own government and of one another.

Beneath this overarching theme lie the details, spanning decades, of the means that powerful actors in the executive branch, in Congress, and in compliant parts of the private sector used to instill and to respond to fear. Because Eddington covers so much ground, I highlight just three such means here, by way of illustration: the growth of the federal government’s surveillance and secrecy capacities; the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ethnicity and nationality; and the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ideology.

The six decades Eddington explores were pivotal for the growth of the U.S. national security state, including the government’s capacities for surveillance and secrecy. With respect to the federal government’s surveillance activities, Eddington illuminates, among other things, the way that its growth was a product of executive initiative as well as congressional, judicial, and corporate enabling. He explains, for example, that the Treasury Department’s Secret Service Division was the dominant agent of domestic surveillance by the early 20th century, and that it went largely unchecked by Congress for years, even after the press revealed that the division had spied on members of Congress at President Theodore Roosevelt’s direction. Roosevelt had ordered the surveillance in an effort to uncover the source of an earlier media story. A subsequent spying scandal did lead Congress to adopt legislation in 1908, restricting the Secret Service Division’s activities to “defeating counterfeiting and presidential protection.” The scandal was a sensational one: The Navy had directed the division to spy on a naval officer at the urging of the mother of a woman with whom the officer allegedly had had an affair. Even after this scandal and subsequent legislation, however, the Theodore Roosevelt administration remained undeterred. It found a way around the legislative bar by creating a new organization: the Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice. It did so by using the Justice Department’s general revenue fund to employ 30 part-time agents, including many veterans of the Secret Service Division. As employees of the new bureau, these agents conducted domestic surveillance that the Secret Service Division was now barred from conducting.

Eddington traces iterations of this pattern—a mixture of executive initiative, occasional congressional pushback, and more frequent congressional cooperation or willful ignorance—throughout the decades that he chronicles. Take, for example, his coverage of the period from the outbreak of World War I in Europe through the aftermath of both the war and the Russian Revolution. In the months following the sinking of the Lusitania, the Wilson administration grew desperate to surveil suspected German agents and their sympathizers in the United States, leading Wilson to authorize a renewed domestic surveillance role for the Secret Service Division. This action “effectively violate[d] the 1908 law” limiting the division’s activity, and Eddington “found no evidence that Congress was informed” of it. Shortly after the United States entered the war, however, Congress authorized some forms of surveillance by the division—for example, to conduct investigations under the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Food and Fuel Control Act. By the end of World War I, “the [division] and [the bureau had] full-fledged domestic spying counterparts in the [Army and Navy].”

These capacities were augmented through cooperation by corporate and civil society actors. For example, the Bureau of Investigation arranged for the major telecommunications providers to transmit copies, without warrants, of “incoming and outgoing telegrams of individuals or organizations of interest to investigators.” The bureau also partnered with a private organization comprised of volunteer investigators, “the American Protective League,” whose members were known to go rogue, “masquerading as [Secret Service] agents” and “in one case ordering a Des Moines, Iowa, resident to raise the American flag over his home.” Eddington also describes how these surveillance precedents and capabilities continued to be utilized after the war’s end. In the postwar years, “the Bolshevik threat [became] the prime, but not exclusive, focus.” As I elaborate below, other targets would include Japanese Americans and critics of their internment.

Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly. Although secrecy is frequently used to bypass congressional and judicial oversight, Congress and the judiciary enabled executive secrecy in significant ways. For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency. The Espionage Act of 1917 bars a much wider range of speech, including information disclosures. Eddington stresses the Espionage Act’s importance in this regard, focusing especially on its use to punish anti-war speech and other forms of dissent throughout World War I and the Cold War. The Supreme Court also enabled broad prosecutorial discretion to punish anti-establishment but not imminently dangerous speech in a well-known line of cases beginning in 1919. The Supreme Court’s decisions in those cases, including Schenck v. United States, Debs v. United States, and Abrams v. United States, endorsed a narrow view of speakers’ First Amendment protections, particularly during wartime.

Eddington also emphasizes the significance of the state secrets privilege and the Supreme Court’s 1953 decision recognizing it in United States v. Reynolds. The privilege may be invoked by the federal government in litigation where “‘there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.’” A significant problem with the ruling, as Eddington points out, is its suggestion that in some cases judges should not require disclosure even to themselves, for in camera inspection. The danger of abuse that this creates is evidenced in the aftermath of Reynolds itself. The case originated as a tort suit brought by a group of widows whose husbands, all civilian engineers, had perished in a crash of an Air Force B-29 bomber. The Air Force successfully resisted disclosing the accident report on the basis that it contained state secrets, and the Supreme Court refused to order even in camera disclosure. Decades later, the accident report, which by then had been declassified, was obtained by the grown child of one of the passengers. She learned that the Air Force had lied so many years ago. The report contained no state secrets but instead revealed negligence on the part of the Air Force.

The scope of the surveillance and secrecy capacities that Eddington explores is breathtaking, but their greatest significance lies in their wielding by government actors as tools to target disfavored groups and ideas. Among the most notorious instances of ethnic or nationality-based targeting was that perpetrated against Japanese Americans during World War II. Eddington’s research sheds new light on the extent of the government’s surveillance of Japanese Americans before and during World War II, and on the gulf between the information it gathered and the lies it told to stoke fear against, and justify the mass internment of, this group. For example, John Franklin Carter, whom President Franklin Roosevelt had secretly commissioned to perform intelligence work for FDR directly, concluded that “98 percent of the Japanese in Hawaii were ‘loyal to the U.S., and that those who are not’” had already been identified by the Navy and the FBI. In a cover letter forwarding one of his reports to FDR, Carter wrote, chillingly and prophetically, that his investigator “‘feels that the Japanese are more in danger from the whites than the other way around.’”

Eddington also highlights the political considerations that led FDR not only to support mass internment for Japanese Americans, but to prolong it. For example, he cites a memo that FDR wrote to two officials, explaining his view that “it would be a mistake to do anything drastic or sudden” in ending internment. FDR “wanted to determine ‘how many Japanese families would be acceptable to public opinion’ for relocation back to the West Coast” and suggested distributing Japanese Americans around the United States to “avoid[] public outcry” on the West coast. As an intelligence report that Eddington quotes acknowledged, the violent public backlash that did follow Japanese Americans’ return home stemmed both from “racial hatred” and “from whites who [did] not want to resume business competition with returning Japanese.”

Surveillance was also used to target ideological dissenters, including those who criticized the federal government’s actions against Japanese Americans. As Eddington recounts, “Such was the fate of a young Army private and aspiring singer-songwriter named Pete Seeger.” Seeger, who had a Japanese American fiancée (who eventually became his wife of nearly 70 years), wrote to the California American Legion to protest its passage of a resolution calling to deport all Japanese and Japanese Americans from the United States and to bar citizenship for all Japanese descendants. The Legion forwarded Seeger’s letter to the FBI, which eventually built an intelligence file on Seeger that ran more than 1,700 pages.

Seeger’s case is just the tip of the iceberg of ideological surveillance and punishment in American history. Eddington chronicles much of this history, ranging from the Secret Service Division’s targeting of anarchists and the nascent Bureau of Investigation’s surveillance of socialists, through the Palmer Raids, Espionage Act prosecutions of socialist and other speakers, “anti-red” scares stoked by members of Congress and the executive branch, and the efforts across many presidential administrations to surveil and target participants in the civil rights movement.

Among the many striking elements in Eddington’s account of ideological targeting is the way that politicians stoked and wielded fears of socialism and communism to aggrandize themselves and to intimidate and control rival politicians. Eddington recounts, for example, that the House Select Committee on Un-American Activities had lost public and institutional support by 1944 but was revived and turned into a permanent committee after Rep. John Rankin, partnering with the American Legion, launched a public campaign to support it. The resuscitated committee went on to “do massive professional, personal, and political damage to thousands of individual Americans and domestic civil society organizations.” The prospect of committee “witch hunt[s]” also led some congressional Democrats, including Rep. Jennings Randolph, successfully to pressure President Truman to employ harsh internal loyalty measures throughout the executive branch. Eddington also gives their due to those administration members, representatives, and other high-profile figures who resisted the “anti-red” race to the bottom. Eleanor Roosevelt, for one, was a voice of conscience, writing to Truman: “I feel we have capitulated to our fear of Communism, and instead of fighting to improve Democracy, we are doing what the Soviets would do in trying to repress anything which we are afraid might not command public support.”

Eddington’s book is a rich, important contribution to our understanding of a pivotal time in American history, and of the growth of America’s national security state in particular. Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them. As he notes in his introduction, however, “The Triumph of Fear” is extraordinary in its scale and in its use of primary as well as secondary literature to illuminate its subject. And Eddington is particularly effective in his choice of stories to highlight and to connect to the book’s larger theme of fear-based governing and politics.

My one criticism of the book is that Eddington occasionally adds a conclusory statement about legality to an otherwise compelling, evidence-based description of government activity. For example, in discussing proposed legislation to criminalize certain disclosures about cryptology, Eddington states: “This was not an encroachment on the First Amendment—it was a proposal to destroy it in the name of national security.” Having written a great deal myself on the law of national security disclosures and the First Amendment, I am extremely sympathetic to Eddington’s point. It is, however, a complicated legal topic to which justice cannot be done in a single sentence. That said, my quibble is a small one because statements like the quoted one make up a tiny part of an otherwise excellent book. I mention this quibble only because the book on the whole is so strong and because its strength stems largely from its intensely research-driven approach.

Because Eddington does, admirably, let his exhaustive research do most of the talking, he does not step outside of the studied time period to explicitly draw comparisons to the current administration. But readers will do as they please, and I suspect I will not be alone in seeing parallels between some of the terrible developments that Eddington chronicles and events now taking place on a regular basis in the United States. Readers likely will see not only parallels but roots, as today’s abuses are enabled in part by the growth in the national security state that Eddington recounts. Eddington’s book would still be an important contribution even if it were not so lamentably relevant to current events. But in this moment, especially, I am grateful for Eddington’s work. The historical context that it provides enables us better to understand what it is that we are living through.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/surveillance-camera-(1).png?sfvrsn=1f2a75b9_5,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:45.944466

The “ICE Out of Virginia” protest, organized by Party for Socialism and Liberation-Virginia, Indivisible RVA and 50501 Virginia, lasted over an hour and halted traffic on Broad Street.

“We are here today to make a loud stand against ICE and this regime that has not represented us, has used our tax dollars to rip our neighbors away from us, has murdered our neighbors in front of us,” said Reed Baldwin of the PSLVA as he addressed the crowd gathered in the pouring rain at Walker Plaza.

The local protest was one of roughly 500 organized nationwide as part of the “ICE Out for Good” weekend, with demonstrations in nearly 1,200 cities and towns after the shooting, according to national organizers.

Trump administration officials have said the shooting was an act of self-defense after Good allegedly tried to hit the agent with her vehicle. Multiple videos contradict that account.

Residents, organizers and speakers from several Richmond groups joined national criticism of the fatal shooting and the Trump administration’s explanation of the incident. They also raised concerns about ICE’s treatment of immigrants.

“They tell us that the immigrants are the problem, that they’re criminals, that Black and brown people are the problem, that trans people, that transkids are the problem,” said Richmond Defensa organizer Violeta Vega. “They tell those lies to our face every day to justify this violence, to justify this terror.”

Demonstrators also criticized decades of increased federal spending on immigration enforcement and border patrol, saying needs such as housing, health care and education have been overlooked.

Speakers encouraged protesters to prepare for a general strike and to organize in defense of themselves and their communities. They also urged people to call on local and state officials to end operations connected to ICE and to reconsider Richmond’s use of Flock Safety cameras, which some activists criticized as surveillance tools.

“The majority of the progress that has been made, it’s been made by, every single day, ordinary working-class citizens,” Te’Shaun Cleckley said. “So, honest to god, I think it’s up to us.”

In a statement, Mayor Danny Avula reiterated that the city and Richmond Police Department do not coordinate with ICE on deportations. He did not say whether the city’s contract with Flock Safety cameras would be ended, instead stressing that the department uses the technology with transparency and for public safety.

Organizers said they plan a peace vigil outside the Virginia War Memorial on Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday and a walkout on Tuesday in response to Good’s fatal shooting and federal immigration policies they oppose.",https://epmgaa.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2026/01/15/No_ICE_march_1.2026_JTH_RFP-16.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 15:58:35.310371

One lawmaker warned the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to preserve records for an investigation into the administration’s deadly use of force.

The dozens of leaders staged an “accountability” hearing at the state capitol in St Paul into Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) actions as demonstrations continued to spread in the city and elsewhere, along with sporadic clashes with federal officers nine days after Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The US president has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to justify sending in troops to quell the protests, which have remained largely peaceful despite the occasional skirmishes and continued arrests.

The gathered lawmakers and officials on Friday labeled their special panel hearing “Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s deadly assault on Minnesota”.

Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who has been singled out for vitriolic and racist public attacks by Trump, decried aggressive treatment of residents, including US citizens, and their vehicles by federal agents and officers.

“Dozens of US citizens have been taken into custody and released hours later. We have yet to see charges materialize, because in nearly all instances, no federal charges are possible,” Omar said, adding that others were taken from their own vehicles.

“Abandoned cars with broken windows have become a normal sight of daily life in the Twin Cities,” she said, referring to the adjacent cities of Minneapolis and St Paul.

As ICE raids and traffic stops have increased, families are being torn apart.

Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, was present and has spoken out against the FBI shutting state and local investigators out of the examination of Good’s killing. And Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, attended, having told ICE to leave and citing the federal government’s aggressive approach as making the city less safe.

From further afield, the Washington state congresswoman Pramila Jayapal attended and chaired Friday’s panel. Jayapal sits on several House committees dealing with immigration and the constitution and she is the senior whip of the Democratic caucus and chair emerita of the progressive caucus.

“The Trump administration has targeted and terrorized people of all immigration statuses, including US citizens, violating constitutional rights and court orders, destroying our existing immigration system and eroding all of our rights,” she said.

Quoting a Minnesota Star Tribune editorial suggesting that the state was “under siege”, she added: “Battalions of armed federal agents are moving through neighborhoods, transit hubs, malls and parking lots and staging near churches, mosques and schools. Strangers with guns have metastasized in spaces where daily life should be routine and safe. It feels like a military occupation.”

Kaohly Her, the mayor of St Paul, was pointed. “We are ground zero for Trump’s war on America, a war on our democracy, on our freedoms, on our rights as Americans,” she said.

Scrutiny of ICE operations has increased in the wake of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Good as she attempted to drive away from ICE agents last Wednesday while they ordered her out of the car and tried to open the door. She was not armed and addressed officers calmly, but the White House quickly called her a domestic terrorist.

Protests have escalated over her killing, and the exclusion of state investigators from an FBI inquiry. Polling released by the American Civil Liberties Union on Friday showed that 71% of voters supported an independent investigation into the shooting, and 84% said people had the constitutional right to observe and document ICE activity in public.

ICE agents, meanwhile, have continued to engage in violent confrontations with residents, protesters and those being sought as allegedly undocumented or otherwise in violation of immigration law. Many of the more violent encounters have been caught on video and posted to social media.

The Minnesota congresswoman Betty McCollum condemned “Trump’s abuse of power”.

“High school students have been thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed on their own school grounds, and it’s happening right here, right now,” she said.

“The actions of these agents, which are totally unprofessional and illegal, create great harm and fear. Secretary Noem, you better be preserving your documents unaltered, because you are going to be held to testify and you will be subpoenaed.”

Jayapal called for ICE to cease its surges.

According to KPD, the Hays County Sheriff’s Office (HSCO) got a call from ICE requesting “ambulance assistance for an individual being detained by federal authorities” at about 7:45 a.m. KXAN reached out to HSCO, and it said it did not assist with this incident.

KXAN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for more clarity on the detainee’s condition and will update this story if a response is given.

Amid a massive expansion in immigration detention in 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) dramatically reduced the number of facility inspection reports by the agency’s Office of Detention Oversight (ODO), one of its key tools for tracking detention conditions. There was a 36.25% decline in ICE detention facility inspection reports published in 2025 compared to the previous year, according to an analysis of data pulled from the agency’s facility inspections website. These inspections assess whether facilities meet a range of detention standards, including those that shape fundamental health and safety conditions for the people being imprisoned there, including whether detention facilities are providing adequate health care, monitoring and effectively preventing suicide, providing quality food, and maintaining habitable shelter.

A Father’s Quest for Justice Finds Resolution After 13 Years

Craig Stingley had no legal training, no big-name lawyer or civil rights advocate by his side. Yet for 13 years, he refused to accept that the judicial system would hold no one responsible for the killing of his 16-year-old son, Corey. The quest for justice dominated his life. He gathered police reports, witness statements and other evidence in the Dec. 14, 2012, fatal incident inside a Milwaukee-area convenience store. The youth had tried to shoplift $12 worth of flavored malt beverages at the shop before abandoning the items and turning to leave. That’s when three men wrestled him to the ground to hold him for the police. The medical examiner determined that he died of a brain injury from asphyxiation after a “violent struggle with multiple individuals.” The manner of death: homicide.

Another officer near the SUV tells Good to get out of the car.
A DHS official told NBC News earlier this week said that Ross suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the fatal shooting incident.
First responders removed Good from the scene on the suburban street in Minneapolis.
ICE officers left the scene at 11:20 a.m., and the FBI arrived at 11:31 a.m.","Official reports have shed light on the moments immediately after Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis last week, and how first responders and bystanders reacted to the shooting, which has led to nationwide protests.

According to police files, fire response reports and transcripts of 911 calls released to NBC News in response to a public records request, Good was still alive when a Minneapolis Fire Emergency Medical Services team reached her.

The reports paint a vivid picture of the chaotic moments following the Jan. 7 shooting, which has become a definitive moment in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“Every use of force incident and any discharge of an ICE firearm must be properly reported and reviewed by the agency in accordance with agency policy, procedure, and guidelines,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to NBC News. “All shootings are initially reviewed by the appropriate federal, state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency principally charged with first response to the incident.”

McLaughlin added that “following a review of the incident by the appropriate investigative agency, ICE will conduct an independent review of the critical incident.”

The fire response report states that during the incident, Good had “apparent gunshots” to her chest, forearm and face, and was “unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity.”

Footage from the incident, including cellphone video taken by Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot Good, shows her at the wheel of her Honda SUV interacting with ICE officers before the shooting.

In the footage, cars can be heard honking, sirens wail and protesters are blowing whistles. Ross is seen walking around the front of the car to face Good. “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” Good is heard telling Ross. Another officer near the SUV tells Good to get out of the car.

In the footage, Ross turns to face the front of the SUV as Good’s wife, Becca Good, appears to say, “Drive.” Good turns the steering wheel to her right, away from the officer, as she begins to drive.

In Ross’ cellphone footage, he can then be heard shouting what sounds like “whoa” and firing. Multiple shots can be heard in the video. The view of his phone camera jerks around, points up to the sky and captures a glimpse of his masked face before it levels out and shows the SUV accelerating down the street.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the officer was acting in self-defense and accused Good of being a “domestic terrorist,” without citing evidence. The FBI is investigating the shooting.

Good, 37, was an American citizen and a mother of three.

Noem said that Ross was treated in a hospital for injuries he sustained in the incident and was released soon after. The emergency services logs say he was first taken to a federal building. A DHS official told NBC News earlier this week said that Ross suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the fatal shooting incident.

The officer walked away from the scene unassisted.

First responders removed Good from the scene on the suburban street in Minneapolis. More than 3,000 federal agents are carrying out ongoing operations in the city, federal government figures say, to root out local corruption and arrest people suspected of serious crimes or immigration breaches.

Eyewitness video shows paramedics treating Good on the sidewalk and carrying her away on a stretcher as people on both sides of the road look on.

Medics applied a tourniquet and gave her CPR before she was taken to a local hospital by ambulance, the fire report said. Hospital staff stopped resuscitation efforts at 10:30 a.m, just under an hour after the shooting.

The first 911 calls were received at 9:38 a.m. CT and the agent who fired the fatal shots left the scene at 10:04 a.m., the police report shows.

The 911 call logs include one caller who told dispatchers: “They just shot a lady. Point blank range in her car…. She’s f------ dead.”

Another caller said, “I had to walk away because I have young kids, and ICE is everywhere over there.”

An unidentified 911 caller said, “ICE fired two shots through her windshield into the driver. She tried to drive away but crashed into the nearest vehicle that was parked.”

In one 911 call, which apparently came from a Homeland Security officer who identified himself only as “Philip” and said, “Requesting EMS assistance and local law enforcement.”

“We had officers stuck in a vehicle, and we had agitators on the scene,” Philip continued. The dispatcher asked him for a description of the shooter, but he said: “No, I don’t have any of that stuff, we’re just trying to get assistance (INAUDIBLE).”

Large parts of the 911 call logs have been redacted and blacked out, with the hidden portions labeled “Law Enforcement.”

The police report also noted that “agitators” were cutting crime tape, slashing tires, throwing snow and ice “at federal agents but not at MPD” officers at various points. Border Patrol deployed pepper spray about 20 minutes after the shooting, the police report said.

Bovino ‘not credible’ during recorded testimony

What we know:

The FOX 9 Investigators reviewed hours of depositions, body camera footage and court filings which involve Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino’s conduct and leadership during Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago last fall.

As part of a civil lawsuit filed against DHS, Bovino was questioned under oath during which Judge Sara Ellis described him as ""not credible.""

""Bovino appeared evasive over the three days of his deposition, either providing ‘cute’ responses… or outright lying,"" Judge Ellis said in her written ruling in November.

DHS did not respond to requests for an interview or questions about Bovino.

Who is Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bavino?

The backstory:

Bovino gained notoriety last year when the Trump administration launched its immigration enforcement operations in major cities last year, including Los Angeles and Chicago.

He has since been seen on the ground in Minnesota as the federal government deploys thousands of immigration agents in the state.

Last week, Bovino stood alongside Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as she defended the ICE agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Bovino: ‘All uses of force have been more than exemplary’

Dig deeper:

Videos from Chicago show Bovino deploying tear gas at a crowd of protesters in Chicago despite being told by one of his own agents that it wasn’t necessary.

""If you need to deploy gas, deploy [expletive] gas,"" Bovino said in the video.

During recorded depositions a month later, Bovino admitted that he ""did not give a warning"" prior to deploying tear gas canisters toward the public.

Yet, Bovino insisted during his testimony that ""all uses of force have been more than exemplary.""

Judge Ellis also found Bovino was ""outright lying"" at times during his depositions, including when he was questioned about a video that shows Bovino clearly using physical force against a protester.

Bovino repeatedly denied tackling the man to the ground despite the video showing otherwise.

Bovino 'lied multiple times' about why he deployed tear gas

Why you should care:

On another occasion, the judge found Bovino ""lied multiple times"" about why he deployed tear gas on a crowd in Chicago in October, indicating at first that he was hit in the head by a rock. That claim was echoed by DHS in a social media post.

However, during the three days of testimony, Bovino gave conflicting accounts of why he deployed tear gas.

At one point, Bovino acknowledged that a rock ""did not hit me in the head, but it did almost hit me."" On the final day of testimony, Bovino said he ""was mistaken"" and that he deployed tear gas canisters before a rock was thrown at him.

As Tacoma’s immigration judges failed to change their stance, the nonprofit made several requests to Cartwright, most of which she granted this week.
The Trump administration has appealed Cartwright’s initial ruling on bond hearings to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Yet to be seen: Will an appeals court ruling hold any more sway over the administration than the lower court’s?","In a case affecting hundreds of immigrants held at one of the largest detention centers in the country, a Washington state federal judge expressed frustration with Tacoma Immigration Court’s refusal to abide by a September ruling holding many detained people are entitled to bond hearings and ordered notice be given to them of their rights.

Since the September judgment, more than 100 detained immigrants — “left with no other recourse” — have filed habeas corpus petitions in federal court seeking bond hearings, said U.S. District Court Judge Tiffany Cartwright in her Wednesday ruling. Many more, particularly those without lawyers, may remain detained because they don’t know about the September order and how they can use it to petition U.S. District Court.

A habeas petition alleges someone is being unlawfully imprisoned or, in this case, detained for days, months or years in jail-like conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. Within the 1,575-bed facility (soon to have 1,635 beds) sits an immigration court for those detained there.

This week’s ruling is the latest development in a class-action case that raises separation-of-power questions and tests the ability of courts to limit federal actions under President Donald Trump. In one corner sits a U.S. District Court, which belongs to the independent judicial branch of government. In another, sits an immigration court, part of the executive branch and subject to the authority of the U.S. Department of Justice.

Immigration judges can be fired at will, as demonstrated by dozens of firings last year, including one in Seattle.

The class-action suit involving the Tacoma Immigration Court arose over a practice, beginning in 2022, of denying bond hearings to many immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally, or in legalese “without inspection.” Bonds, like bail in criminal court, allow an individual to remain free while a case is pending.

Espousing a novel legal theory, some of the court’s judges — including now interim U.S. Attorney for Western Washington Neil Floyd — have said such immigrants are subject to mandatory detention under a section of immigration law dealing with “applicants for admission” to the U.S. Immigrants who crossed the border unlawfully at any time in the past still count as applicants for admission, even if they have lived in the U.S. for decades, the Tacoma immigration judges held.

The Trump administration turned that theory into national policy with a Department of Homeland Security memo last July, followed by a September ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals. The board also belongs to the executive branch.

Cartwright in September ruled that the novel legal theory contradicts long-standing practice and common understanding of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Hundreds of other federal courts have ruled similarly, including a California court whose November ruling applies nationally.

Yet, Tacoma’s immigration judges have continued to say they lack jurisdiction to issue bonds in these cases, though sometimes they have stipulated “alternative” bonds they would set if they could.

Floyd, who may not keep his job in the U.S. attorney’s office long due to a seeming move by federal judges to oust him, told The Seattle Times last fall that Cartwright’s September ruling is a nonbinding “advisory opinion.” He pointed out that the so-called “declaratory” ruling does not directly order the government to do something — prohibited in certain class-action immigration cases — but states what the law is as the judge sees it

Cartwright called the notion of her previous ruling as merely advisory flat-out wrong. Quoting case law, she wrote this week: “A declaratory judgment is a real judgment, not just a bit of friendly advice.”

Advertising

And a Congressional law allows a court to take steps to facilitate compliance, according to Matt Adams of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a nonprofit legal advocacy group representing plaintiffs in the class-action suit. As Tacoma’s immigration judges failed to change their stance, the nonprofit made several requests to Cartwright, most of which she granted this week.

She ordered that, within five days of arriving at the Northwest ICE Processing Center, immigrants charged as inadmissible to the U.S. be provided with a notice informing them they may have a right to a bond hearing because of the class-action ruling.

The notice explains that those who could be helped by the ruling include immigrants who were not apprehended upon arrival in the U.S., are not subject to mandatory detention because of certain criminal charges or convictions and are not in expedited removal proceedings that bypass judges.

The notice also says that because the Department of Homeland Security and the Tacoma Immigration Court are not following a federal judge’s ruling, those affected will likely have to file a habeas petition. For help, it refers people to the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

Cartwright additionally ordered the federal government to provide the nonprofit group with a weekly list of people who received the notice, along with their ICE arrest reports.

Adams said the new order would allow his organization to help more people but called it a stopgap measure that is not likely to change the Tacoma Immigration Court’s practice of denying bond hearings. “I think they’ve already dug in their heels, and at this point, they are going to continue to defy the law,” he said.

He added he’s heard reports of immigration courts around the country denying bond hearings despite the national ruling out of California.

The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which lies within the Department of Justice to oversee immigration courts around the country, said it does not comment on litigation-related matters.

The Trump administration has appealed Cartwright’s initial ruling on bond hearings to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 4.

In his lengthy September order, Young ruled the government’s arrest and removal of international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views violated their free speech rights.
He said Noem and Rubio misused their office’s “sweeping powers” to “strike fear” into noncitizens to curb their protected political speech.
“The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the President of the United States have a fearful view of freedom,” Young said.
“A view that defines the freedom here in the United States by who’s excluded.","A Boston federal judge said he was struck by a “breathtaking” conspiracy involving Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to violate international students’ free speech rights as the court outlined a remedy.

Concluding in his view “one of the most important cases” ever heard in the court, Judge William G. Young railed against the cabinet secretaries’ participation in the government’s efforts to target non-citizen students and scholars for their protected pro-Palestine or anti-Israel speech.

“The big problem in this is: It’s that the cabinet secretaries and ostensibly the president of the United States are not honoring the First Amendment,” Young said, extending his review of his findings to the White House.

Young declined to hit the government with a broad injunction, but he said he would issue an order that would give noncitizen members of the academic groups that sued the government a “conclusive presumption” that any change to their immigration status was in retaliation for being involved in the litigation.

The government could overcome that presumption by providing evidence that it had appropriate reason to adjust the immigration status of the person who was a member of the American Association of University Professors or the Middle East Studies Association when it sued in March, the judge said.

In his lengthy September order, Young ruled the government’s arrest and removal of international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views violated their free speech rights. He said Noem and Rubio misused their office’s “sweeping powers” to “strike fear” into noncitizens to curb their protected political speech.

Young indicated he had no interest in an injunction that would have him indefinitely police the government’s conduct and is barred by the US Supreme Court’s limits on universal injunctions from applying the ruling beyond the parties here.

He told Department of Justice lawyer Paul Stone that the proposed order largely aligned with the government’s request for “care and restraint” in ordering any remedy. But the court’s inventive solution didn’t prove sufficient.

Stone said federal immigration law stands as a bar to such an order, which would trample on the system of administrative immigration courts that Congress put in place to adjudicate removals. The Department of Justice lawyer said the government’s position is no remedy should be entered.

Young sharply retorted: “The Secretary of Homeland Security in concert with the Secretary of State, approved by the President of the United States to violate the Constitutional rights of these people and you’re telling me there is no remedy? I respectfully disagree.”

He said the burden the order would put on the government was designed specifically because the “cabinet secretaries have failed in their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution.”

Young, in his 47th year on the bench, opined on what caused the government to end up running an “unconstitutional conspiracy to pick off” noncitizen academics to chill their political speech.

“The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the President of the United States have a fearful view of freedom,” Young said. “A view that defines the freedom here in the United States by who’s excluded. It seems obvious from this record, these high officials for one thing are seeking to exclude everyone. It’s erroneous.”

The judge said he expects to issue the remedies ruling on Jan. 22.

Gavin Newsom said he does not support abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a week after a federal agent fatally shot a woman in Minnesota, sparking mass protests and reigniting a national debate about how to rein in the agency.

“I disagree,” Newsom told conservative pundit Ben Shapiro on a Thursday episode of the “This Is Gavin Newsom” podcast. Shapiro asked if Newsom agreed with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who earlier this week tied the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies to a massive budget increase for ICE: “I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this…You get screwed over to pay a bunch of thugs in the street that are shooting mothers in the face.”

Last week, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good as she drove away from an anti-ICE demonstration in Minneapolis. Federal officials defended the shooting, claiming without evidence that Good was a “domestic terrorist” and had tried to “ram” Ross with her car.

Multiple eyewitnesses, videos, and local and state officials disputed that, and residents have protested as federal agents have continued to pour into the liberal city, conducting traffic stops, detaining people and shooting an additional person after Ross shot and killed Good.

The shooting has sparked questions about whether lawmakers should make it easier to sue ICE agents after they kill someone. Six federal prosecutors resigned after the U.S. Department of Justice directed them to investigate Good’s widow. President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would let him use military troops to quell protests.

In July, Congress passed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” which allocated ICE an extra $75 billion in funding to escalate deportation efforts while cutting federal funds for states that went towards public benefits like health care and food assistance.

Democrats plotting a political comeback in the November midterms have tried to capitalize on the public’s growing negative perception of ICE while avoiding the pitfalls of the unsuccessful “Defund the Police” movement that ignited in 2020 following the death of George Floyd.

Newsom, who has teased a potential run for president in 2028, told Shapiro he supports “comprehensive immigration reform,” but did not offer more specifics, a vague stance he has maintained throughout his political career.

As mayor of San Francisco, Newsom required police to report undocumented children charged with violent crimes to ICE. He later said in 2018 it was a regrettable compromise to protect San Francisco’s sanctuary city status following a high-profile shooting in which Edwin Ramos, an undocumented Salvadoran gang member, shot and killed a family of three after mistaking them for rival gang members.

Newsom says he supports California’s sanctuary status

Newsom told Shapiro he supports maintaining California’s sanctuary status, which means the state does not cooperate with investigations into undocumented residents.

The movement dates back to the 1980s, when cities like Berkeley welcomed Central American asylees fleeing civil wars in countries like El Salvador, where the U.S. supported a military dictatorship.

Newsom cited research showing sanctuary cities are not more violent than non-sanctuary cities: “I think it’s important to establish, because it’s not well established, sanctuary jurisdictions have lower crime rates than non-sanctuary jurisdictions. So this notion that it somehow increases crime is also, I think, contradicted on the basis of the facts.

”He also boasted to Shapiro that California cooperates with ICE to prosecute “dangerous criminals,” and that he has vetoed “multiple” legislative efforts to further limit state cooperation with the agency.

“When it comes to the issues of violent criminals, when it comes to felons, people that are being released from the largest state system in the United States of America, California cooperates,” Newsom said.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/hpzud5/picture308136835/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/PARAMOUNT-3-LA%20(1).jpg,N,,2026-01-16 13:58:57.390610

According to a Minneapolis fire department incident report obtained by the Guardian, along with police records and 911 transcripts, paramedics arrived at the scene at about 9.42am on 7 January and found Good “unresponsive” in the driver’s seat of her car, “with blood on her face and torso”.

The report states that paramedics removed Good from the car and reported that she was “unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity”.

According to the report, paramedics identified two “apparent gunshot wounds” to the right side of her chest, another apparent gunshot wound “to the patient’s left forearm”, and a “possible gunshot wound with protruding tissue on the left side of the patient’s head”. The report also notes that she had “dilated pupils” and blood “discharging” from her left ear.

According to the report, responders moved Good down the block “for a more workable scene, better access for ambulances, and separation from an escalating scene involving law enforcement and bystanders”.

Paramedics began performing chest compressions and applied a tourniquet to Good’s left arm before transporting her to a nearby hospital. The report states that CPR was continued during transport.

Upon arrival at the hospital, the report states that paramedics continued chest compressions while hospital staff “assumed airway and ventilation responsibilities”. According to the report, “resuscitative efforts were discontinued at approximately 10.30am”.

The Guardian also obtained transcripts of multiple 911 calls related to the shooting. Records show that the first call to 911 came in at about 9.38am on 7 January, roughly one minute after the shots were fired.

In one call, a caller told the dispatcher that there were “a bunch of ICE agents on 33rd and Portland, they just shot a lady point-blank range in her car”.

When asked if the woman had been shot, the caller responded: “She’s fuckin’ dead. They fuckin’ shot her.”

Later in the call, the same caller said: “There’s 15 ICE agents and they shot her, like, ’cause she wouldn’t open her car door.”

Another caller reported witnessing “fired shots into a car” and told the dispatcher that “ICE fired shots into her windshield.”

Asked whether anyone had been hit, the caller, who told the dispatcher that they were now across the street, responded: “Yes, bleeding.”

Describing the incident, the caller said: “I saw an ICE officer fired two shots through her windshield into the driver. She tried to drive away but crashed into the nearest vehicle that was parked.

“I saw blood all over the driver, then the partner who was trying to provide assistance,” the caller said.

The dispatcher responded that help was on the way.

A separate 911 call appears to have come from someone who said they were calling on behalf of federal officers at the scene, requesting assistance from EMS and local police.

“We had officers stuck in a vehicle and we had agitators on scene,” the caller said, adding that there had been “shots fired by our locals”.

The caller said that they did not have a description of the shooter, and they were “just trying to get assistance”.

When asked by the operator where they were getting the information from, the caller said it was “from our local joint operation command center”, adding that “the officers on scene are relaying to us to get in contact with you guys”.

The dispatcher told the caller that “we have help on the way”.

The documents viewed by the Guardian also include communications among law enforcement and emergency personnel.

At 9.47am local time, a message read: “NEED CROWD CONTROL AND AREA BLOCKED OFF.”

Three minutes later another message stated, “CROWD NEEDS TO BE MOVED BACK,” followed seconds later by: “CROWD GETTING HOSTILE.”

At 10.04am, roughly 15 minutes after the shooting, messages stated that the “AGENT THAT FIRED IS NO LONGER ON THE SCENE” and “HAS BEEN TRANSPORTED TO FEDERAL BLDG”.

At 10.07am, a message read: “CONTACT WHO IS IN CHARGE OF FEDS AND HAVE THEM LEAVE SCENE.”

At 10.20am, a message described the crowd as “GETTING MORE AGITATED” and, several minutes later, the communications stated that there was a “CROWD OF 20” attempting to “SURROUND OFCRS”.

At 11:01am, the communications stated: “ICE BEING SURROUNDED.”

And then at 11.20, it stated that “ALL ICE AGENTS HAVE LEFT SCENE” and about 18 minutes later it added: “CROWD CALMED DOWN NOW THAT ICE IS GONE.”

Trump administration officials, including Donald Trump himself, have claimed that the agent who shot and killed Good, identified as Jonathan Ross, acted in self-defense, and they have accused Good of trying to “run him over”.

That account of the incident has been widely disputed by local and state leaders in Minnesota as well as by eyewitnesses. Video footage of the shooting appears to show Good’s vehicle turning away from the officer as he opened fire.

Good’s killing has sparked protests in Minneapolis and in other cities across the US. And on Thursday, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota in response to the protests against federal immigration enforcement operation, as Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, a Democrat, urged demonstrators in Minneapolis to be peaceful amid escalating tensions there.

Last week, our country bore witness to the depths of ICE’s cruelty. We saw a masked agent shoot into a vehicle that was driving away, murdering Renee Nicole Good — a mother and American citizen.

This week, here in New Jersey, a high school student in Morristown was doing his family’s laundry when he was taken by masked and armed agents. In the same ICE sweep, a Morristown father was snatched on his way to pick up food for himself and his 6 year old daughter Annabella. His daughter was found walking the streets by herself and crying looking for her father hours later. The following day, ICE agents pulled Warren residents from their cars.

New Jersey has to do more to protect our communities from a rogue immigration enforcement agency that violates people’s constitutional rights. And if we’re looking for a roadmap, we don’t have to look far.

During the first Trump administration, an immigrant rights movement blossomed in New Jersey, finding a strong partner in Governor Phil Murphy. We won 10 pro-immigrant laws in Murphy’s first four years, and we became a state where immigrants could move freely, go to college, get occupational licenses, and have access to a lawyer. Basically, anything a state could do to protect immigrants, we did it, and it made New Jersey a safe and welcoming place for all.

Now, the stakes are even higher, with an emboldened Trump administration and his paramilitary force that shows no regard for the law or basic human rights.

New Jersey is one of the most diverse states in the nation, and immigrants are an essential part of our social and economic fabric. Immigrants make up almost a third of the state’s workforce and bring in billions in tax revenue. More than four out of every ten children in the state have at least one immigrant parent. And as the murder of Renee Nicole Good showed us, immigrant or not, no one is safe when ICE comes into town.

At this moment, families all across New Jersey are feeling the pain of ICE’s attacks. Our state has the most ICE detention beds on the entire East coast, and the Department of Homeland Security is looking to expand into the military base in Fort Dix and a warehouse in Roxbury.

Over 6,000 New Jersey residents have been detained and separated from their families since Trump took office a year ago, held in filthy conditions with no access to adequate food, medical care, legal help, or hope. In 2025 alone, 32 people have died in ICE custody, including Jean Wilson Brutus, who died at Delaney Hall in Newark.

This violence, damage, and destruction will only get worse. The DHS budget will grow to $170 billion this year, which is bigger than most countries’ militaries. ICE is increasingly using AI and surveillance technology to track people through their phones and their license plates. ICE is going door-to-door in neighborhoods, pushing their way into private homes and committing blatant civil rights violations. They are arresting US citizens and immigrants alike without warrants.

ICE cannot be trusted on our streets or in our communities, and New Jersey has to step up.

In his final days as governor, Governor Murphy has the opportunity to do just that. There is a package of immigrant protection bills on the governor’s desk that would keep our communities safe and cement his legacy as a champion for fairness and opportunity for all.

The Safe Communities Act (A6308/S5036) provides guidance to sensitive locations like schools, hospitals, and libraries — creating state level model policies to protect safe access to essential services for all New Jerseyans.

The Privacy Protection Act (A6309/S5037) limits when government agencies can collect immigration status information, and restricts the Motor Vehicle Commission from sharing data with ICE — protecting the privacy of millions of New Jerseyans from federal overreach.

Finally, A6310/S5038, which limits local law enforcement from aiding and abetting ICE’s abuses, would codify and strengthen the protections Governor Murphy himself oversaw seven years ago.

As he did during the first Trump administration, Governor Murphy must once again meet the moment and sign these bills into law. Given the escalating violence at the hands of ICE — and the threats yet to come — there is no other choice.

‘No judicial warrant’

What we know:

U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Bryan found that the arrest of Liberian immigrant Garrison Gibson violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

The judge ordered Gibson's immediate release from ICE custody, as the arrest was conducted without a judicial warrant.

Gibson was arrested last weekend in his north Minneapolis home when armed federal agents used a battering ram to bust open the family’s front door. The agents had only administrative paperwork, not the required judicial warrant to breach private property.

""To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G.’s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant,"" wrote Judge Bryan in his nine-page order. ""This arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. For this independent reason, Garrison G.’s detention is unlawful, and the Court orders his immediate release.""

Arrest caught on camera

The backstory:

Cameras captured the chaotic scene as armed federal agents broke into Gibson's home.

His loved ones streamed the incident live on social media, demanding to see a judicial warrant that would have allowed the entry. But the immigration enforcement officers on scene only presented administrative paperwork.

Gibson's attorneys immediately filed a habeas petition in federal court, leading to the judge's ruling.

Under immigration supervision for 15+ years

Dig deeper:

According to court filings, Gibson is a 38-year-old Liberian citizen, who has a final immigration removal order dating back to 2009.

But he was living under immigration supervision in the United States for more than 15 years with a past drug conviction that has been cleared from his record.

His attorney says Gibson had just checked in with ICE officials approximately two weeks prior to his arrest and had another meeting on the calendar at the end of the month. In his order, Judge Bryan added that Gibson’s compliance with immigration officials included ""submitting to ankle monitoring.""

The other side:

In a statement to the FOX 9 Investigators earlier in the week, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin referred to Gibson as a ""criminal illegal alien from Liberia"" with a lengthy rap sheet that included robbery, drug possession with the intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft. She promised, ""This criminal will remain in ICE custody pending removal,""

However, in his Thursday ruling, Judge Bryan found that ""Garrison G. has no criminal record.""

Gibson released from ICE custoy

What's next:

Judge Bryan gave ICE and the Department of Homeland Security until noon on Friday to release Gibson.

His family says, Gibson had been locked up in the Freeborn County jail in Albert Lea for the last several days. The judge also ruled that Gibson’s legal team is eligible to seek attorney’s fees and costs incurred in fighting for his release under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

It was met with “huge internal concern” by some, one CBS News staffer said.
“I’m no doctor, but internal bleeding is a very broad term and can range in severity,” wrote CBS News senior vice-president David Reiter.
“A bruise is internal bleeding.
“There was big internal dissension about the ‘internal bleeding’ report here last night,” the CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said.","Some CBS News employees expressed concern after the network cited two anonymous “US officials” on Wednesday to report that the ICE officer who fatally shot Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis “suffered internal bleeding to the torso” after the incident.

CBS initially published the account about officer Jonathan Ross on X, formerly Twitter. About 30 minutes later, the network followed up with another post, containing a link to an article by two correspondents that similarly cited “two US officials briefed on his medical condition”.

The report, which was not extensively covered by other news organizations, drew an immediate response on social media from critics who questioned the network’s sourcing – and whether it aligned with the Trump administration’s preferred focus.

But there was also internal skepticism at the network about the report, according to emails viewed by the Guardian. It was met with “huge internal concern” by some, one CBS News staffer said. Others viewed the conversations as standard editorial discussions.

Before the original report was published, a medical producer at the network suggested in an email to colleagues that “it would be helpful to ask what type of treatment he received”, and whether the officer received surgery or any other type of procedure.

In another email, an executive expressed skepticism about the broad nature of the medical diagnosis, and what it actually entailed. “I’m no doctor, but internal bleeding is a very broad term and can range in severity,” wrote CBS News senior vice-president David Reiter.

“A bruise is internal bleeding. But it can also be something serious,” Reiter continued. “We do know that the ICE agent walked away from the incident – we have that on camera.” (The network’s story noted that “videos from the scene showed Ross walking away after the incident”.)

The network’s top editor, Bari Weiss, expressed a high level of interest in the story on an editorial call on Wednesday morning, according to staffers who listened.

“There was big internal dissension about the ‘internal bleeding’ report here last night,” the CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said. “It was viewed as a thinly veiled, anonymous leak by [the Trump administration] to someone who’d carry it online.”

“Felt to many here like we were carrying water for the admin’s justifying of the shooting to keep our access to our sources,” said a second network staffer, who was also not authorized to comment.

In a statement, a CBS News spokesperson said the network “went through its rigorous editorial process and decided it was reportable based on the reporting, the reporters, and the sourcing”.

CBS, which labeled its story as an “exclusive”, was not totally alone on the story. The ABC News live blog published a two-paragraph update repeating the claim and citing “multiple US officials familiar with [Ross’s] medical condition” – but noting that the officials “didn’t provide more details about the medical condition”.

Other news organizations, including NBC News and the New York Times, also made brief mentions of the claim. Fox News, which published a full story, cited a confirmation from the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin – though it acknowledged that “the extent of the bleeding … was not immediately clear”.

The Guardian has not independently confirmed the report.

Since Weiss took over as editor-in-chief in early October, the network has faced accusations of favoritism toward the Trump administration. CBS has been controlled since last year by Paramount Skydance, the media conglomerate heavily bankrolled by the tech billionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a friend of the president.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2f66fbaa8db4492db4d61bc41a9a5c6975bbbab/0_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7dea27b9e854ac35a9713ababba6612",N,,2026-01-16 12:59:18.250298

Rodriguez and his girlfriend, Ale, who declined to give her last name, said the officers gave no warning before firing at them. She said she was hit in the chest with a less-lethal round but was not injured.

“That’s when I started yelling at them,” she said. “I’m like holding a sign that says, ‘Stop kidnapping my neighbors’ and a candle; I am no threat to any of [those] guys.”

She said after getting shot she heard her boyfriend screaming.

The video suggests Rodriguez was struck at the same time that 21-year-old Kaden Rummler was hit in the face. Rodriguez can be heard screaming in the background just as Rummler falls to the ground.

In a statement released by Rummler this week and read by a member of the social justice organization Dare to Struggle, which organized one of the protests that day, he said doctors found pieces of plastic and glass in his skull as well as metal in his stomach lining, and pulled a piece of plastic “the size of a nickel” from his injured eye.

Rummler said a piece of metal got lodged millimeters from his carotid artery, and doctors were unable to remove some of the shrapnel from his skull.

He said the DHS officers did not call paramedics right away and at one point pushed his face into a pool of his own blood.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, played down the injury and denied the allegations in statements to The Times this week.

“This is absurd,” she wrote. “DHS law enforcement took this rioter to the hospital for a cut and he was released that night.”

McLaughlin said “a mob of about 60 rioters threw rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement officers.” She said two officers were injured but did not say how or what their injuries were. She said two people were arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer and disorderly conduct.

“This was a highly coordinated campaign of violence where rioters wielded shields,” she said. “Make no mistake, rioting and assaulting law enforcement is not only dangerous but a crime.”

Videos of Friday’s incident shared on social media do not reflect McLaughlin’s version of events.

In Santa Ana, hundreds gathered that night to protest the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a Minnesota mother of three, and the Trump administration’s mass deportations. Some were there to speak out against police brutality in general. Protesters marched in the downtown area chanting, “ICE out of O.C.,” and held up signs that read, “No more raids, keep families together” and “Stop the deportations.”

An earlier protest started at 3 p.m. and was organized by Dare to Struggle, according to Connor Atwood, a member of the group. Atwood, who was present, said the scene turned chaotic as the protest began to wind down and the crowd dwindled.

One video shows demonstrators throwing orange traffic cones at the federal officers, who were standing guard outside the entrance to the Santa Ana federal building.

Rodriguez, his girlfriend and other demonstrators said the cones never came close to hitting the officers. They said there were no bottles or rocks thrown and they saw no one holding shields.

A spokesperson for the Santa Ana Police Department said the only physical confrontation by protesters they were aware of that night was the tossing of orange cones at the federal officers.

The video cuts to three DHS officers approaching the group before one tries to take a young person — identified by friends as Skye Jones — into custody, prompting at least three demonstrators to try to intervene. As one officer struggles to apprehend Jones, two others fire less-lethal rounds at the crowd, hitting one woman in the leg and Rummler in the face.

The video shows Rummler dropping to the ground, holding his face as the crowd retreats. An officer then drags him by the hood of his jacket. Rummler appears to be choking, grasping at the jacket around his neck as blood pours from his left eye.

The clash outside of the federal building is part of a number of controversial confrontations that sparked nationwide protests and raised concerns about the use of violence by federal immigration agents.

Santa Ana Mayor Pro Tem Benjamin Vazquez said he was troubled by what took place outside of the federal building on Jan. 9 and called the federal officers’ actions “deplorable.”

“Shooting any kind of projectile into somebody’s face could lead to death,” he said.

Vazquez said it appears the agents did not try to de-escalate the situation or attempt to go inside the building where it would have been safer.

“The building is a fortress, it’s got thick concrete walls,” he said. “It’s clearly built to take on a simple signs, water bottles, even rubber cones.”

“There was no need for them to come out of the building,” he added. “The violence doesn’t match the protests.”

Sitting on his living room couch this week, Rodriguez said doctors told him the projectile that hit him in his eye damaged his iris, cornea and lens. He developed a cataract too.

On a small table, sealed in a Ziploc bag, were pieces of the projectile he suspects he may have been hit with. The pieces appear to be part of a round plastic pellet that was filled with a pinkish powder.

Rodriguez doesn’t know how much of his vision, if any, he’ll be able to get back. He said doctors told him he’ll require surgery to remove the cataract before they can determine that. He said he’s been unable to work or drive.

Rodriguez works at an after-school program in Orange County and supervises third graders. He said he drives a school van to drop students at their homes or stops, but now he may not be able to do that.

The injury has altered his life as a working artist, making it difficult to read, write and paint. He said distinguishing some colors on the palette has been challenging.

“The first day when I tried to paint was frustrating,” he said. “ “I couldn’t distinguish between brown and purple for a little bit.”

Rodriguez said he’s gone through a mix of emotions since the shooting. He hopes he’ll get to thank the man who provided medical care to him before his girlfriend drove him to the hospital. He feels sad that Rummler lost vision in his left eye too. And he said he’s angry that people are being harmed and that their constitutional rights are being violated by federal authorities.

“All of America should be outraged right now, you know, we should all be very upset at minimum,” he said. “Because as far as I’m concerned, I was doing something legitimate and for a legitimate reason, you know, like a civilian was murdered by somebody who seemingly cannot get prosecuted and more than likely won’t get prosecuted, which is why I was out there.

“When I heal up, I’m gonna be back out there, protesting against this, because this makes me sick. This is not the country that I want to live in.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d5f2c5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1586x833+0+241/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F74%2Fbb7ee68645d18d488f104409868a%2F1537835-me-santa-ana-protester-shot-in-face-ajs-04.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:57.485024

On Thursday, Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, the leader of the Gathering Place, an Evangelical Latino congregation in Orlando, said he’s also hearing from his members and other Chaplains that there’s a heavier presence of ICF in communities, along with arrests.

“Detentions have risen,” he said. “(Chaplains) have said, many of those people are immigrants.”

Salguero was joined by a room full of faith leaders from Central Florida, advocating for the safety of immigrants in their communities.

“We call for due process. The human and civil rights of immigrants should be respected. We believe in their human and civil rights. They should do all things with due process,” he said.

The impact of more ICE arrests can best be seen at the Orange County Corrections Department. According to a new report, the average daily population of inmates arrested by ICE without any other local charge, or arrested by another agency, increased by 930% from Dec. 2024 to the end of 2025.

Arrests have increased recently as well, with a 33% increase from November to December.

“They are not criminals. They have not committed a crime other than they got entangled in a very broken immigration system, and they are coming in and being booked into Orange County jail,” said District 1 Commissioner Nicole Wilson, who was present at the Thursday press conference.

Commissioner Wilson noted the uptick in arrests and also repeat bookings made.

“These repeat bookings occur when an inmate is held for 72 hours, transferred to ICE custody, and subsequently returned, because they get to restart that 72-hour hold. So we're essentially being used as a detention facility,” she said.

On Thursday, Democratic Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost posted on social media about reports of increased ICE activity in parts of Orange County, urging residents to remember their rights.

“We’ve also received reports of heavy ice activity at certain hotels in the area, as well,” Frost said. “They have made pretty large hotel reservations in surrounding hotels, as well.”

Central Florida Public Media has not independently verified those claims.

During the gathering on Thursday, Salguero stated that his church has provided information in both English and Spanish on how to respond if there is an immigration action in a sensitive location. He is also advocating for peaceful protests against current ICE policies.

“We do not want to see any replication of what's happened in Minnesota and Chicago and elsewhere,” he said. “For pastors, life is sacred. That means the life of immigrants. The life of law enforcement, but also the quality of life of our community.”

Pastor Sarah Robinson leads the Audubon Park Covenant Church and joined Rev. Salguero and other leaders on Thursday.

“Stepping up and saying loud and clear and definitively, ‘we evangelicals, we see what's going on, and it's not okay.’ That's a really big deal,” she said.

Salguero acknowledged that there is a narrative painted around Evangelicals, suggesting they approve of ICE operations.

DOES THE LAW ALLOW PEOPLE TO SUE ICE AGENTS?

U.S. law makes it very difficult to sue federal agents as individuals. But victims can sue the federal government for compensation when its employees cause financial or bodily injury in the course of their work.

This is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, an exception to a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity which usually shields the federal government from lawsuits.

In a FTCA case, a plaintiff typically alleges a government employee acted negligently or wrongfully.

The statute might apply, for example, if an ICE agent damaged vehicles during an enforcement action. The statute would also allow family members of someone killed by ICE to seek compensation for wrongful death.

Several FTCA cases in the last year have drawn attention to the relatively obscure statute, which allows suits by citizens and non-citizens.

Jessie Fuentes, an elected official in Chicago who was handcuffed by ICE agents last year, recently used the FTCA to seek $100,000 in damages over the incident. That claim is pending.

Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist detained by ICE, and a Venezuelan man sent by U.S. authorities to a Salvadoran megaprison also have brought FTCA claims.

WHAT HURDLES DO THESE CASES FACE?

While the FTCA opens a rare avenue for a lawsuit against the federal government, these claims face limits and obstacles, and legal experts generally consider the law a weak mechanism for addressing government officials' misconduct.

Plaintiffs cannot seek punitive damages and do not have the right to a jury trial. Awards are also capped by the laws of the state where the wrongdoing occurred.

So, compensation can often be much lower than in traditional civil liability cases.

Additionally, the government cannot be held liable for discretionary judgments made by federal employees.

That means the government can defeat a claim by showing federal workers had to make judgment calls rather than follow standard procedures.

The government can also win by convincing a judge that the employee's actions were reasonable. In Good's case, the government would likely argue that the ICE agent who killed her acted in self-defense.

CAN FEDERAL AGENTS BE SUED INDIVIDUALLY?

Federal agents can only be sued individually in very limited circumstances when they violate the U.S. Constitution, and even then, such suits rarely succeed.

In a landmark 1971 case, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Brooklyn man to sue federal agents who searched his home without a warrant.

The court said the man's right to sue the agents for money damages was implied in the U.S. Constitution, even though there was no specific law passed by Congress authorizing such a claim.

That ruling created a type of lawsuit known as a Bivens action, in which federal employees who violate the U.S. Constitution can be sued in their personal capacity and forced to pay monetary damages.

But U.S. courts only recognize Bivens actions in very limited contexts, and in 2022, prohibited such claims against federal border agents conducting immigration enforcement.

Those more recent rulings have made it nearly impossible to sue federal officers like ICE agents in their individual capacity.

WHAT ABOUT CRIMINAL LIABILITY?

The bar against criminal prosecution of federal law enforcement officers such as ICE agents is very high and indictments are rare.

State-level prosecutors can file criminal charges against federal agents under certain circumstances. They would have to show that a federal agent's actions were outside the scope of their official duties, objectively unreasonable or clearly unlawful.

“If there are folks that have been identified [as] being here illegally, I do fully support federal immigration authorities enforcing the law,” added Harrington.

“…there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon.","PORTLAND, Maine — Reactions are mounting across Maine after the mayors of the state’s two largest cities said federal immigration enforcement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could soon increase.

Portland Mayor Mark Dion and Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline announced that ICE may soon expand its presence in their communities, but federal officials and local law enforcement have not confirmed those reports.

The uncertainty has divided opinions among residents and public officials, with some expressing deep concern and others saying they are less worried about what an increased ICE presence might mean for Maine.

Portland resident Lucian Curtis voiced concern about what he’s heard and seen from immigration enforcement actions in other states.

“I think it’s very concerning,” Curtis told NEWS CENTER Maine. ""That sort of presence that they’re trying to muster seems to be at no actual benefit to our community and our economy,” Curtis said.

Not everyone shares those concerns. Republican State Senator Matt Harrington (R‑York) said Maine’s situation is not likely to mirror high‑profile enforcement seen in other states.

“I think we have a lot fewer people,” Harrington said, suggesting that the number of undocumented individuals in Maine is much lower than in other parts of the country.

“If there are folks that have been identified [as] being here illegally, I do fully support federal immigration authorities enforcing the law,” added Harrington.

“…Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods,” Dion’s statement read.

In Lewiston, Sheline urged residents and local businesses to understand their rights and prepare for possible encounters with ICE.

“…there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon. I urge residents and businesses to know their rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops them…” Sheline wrote.

The mayors’ announcements came the day after President Donald Trump referenced Maine’s Somali population in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, saying fraud is “going on in Maine, too.”

“He was like a father figure to me,” Michael said of his uncle. “My parents split up at a really early age of my life. I was a baby, so I didn’t get to see my two parents together, and my dad really wasn’t in my life, right? So [Parady] was the one that connected me to that side of my family.”

Parady La would drive two hours to Michael’s home in Allentown and bring him back to Philadelphia during Michael’s summer vacation. There, Michael recalled that his uncle would give him and other kids money for ice cream when the Mister Softee truck came by.

“He always put himself aside and looked out for his family,” Michael said.

Michael and Parady La’s other family members, friends and loved ones are mourning his loss and celebrating his life at a memorial service in Upper Darby on Friday, even as they push for information about the circumstances that led to the 46-year-old’s death last week.

Michael started a GoFundMe for the family to help pay for funeral expenses and support Parady La’s 23-year-old daughter, Jazmine La. Donations will also go toward the family’s efforts to pursue legal action against ICE and Federal Detention Center Philadelphia.

What happened to Parady La?

According to Michael, on Jan. 6, Parady La asked his cousin if she needed anything from the grocery store. Hours later, family members found his car, empty, parked by the side of the road a half-mile away. Parady La called later that day and informed his family that ICE agents had pulled him over and asked for his ID, and then detained him.

Michael, who lives in Florida, said his cousin called him at 3:30 p.m. on Jan. 8 and told him Parady La was in the hospital, and was brain dead.

“One thing is huge, is that your family member, who’s been here their whole life … that he’s being sent to a country he’s never been to before,” he said. “So we’re dealing with that in 24 hours, and a little after 24 hours, we hear that he’s in the hospital, brain dead. So it’s just shocking and really confusing on top of that.”

According to a Jan. 10 statement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Parady La was “receiving treatment for severe drug withdrawal” while in detention at FDC Philadelphia. On Jan. 7, the statement reads, Parady “was found unresponsive in his cell.” The statement said that FDC officers administered CPR and several doses of NARCAN and called for medical assistance.

Parady La was admitted to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital that evening in critical condition, and pronounced dead the morning of Jan. 9, ICE officials said.

For Michael and Parady La’s family, ICE’s account “didn’t add up.”

Michael, who flew into Philadelphia hours after his uncle passed away, said his family’s understanding is that Parady La informed officers that he was going through fentanyl withdrawal soon after he was detained. They’re questioning why NARCAN, which is used for opioid overdoses, was administered to Parady La when he was experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

“As we keep fighting for information, we’re finding out that there’s like levels of information that just become locked, you know?” he said. “We’re still fighting for answers and still trying to figure out what’s going on.”

Michael said his family now has a legal team and is going to pursue legal action against FDC Philadelphia and ICE.

“This fight isn’t about deportation,” Michael said. “It’s about the care that each and every person needs when they are in custody, whether it is in ICE custody, FDC, or, you know, a different federal agency … If you bring somebody in your home, I feel like it’s your duty to make sure that they’re cared for in your home.”

Shut Down Detention Campaign, a coalition of organizations and individuals fighting to end immigrant detention, said in a press statement that Parady La’s death was “completely preventable and is a direct result of egregious medical neglect.” According to the group, “several sources” said that Parady La “told staff he was going through fentanyl withdrawal and repeatedly requested care after vomiting several times throughout January 6th.”

In its statement about Parady La’s death, ICE said it “is committed to ensuring that all those in custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.”

“Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay … At no time during detention is a detained alien denied emergency care,” the statement reads.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/parady-la-ice-death.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 13:59:40.105892

I am in the passenger seat of a stranger’s car in Minneapolis, four days after Renee Nicole Good was killed here. I’m riding with someone who was doing the same kind of work we think Good was doing when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot her. Right now, our work is much quieter. We’re driving in loose loops when a volunteer who is patrolling the streets as a pedestrian observer on the Signal call we’re listening to—a broad network of thousands of locals relaying up-to-the-moment intel on ICE activity—reports two vehicles near Karmel Mall, known locally as “Somali Mall.” Another volunteer fulfilling the role of dispatcher, also on the call, identifies them by make and model. Another observer cross-references the license plates against a running database. They’re confirmed as ICE vehicles, unmarked like they almost always are.

My guide for the day, who I’ll call C, sits up. “They’re going to come past us right here,” they say, accelerating toward the intersection.

Within seconds we spot them: two SUVs moving faster than the flow of traffic. Through their windows, I can see silhouettes of men with heavy Kevlar high on the neck, faces covered, sunglasses.

C begins calling out every turn, street, and direction the SUVs take—while laying on their car horn hard and continuously, like an alarm. The sound is constant and blunt. It could easily be mistaken for an expression of anger, but watching how others in the area—pedestrians, other drivers—react, it’s a signal: a warning to anyone within earshot that ICE is moving through the neighborhood. It turns what ICE hoped would be a discreet operation into a public event. One pedestrian we pass hears the horn, turns, and gives the ICE vehicles the finger.

The SUVs accelerate. We follow closely, C still honking, still relaying their movements. Then they turn onto a familiar street.

“This is my street,” C says. Their posture changes. They look at me. “Can you record this?”

At the next stop sign, the vehicles split. One SUV pauses, blocking our path, allowing the other to pull away, surging into the intersection, cutting ahead of an uninvolved civilian car, using it as a moving barrier. If C had chased through, we would have been hit broadside: “They have absolutely no respect for traffic laws.” That first SUV is gone.

“They sometimes travel in pairs,” C tells me. “You can’t follow both. They’ll break and try to shake anyone observing.”

The remaining ICE vehicle, a Wagoneer, continues through the block. C keeps honking, keeps calling turns. We circle again. “They’re letting me pass my house again,” they report into Signal.

Then: “They’re stopped in front of my house.”

The first thing I noticed when I got to Minneapolis last weekend was the new language. For example: The work C was doing has a name—“commuting”—a deliberately mundane term for pursuing, tailing, and deliberately irritating ICE agents moving through the city in unmarked cars.

As C scans windshields, front seats, and license plates, they tell me about a recent incident near their home. “Three blocks from my house, an unmarked vehicle with four agents in it roll up and just grab a guy off the sidewalk who was walking,” they said. “They violently shoved him into their car.” Their voice trembles as they describe the incident, one they managed to film, hoping that footage might be useful later. “They just snatched him.”

That verb—snatched—is another example of the new language. So is “abduction.” Both are meant to describe the force, speed, and chaos with which ICE is removing people from their city. People are taken before anyone nearby understands what’s happening.

It’s a mistake to think that this transformation started after Good’s killing. The ICE raids intensified in Minneapolis in early December, and the Signal network C volunteers in has been active since then. Minneapolis had already been in an ongoing battle between ICE and the local residents for months when Good was killed.

Her death also occurred just a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police in 2020, an area now dubbed George Floyd Square. The past five years taught this city what it looks like when official accounts collide with video evidence, with witness testimony, with what residents say they watched happen with their own eyes. People I met kept describing this as a reason the infrastructure exists at all: not as a guarantee of safety, but as a way to create a record.

Now, in this frozen tundra of a city, in a state best known for its enduring Midwestern niceness, residents of Minnesota are doubling down.

Since Dec. 1, growth in these networks had been steady. After Renee Good was killed, it exploded. Volunteer residents told me that up until the shooting, roughly 20 people would join every day. Now, it’s hundreds.

I came to Minneapolis to understand what it looks like when a city organizes not around a single protest or flashpoint, but around a daily pattern of federal enforcement that residents describe as their new normal. People kept telling me the same thing: The city has a new infrastructure now, mostly invisible unless you’re inside it. C offered to show me what that looks like in real time.

“When I started in early December,” C tells me, “it was not at all guaranteed to see an ICE agent during patrols.” They pause. “Now I see anywhere from one to upwards of 20 if I’m out for even an hour.”

That morning, C picked me up near the intersection where Good was shot and killed. Like George Floyd Square, the response here had been immediate and spatial. In the first days after her death, neighbors used debris to block the roads, closing the intersection in every direction. For a brief window, the intersection functioned the way so many Minneapolis corners have learned to function: part memorial, part staging ground—an assertion that something had happened here and could not simply be folded back into normal traffic patterns.

By the time I arrived on Saturday morning, the barricades were gone. Traffic had resumed. The memorial had been compressed into the parking lane of the one-way street, clustered near where Good’s SUV had crashed into a parked car. Flowers lined the curb. Candles flickered in the cold. Handwritten signs were fixed to fences and utility poles. The street felt reopened but not reset.

Nearby, a small group of friends arrived together, standing shoulder to shoulder as they took in the memorial. One of them, Kylie, told me she’s still in shock. “On our way here, we watched ICE take somebody from their home. Like 30 minutes ago. They broke her window and took her out of her house.”

That mourners could witness such actions so close to the scene of Good’s death is as useful an indication as any about how things are going in Minneapolis. By most accounts, tensions have only continued to ratchet higher. I flew home on Monday, and on Wednesday another altercation between ICE, a Venezuelan man, and two civilians attempting to prevent the agents from arresting the man resulted in ICE shooting the man they were attempting to arrest in the leg. The two civilians were reportedly “armed” with a snow shovel and a broom, and the incident is being held up as the reason Donald Trump is now floating using the Insurrection Act to enter the city. Meanwhile, Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general, told residents to continue to report possible rights violations and other incidents involving federal law enforcement. People I spoke to described the escalation as cause to organize even harder.

That effort continues to be diffuse. The way anonymity is central to how this work functions makes it hard to know specifically who Good was collaborating with when she was killed. The volunteer network is also extremely local and largely homegrown, built by neighbors organizing block by block with the families who live next door. Their stories said a lot about how someone like Good may have gotten involved.

Nick is a local father in South Minneapolis. He’s also an admin in one of the neighborhood-level Signal networks that routes ICE sightings into local response. He told me that he got involved around Dec. 1, when ICE activity in his area started to feel constant. “That was the day that it really sort of got out of hand,” he told me. That day, he said, a neighbor was taken. Then ICE returned. Then they returned again. “When they came back for a third time, we were organized. We were out there watching, whistling. … It’s been like that ever since.”

He ended up on the helm of his particular neighborhood’s efforts largely by default. “I guess I’m very online,” he told me. “I know how to do some technical stuff. So I just kind of took over as one of the admins.” His chat has become an invaluable tool for locals who want to track and observe ICE. Volunteers cross-check license plates against a database of confirmed ICE vehicles, dispatchers track ICE activity, observers patrolling on foot or in vehicles give up-to-the-moment information of ICE whereabouts. He wanted one thing understood immediately: This is not a professional operation. “It is just ordinary people that are doing this,” he said. “This isn’t fun. It’s middle-aged parents who would rather be playing with their kids at home.”

Nick also wasn’t keen on comparing this moment to how he experienced the uprising that followed the killing of George Floyd. He said the two are different in that that was a single instance, and now they see videos of inhumane treatment and police brutality dozens of times a day in their neighborhoods.

Back in the car with C, as we drive in more slow loops, they give me a tour of the city they call home, and clearly love. But in almost in the same breath, they point out places that have become markers in this new geography of enforcement.

“That fish-and-chicken spot,” they say, gesturing, “that’s where [ICE] were initially staging.”

The Signal call runs constantly in the background. The cadence of volunteers is efficient and clipped. C describes what they look for: SUVs and pickups parked in alleys; heavily tinted windows; out-of-state plates; erratic driving; the outline of tactical vests and sunglasses. It has become reflexive, they say, to glance into nearly every vehicle.

Even while so much of the action seems like it is being done car-to-car, people kept telling me the system is bigger than patrols. Volunteers are doing everything they can to keep vulnerable residents from having to be anywhere ICE might be. This means doing things like getting anyone who is trying to avoid ICE’s scrutiny rides, child care, groceries. To understand this part of the work, people told me, I should talk to Anna, who is running one such effort called Neighbors Helping Neighbors.

Anna talked the way people do when they’ve been in crisis mode for too long: fast, specific, typing into her phone without interrupting. In her telling, the last two months didn’t introduce a new fear so much as spread it—turning what many immigrant neighbors have lived with for years into a shared civic atmosphere.

Her days now revolve around a simple system: a form for volunteers, another form for neighbors asking for help. “On average, I would say a week ago we were getting three to five a day,” she said. “Last night from 3 p.m. to this morning we’ve received 51.” The requests were spreading outward into the suburbs—“Farmington … Roseville, Inver Grove Heights, Eden Prairie”—and it’s still intensifying.

When I asked where Neighbors Helping Neighbors came from, she described it as improvised and immediate: “We just started brainstorming and I literally just created a Google form and we just shared it on social media and now it has just become a thing.” It stayed informal even as it grew. “People are like, ‘Who can I Venmo?’ ” she said. “And I’m like, ‘You can Venmo me.’ ” Someone would send her a receipt, and she’d reimburse them. “I don’t know who they are,” she said. “And I’m just Venmoing them.”

She talked about it as mutual aid built in real time, held together by trust and speed, and by a kind of local reflex that Minnesota has rehearsed in smaller ways for years—neighbors pushing each other out of snowdrifts, shoveling sidewalks, checking in. “You have to know your neighbors,” she said. “You need to know their names.”

Neighbors are showing up in droves. Organizers told me their Signal chats were maxing out. Trainings are full. Food pantries were being inundated. And even after the horror of Good’s killing, the new volunteers weren’t seasoned activists, they were regular people who finally reached a point where doing nothing felt worse than the risks of doing something.

Jordan Castillo attended his first training at a church in South Minneapolis on the same day Renee Good was killed. He arrived already unsettled. He remembers murmuring “Holy shit” when he got to the packed parking lot. Inside, he estimated there were “probably about 700 people.” He stopped when he walked in. “I was like, whoa. This is a moment. Like, this is history.”

But Good’s killing isn’t the only thing pulling people in—many volunteers are coming to this work after seeing ICE in their own neighborhoods. When I met Burt Muston in a park near his home, he pointed to the local market he described as “a neighborhood staple.” Two people were taken by ICE here. The market closed afterward. “They’ve been closed ever since.” That was the tipping point for him, he said.

Muston is a large white man, and with his beard and dark sunglasses, he could be mistaken for an ICE agent himself. He saw this as an advantage. “As, like, a big white dude … other than if they want to say I’m obstructing justice, they’re not going to really fuck with me,” he told me.

That doesn’t mean he doesn’t take the risks seriously—he referenced footage where an ICE agent told an observer, “Have you not learned your lesson when we kill that lesbian bitch?” He had already made contingency plans. “I’ve actually set up, if I do get detained or something like that, people to come grab my dog to take care of,” he said. Then he waved it off: “I’ll just cross that bridge if I come to it.”

I spoke to another volunteer, who I’ll call M, in a coffee shop at 7 a.m., just before she headed to another shift as a “commuter.” Responding to ICE-watch calls has become part of her routine—she’s been doing it before work, after getting training months ago. “I’m just getting out of bed in the morning and thinking, Maybe I should wake up earlier. Maybe I should leave the house at 6 a.m. so that I can help make sure that there are eyes on the road, eyes on the bus stop or by the schools.”

But the watching goes both ways. As I sit in the car with C after the second ICE vehicle sped off, the remaining Wagoneer idles midblock—right in front of C’s house. The message C took from it was simple: “We know where you live.” C keeps the horn down and raises a middle finger toward the windshield.

Moments later, the Wagoneer accelerates away on an icy stretch, blowing through a row of intersections with stop signs. C follows cautiously, choosing to stop instead, letting the distance span. The Wagoneer disappears. C scans mirrors, side streets, cross traffic. “I think we lost them,” they say.

“I lost it at the light,” they report to the group call. “If anyone’s further east on 31st past I-35 and can get eyes on it …” No one does.",https://compote.slate.com/images/de573e37-75e0-4a11-869d-351d850bcb56.jpeg?width=1560,N,,2026-01-16 11:01:14.903461

The federal government depends on local jails for detention space, and transfers people across the country to local jails that they pay a per diem.
In Kentucky, the increasing use of local jails for immigration detention puts pressure on an already-strained system rife with crowding and other poor, dangerous conditions.","A year in to the Trump presidency, the administration’s mass deportation effort has resulted in a historic high of 68,990 immigrants locked up in detention, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is becoming increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of arrests. Despite mounting public outrage and fear, however, a growing number of local police and jails in Kentucky are entering into agreements and contracts to cooperate with ICE. And Kentucky legislators are proposing ways to further ramp up deportation efforts across the state even as ICE arrests in the state surge and the number of detainees in local jails increases.

State and local governments play a central role in implementing this mass deportation agenda, which includes financial incentives for law enforcement agencies to formally partner with ICE and for jails to rent out beds for detention. In Kentucky, 22 local law enforcement groups have already signed 287(g) agreements and 11 county jails are contracting with ICE to hold detainees. That is an increase of 8 additional law enforcement groups and 2 more county jails just in the last few months. In addition, several bills have already been filed this legislative session that would require local agencies to participate.

States and localities play a key role in administration’s anti-immigrant agenda

During the campaign the Trump administration promised to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history and remove 15 to 20 million undocumented immigrants — a number greater than the 14 million estimated to live in the U.S. The administration is reportedly pressuring ICE to arrest 3,000 immigrants a day and deport a record one million each year.

On its very first day, the administration issued 10 executive orders and proclamations that set in motion a sweeping anti-immigrant policy agenda. The major executive order on immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior, “Protecting the American People From Invasion,” included numerous policies designed to massively increase arrests and deportations, including requiring immigrants without citizenship register with the federal government or be subject to criminal prosecution.

The administration is utilizing state and local law enforcement to carry out its plan. The “Protecting the American People From Invasion” executive order directed DHS to expand 287(g) agreements with state and local law enforcement to mobilize them as partners in enforcing federal immigration law “to the maximum extent permitted by law.” In addition, ICE issued a separate set of standards in July for immigrant detention in facilities that already incarcerate people in state/local custody. These new standards reduced the number of required procedures and oversight compared to dedicated facilities, a strategy to expand immigrant detention in local jails by making it easier to enter into these agreements with ICE.

An April executive order threatened to revoke all federal funding to states and localities deemed to be “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Louisville was on the Department of Justice’s published list of so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions because of a local ordinance preventing the jail from keeping someone in custody at the request of ICE (an “ICE detainer”) for as long as 48 hours after their scheduled release; the mayor later announced a reversal of its policy and Louisville was removed from this list.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBBA), the budget megabill that passed Congress in July, also appropriated $170.7 billion to carry out this anti-immigrant agenda, in addition to $75 billion for the enforcement, surveillance and militarization of borders.

22 Kentucky law enforcement agencies have already signed 287(g) agreements with ICE, three in the first week of the new year, with an additional contract pending

Section 287(g) was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1996, authorizing ICE to give state and local law enforcement officers the authority to enforce federal immigration law. Starting with 9/11, it has been utilized during times of heightened immigration enforcement.

During the first Trump administration, the number of 287(g) agreements nationally jumped from 35 to 150. There were 135 memorandums of understanding (MOUs) on Jan. 20, 2025, which surged to 1,036 October 1 and is now up to 1,318 across 40 states as of Jan. 13, 2026. New financial incentives in the OBBBA have been in effect since October 1 for state and local law enforcement agencies that participate, heightening long-held concerns about racial profiling, violence and other human and civil rights violations in the 287(g) program.

The majority of the agreements are the Task Force Model, which empowers state or local law enforcement to make immigration arrests during routine policing and was discontinued from 2012 until January 2025 due to documented civil rights abuses. As of Sept. 2, 2025, 8,501 Task Force officers had completed training and more than 2,000 additional officers were in training.

There are two other types of 287(g) agreements:

Jail Enforcement Model – Corrections officers are deputized by the federal government to interrogate people about their immigration status.

Warrant Service Officer Model – ICE trains, certifies and authorizes state and local law enforcement officers to serve and execute administrative immigration warrants on people who are in custody in their agency’s jail.

Both the Task Force Model and Jail Enforcement Model have historically required a four-week, in-person training program, while the more-limited Warrant Service Officer Model required just eight hours of training. However, in bringing back the Task Force Model the Trump administration is only requiring a 40-hour online training course, especially concerning given this model is the most aggressive and has a history of abuses.

In Kentucky, there are now 28 287(g) contracts across 22 different agencies, 18 of which are the problematic Task Force Model:

Twelve of the agreements happened after the OBBBA became law, all but two of which were for the Task Force Model. Since we first published this analysis in October of 2025, eight new 287(g) agreements have been entered into, all of which are the Task Force Model, and an additional Task Force Model contract is pending for the McCracken County Sheriff’s Office.

Prior to the OBBBA, local law enforcement agencies partnering with ICE received limited federal funds for expenses like training and IT infrastructure. However, DHS is now fully reimbursing participating agencies for the annual salary and benefits of each trained 287(g) officer; this includes covering overtime up to 25% of their annual salary. In addition, agencies can receive quarterly “performance bonuses”— not dissimilar to a bounty — based on the “successful location” of undocumented immigrants identified by ICE and “overall assistance to further ICE’s mission to defend the homeland.” Agencies that locate 90% to 100% of ICE-identified undocumented immigrants receive $1,000 per eligible task force officer, $750 per eligible task force officer for locating 80% to 89% of ICE-identified undocumented immigrants and $500 for locating 70% to 79%.

There were nearly 2,000 ICE arrests in Kentucky in the first nine months of the new administration, and the arrest rate is increasing

On January 20, 2025 the Department of Homeland Security issued a directive rescinding the Biden administration’s “protected areas policy” that prevented immigration enforcement in places like churches, schools and hospitals. ICE arrests surged nationally following the inauguration, with 32,809 between January 20 and March 10, the equivalent of about 656 arrests per day, compared to 255 each day under the previous administration. After ICE reportedly received orders on May 20 to further intensify their efforts and started targeting workplaces and immigration court, there was a peak of around 30,000 arrests in June 2025 compared to 8,000 in June 2024. That was the highest level since at least 2020 but still far below the goal of 3,000 per day, or roughly 90,000 a month. ICE arrests were lower in July and August but then increased to more than 33,000 in September.

ICE arrest data obtained, processed and made available by the Deportation Data Project, shows that in Kentucky, between Jan. 20, 2025 and Oct. 15, 2025, there were 1,950 ICE arrests. That’s a 32% increase compared to the 1,475 arrests in 2024 during the same period.

According to an analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, the ICE arrest rate in Kentucky was 17.2 per 100,000 residents in the first four months of the Trump administration (Jan. 20 to May 20, 2025) and increased to 25.5 between May 21 and Oct. 15, 2025. During both time periods, 75% of the ICE arrests in Kentucky happened at a jail or other lockup facility and 25% occurred at workplaces, homes, courts or other non-carceral locations in the community.

As can be seen in the map below, jails are the most common location for ICE arrests in the state, especially those occurring outside of Louisville. The data also shows that for the people arrested by ICE in Kentucky between Jan. 20 and Oct. 15, 2025 the most common country of origin is Mexico (832), followed by Guatemala (568) and Honduras (197).

Efforts to drive up the number of arrests have led to the targeting of people with no criminal history (and those convicted of a criminal offense may have been for a minor charge). Immigrants with no criminal convictions are increasingly the largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE.

And ICE arrests alone don’t even capture the full scope of the situation, as illustrated by a May 29 immigration raid in Harlan that was carried out by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) despite being unrelated to drugs.

ICE detention in Kentucky is growing and the total number of people in federal custody in the state’s local jails is at a historic high.

The total number of people detained by ICE was 68,990 on Jan. 8, 2026, up from 39,703 on Jan. 12, 2024, a 74% increase. Yet these staggering numbers only reflect around two-thirds of people detained for immigration reasons as they don’t include those facing criminal prosecution in the custody of U.S. Marshals or the Bureau of Prisons.

Local jails are playing a significant role in the Trump administration’s mass arrest and deportation agenda because in 25 states they are the only facilities available for holding people arrested by ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service. The federal government depends on local jails for detention space, and transfers people across the country to local jails that they pay a per diem. In Kentucky, the increasing use of local jails for immigration detention puts pressure on an already-strained system rife with crowding and other poor, dangerous conditions.

Kentucky’s local jails have a long history of renting jail beds to the federal government because federal per-diem amounts are typically much higher than what the state pays jails to incarcerate people in Kentucky Department of Corrections (DOC) custody. Laurel County and Grayson County even vastly expanded their local jails for the specific purpose of holding more people in federal custody for this reason.

Until recently, these jails primarily held people in the federal criminal system for the U.S. Marshal’s service rather than ICE; however, there is a lot of interplay between the two agencies that is important to understand for getting a full picture of immigration detention in jails. For a person arrested by ICE who is charged with a federal immigration crime, custody is transferred to the U.S. Marshals until the criminal case is resolved, at which time ICE can arrest them again (directly from jail or prison after their case is dismissed or they serve a sentence) and then they re-enter immigration detention.

Kentucky jail data shows a marked increase in the number of people in federal custody in Kentucky jails since the beginning of 2024 — jumping from 1,963 on Jan. 23, 2025 to a historic high of 2,827 on Dec. 24, 2025 — a 44% increase.

Note that the federal custody population number includes immigrants detained by ICE and by the U.S. Marshals for a federal immigration crime (and for 49% of people booked into U.S. Marshals custody in May of 2025, immigration offenses were the reason), as well as people in U.S. Marshals custody who are not immigrants and have federal criminal charges completely unrelated to immigration.

Although it isn’t possible to parse out exactly how many people in federal custody in Kentucky jails are being detained for immigration enforcement reasons, it’s clear the upward trend that started in February is related to the intensification of immigration enforcement happening around the same time.

ICE data analyzed by Relevant Research shows dramatic growth in the number of Kentucky jails contracting with ICE for beds and in the estimated average daily population of these detainees. In 2024, just one local facility in the state, the Boone County Detention Center, had a consistent and significant population of people in ICE custody. On Jan. 21, 2025 the estimated “interval average daily population” (ADP) of ICE detainees in Kentucky jails was 120.5. By Aug. 18, 2025, there were an estimated 915.0 people in ICE custody across nine local jails. In November two additional jails — Christian and Daviess County Detention Centers — started contracting with ICE, and on Dec. 26, 2025, the estimated ADP was up to 1,176.3 across 11 local jails, seven of which consistently hold a significant number of people in ICE custody.

ICE agents have been observed approaching homes and businesses with administrative warrants issued by ICE, which lack the legal weight of a judicial warrant.","“How sad that indigenous people have to prove they are not illegal immigrants,” wrote Cindy Smith in response to a Facebook posting by the Lac Courte Oreilles (LCO) Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.

On Jan. 10, the LCO Tribal Governing Board issued an immediate release that it was “closely monitoring recent events that took place in Minneapolis, and around the country involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Agents.”

Just a few days before, on Wednesday, Jan. 7, a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, was shot and killed in her vehicle by an ICE agent in South Minneapolis.

Over 1,000 ICE agents were in the Twin Cities area as a major campaign that has received national attention to detain and arrest those who had reportedly violated federal immigration laws. The agents not only tracked down those without legal status to reside in the U.S., but also questioned and detained others because of their appearance, such as skin color and accent, whether or not they were legal residents or citizens. Caught up in the crackdown were at least five Native Americans who were detained, including four Oglala Sioux from South Dakota and one from the Red Lake reservation in Minnesota.

Jose Roberto “Beto” Ramirez, a Red Lake descendant, told a reporter for ICT that he was trailed by an SUV and when he parked in a grocery store parking lot, he was dragged out of his vehicle without explanation and detained for several hours. Ramirez said he felt like he had been “kidnapped”. He was subsequently released without any charges.

News reports from the Twin Cities have stated that Native Americans, who are fully U.S. citizens, had been approached by ICE agents regarding their immigration/citizenship status.

In response to Native Americans being stopped by ICE, several Wisconsin tribes issued statements voicing concern over the stops and also offering advice to their members.

“We humbly offer our sincere condolences to all those affected by these incidents,” reads the Lac Courte Oreilles release, which assured members that the Tribal Governing Board “is actively working to ensure our tribe and members are as safe as possible and is reviewing policies to implement access restrictions in areas that are non-public, employee-only, and restricted to ensure our facilities are entitled to every legal protection possible.

“In these unprecedented and uncertain times, it is essential that we remain vigilant and protect one another. We encourage everyone to stand together in solidarity to support each other spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically. The safety and well-being of all tribal members continues to be our highest priority. We will do everything in our power to protect our members, reservation, government buildings, and enterprises.”

Jon Greendeer, president of the Ho-Chunk Nation posted Wednesday, Jan. 14, “My office and social media feeds have been buzzing with concerned tribal members following the recent shooting of an American Citizen by an armed ICE official. Now with the news of alleged door-to-door campaigns, the threat literally hits home.”

Also on Jan. 14, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians posted the following: “The Tribe wants to be clear: we do not support or cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Our priority is the safety, dignity, and protection of our tribal members. We are deeply concerned by reports coming out of Minnesota involving the detention of tribal members, as well as ICE actively being reported in areas near our community. As indigenous people to this land, our identity should never be questioned, challenged, or used as a reason for detention.”

On Jan. 12, the St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians issued a statement on “opposing ICE and affirming tribal sovereignty,” which said, in part, that tribal leaders “strongly oppose the actions and presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) including the targeting of community members, the detention and separation of families, and the ongoing disregard of human rights.”

On Jan. 10, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community alerted members on Facebook that Native Americans “are being caught up in raids and detained.”

Like several of the tribal posts, the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe encourages its members to be prepared for being “stopped, detained and questioned regarding your citizenship.”

Even though tribal members are U.S. citizens, Wisconsin tribal members are being encouraged to carry their tribal, state and federal IDs and even birth certificates.

On Jan. 14, the LCO tribe said it would be issuing ID cards for enrolled members who live off the reservation in the Twin Cities at the Minneapolis American Indian Center Rotunda, and like other tribes, LCO noted that fees are being waived for the ID cards.

On Jan. 11, the Oneida Nation offered detailed guidance if members encountered ICE agents:

“Stay calm and ask for identification.”

“Always carry your Oneida ID.”

“If detained, say ‘I want to speak with an attorney.’”

“Report encounters to Oneida Police Department.”

“At home, keep the door closed and request a judicial warrant.”

Several tribes are notifying members that if the ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, the agents do not have permission to enter their home without consent.

ICE agents have been observed approaching homes and businesses with administrative warrants issued by ICE, which lack the legal weight of a judicial warrant.

Some of the tribes are advising members if ICE comes to their doors without a judicial warrant to not only not open their doors, but also report the presence of the ICE agents to tribal police.

The Ho-Chunk Nation said it will provide its members with door signs for law enforcement that “alert” officers of the “state, tribal and federal citizenship” status of the residents and communicate that “agents may not enter the property without a valid warrant.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/230714-Wisconsin-Examiner-Staff-43-2048x717.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 11:01:19.170704

Under the old district lines, Trump won Kaptur’s district by 7 percentage points, according to NBC News’ Decision Desk.","Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Madison Sheahan on Thursday resigned her post and launched a campaign for Congress in Ohio, jumping into a crowded Republican primary for a seat that became more GOP-friendly after a recent redistricting push.

In a video announcing her campaign launch, Sheahan highlighted her time at ICE and slammed Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the Ohio congresswoman whom she’s aiming to unseat.

“In less than one year at ICE, I’ve stopped more illegal immigration than Marcy Kaptur has in her 43 years in Washington,” Sheahan said in the video. “In Congress, hypocrisy, excuses and failure can earn you a lifetime job, but on my family farm that would put us out of business.”

“Ohio neighborhoods are safer, thanks to President [Donald] Trump and ICE,” Sheahan added later in her video.

Her campaign launch brings the number of Republicans running in the district’s primary — which is slated to take place on May 5 — to more than half a dozen.

The GOP primary field includes state Rep. Josh Williams and Derek Merrin, a former state lawmaker who was the GOP nominee against Kaptur in 2024.

A Kaptur campaign spokesperson said in a statement, “While Republicans from near and far will fight through a messy primary in this district they gerrymandered again just this fall, Congresswoman Kaptur is focused on delivering real results for her constituents. She’s working to lower costs for working families, protect access to affordable health care, and bring transformative investments to Northwest Ohio.”

House Republicans are heading into the election year with a slim majority, compounded by dozens of retirements on both sides of the aisle. Trump has expressed concern in recent days that the GOP could lose control of the House.

“It’s some deep psychological thing, but when you win the presidency, you don’t win the midterms,” Trump told Reuters on Wednesday. Earlier this month, the president told House Republicans in a speech that Democrats would seek to impeach him if they flip control of the chamber.

Ohio’s 9th District is one that Republicans have targeted for several cycles and has consistently been a battleground district.

In 2024, Kaptur beat Merrin in the general election by less than a percentage point while Trump carried the district by a wider margin. The congresswoman is one of a handful of Democrats currently serving in a district that the president won in 2024.

During a wave of partisan redistricting across the country last year, Republicans in Ohio redrew the 9th District’s boundaries to make the seat more favorable for the GOP. Under the old district lines, Trump won Kaptur’s district by 7 percentage points, according to NBC News’ Decision Desk. But under the new district lines, Trump would have won the seat by 11 percentage points.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the race in this year’s midterm elections a “Toss Up.”

In 2024, Trump endorsed Merrin ahead of the GOP primary in this district, helping propel him to victory in a small but competitive primary field. The president has not yet endorsed in this district ahead of this year’s primary election.

In her launch video and her resignation letter Thursday, Sheahan highlighted her work with the Trump administration and her ties to the president.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260115-madison-sheahan-mn-1045-602aa5.jpg",N,,2026-01-16 11:59:18.356411

After nearly three decades in Minnesota, Cecilia Sosa’s parents started a cleaning business together in the last few years and had “flourished”, making connections and friends, she said.
“I am not ready for them to leave,” Cecilia Sosa said.
Each time she hears or sees cars that may belong to immigration agents, she rushes outside to check who they’re after.
“I basically tell everyone here: ‘I couldn’t save my husband, but I could probably save you,’” she said.","Paulo Sosa Garcia and Ramona Cecilia Silva were heading to work in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, on Monday morning when federal immigration agents pulled them over and arrested them. By the next morning, they were detained in El Paso, Texas.

Tomas Martinez Gregorio was driving his wife, Daisy Martinez, and their six-year-old son, Jayren, to a hospital in Brooklyn Park when federal agents pulled them over and took Gregorio. Jayren never made it to his tonsillectomy appointment.

About 3,000 federal agents are either operating in Minnesota or on their way to the region – seeking to arrest immigrants in what the Trump administration said was its largest enforcement operation thus far. More than 2,400 people in Minnesota have been arrested in recent weeks – and many have been swiftly moved to detention centers out of state, or removed from the country.

Some had valid visas and a right to be in the US, according to local leaders who have been responding to constituents affected by the raids and lawyers representing immigrants. The Guardian has confirmed that several refugees with legal status have been arrested in recent days after the Trump administration said it would “re-examine thousands of refugee cases”.

Many have been arrested in their neighborhoods – at home, on their way to work, at department stores and restaurants, outside schools and places of worship.

Their families are grappling with the aftermath.

“I just want for my parents to come back home,” said Cecilia Sosa, the eldest of Sosa Garcia and Silva’s three daughters.

Sosa Garcia and Silva came to the US from Mexico in 1999, and had been in a years-long process to obtain legal residency, according to their daughter. Five days before they were detained, they had been told that their case had been approved to move forward. Now their daughters are instead working to raise funds for lawyers’ fees to get them released from detention – posting a video on TikTok saying they are “living their worst nightmare”, which includes footage of their parents’ car on the side of the road with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicles around it.

After nearly three decades in Minnesota, Cecilia Sosa’s parents started a cleaning business together in the last few years and had “flourished”, making connections and friends, she said. Their youngest daughter is 19, and they helped her with college expenses, and were caregivers for Cecilia Sosa’s grandfather, who just had a brain tumor removed.

Now the daughters have had minimal contact with their parents since 12 January. Sosa Garcia was able to call his daughters’ aunt to inform the family that he and his wife were detained. Silva sent a text message to one of her daughters telling her that she was detained and asked the family to call a lawyer. The couple are now being held separately at Camp East Montana at Fort Bliss, a massive tent facility in El Paso where human rights groups have alleged that detainees face physical abuse and unsafe conditions.

“I am not ready for them to leave,” Cecilia Sosa said. Her nine-year old son, whom her parents were helping her raise, asks frequently about them, she said: “We need them here.”

Daisy Martinez, whose husband, Tomas Martinez Gregorio, was detained on New Year’s Eve, said she has also struggled to explain to her son what happened to his stepfather. “He says every single day: ‘Can we get Tommy back?’ He tells his teacher: ‘Can you please save Tommy?’” she said.

The other night, her son told her he’d dreamed that his stepfather was back – and he was sad to wake up. “It just breaks my heart to hear a six-year-old say that they don’t want to wake up,” Martinez said.

Martinez and Gregorio had been married recently, in November. He is undocumented, from Mexico. Although Martinez is a US citizen, the couple had decided not to apply to adjust Gregorio’s immigration status during the Trump administration because they worried that an application would draw attention to him, and ICE would try to target him for deportation.

As more and more federal immigration agents deployed to the Twin Cities in December, Martinez had worried about Gregorio. Still, they hadn’t expected three cars with ICE agents to corner their vehicle as they were driving to the hospital.

Martinez tried to talk them down – but the agents, who were armed, demanded that Gregorio get out of the car. Video footage that Martinez recorded, reviewed by the Guardian, captured her pleading with them to let Gregorio go, and an agent telling her that her husband had a DUI on his record.

Later, an immigration agent told her that her husband did not in fact have a criminal record – and Daisy said she hasn’t been given a reason for why exactly her family was targeted.

When Martinez tried to chase after her husband, who was being ushered into an agent’s car, several other agents tackled her against the car and pinned her arms behind her, she said.

“And then they left,” she said.

Martinez then noticed her son shaking and screaming in the back seat. She briefly blacked out. When she came to, she called her cousin.

“We were two minutes away from the hospital,” she said. “We never made it to the surgery.”

Panicked, Martinez and her cousin tried to find Gregorio by tracking the location-sharing feature on his phone and realized he had been taken – like many immigrants arrested in the region – to the ICE facility at Fort Snelling, a former military fortification in south Minnesota. After that, he was transferred to a county jail in Sherburne county, a 40-minute drive from the couple’s home.

In the weeks since, she has been scrambling to figure out how to get her husband released – and how to parent and survive without him. He worked in the insulation industry and had made a good salary, allowing Martinez to work part-time and focus on childcare, she said.

Ever since agents tackled her, she said, an old injury on her foot has been acting up, making it difficult for her to walk or stand for long periods. That, combined with insomnia and the trauma of Gregorio’s arrest, has made it difficult for her to do her job as a part-time supervisor for a fast-food chain.

“I’m the child of an immigrant, I’m the wife of an immigrant,” she said. “My son was born in Mexico … so I’m basically the mom of an immigrant,” she said. “And [ICE] made me feel like my citizenship doesn’t matter any more. My social status doesn’t mean anything, my passport doesn’t mean anything.”

Still, she said, she tries to watch out for her friends and neighbors without citizenship. In the past few weeks, she has been making regular runs to the gas station to fill up their cars, making grocery runs for whoever needs it. Each time she hears or sees cars that may belong to immigration agents, she rushes outside to check who they’re after.

Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who illegally entered the U.S. from Venezuela in August 2022, was the target of the ICE operation when he was shot in the leg, according to DHS. He was previously convicted of driving without a license and arrested on two counts of giving a false name to a peace officer.

Officials said he was released by Minnesota authorities before ICE could lodge a detainer against him.

Before the attack, the federal agent was in the process of arresting Sosa-Celis during a routine traffic stop when the illegal immigrant crashed his vehicle into another car and fled.

The private polling suggested a rupturing of the coalition of independent, moderate and minority voters who were key parts of Trump's victory in 2024. Such voters will play a big role in determining whether Republicans keep their slim House majority in November's midterms.

If Republicans lose the House, Trump will head into his final two years in office as a lame duck who, he acknowledges, could face a third impeachment.

Zoom in: To the degree they support a more constrained approach, some advisers are playing to the president's occasional misgivings about the optics of some ICE tactics.

""I wouldn't say he's concerned about the policy,"" a top Trump adviser told Axios. ""He wants deportations. He wants mass deportations. What he doesn't want is what people are seeing. He doesn't like the way it looks. It looks bad, so he's expressed some discomfort at that.""

""... [T]here's the right way to do this. And this doesn't look like the right way to a lot of people.""

Several Republicans in Congress have expressed concern to the White House about how the raids are playing out, according to a person familiar with the discussions.

ICE's aggressive tactics are dominating the news and obscuring the White House's work on cost-of-living issues that congressional Republicans, Trump and his team see as more important.

By the numbers: The internal GOP polling that alarmed some Trump insiders was completed at the end of December, days before an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis.

60% of independent voters and 58% of undecided voters said Trump was ""too focused"" on deporting illegal immigrants, the poll viewed by Trump's team found.

33% said Trump was primarily deporting law-abiding people, as opposed to criminals.

ICE is taking a reputational hit. Two public surveys released this week — one from CNN, another from YouGov — found that most Americans said the agency was making U.S. cities less safe.

Another poll done for the Associated Press after Good's death found that just 38% of Americans now approve of Trump's immigration policies.

The big picture: ICE's tactics are drawing pushback from some prominent Trump supporters. Joe Rogan, who endorsed Trump on the eve of the 2024 election, complained on his show this week about ""militarized groups of people roaming the streets, just showing up with masks on, snatching people up.""

""Are we really going to be the Gestapo?"" he asked. ""'Where's your papers?' Is that what we've come to?""

Friction point: In its push to fulfill Trump's promise of mass deportations, ICE is not getting help from police in ""sanctuary cities"" such as Minneapolis and St. Paul, which ban local authorities from engaging in immigration enforcement.

State and local officials, including Gov. Tim Walz (D), have encouraged peaceful protests.

""You're only seeing chaotic ICE raids in blue sanctuary cities where local officials are fighting against federal law enforcement,"" Vice President Vance said Tuesday on X.

Reality check: Publicly, Trump and the White House continue to back an aggressive immigration approach.

In a Truth Social post Thursday, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota, which, among other things, could lead to him sending in National Guard troops.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are architects of the current effort, and they have Trump's support.

Some Trump allies believe Noem, a former South Dakota governor, is preparing to run for president in 2028 as an immigration hardliner.

After the federal government took an axe to San Francisco Immigration Court in 2025, cutting its bench from 21 judges to four in a matter of months, it’s starting the new year by making that shrinkage permanent. Last week, the Department of Justice told court staff (opens in new tab) it will not renew its lease for offices and courtrooms at 100 Montgomery St. by the end of this year. The announcement was first reported by Mission Local.

The Montgomery Street facility housed 19 of the 21 judges at the start of 2025. Without it, San Francisco Immigration Court will run entirely out of its much smaller space at 630 Sansome St., where Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has offices. ICE officers routinely detain asylum seekers in the halls outside Sansome courtrooms, shuttle them a few feet down a hallway, and disappear them into a holding area. It’s a far quicker and more secretive process than the dozens of ICE detentions at the Montgomery building, which happened in public view on the street out front, leading to some of the past year’s most memorable confrontations between protesters and ICE.

In its internal announcement, the DOJ said all staff at Montgomery Street will be relocated to Concord Immigration Court this year. Several immigration law experts say that if cases are reassigned out of San Francisco, asylum seekers could be robbed of the unique bevy of services the city’s legal aid community provides.

“We‘ve been proud of ourselves as sort of like a model for the rest of the country for how to do large-scale, public-defender-style immigrant defense,” said Jordan Weiner, interim executive director at La Raza Centro Legal. “By shutting down SF immigration court, they’re doing a good job of making it harder for us.”

La Raza Centro Legal is part of the San Francisco Immigrant Legal Defense Collaborative, a group of 16 nonprofit organizations that provide legal support to people facing deportation. The collaborative ended 2025 with a flawless record in helping people detained by ICE at immigration court, winning 100% of habeas corpus cases filed in federal court to get those people released.

The city funds the coalition’s work and requires that nearly all of it take place in San Francisco. It’s unclear if San Francisco will pay for legal services at the Concord court, 25 miles away.

Concord’s court saw six of its 13 judges fired in 2025 and has a backlog of 6,000 cases.

“The judges in that court will now have to deal with a barrage of new cases on top of their already crushing caseloads,” said Shuting Chen, who was fired as anSF immigration judge in December.

What’s next

The culling of immigration judges has been one of the Trump administration’s most successful efforts to remake the federal judiciary to serve his policy objectives. In 2025, more than 125 immigration judges across the U.S. were terminated or accepted buyouts to retire early, shrinking the national judge corps by at least 15%. Courts in blue cities have fared far worse than average. In September, news leaked that the Trump administration planned to backfill the vacancies with 600 military judges. At least one of those military judges has already been fired (opens in new tab) for apparently granting asylum too frequently. In early December, the DOJ posted job openings for “deportation judges.”

The closure of Montgomery Street dashes hopes that any of the newly appointed or hired judges will restock the bench in San Francisco, which had one of the busiest immigration courts in the country.

“The court at Montgomery is an institution and, for many immigrants, the first real contact they have with the justice system in our country,” said Chen. “Its demise is an intangible loss … because the court is a symbol of the rule of law and judicial integrity and independence we’re supposed to have in this country.”

As of September, San Francisco Immigration Court had the nation’s 10th-largest backlog: 120,000 cases. For the thousands of asylum seekers whose judges have been fired, the most that they can do is refresh the DOJ website to see if their cases have been reassigned and when they might get a day in court. Many have received notice that their hearing dates have been pushed to 2029.

“There‘s a reason the Trump administration is trying to shut down the courts,” Weiner said. “Because that’s where you vindicate your rights.”

According to the DOJ’s memo, the Montgomery courts could be vacated as early as this summer, but it’s unclear when or where cases may be reassigned.

Weiner doesn’t think that will matter much in the end. “ I don’t think the administration has any plans for these cases ever to be heard,” Weiner said. “I think they’re going to keep finding ways to cut them off before they get to the final hearing.”",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_2pkhrvtcil08debgtat2vea610/-S1200x630-FPNG,N,,2026-01-16 12:00:07.215609

The changes, expected to come into force 1 March, have prompted widespread questions from readers about how the law could affect them.

The Compass spoke with HSM partner and immigration expert Alastair David to analyse some of the key nuances in the law.

We also consulted Daniel Altneu, a partner at Bedell Cristin, as well as Immigration Minister Michael Myles and Chief Officer Wesley Howell, to help break down what the law might mean for readers and their families.

The key changes and who is most impacted

One of the central changes in the bill is a significantly longer timeline before a person becomes eligible to apply for Caymanian status – 20 years for most people and 15 years for those married to a Caymanian.

Caymanian status brings with it the right to vote, the right to own businesses, and freedom from annual work-permit fees, which, in some professions, can run into tens of thousands of dollars a year. As a result, the changes carry a substantial financial and practical impact for people aspiring to status, as well as for their employers.

Other groups that are likely to feel the impact most quickly include new work-permit holders, who will not be able to change employers during the first two years of employment, and married couples, who face tighter rules around term limits and residency.

Who is covered by the old system?

Currently, the Caymanian Protection Act, while passed, is not scheduled to come into force until 1 March.

The bill includes transitional provisions. Anyone who already holds permanent residence will remain under the old system, meaning they will still become eligible to apply for Caymanian status after 15 years of residency.

“Under the earlier version of the bill, many more people would have been grandfathered in,” said David.

“Under the amended version, that protection largely applies only to people who already hold permanent residence.”

There is greater uncertainty for people who have applied for permanent residence but are still waiting for a decision on their application. If they do not get approval by the time the legislation comes into force, they will likely fall under the new provisions of the law, David believes.

“From what I can see, they will fall under the new system,” David said, noting that the law appears to treat the grant of permanent residency and the commencement date of the legislation, not the application date, as the cut-off point.

In an update published by HSM in a newsletter to clients, the firm wrote, “This amendment will adversely affect at least 600 people who are currently working pursuant to a Permission to Continue Working with pending PR applications if decisions are not given before the CPA comes into effect.”

For work-permit holders, the new job-change restrictions will apply once the act comes into force, so that provision largely impacts new arrivals to Cayman. Ultimately, the regulations will determine what exceptions apply.

Changes from the draft law

Changes to the transitional provisions in the draft act, which were approved by Parliament, have raised created uncertainty to who exactly would be ‘grandfathered’ in with respect to when they could apply for Caymanian status.

The initial draft of the law grandfathered in anyone who has a ‘certificate, permission or exemption’ – which lawyers say could have been interpreted quite broadly. The amended act passed by Parliament much more specifically references anyone who has been ‘granted the right to reside permanently’ in the Cayman Islands.

The finalised act creates a cut-off for the transitional provision to anyone who has legal permanent residence granted at the time the legislation is passed, in the view of two senior local attorneys who analysed the Act.

In simple terms, they say, if someone has a permanent-residence application in motion, that application will be treated under the old law, but a subsequent status application will fall under the new law.

Altneu, a partner at Bedell Cristin law firm, said this was an “unexpected shift” from the draft bill that would primarily impact those waiting for a decision under the permanent residence points system.

“The bill specified that these individuals would be fully grandfathered into the pre-existing pathways to the right to be Caymanian,” he said.

“Even if their applications were granted after commencement of the Caymanian Protection Act, they would have retained their eligibility to apply for the right to be Caymanian on grounds of naturalisation after at least 15 years’ legal and ordinary residence in the islands or at least five years after the receipt of their Certificate of Naturalisation or Registration. However, the act has removed that transitional protection.”

He added, “With pending Permanent Residency Points System applicants currently being scheduled for History and Culture Tests in May 2026, this change could have a meaningful impact on many individuals and families who had previously been reassured by the transitional provisions.”

Chief Officer Wesley Howell said anyone who applied before the act comes into force should still be under the old timelines – even for a future Cayman status application.

He said the transitional provisions were intended to prevent anyone from being disadvantaged.

“We’ve not sought to move the goalpost for anybody that has a legitimate expectation,” he said.

However, both lawyers say that is not what the law currently says, and if that is the intent they believe an amendment would be needed. The sought clarity could also perhaps be addressed by the forthcoming regulations.

A misconception about human rights laws

There is a common misconception that UK or international human-rights laws requires Cayman to offer citizenship after a fixed period of residence. According to David, that is not the case.

“There is no European or UK requirement that Cayman must grant citizenship after a certain period,” he said.

“Extending the timeline from 15 to 20 years is within the government’s margin of appreciation, and is likely to be lawful.”

He noted that the UK itself is currently debating extending its own timelines for long-term residency and citizenship.

Harkening back to the introduction of term limits, Howell said there is an EU provision that covers certain rights, acquired over continuous legal residency, but how that would be interpreted is unclear.

“How long is that piece of string? We don’t know,” he said. “We believe that it’s less than 10 years – that is the whole reason why term limits were introduced in the first place, because there was significant pressure in relation to the persons who had been the islands for decades without having any sort of long-term residency.”

How the changes affect married couples

For a relatively small but significant group of people, one technical change could have a major impact.

Under the existing system, married work-permit holders can benefit from whichever spouse has the longer remaining term limit. The new law reverses that position.

“This is the section that surprised me the most,” David said.

“The changes are punitive for married couples. Where spouses previously benefited from the longer remaining term limit, the new law ties both spouses to the shorter one.”

For example, a worker who might otherwise expect to remain eligible for work permits for nine years could find themselves limited to just three years if they marry a spouse who has already spent longer on the island. The spouse could still rollover or apply for permanent residence, but these are not always viable options for families.

Howell said the aim here is to prevent people racking up years of residency by default or “strategically extended their time limits by entering into marriages or civil partnerships”.

Another significant change removes provisions that previously allowed dependents of permanent residents to remain in Cayman after the death of their spouse.

“The consequence of that could be devastating,” David warned.

For instance, a stay-at-home parent and children could face legal uncertainty – or even removal – following the sudden death of the family’s main permit holder.

“The biggest potential legal challenges relate to marriage provisions and dependent rights,” he said.

The impact on spouses of Caymanians

Spouses of Caymanians will also face longer timelines.

The waiting period to apply for permanent residence increases from one year of marriage to seven years.

They will also be required to submit annual declarations to Workforce Opportunities and Residency Cayman (WORC) during that period.

The impact on people with children

There is one significant change for expatriate families. The minimum salary requirement to have a ‘dependent’ added to a work permit has increased significantly.

A minimum monthly income of $5,000 (up from $3,500) is required to include a single dependent on a work permit. Another $1,000 per month (up from $500) is required for each additional dependent.

So, a family of four, where only one parent works, would require a salary of $7,000 a month – $84,000 per year – to relocate to Cayman, compared with $4,500 a month or $54,000 annually under the previous legislation. A single mother-of-one would now need to earn at least $60,000 annually to bring her child to Cayman.

The thresholds apply for new permits, and there is potential impact for firms trying to attract talent from overseas, especially as a job or work-permit offer would clearly not include work or income for a spouse.

Where it gets complicated for people already in Cayman is on work-permit renewals. Immigration lawyers say they simply don’t know how these would be treated. But the potential scenario arises for people who have worked in Cayman for a number of years and are settled with families, that they may no longer meet the minimum salary requirements to have dependents stay with them when they apply for a new or renewed permit.

The Compass has sought clarity from government on this and are awaiting a response.

The job-hopping ban

The bill introduces a prohibition on work-permit holders changing employers during their first two years in Cayman.

The stated aim is to prevent job-hopping and clamp down on labour-brokerage schemes involving permits for jobs that do not exist.

There is a carve-out allowing workers to change jobs where they can satisfy WORC that there were “prescribed circumstances” leading to the termination of their employment, though those circumstances have not yet been set out in regulations.

“The restriction is not a complete ban,” David said.

“Its legality and fairness will depend on the exceptions written into regulations. If abused workers cannot change jobs, that would create serious problems.”

This will impact new permit holders only, so it doesn’t apply to someone who had a permit issued before the new legislation commences.

ID cards for work-permit holders

The law introduces a new fee for work-permit ID cards, though few details have been published about how the system will operate.

David raised concerns about enforcement.

“As drafted, officials could demand to see a work-permit ID card without reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed,” he said.

“From a civil liberties perspective, that is concerning.”

How the law helps Caymanians

The legislation is explicitly designed to prioritise Caymanians in the labour market. One of the main mechanisms for doing so is economic pressure.

“It will become more expensive to employ expatriates,” David said.

“That may encourage hiring Caymanians, but it will also affect industries where Caymanians are not available.”

Ultimately, he said, the success of the reforms will depend on how they are implemented.

“If, in five years’ time, Caymanians are progressing further and doing better, then that will be good for the country,” he said.

“But that outcome depends on how the law is applied.”

Myles believes it will not be meaningfully more expensive to hire from overseas. When Caymanians are not available, he says, work permits will be granted. As of now, the application fees have been subject to a small increase, but work-permit fees have not gone up.

He agrees that success is also about implementation in tandem with other reforms to improve training and education, and align scholarships with a workforce development plan.",https://caymancompass.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Immigration-reform-1920x1280-1.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 09:59:10.703029

Federal laws require Khalil to challenge his case in immigration court first, the judges said in a 2-1 ruling.
This can mean having the case reviewed by all judges on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, or even the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Trump administration accused the 30-year-old of being a “pro-Hamas sympathizer,” without providing evidence to support the claim.
In September, a U.S. immigration judge denied Khalil’s motion for a waiver preventing his removal from the U.S. and ordered that he be deported to either Algeria or his native Syria.","An appeals court on Thursday overturned a lower court’s decision to release former Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention. While the panel of judges did not rule on the merits of the case, it did state that a judge in New Jersey does not have jurisdiction over it.

Federal laws require Khalil to challenge his case in immigration court first, the judges said in a 2-1 ruling. Then, he can appeal.

“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two. But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct,” judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas said in their ruling. “Because Khalil raises legal questions that a PFR (petition for review) court can meaningfully review later on, the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act) bars him from attacking his detention and removal in a habeas petition.”

Judge Arianna Freeman dissented, writing that “Khalil’s case requires us to tease these strands apart,” and that it can be decided by the district court.

“Khalil says his claims are now-or-never ones because his injuries are ongoing and his rights are ‘being violated, now,’” Freeman wrote. “But his claims raise legal questions challenging the government’s very basis for trying to remove (and thus detaining) him.”

Khalil, in a statement, said the ruling is “deeply disappointing, but it does not break our resolve.”

“The door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line, but it has not closed our commitment to Palestine and to justice and accountability,” he wrote. “I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called the ruling a “vindication of the rule of law and the simple truth that DHS has argued from the beginning: an immigration judge, not a district judge, has the authority to decide if Mr. Khalil should have been released.”

She maintained that the Trump administration “acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil” and said “DHS will work to enforce his lawful removal order.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey said the Trump administration cannot re-detain Khalil until the order officially takes effect, which will not happen while he can still appeal. This can mean having the case reviewed by all judges on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

“The Trump administration violated the Constitution by targeting Mahmoud Khalil, detaining him thousands of miles from home, and retaliating against him for his speech,” Bobby Hodgson, deputy legal director at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said. “Dissent is not grounds for detention or deportation, and we will continue to pursue all legal options to ensure Mahmoud’s rights are vindicated.”

Khalil’s cases

Immigration officials arrested Khalil, a legal resident in the U.S., last March at his apartment in Manhattan. Khalil participated in pro-Palestinian protests and campus encampments at Columbia in 2024.

The Trump administration accused the 30-year-old of being a “pro-Hamas sympathizer,” without providing evidence to support the claim.

In a two-page memo obtained by The Associated Press, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that Khalil could be expelled because of his beliefs, and accused him of antisemitic conduct and participating in disruptive protests. Khalil has denied these allegations of antisemitism, saying that he was criticizing Israel and the United States over what is happening in Gaza, and that the federal government is trying to suppress this speech.

After being detained for more than 100 days, Khalil was released in June when U.S. District Judge Michael E. Farbiarz ruled that it was likely that Rubio’s attempted deportation on foreign policy grounds would be ruled unconstitutional. In a separate order, Farbiarz declared that Khalil was neither a danger nor a flight risk.

Department of Homeland Security officials also alleged Khalil failed to disclose information on his green card application.

In September, a U.S. immigration judge denied Khalil’s motion for a waiver preventing his removal from the U.S. and ordered that he be deported to either Algeria or his native Syria.

Prosecutors have yet to charge Khalil with a crime in either case.

Deportations challenged in court

Four other student activists, Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi, Badar Khan Suri and Yunseo Chung, were similarly accused by the Trump administration of being a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests.

The New York Times reported that these students challenged their own deportations or detainments in separate, individual lawsuits. Those who were detained, the outlet wrote, were later ordered to be released.

Massachusetts Federal District Judge William G. Young ruled in September that the Trump administration chilled these students’ speech with arrests he said were aimed at striking fear to those critical of Israel.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25294548168147_AP_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 12:00:11.683150

Gen. Pam Bondi said in September that “clean voter rolls are the foundation of free and fair elections,” and that the Justice Department was going to ensure that they exist nationwide.
This effort goes far beyond what Congress intended when it passed the underlying legislation,” Carter wrote.","A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit demanding California turn over its voter rolls, calling the request “unprecedented and illegal” and accusing the federal government of trying to “abridge the right of many Americans to cast their ballots.”

U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, a Clinton appointee based in Santa Ana, questioned the Justice Department’s motivations and called its lawsuit demanding voter data from California Secretary of State Shirley Weber not just an overreach into state-run elections, but a threat to American democracy.

“The centralization of this information by the federal government would have a chilling effect on voter registration which would inevitably lead to decreasing voter turnout as voters fear that their information is being used for some inappropriate or unlawful purpose,” Carter wrote. “This risk threatens the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy.”

Carter wrote that the “taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece by piece until there is nothing left,” and that the Justice Department’s lawsuit was “one of these cuts that imperils all Americans.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday.

In a video she posted to the social media platform X earlier Thursday, Assistant Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon — who heads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division — said she was proud of her office’s efforts to “clean up the voter rolls nationally,” including by suing states for their data.

“We are going to touch every single state and finish this project,” she said.

Weber, who is California’s top elections official, said in a written statement that she is “entrusted with ensuring that California’s state election laws are enforced — including state laws that protect the privacy of California’s data.”

“I will continue to uphold my promise to Californians to protect our democracy, and I will continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote,” Weber said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office called the decision another example of “Trump and his administration losing to California” — one day after another court upheld California’s congressional redistricting plan under Proposition 50, which the Trump administration also challenged in court after state voters passed it overwhelmingly in November.

The Justice Department sued Weber in September after she refused to hand over detailed voter information for some 23 million Californians, alleging that she was unlawfully preventing federal authorities from ensuring state compliance with federal voting regulations and safeguarding federal elections against fraud.

It separately sued Weber’s counterparts in various other states who also declined the department’s requests for their states’ voter rolls.

The lawsuit followed an executive order by President Trump in March that purported to require voters to provide proof of citizenship and ordered states to disregard mail ballots not received by election day. It also followed years of allegations by Trump, made without evidence, that voting in California has been hampered by widespread fraud and voting by noncitizens — part of his broader and equally unsupported claim that the 2020 presidental election was stolen from him.

In announcing the lawsuit, Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said in September that “clean voter rolls are the foundation of free and fair elections,” and that the Justice Department was going to ensure that they exist nationwide.

Weber denounced the lawsuit at the time as a “fishing expedition and pretext for partisan policy objectives,” and as “an unprecedented intrusion unsupported by law or any previous practice or policy of the U.S. Department of Justice.”

The Justice Department demanded a “current electronic copy of California’s computerized statewide voter registration list”; lists of “all duplicate registration records in Imperial, Los Angeles, Napa, Nevada, San Bernardino, Siskiyou, and Stanislaus counties”; a “list of all duplicate registrants who were removed from the statewide voter registration list”; and the dates of their removals.

It also demanded a list of all registrations that had been canceled due to voter deaths; an explanation for a recent decline in the recorded number of “inactive” voters in California; and a list of “all registrations, including date of birth, driver’s license number, and last four digits of Social Security Number, that were canceled due to non-citizenship of the registrant.”

Carter, in his ruling Thursday, took particular issue with the Justice Department’s reliance on federal civil rights laws to make its case.

“The Department of Justice seeks to use civil rights legislation which was enacted for an entirely different purpose to amass and retain an unprecedented amount of confidential voter data. This effort goes far beyond what Congress intended when it passed the underlying legislation,” Carter wrote.

Carter wrote that the legislation in question — including Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1960 and the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993 — was passed to defend Black Americans’ voting rights in the face of “persistent voter suppression” and to “combat the effects of discriminatory and unfair registration laws that cheapened the right to vote.”

Carter found that the Justice Department provided “no explanation for why unredacted voter files for millions of Californians, an unprecedented request, was necessary” for the Justice Department to investigate the alleged problems it claims, and that the executive branch simply has no power to demand such data all at once without explanation.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0cb6ef1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3744x1966+0+265/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F50%2F7b%2F83443d6f42119729d7022bcae1d1%2F1502626-pol-me-california-democratic-convention-38-ajs.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:58:54.479496

Reuters reporting highlights the case of Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a Sierra Leonean national, who was deported to Ghana in November and detained before being sent back to her home country, illustrating the human and legal complexities of these removals.

Kuyateh’s Case

Kuyateh, 58, had fled Sierra Leone during the 1991–2002 civil war and lived in the United States for nearly 30 years. After being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July, she applied for protection against deportation, citing fears of torture linked to her father’s political opposition. Although an immigration judge granted her request, she was deported to Ghana in November, where she was held at a hotel for six days before being forcibly sent to Sierra Leone. Video footage of her being dragged to a van went viral, sparking international attention.

Third-Country Deportation Program

Kuyateh was one of more than 30 U.S. deportees sent to Ghana last year under agreements with West African countries. Of those, at least 22 were subsequently repatriated to their home countries despite protections granted in the U.S., according to legal filings and interviews with lawyers representing the migrants. Equatorial Guinea also returned at least three U.S. deportees, many of whom were at risk of persecution, torture, or human rights violations in their countries of origin.

Human rights advocates argue that this practice violates international law prohibiting refoulement, which forbids sending individuals to countries where they face serious harm. Critics contend that third countries are being used to circumvent U.S. and international protections.

U.S. and West African Government Positions

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended the removals, stating that all deportees were “illegal aliens” who had received due process. However, DHS did not address the subsequent repatriations, leaving questions about accountability. Ghana’s government said it only accepts migrants without criminal records and maintains that its actions are grounded in humanitarian principles, though some officials acknowledged that discussions with U.S. authorities included possible concessions related to visas and tariffs. Equatorial Guinea and the countries of origin largely did not respond to requests for comment.

Legal and Humanitarian Concerns

Lawyers and advocates say many deportees had valid protection claims. Some were targeted due to political beliefs, sexual orientation, or gender-based persecution. Video evidence and eyewitness accounts suggest that many were given no opportunity to contest their forced repatriation. U.S. courts have upheld the administration’s authority to deport individuals to third countries while legal challenges proceed, creating concerns over compliance with international human rights norms.

Impact on Migrants

The personal toll on deportees is significant. Kuyateh described being separated from her family in the United States and struggling to rebuild her life after being forcibly returned to Sierra Leone. Another migrant, Diadie Camara from Mauritania, described fear for his safety and the need to go into hiding after being repatriated via Equatorial Guinea and Morocco. Advocates emphasize the psychological and social hardships caused by the deportations, particularly for vulnerable populations with histories of conflict, slavery, or persecution.

Analysis

The use of third-country deportations highlights the tension between domestic immigration enforcement and international human rights obligations. From a realist perspective, the U.S. seeks to expedite removal of unauthorized migrants while minimizing direct responsibility for potential harm. However, this strategy risks undermining legal norms and creating diplomatic friction with host countries. For Ghana and Equatorial Guinea, participation may strengthen ties with the U.S. but exposes them to criticism for facilitating refoulement. The cases illustrate a broader ethical and legal dilemma: managing immigration pressures without violating international law or endangering vulnerable populations.

Home Depot faces criticism for ICE raids in store parking lots

Flock Safety's data used in immigration enforcement investigations

NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A group of Home Depot (HD.N), opens new tab investors is asking the company to review its partnership with surveillance firm Flock Safety and state how its data is used and shared with law enforcement, following reports by an independent media outlet that the vendor's data has been used in Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigations.

Home Depot locations have become hotbeds for ICE arrests, after U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller said the agency should target the home improvement chain, where migrant day laborers are known to gather.

Investors in several companies are increasingly seeking answers to how U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policies and enforcement are affecting company operations and reputation.

Zevin Asset Management, a sustainability-minded investor that owns more than $7 million in Home Depot stock, is leading a shareholder proposal with 17 co-filers asking Home Depot to evaluate and report the risks associated with sharing data with third-party surveillance vendors.

Zevin's proposal comes after a Walmart (WMT.O), opens new tab and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab shareholder asked the retailers for details on how the immigration crackdown is affecting their finances and supply chains, and as protests erupt after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by a U.S. Immigration agent in Minneapolis.

The investor group wants an ""assessment of privacy and civil rights risks, including discrimination or wrongful detention from misuse of customer data,"" according to the proposal seen by Reuters.

""Such practices may expose the Company to financial and legal risks, including potential data breaches and enforcement of evolving state privacy laws,"" shareholders said in the proposal. ""The Company already faces reputational risks stemming from frequent immigration enforcement raids occurring near its stores and heightened public concerns regarding data privacy.""

The company's annual shareholder meeting is expected in May.

Home Depot has faced criticism for ICE raids in its store parking lots, where immigrant day laborers often congregate looking for opportunities to work on construction projects. Some critics have said the company should speak out against the raids, which have prompted protests at some of its stores.

A Home Depot spokesperson said: ""We cannot legally interfere with federal enforcement agencies, including preventing them from coming into our stores and parking lots.""

Like other retailers, Home Depot collects demographic information including age, race, ethnicity and gender from companies that provide services on its behalf for fraud prevention, security and asset protection, according to its website.

The company discloses the information to ""law enforcement, public and government authorities"" that it considers ""reasonably necessary to comply with law, support investigations, and protect the rights and property.""

Home Depot also uses Flock Safety automated license-plate camera readers in its parking lots and in stores. The company does not grant access to its license-plate readers to federal law enforcement, the company spokesperson said. A report by digital publication 404 Media said ICE agents have used Flock Safety's data for immigration enforcement investigations after being sent the data by local law enforcement. Flock Safety does not have contracts with the Department of Homeland Security or its subagencies, including ICE, according to a source familiar with the matter.

The sharing of Flock Safety data by local police departments with ICE creates ""de facto federal surveillance without transparency or consent,"" the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, of which Zevin is a member, said in a letter to Home Depot's board of directors seen by Reuters.

The home improvement chain, which is not notified ahead of ICE enforcement, has advised employees to report immigration raids to the company, according to the spokesperson. The raids are recorded in a centralized database. Home Depot gives employees the option to go home, with pay, when these events occur.

Most of the resolutions, including the one at Home Depot, are nonbinding. A change by U.S. securities regulators could mean fewer such resolutions make it to corporate ballots in 2026. If this one does, the results could show the extent to which investors are worried about the financial implications of Trump's immigration policies.

The impeachment resolution was originally introduced by Congresswoman Robin Kelly (IL-02).

“Enough is enough. Under Secretary Noem, DHS, and ICE have systemically violated the rights and privacy of Americans, terrorized our cities, and obstructed Congress. Real checks and balances are in order, which is why I have signed onto Articles of Impeachment against Secretary Kristi Noem. I will continue to use every tool available to hold this Administration accountable, to demand answers on behalf of the American people, and keep our communities safe,” said Congresswoman Elfreth.

The Constitution gives the U.S. House sole power of impeachment. The three articles of impeachment are:

1. Obstruction of Congress

Secretary Noem violated her constitutional oath and refused to comply with the law that prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from preventing a Member of Congress from entering a DHS facility used to detain undocumented immigrants.

There’s been documentation in which Members of Congress have tried to enter an ICE facility and were denied in Illinois, Texas, Colorado, California, New York, Virginia, and Washington.

2. Violation of Public Trust

Secretary Noem has repeatedly violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution. She’s also broken due process by directing ICE to conduct warrantless arrests and use violence against US citizens and lawful individuals.

During Secretary Noem’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, federal agents used excessive force, in some cases injuring or killing residents. Federal agents used military-style tactics to raid an apartment building in South Shore, detaining U.S. citizens for hours without warrants or reason for arrest. These dangerous actions have continued in cities across the country, including in Minneapolis, where Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed without justification.

3. Self-Dealing

Secretary Noem has misused her position for personal gain while inappropriately using $200 million taxpayer dollars to fund an ad campaign for ICE recruitment. She bypassed the normal competitive bidding process to award a contract to a firm called Strategy Group. Strategy Group was formed just days before the award and is run by the husband of senior DHS official Tricia McClaughlin, a close friend of Secretary Noem.

In the letter to Chairman Mark Amodei (NV-02) and Ranking Member Henry Cuellar (TX-28), the lawmakers cited a growing national pattern of illegal and abusive ICE practices—underscored by the murder of Renee Good—including the use of excessive force, prolonged detention in facilities not designed to hold people, denial of medical care and legal access, and a lack of basic transparency. Congressman Moulton and Congresswoman Ansari also raised serious concerns about ICE’s use of masked agents during civil enforcement actions and numerous examples of ICE detaining U.S. citizens.

“Congress cannot keep writing blank checks to an agency that repeatedly violates the law and actively harms its own citizens,” said Congressman Moulton. “ICE has shown over and over again that it cannot be trusted to follow the law and protect the American people. Until ICE stops harming—and in some cases, killing—U.S. citizens and others in its custody, Congress should not spend another federal dollar on this agency. Our power of the purse is one of the only tools we have left to force accountability, and we need to use it.”

“ICE is a rogue agency that Donald Trump is deploying to terrorize communities,” said Congresswoman Ansari. “We must not approve any additional funding for this Trump militia force that has lost the trust, credibility, and legitimacy in the eyes of the American public. Instead, we need accountability in place for ICE’s abuses, including the assault and murder of people on city streets and in detention facilities. I urge our appropriators to hold ICE and Donald Trump accountable for their crimes.”

Congressman Moulton and Congresswoman Ansari state that they will not vote for a Homeland Security Appropriations bill that does not:

Freeze ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations funding at or below Fiscal Year 2024 enacted levels. No increases above that level should be provided without strict conditions on demonstrated compliance with detention standards, civil rights protections, and transparency requirements.

Prohibit the use of ICE field offices and processing centers for overnight or multi-day detention. Congress should require that all individuals be transferred to compliant detention facilities within a fixed number of hours, with mandatory notification to their attorney of record and an identified family member prior to transfer.

​​Require ICE to issue and enforce a nationwide policy prohibiting the routine use of masks by agents during civil enforcement actions.

Reaffirm and strengthen language guaranteeing immediate access for Members of Congress and designated staff to any DHS facility used to detain or hold individuals, without advance notice or administrative delay.

Require regular public reporting on length of stay in field offices, medical staffing levels, complaints received, and corrective actions taken, disaggregated by facility.

Require ICE to publicly report, on a quarterly basis, all instances in which United States citizens or lawful permanent residents are stopped, detained, questioned, or held by ICE. Reports should include the duration of detention, the asserted basis for the action, how citizenship or lawful status was verified, whether force or restraints were used, and whether the individual was transferred or released.

Condition the obligation or expenditure of funds for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations on the full reinstatement and independent operation of ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility and DHS oversight entities, including the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman. DHS should be required to certify to Congress that these offices are fully staffed, retain independent investigative authority, and may transmit findings directly to Congress without alteration, delay, or political interference.

Ms. López was detained by immigration authorities on Nov. 20 at Boston Logan International Airport.
The Trump administration’s immigration clampdown, which has resulted in thousands of deportations, has at times gone ahead in contradiction of court orders.
Todd Pomerleau, Ms. López’s lawyer, said on CNN that he appreciated that the administration admitted its mistake, and he hoped that would lead to Ms. López’s swift return.
“It’s a rare apology,” Mr. Pomerleau said, but he added that “an apology without a remedy is a hollow apology.”","In a federal court hearing on Tuesday in Massachusetts, the Trump administration acknowledged that it made a mistake when it deported a college student flying home for Thanksgiving.

Any Lucia López Belloza, 19, a freshman at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., was detained at an airport and deported to Honduras in late November after trying to surprise her family with a visit for the holiday.

Despite the administration’s rare admission of error, the government has not moved to drop the case, and it has generally sought maximum authority to detain and deport noncitizens.

Some wrongfully deported migrants were returned to the United States to face further litigation with little fanfare. But in several high-profile cases, such as the expulsion of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, Trump officials have dug in on attempts to carry out deportations even when immigration officials make mistakes.

Ms. López was detained by immigration authorities on Nov. 20 at Boston Logan International Airport. She was flown to Honduras two days later, despite a court order signed on Nov. 21 barring her deportation while her case was still pending.

In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Ms. López said, “I accept their apologies.” She added: “I hope that based on this apology I am able to return back to my studies and also to be home with my parents.”

Since being deported, Ms. López’s family has faced intimidation from immigration authorities. Early last month, agents in three unmarked vehicles appeared at her parents’ home in Austin, Texas. One agent rushed at her father, Francis López, but did not detain him after Mr. López fled into his house and locked the door.

In the court hearing on Tuesday, Richard G. Stearns, a U.S. District Court judge appointed by President Bill Clinton, indicated that he hoped to find a solution so Ms. López could return to the United States and continue her studies.

The Trump administration’s immigration clampdown, which has resulted in thousands of deportations, has at times gone ahead in contradiction of court orders.

In one notable case, more than 200 migrants were flown to El Salvador in March despite a court order demanding that the planes turn back. Mr. Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, was returned in June only to face further detention and deportation threats.

Todd Pomerleau, Ms. López’s lawyer, said on CNN that he appreciated that the administration admitted its mistake, and he hoped that would lead to Ms. López’s swift return.

“It’s a rare apology,” Mr. Pomerleau said, but he added that “an apology without a remedy is a hollow apology.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/08/multimedia/15trump-news-student-deported/15trump-news-student-deported-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 03:58:04.449879

Local leaders chime in after reports of ICE touring south Kansas City locations for possible detention center

After rumors of a possible detention center began swirling in Kansas City this week, federal agents were spotted in south Kansas City on Thursday. KMBC 9 saw Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the area of East 149th Street on Thursday morning. Jackson County Legislator Manny Abarca said on social media that he confirmed they are looking to build what he called a “mega detention facility.” Plans for these possible detention facilities were first reported in the Washington Post. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., first spoke against the possible detention sites, which he said would aim to hold 8,000 immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security reportedly awarded a $29.9 million no-bid contract to an organization to carry out the plan. The DHS has not confirmed reports of these facilities. Cleaver strongly condemned the reported plan, saying it will “degrade our society, divide our communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and stress the civility of our institutions to the point of fracture.” And he is not the only local leader who has expressed disapproval of the detention center, should it come to fruition. Mayor Quinton Lucas said his office was working to verify reports of a potential detention center but that it would work to ensure that “no such facility” comes to the Kansas City area. “I want to reaffirm our city’s commitment to being welcoming and inclusive,” Lucas said in a news release. “Kansas City has always been a place that embraces growth and opportunity, not fear and division. We believe in ensuring that all who live and visit our community feel valued and respected.” On the other hand, some local leaders seem to think that some language and actions involving recent ICE rumors have gone too far. Jackson County Legislator Sean Smith referenced Cleaver’s letter on the reported detention center, saying Cleaver is “stoking fear and insulting federal law enforcement efforts.” “Such actions are inappropriate,” Smith said on social media. “Obstructing, threatening and insulting law enforcement is disgraceful. And elected officials doing so erodes any potential we have for keeping our discourse civil.” Where could this facility be built?Concrete plans for a detention center are not available, and may not exist yet, but one rumored location is an industrial building in the area of the 4000 block of East 149th Street. Port KC issues a statement regarding the site of the former Richards-Gebaur Airbase and its involvement, or lack thereof, in it. “To be clear, the building referenced was built and occupied solely as an advanced logistics and industrial facility. It is wholly owned by a private entity,” Port KC said. Port KC said the building and the land are owned by Platform Ventures, a Kansas City-based real estate company. “Port KC has very limited ability to disallow a sale of the facility,” Port KC continued. “Under no circumstances would Port KC offer any development support to a use that is not consistent with our mission to bring quality industrial and logistics jobs to the community.” Efforts to block the detention center planAfter speaking out against a possible ICE or DHS detention center, Lucas and the City Council approved an ordinance Thursday to block permits and licenses for any pending or future applications to establish non-municipal detention facilities in Kansas City. The five-year moratorium applies to any application for a detention, corrections or carceral facility not owned or operated by the city. This would last through Jan. 15, 2031.

Lawyers Weekly Staff,,,,,https://masslawyersweekly.com/2026/01/15/immigration-habeas-corpus-detention-2/,"Where a habeas corpus petition has been filed, that petition should be denied because the petitioner is subject to a final removal order, so his continued detention is lawful.
That statute requires that an alien be removed within 90 days of their removal order becoming final (‘the removal period’), during which time their detention is mandatory.
What is clear, however, is that petitioner has been subject to a final removal order since at least July, 2023.
The Court agrees and finds petitioner’ s detention lawful under these provisions.
… “Finally, Hernandez Martinez alleges that his continued detention without a bond hearing violates bond regulations found at 8 C.F.R.","Where a habeas corpus petition has been filed, that petition should be denied because the petitioner is subject to a final removal order, so his continued detention is lawful.

“Petitioner claims that he is detained pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1226(a) and is therefore eligible for a bond hearing. He contends that §1225(b)(2), which mandates custody of aliens detained at the border, does not apply to him.

“In this case, petitioner is mistaken. Both §1225 and §1226 are statutory provisions relating to the detention of aliens pending removal proceedings, not those, such as [petitioner Mario Alexis] Hernandez Martinez, who have already been ordered removed. Petitioner is, instead, subject to the provisions §1231, which provides for the custody of aliens with final orders of removal. That statute requires that an alien be removed within 90 days of their removal order becoming final (‘the removal period’), during which time their detention is mandatory. An alien found to be inadmissible under §1182 may be detained beyond the removal period for a reasonable amount of time, §1231(a)(6), but presumably no longer than six months. Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 701 (2001).

“Under the prescribed framework, petitioner’s detention is lawful. It is unclear from the record why or how petitioner was released at the conclusion of his removal proceedings, or if he was ever in custody. What is clear, however, is that petitioner has been subject to a final removal order since at least July, 2023. The government concedes that his removal period has long since lapsed but that, because he is inadmissible under §1182(a)(6)(A)(i) as having been neither admitted nor paroled, he may nonetheless be detained under §1231(a)(6). The Court agrees and finds petitioner’ s detention lawful under these provisions. …

“While petitioner is correct that he is to be afforded due process, he is incorrect that his current detention contravenes that right. As the United States Supreme Court made clear in Zadvydas, detention under §1231(a)(6) is presumed to be constitutionally valid for a period of up to six months. 533 U.S. at 701. Petitioner has been detained for less than two weeks. Such relatively brief detention does not violate his right to due process under the United States Constitution. …

“Finally, Hernandez Martinez alleges that his continued detention without a bond hearing violates bond regulations found at 8 C.F.R. §§236.1, 1236.1 and 1003.19. Again, he is detained pursuant to §1231(a)(6), which does not afford him the right to a bond hearing similar to that of §1226(a). … His custody does not therefore implicate, let alone violate, any such regulations.”
