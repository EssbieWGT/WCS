On Tuesday, District Judge William Smith in Providence, Rhode Island, wrote that the Department of Homeland Security had done precisely what his September 24 ruling forbade when it imposed new immigration-related conditions that states must accept before they may obtain emergency preparedness grants from FEMA.
After Smith’s initial ruling, the administration issued new grant award documents to the states with nearly identical immigration enforcement conditions but with a clause saying they would only become effective if Smith’s ruling was stayed or overturned.
The judge, an appointee of former Republican President George W Bush, blocked the new conditions from being enforced and required the administration to amend the grant award documents by next week.

In his earlier ruling, the judge had struck down conditions the department originally had imposed on grant awards.

At the time, 20 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia had argued the restrictions were designed to coerce them into adhering to the Republican president’s hardline immigration crackdown.

After Smith’s initial ruling, the administration issued new grant award documents to the states with nearly identical immigration enforcement conditions but with a clause saying they would only become effective if Smith’s ruling was stayed or overturned.

Smith said the “fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference” as the administration was again unlawfully forcing the states to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo millions of dollars in funding.

“Defendants’ new condition is not a good faith effort to comply with the order; it is a ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make at the risk of losing critical disaster and other funding already appropriated by Congress,” Smith wrote.

The judge, an appointee of former Republican President George W Bush, blocked the new conditions from being enforced and required the administration to amend the grant award documents by next week.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Senior U.S. District Judge William Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, scolded the government for what he called a “ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make.”

In September, Smith ruled that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is barred from enforcing new requirements that effectively withhold disaster aid from states with so-called “sanctuary” immigration laws.

But despite that order, Smith wrote Tuesday that the department tried to implement a workaround: adding a trigger clause to the FEMA disaster relief grants that would force states to comply with the immigration provisions if the judge’s prior injunction gets overturned on appeal.

“In effect, defendants have done precisely what the memorandum and order forbids, which is requiring plaintiff states to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo the award of DHS grants,” Smith wrote in a three-page ruling. “The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference.”

“No matter how confident defendants may be of their chances on appeal, at present, the contested conditions are unlawful,” the judge added. “Plaintiff states therefore have a right to accept the awards without regard to the contested conditions.”

The states complained earlier this month of potential violations to Smith’s order, writing in a letter to the judge that Homeland Security “copy-pasted the contested conditions” into a new grant term with the trigger clause.

This was “not a good faith effort to comply with the order,” Smith ruled Tuesday. He found that the government’s attempted workaround is indeed a violation of his September order.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.

A batch of Democratic states sued the administration in May, claiming that the government was “hanging a halt in … critical funding over states like a sword of Damocles” by requiring collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get FEMA funds.

In doing so, the states claimed that they were put in the impossible situation of having to choose between emergency readiness and how to best use their local law enforcement. Complying with the government in this case, the states argued, would pull police resources off of crimefighting efforts and onto the government’s immigration agenda.

The requirements also mandate that states end any program that “benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration,” which the states say is a breach of federalism.

“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: Agencies in the executive branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce states into adopting its preferred policies,” the states argue.

Emergency relief is just one of the ways the Trump administration has attempted to get states to comply with its mass deportation agenda, which has been scrutinized by Democratic lawmakers and civil rights leaders as an unlawful affront to the Constitution.

Federal authorities also tried to tie immigration enforcement to transportation funding — another move that prompted a massive lawsuit from a multistate coalition.

“My team and I continue to gather information about the exact details of what happened in Hoffman Estates on Friday — but there is no doubt that the video is real and that it happened here, in my district, on a street I have walked myself,” Krishnamoorthi stated in a media release.

“What that footage appears to show — a child being slammed to the ground by an ICE agent — is indefensible,” he said.

“The Hoffman Estates Police Department has confirmed that ICE agents were present in the department’s parking lot that same day and issued a statement referencing videos circulating about the day’s events.

“Yet instead of providing transparency or clarifying the facts, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security aggressively spread misinformation online, falsely claiming this was an unrelated arrest from over a year ago and miles away in Chicago.

“This continues a disturbing pattern of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security denying the public transparency or accountability while actively spreading politically motivated disinformation.

“The events in Hoffman Estates embody everything that’s wrong with the Trump Administration’s militarized ICE raids: cruelty without accountability, secrecy without oversight, and power without restraint,” Krishnamoorthi said.

“That must end — and I will continue working in Congress to demand the transparency, oversight, and justice the American people deserve.”

Earlier today, Krishnamoorthi traveled to the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, to perform congressional oversight of reported detentions — including of minors — but was once again denied entry by the Trump administration.

The refusal follows a similar incident in June, when Krishnamoorthi and Congressman Jonathan Jackson were turned away from another ICE site in Chicago’s South Loop after attempting to inspect conditions and obtain information about detainees.

“I demanded access to the Broadview ICE facility to perform oversight — as is my right and my duty as a Member of Congress,” Krishnamoorthi stated. “Once again, the Trump administration slammed the door on transparency and accountability. Congress and the American people have every right to see what’s happening behind those walls.”

Krishnamoorthi emphasized that continued obstruction of lawful oversight undermines accountability at a time when federal enforcement actions have intensified under Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump Administration’s mass-deportation campaign targeting Democratic-led cities.

I am writing this week’s newsletter on Thursday, so the usual disclaimers apply if any big news is missing. I usually prefer to ignore the utterances of certain politicians, but it has only been a few days since the last newsletter and I need some content. So I’m afraid that I am going to take a look at what the shadow Justice minister said last week, seemingly while using a judge’s wig as a puppet (??).

In a speech given at what appeared to be a sparsely populated Tory conference last week, the shadow minister continued an attack on judges that has been championed by the right wing press who have been misreporting immigration and asylum appeals since the beginning of the year. He apparently has a list of judges whose views he does not agree with because they are suspected of being pro-migrant, for reasons including previous cases and social media posts. Names have been made public and as a consequence those judges have been placed at risk of far-right violence.

Meanwhile, suspicions are that this recent hit piece was written by a judge, given the access to the bookshelves in Field House. The article acknowledges that the Home Office makes bad decisions, yet concludes that the solution is to get rid of both lawyers and judges. No wonder there is no name attached, as this is an embarrassingly incoherent position. Presumably though, Jenrick would have no issue with any judge holding these views.

On Free Movement, the latest podcast is out for those of you who want to listen to Barry and I discuss all things September. Right at the end I even managed to get Barry to discuss his most (in)famous case.

The Migration Advisory Committee has completed the first stage of its review of the temporary shortage list. Also last week, we finally have our newest Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (and as a consequence are down one Immigration Services Commissioner). We republished our updated briefing on the role.

We also had a few case write ups, with more to come this week. For everything else on Free Movement and elsewhere, read on.

The state’s response revealed nine records requests made about Work Ethic Camp negotiations between Aug. 21 to Sept. 5, including the Examiner’s.
Both Houlden and Gutman said the exceptions allowing government agencies to withhold public records are meant to be narrowly interpreted.
A common obstacle that dissatisfied records requesters face: There is little to no recourse when they believe public records law has been violated.
In comparison to other states, Gutman said Nebraska has far fewer lawsuits challenging public records requests.","LINCOLN — As Nebraska moves forward in converting a McCook state prison into an ICE detention center, concerns grow about the Governor’s Office stonewalling public requests seeking more about what is going on.

By late September, Gov. Jim Pillen’s office had denied at least nine public records requests asking for information about the state’s negotiations with the federal government regarding the McCook Work Ethic Camp, records obtained by the Nebraska Examiner indicate. Additionally, there’s evidence that broader requests on the subject have also been denied, although some state agencies, including the prison system, have released some records.

These denials raised the eyebrows of local activists and legal experts who say they are suspicious that potentially thousands of public records could be withheld under the governor’s justifications. Though there is little evidence of wrongdoing, the lack of information on a subject that involves a state prison and state funds makes some believe the state has something to hide.

“Whether or not they file an open records request, people are calling out for this information and are entitled to understand what their government is doing in their name,” said Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska. “The interest in obscuring that information completely … is really suspect, and the motivation for that needs to be questioned.”

Meanwhile, Nebraska is well underway in transitioning the McCook property into a jail that holds migrant detainees for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said just over 60 of the 180 men the camp typically holds remained housed there as of Oct. 8.

Charlie McPherson, executive director with the McCook Economic Development Corp., said his team is “keeping eyes and ears open for more information,” and hasn’t gotten any fresh info from the city or state. “Just sitting tight.” He said driving by the camp, he noticed fencing work being done.

Talks between state officials and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about the Work Ethic Camp have been going since at least late March, according to documents the government watchdog group Common Cause Nebraska acquired from the Department of Corrections.

News of the plan broke in late August. In early September, Pillen administration staffers revealed in a closed-door briefing that state officials initiated conversations with the federal government regarding the possibility of helping ICE.

At the time, State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington said she was told state leaders expect a written agreement between Nebraska and the federal government to be completed within 60 days.

Though it’s still within the 60-day window, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha said he’s heard from several sources that the state has already signed the contract and is waiting for a federal response. There has been no official confirmation as yet. Homeland Security operations continue during a government shutdown that could limit some ICE actions.

The Nebraska Examiner filed a public records request of its own Sept. 5 for communications between Pillen, his staff, and Homeland Security officials about the deal. The Governor’s Office responded to the request Sept. 18, well past the four-day deadline laid out in statute for how long state agencies have to respond.

In its response, the office denied the request based on four justifications:

The documents requested constitute “proprietary or commercial information.”

The documents requested constitute “negotiation records for the lease or sale of an interest in real property.”

The documents requested constitute “confidential communications.”

Cited a statute outlining the rules for lawyer-client privilege.

The Examiner sent a follow-up request on Sept. 22 seeking how the Governor’s Office responded to related requests from others. The office requested an extension and fulfilled the request on Oct. 8.

The state’s response revealed nine records requests made about Work Ethic Camp negotiations between Aug. 21 to Sept. 5, including the Examiner’s. All were denied, and seven of the nine were denied with virtually identical reasonings — those listed above. The requests were made by a range of individuals, including reporters, private citizens and State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha.

But the state’s justifications for denying the requests are questionable, according to multiple legal experts who spoke with the Examiner, including Houlden and Daniel Gutman, a lawyer who has litigated several public records disputes. Houlden said she believes the exceptions government agencies are granted under law are being applied more broadly than they ought to be.

“(The governor’s office) tends to blur lines when it comes to interpretations,” said Gavin Geis, executive director of Common Cause Nebraska.

Geis argued that the first two justifications treat the dealings between two public bodies — the Nebraska state government and the federal government — as though both are private businesses. Houlden noted the exact language of one of the cited statutes grants an exception for records that would “give advantage to business competitors and serve no public purpose” if they were made public, which makes her believe that the exception should not apply.

Houlden said the second justification contradicts previous public statements state officials have made that Nebraska will continue to own and operate the McCook facility.

Both Houlden and Gutman said the exceptions allowing government agencies to withhold public records are meant to be narrowly interpreted. Though Gutman said this isn’t a legally binding principle, there is a legal obligation for state officials to “understand and apply the exceptions in light of a broader public policy that favors disclosure.”

The Governor’s Office declined an interview for this story but sent a written statement.

“The Governor’s Office has responded to all record requests submitted about WEC and its transition to becoming a federal detention center,” Pillen spokesperson Laura Strimple wrote. “The process followed was the same as for any record request. Records have been provided to each requestor within the scope of law, which also allows for withholding information that meets specific exceptions.”

Gutman equated questionable public records responses to “the chicken or the egg” paradox, because while there is cause to suspect the Governor’s Office is withholding records that should be public, there is no way to know for certain without seeing the records being withheld.

There are legitimate reasons to withhold government records, Gutman said. The question is: Do those reasons apply to the potentially thousands of records that pertain to the WEC negotiations? Gutman said he thinks that’s unlikely.

Nebraska law treats most public documents as public records. According to the Attorney General’s Office, exceptions to the state’s public records statutes include personal information on students, medical records other than about births or deaths, trade secrets, investigatory records, vulnerabilities involving public property, firearms registration information and cybersecurity info.

A common obstacle that dissatisfied records requesters face: There is little to no recourse when they believe public records law has been violated. The main option is suing in Lancaster District Court, which Gutman said at best can take two to three months to resolve, or longer if the state appeals.

The state also recommends requesters petition the Attorney General’s Office for a review if they believe an error was made in their response.

In comparison to other states, Gutman said Nebraska has far fewer lawsuits challenging public records requests.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a vocal critic of the governor and other state agencies, said she believes Pillen’s office is banking on the assumption that most people won’t take them to court.

Cavanaugh acknowledged that hesitation over public records requests is not a problem specific to Pillen’s administration but argued it has gotten worse since he took office. Former governor turned U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., didn’t make the process easy, but he returned requests and allowed room for negotiations, she said.

When reached by the Examiner, McCook City Council members said they agreed to direct all questions on the McCook conversion to Molly Smith, a city spokesperson who did not return calls. McCook Mayor Linda Taylor also did not return calls.

State Sen. David Murman, whose legislative district includes McCook, said he had no fresh update. He supports the project and President Trump’s efforts to secure the border, he said, and believes many of his constituents do also.

Cavanaugh, along with fellow Appropriations Committee member State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, requested that the committee hold a public briefing to better understand the transition process and its financial implications for the state. They were denied by committee chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, who said there will be opportunity to discuss the topic when the Legislature reconvenes in January.

Judiciary Committee Chair State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln also has denied requests for public hearings about the Work Ethic Camp.

The Urban Affairs Committee, chaired by McKinney, held a public hearing in September at the Capitol, which drew a large enough crowd that it required an overflow area. This is part of the “far-reaching consequences” Geis said come with withholding information on matters of high public interest. It limits the opportunities for voters to make informed decisions.

On the flip side, he said, it also keeps voters in the dark about good decisions their government is making. In this way, Geis argued Pillen could benefit from being more forthcoming.

“When they close the door, we can only assume that what’s happening back there is not to our benefit,” Geis said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said its agents use a “minimum amount of force” when making arrests, but every day it seems a new video pops up online that indicates otherwise.

Personally, my social media feed has been a stream of brutal ICE interactions: agents caught on video being both verbally and physically aggressive with the people they are detaining and with bystanders — all while many of them hide behind masks and plainclothes.

In one video, taken outside of an elementary school in Chicago, a group of masked ICE officers can be seen pulling a screaming woman out of her car. Eyewitnesses said she was in line for afternoon school pickup at the time of the incident. In the video, the woman said the agents did not have a warrant and claimed that agents had “forcibly opened” her car door.

Another video taken in Chicago showed masked agents in a white SUV throwing a canister of tear gas onto a pedestrian street near a middle school in broad daylight. Cars can be seen trying to block the unmarked vehicle, which was reportedly headed for a local grocery store. An agent then rolled down his window and threw the tear gas, causing bystanders to disperse.

In Maryland, two ICE officers chased a man into a busy intersection and then tackled him. The man could be heard screaming in Spanish “ayuda,” which means “help.” During the struggle, an agent dropped his handgun and then appeared to point it at bystanders. The Department of Homeland Security said the man being arrested in the video was resisting.

In Chicago, a journalist by the name of Debbie Brockman was forced to the ground and cuffed by three federal agents while she was out reporting. DHS said Brockman was arrested for allegedly assaulting a federal agent. WGN-TV, Brockman’s employer, said she was not charged with any crimes and was ultimately released.

Responding to criticism about its operation, DHS said that “anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest.”

But the tactics seen in these videos are brutal in nature, alarmingly so, and the presence of a rolling camera does not seem to deter ICE agents’ behavior. While many of these videos are difficult to watch, it is also important to bear witness to what is happening to human beings on the streets of America.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251013-velshi-ice-videos-zz-25262a.jpg",N,,2025-10-14 12:56:57.870435

4.3 This instrument also makes minor changes to other policy areas, detailed in paragraphs 5.40 and 5.60 of section 5 of this Explanatory Memorandum.

Where does the legislation extend to, and apply?

4.4 The extent of this Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (that is, the jurisdiction(s) which the statement forms part of the law of) is all of the United Kingdom.

4.5 The territorial application of this Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (that is, where the statement produces a practical effect) is all of the United Kingdom.

5. Policy Context

What is being done and why?

Introduction of a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana

5.1 The changes will introduce a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana, which means that these nationals will need to apply for and obtain a visa prior to visiting the UK.

5.2 Linked to this Botswana will be removed from the list of countries whose nationals are eligible to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA).

5.3 By applying a visit visa requirement and removing eligibility to enter the UK with an ETA, those travelling to visit the UK can be assessed against the requirements of the Immigration Rules in advance of arrival in the UK. This means that their visit visa application will be refused where it is assessed that they do not meet those requirements or issued where it is concluded that they do.

5.4 UK visa requirements are kept under review. There are high numbers of nationals of Botswana who travel to the UK for purposes that are not permitted under the Immigration Rules for visitors. In particular, since 2022 there has been a persistently high number of nationals of Botswana who claim asylum. Between January 2022 and June 2025, 1,332 nationals of Botswana claimed asylum with 642 of these claims made at port. So far in 2025 (January to June), 147 nationals of Botswana have claimed asylum. While the number of people claiming asylum has fluctuated, numbers have remained high throughout this period and all asylum claims place additional resource pressure on the borders and migration system.

5.5 In 2023, 62% of asylum claims were made at the UK border. In 2024, 21% of asylum claims were made at port. All asylum claims made at port add significantly to operational pressure at the border, diverting staff from other priorities.

5.6 The visa national status of Botswana will be kept under review; particularly with regards to whether the visa introduction affects the number of individuals claiming asylum from within the UK.

5.7 The introduction of the visa requirement will include a transition period for nationals of Botswana to travel to the UK without a visa where they hold a confirmed travel booking made prior to the introduction. This period will commence at the same time as the visa requirement is introduced and run until six weeks after the introduction date: 15:00 GMT on 25 November 2025. During this period, nationals of Botswana who hold a confirmed travel booking at the time of the introduction and an ETA, for travel to the UK within the six-week transition period, will not be required to obtain a visit visa before travel. Applications for an ETA for nationals of Botswana will close at 15:00 BST on 14 October 2025. Nationals who hold confirmed bookings for travel to the UK on a date after the transition period ends will need to obtain a visa in advance of travel. Amending the date of travel on a confirmed booking to an earlier date that falls within the transition period would still require the person to have a visa.

5.8 This transition period is designed to prevent operational difficulties, general unfairness, and ensure that people who arranged travel before this announcement do not lose money. The length of the period (six weeks) has been chosen to give those affected enough time to apply for and receive a visa. The current customer service standard processing time for applicants to receive a decision and, if issued, a visitor visa, is three weeks. Further information can be found at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visa-processing-times-applications-outside-the-uk.

5.9 The introduction of a visa requirement will be accompanied by amendments to the Immigration (Passenger Transit Visa) Order 2014, to ensure that nationals of Botswana will require a direct airside transit visa (DATV) when conducting airside transit travel (unless they fall within one of the exceptions set out in Article 4 of the Order). Airside transit passengers are those who do not need to change airports and do not need to pass through the UK border when changing to a connecting flight. If these amendments are not made, nationals of Botswana will be able to travel to the UK purporting to have booked onward travel and instead claim asylum, circumventing the visa requirement. It would also continue to enable nationals to transit through the UK with the intention of travelling to another country to claim asylum.

Recognition of Palestine: changes to the visa national list

5.10 In September 2025, the UK announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine. To deliver this commitment and ensure that the UK maintains the requirement for these nationals to obtain a visa to visit the UK, Palestine is being added to the Immigration Rules Appendix Visitor: Visa National List.

5.11 This change will introduce a visit visa requirement on nationals of Palestine, which means that these nationals will need to apply for and obtain a visa prior to visiting the UK. Whilst the Occupied Palestinian Territory (as formerly known) was not previously included on the Visa National List, its citizens were already subject to a requirement to obtain a visa to visit the UK, either as citizens of the Occupied Palestinian Territory or as stateless individuals in certain cases under existing operational guidance. In respect of the Immigration Rules Appendix Visitor: Visa national list, Palestinian nationals could also previously be considered under section VN 1.1(b) (stateless persons) or VN 1.1(C) (persons travelling on any document other than a national passport).

5.12 By amending legislation to include the newly recognised state of Palestine, those travelling to visit the UK can continue be assessed against the requirements of the Immigration Rules in advance of arrival.

5.13 This is a necessary change to protect the UK’s border and national security and to deliver on the Government’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine.

5.14 The addition of Palestine to the Immigration Rules Appendix visitor: Visa national list will be accompanied by amendments to the Immigration (Passenger Transit Visa) Order 2014, to ensure that Palestinian nationals continue to require a direct airside transit visa (DATV) when conducting airside transit travel (unless they fall within one of the exceptions set out in Article 4 of the Order). Again, this is not a new requirement but ensures continuity and consistency with changes to the Appendix Visitor: Visa national list. Airside transit passengers are those who do not need to change airports and do not need to pass through the UK border when changing to a connecting flight.

German school groups travel: easing travel requirements for German school groups visiting the UK

5.15 Following EU Exit (effective from 1 October 2021), the UK required passports from EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals, as is the case with nationals from the rest of the world. On the same date, the UK ended its acceptance of the List of Travellers scheme, which allowed people studying in an EU Member State to travel within the EU on an organised educational visit without a passport or visa. The requirement to travel on a passport and hold a visa (if a visa national) was viewed by Germany as a significant barrier to German school groups visiting the UK. The changes address this concern.

5.16 This change will allow people aged 19 years and under who are studying at a German school or educational institution, the existence of which is confirmed by the relevant German municipal or competent authority, to come to the UK without an advance permission (an ETA or visa) when they are travelling as part of a school party of five or more. It also allows EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals aged 19 and under who are studying at the school to travel on a national identity card rather than passport. This change mirrors the similar arrangement the UK already has with France and was agreed in the context of the UK-Germany Treaty.

Change to the validity requirements in Appendix Temporary Permission to Stay for Victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery

5.17 The change will correct an inconsistency between the validity criteria of Immigration Rules Appendix Temporary Permission to Stay for Victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery and the caseworker guidance, to accurately reflect that there are two types of application under the route; one via application form FLR (HRO), and one made directly to a relevant competent authority.

Introduction of dependants to Appendix Statelessness

5.18 Changes are being introduced which affect partners and children of a Stateless Person. These include:

A partner or child of a stateless person may apply for entry clearance or permission to stay under Appendix Statelessness from 11 November 2025 where they formed part of the family unit before a stateless person was granted permission to stay. Those applying as a dependant on this route will need to meet the relevant partner or child requirements.

Where a partner or child of a Stateless Person are not themselves stateless and formed part of the family unit after a stateless person was granted permission, they may apply to come to or stay in the UK under the family provisions in Appendix FM. The existing provision in Appendix FM has been amended to reflect this change. Those applying under Appendix FM will need to pay the application fee, or be granted a fee waiver, as well as meet the relevant partner or child requirements.

5.19 As a result of these changes, a minor consequential change has been made to Appendix FM, Appendix Children and Appendix Relationship with Partner.

Changes to English language requirements for economic migration routes

5.20 As set out in the Immigration White Paper (Restoring Control over the Immigration System), we are introducing new requirements for English language in relation to economic migration routes.

5.21 The English language requirement for the Skilled Worker, High Potential Individual and Scale-up routes is increased from B1 Level to B2 Level (as defined under the Common European Framework for Reference for Languages (CEFR)).

5.22 The new requirements will apply to those seeking an initial grant of leave in a relevant route following the implementation of these provisions on 8 January 2026. Those who have already obtained a permission where they were required to show a B1 level, will continue to be subject to a B1 level requirement where they are seeking an extension on the same route.

High Potential Individual - targeted and capped expansion

5.23 Expansion of the High Potential Individual route, doubling the list of eligible institutions (subject to any exclusions the Secretary of State considers appropriate). This may be, for example, where inclusion of an institution would undermine UK national security or foreign policy. There will also be a cap placed on the route of 8,000 applications per year. This follows a commitment made in the Immigration White Paper, published in May 2025.

Change to reduce the duration of stay under the Graduate route to 18 months

5.24 The Immigration White Paper published on 12 May announced the Government’s intention to reduce the duration of stay under the Graduate route to 18 months. The Graduate route currently allows eligible graduates who have successfully completed a UK bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or other relevant qualification to remain in the UK for two years, and PhD graduates for three years.

5.25 The change to 18 months will apply to applications submitted on or after 1 January 2027, with PhD graduates continuing to receive three years of leave. The data shows that too many graduates allowed to stay in the UK following the successful completion of their studies are not moving into the graduate level roles which the Graduate route was created to facilitate access to. It is important that those who stay transition into graduate-level jobs and are properly contributing to the economy.

Students transitioning to the Innovator Founder route

5.26 This is a specific change to Student work conditions that will allow Student visa holders to establish a business, where they have completed their course and are switching to the Innovator Founder route. It replaces a similar provision that previously applied to those switching into the Start-up route, which is now closed to new applications.

Change to replace Part 9: Grounds for Refusal, with Part Suitability

5.27 Part 9 has been replaced by a new section called Part Suitability, which serves as the central reference point for all suitability-related refusal and cancellation grounds. This change aligns with the terminology already used in simplified immigration routes, where applicants are assessed against “suitability requirements” rather than “grounds for refusal”.

5.28 Paragraph 39E, which sets out exceptions for individuals who have overstayed their visa or permission, has been moved into Part Suitability under a dedicated section titled “Exceptions for overstayers”. This ensures that overstaying exceptions are considered within the broader suitability framework and improves consistency across routes.

5.29 A number of consequential changes have been made to other parts of the Immigration Rules to reflect the new structure. These include updates to paragraph references, removal of outdated terminology, and alignment of drafting with simplification principles. For example, references to “Part 9” have been replaced with “Part Suitability” in various sections, and the treatment of overstaying has been clarified to reflect the new location of paragraph 39E in Part Suitability.

5.30 The definition of ‘permission’ has also been clarified to reflect it means either permission to enter or permission to stay and includes settlement.

5.31 These changes are part of a broader simplification initiative in line with the recommendations made by the Law Commission on Simplification of the Immigration Rules in January 2019, to make the rules more accessible and easier to navigate.

Amendments to Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life, Appendix Adult Dependant Relative and Appendix Settlement Family Life to apply Part Suitability.

5.32 Family and Private Life rules have, until now, not applied Part 9:Grounds for Refusal, and instead had their own suitability requirements which have resulted in a more generous approach where there are suitability considerations to be made.

5.33 This amendment will apply common suitability provisions to the family and Private life routes - deleting the suitability rules that were bespoke to the Family and Private Life rules and applying Part Suitability (which is replacing Part 9: Grounds for Refusal) to Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life, Appendix Adult Dependent Relative and Appendix Settlement Family Life.

Changes to Appendix Temporary Work – Seasonal Worker

5.34 Changes are being made to the rules concerning the number of months a seasonal worker must be outside the UK before being permitted to apply for a new seasonal work visa. These changes will permit seasonal workers to spend no more than six months working in the UK during any rolling 10-month period, rather than any rolling 12-month period under the previous rules.

Changes to the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme

5.35 The Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme (UPE) was launched on 4 February 2025. It provides a route for Ukrainians (and their eligible family members), who have already been living in the UK with Ukraine Scheme permission, to make a further application to extend their temporary sanctuary in the UK whilst the conflict in Ukraine remains ongoing.

5.36 Since the launch of UPE, children who apply with their parent who is either granted Ukraine Scheme permission at the same time as, or holds Ukraine Scheme permission, will have their period of permission aligned to that parent. Where both parents meet the criteria, the child’s permission is aligned with the parent whose permission expires last.

5.37 As part of ongoing safeguarding measures, we have identified a need to allow for a child’s permission to be aligned to that of their legal guardian. As such, we are updating the UPE eligibility requirements to ensure children can be granted permission in line with their legal guardian. As an additional safeguarding measure, in the eligibility requirements we are specifying that the adult (parent or legal guardian) must be in the UK for a child’s permission to be aligned.

5.38 We are also amending the residence requirement to allow an application to be refused where a child born in the UK or Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man) to a Ukrainian national parent who holds, or is eligible for, Ukraine scheme permission, has been outside the UK or Islands since birth.

5.39 Lastly, we are making minor drafting changes to the validity requirements, in addition to the nationality and relationship requirements to clarify the current policy intention as reflected in the rules.

Other Minor Changes

Changes to Appendix Global Talent

5.40 The Global Talent category is for talented and promising individuals in the fields of science, digital technology and arts and culture wishing to work in the UK. ‘Talent’ applicants are already leaders in their respective field, while ‘promise’ applicants have shown the potential to become leaders in their field.

5.41 As agreed with Arts Council England and their sub-endorsing body, Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), we are expanding some requirements to allow individuals within the architectural field to provide evidence of their achievements as a named member of a group or contributor, as well for their work as an individual. Additionally, we are allowing applicants to provide evidence of significantly contributing to being shortlisted or nominated for an international architectural award to qualify. Both of these changes more closely align the criteria for architects with other sections of the arts and culture requirements.

Changes to Appendix Global Talent: Prestigious Prizes

5.42 Applicants who hold a qualifying prize can qualify without the need to obtain an endorsement from one of the Global Talent endorsing bodies Our expert bodies consider the prizes listed demonstrate irrefutable evidence of prize holders being at the pinnacle of their profession. To be eligible, prizes must be given to named individuals, and therefore the list does not include prestigious awards for specific works, such as an award-winning film, or to whole organisations. Prizes included must also be open to all nationalities and winners must be determined by experts or peers, rather than a public vote.

5.43 Following consultation with the Global Talent endorsing bodies, a further 27 prizes have been added to the list and one prize has been deleted as it is no longer awarded and there are no living former winners. In addition, a number of small corrections have been made to existing prize names and the order they are listed in the tables.

5.44 The list will be kept under review and may be revised in future updates to the Immigration Rules.

Changes to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)

5.45 The EUSS in Appendix EU enables EU, other European Economic Area and Swiss citizens living in the UK before the end of the post-EU exit transition period at 11pm on 31 December 2020, and their family members, to obtain the immigration status they need to continue living in the UK.

5.46 The changes clarify the drafting of the change made from 16 July 2025 by Statement of Changes HC 836, enabling a holder of pre-settled status under the EUSS to be granted settled status where they have been resident in the UK for at least 30 months in total in the most recent 60-month period. They also bring the grounds for cancelling pre-settled status on or before the holder’s arrival in the UK into line with those for curtailing it in-country, so that, where proportionate, this can be based on the fact that the person never met, as well as where they have ceased to meet, the requirements of Appendix EU.

Deletion of obsolete Immigration Rules pertaining to the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa.

5.47 This change will delete obsolete Immigration Rules pertaining to the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa. Applications for entry clearance or for leave to remain cannot be made after 6 July 2025. Given that 6 July 2025 has passed, these Rules, which only apply to entry clearance and leave to remain applications, are no longer needed. It remains possible for those already in the route to apply for indefinite leave to remain until 6 July 2027, where they previously held leave as a Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur). Related changes have also been made to delete general requirements for points-based system routes in Part 6A of the Rules.

Changes to Appendix Sports Governing Bodies

5.48 These changes reflect the fact that British Kendo Association and Great Britain Wheelchair Rugby have met the requirements to become Home Office Approved Sports Governing Bodies.

Changes to Appendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes

5.49 These changes update the names of two visa schemes following requests from the endorsing government departments, the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Business and Trade, of each scheme. These changes also delete the Khebrat Leadership for Change Programme scheme endorsed by the Department for Education as the scheme is no longer in use.

Changes to Appendix Child Student - Safeguarding

5.50 A nominated guardian is a carer that looks after a Child Student for less than 28 continuous days and is not a close relative. The definition of nominated guardian in the introduction section of the Immigration Rules requires the length of care to be less than 28 days. This has been amended to clarify that the 28 days must be continuous days. The definition has also been expanded to include guardians that care for Child Students during periods of term-time. These amendments have also been reflected within Appendix Child Student to the Immigration Rules.

5.51 A new definition has been added to the introduction section of the Immigration Rules to describe a guardianship organisation, which is now mentioned in Appendix Child Student to the Immigration Rules, as a company that arranges a nominated guardian for a Child Student.

5.52 Clarifications are being made to paragraph CS5A.2 and CS5A.3 regarding those living with a nominated guardian. The Child Student’s application can be refused if their nominated guardian regularly lives with someone that has a criminal conviction. This has been amended so that this only applies if the person living with the nominated guardian is an adult. This clarifies that the rule does not apply to children.

5.53 Certain requirements are applied to ensure children have safe living arrangements. The ‘living arrangement requirement’ has been amended to clarify the permitted living arrangements on the route, including that as a boarding student you are able to stay with a parent who has permission as a Parent of a Child Student, if the Child Student is over 12 years of age and the parent is caring for their younger sibling who holds permission as a Child Student. The different types of boarding arrangements (flexi, weekly, and full boarding) have now been amalgamated under a single boarding category for simplicity when reading the rules and to formalise a concessionary arrangement permitting flexi and weekly boarders to be in the care of a nominated guardian when they are not staying at school.

5.54 A new paragraph has been added to Appendix Child Student to the Immigration Rules to cover the information guardianship organisations need to provide where an applicant does not have the details of their nominated guardian at the point where they apply for permission on the Child Student route. A new paragraph has also been added for this scenario so the named contact from the guardianship organisation must be British or Settled in the UK.

5.55 Paragraph CS9.4(g) has been amended to explain details that we require to be listed on the letter of undertaking relating to adults that regularly live with a nominated guardian.

Student Route Maintenance Requirement Annual Uplift

5.56 There is a maintenance requirement for student applicants to demonstrate they have funds to support themselves for each month of their course (up to 9 months). This level of funds is aligned with the maintenance loans available for home students, which is reviewed every year. This change increases the maintenance requirement to match the maintenance loans available for home students for the 2025/2026 academic year. We will ensure it continues to align with home students’ maintenance loans in future.

5.57 We have updated the maximum amount for the accommodation offset in line with the changes to the maintenance requirement. The accommodation offset allows students to demonstrate less maintenance funds if they have paid a deposit for their accommodation in the UK.

Changes to the continuous residence rules

5.58 Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and Tier 1 (Investor) are being added to the list of provisions to which Appendix Continuous Residence applies, as part of changes to Part 6A of the Immigration Rules. The rule concerning the breaking of continuous residence is also being corrected.

Changes to align drafting across the Immigration Rules

5.59 Minor changes are being made to align the drafting across the Immigration Rules. These are not policy changes and are minor presentational changes that are intended to provide greater transparency, clarity, and consistency.

Other drafting changes

5.60 The Statement of Changes also introduces minor drafting changes to correct incorrect paragraph references and minor errors. It also clarifies and amends technical points relating to occupation tables in the changes laid on 1 July 2025 (HC 997).

6. Legislative and legal context

How has the law changed?

6.1 The Immigration Rules, as laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State, constitute a statement of practice to be followed in the administration of the Immigration Act 1971 for regulating the entry into, and stay of, persons in the United Kingdom.

6.2 This Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules will be incorporated into a consolidated version of the Immigration Rules. This can be found on the GOV.UK website, where all the Statements of Changes in Immigration Rules issued since May 1994 are published.

6.3 The changes will be implemented on various dates from 14 October 2025 as detailed in the implementation section of the accompanying Statement of Changes.

6.4 For the changes that introduce a visa requirement on Botswana, those changes will come into effect at 1500 BST on 14 October 2025. The changes regarding appendix HPI, will come into effect on 4 November 2025, the changes relating to Students transitioning to the Innovator Founder route come into effect on 25 November 2025 and the changes to English language requirements for economic migration routes will come into effect on 8 January 2026. All other changes will come into effect on 11 November 2025 and are detailed in the implementation section of the Statement of Changes.

Why was this approach taken to change the law?

6.5 This is the only possible approach to make the necessary changes.

7. Consultation

Summary of consultation outcome and methodology

7.1 The specific changes in this Statement have not been the subject of a formal public consultation, as this would be disproportionate given the nature of the changes.

8. Applicable Guidance

8.1 Guidance relating to these Rules changes will be updated and placed on the GOV.UK website when these changes take effect.

8.2 It is our practice to only publish guidance updates when Rules changes take effect to mitigate the high risk of users referring to the wrong version.

Part Two: Impact and the Better Regulation Framework

9. Impact Assessment

9.1 A full Impact Assessment for the changes that relates to the various White Paper changes made in this Statement of Changes will be published alongside the Explanatory Memorandum and Statement of Changes on the Gov.uk website.

Change to reduce the duration of stay under the Graduate route to 18 months

9.2 The Graduate route changes are expected to have a modest impact on Student visa demand. It is provisionally estimated a long-term reduction of approximately 12,000 Student visa applications per annum. Short-term impacts may also arise following the announcement. Financial implications include reduced visa fee and Immigration Health Surcharge revenue, with provisional estimates of £27m from the Student route and £23m from the Graduate route.

Other changes

9.3 Although there is a degree of impact as a result of the changes being made, a full Impact Assessment has not been prepared for the changes listed below because the level and effects of the changes do not meet the threshold for producing an Impact Assessment or Economic Note:

Introduction of a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana

9.4 The changes are likely to have a meaningful impact on the public sector. High volumes of asylum claims, if left unchecked, can represent significant cost to the public sector, though overall costs for this population would be a small proportion of overall asylum costs.

9.5 As a result of a visa introduction on nationals of Botswana, there may be an impact on the number of genuine visitors coming from Botswana to the UK due to the requirement to obtain a visa before travel.

9.6 These changes therefore may represent a meaningful indirect impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies. The ONS estimated that in 2023, on average, nationals from Botswana arriving by air spent £983 per visit to the UK. Any reduction in spending resulting from a reduction in visitors to the UK is likely to represent a cost to business through a reduction in revenue.

German school groups travel: easing travel requirements for German school groups visiting the UK

9.7 The impact of the agreement on Border Force is assessed as low. It is possible that Border Force may experience minor fluidity issues due to the intended increase in German school group travel to the UK, but steps will be taken to mitigate this. The impact of the agreement on border security is low due to the robust authentication measures in place and the low-risk cohort involved.

Changes to the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme

9.8 An Impact Assessment was prepared for the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme more broadly and was published on 26 November 2024, following the laying in Parliament of the Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules setting out the associated changes. No further economic impacts, beyond those set out in the already published impact assessment, have been identified as a result of these changes.

All other changes

9.9 A full Impact Assessment has not been prepared for the other changes in this instrument because the level and effects of the changes do not meet the threshold for doing so.

Impact on businesses, charities and voluntary bodies

9.10 For all other changes there is no, or no significant, impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies.

9.11 For all other changes the legislation does not impact small or micro businesses.

9.12 For all other changes there is no, or no significant impact on the public sector.

10. Monitoring and review

What is the approach to monitoring and reviewing this legislation?

10.1 The approach to the monitoring of these changes is to review the operation and effect of all the relevant Immigration Rules, including any Rules amended or added to by the changes in this Statement, and lay a report before Parliament within five years of 6 April 2017, and within every five years after that. Following each review, the Secretary of State will decide whether the relevant Immigration Rules should remain unchanged or be revoked or amended. A further Statement of Changes would be needed to revoke or amend the relevant Rules.

10.2 A statutory review clause is included in the instrument.

Part Three: Statements and Matters of Particular Interest to Parliament

11. Matters of special interest to Parliament

Introduction of a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana

11.1 The changes to introduce a visit visa requirement on nationals of Botswana will come into effect at 1500 BST on 14 October 2025, and therefore depart from the usual convention that changes to the Immigration Rules come into force no earlier than 21 days after their being laid in Parliament.

11.2 Controlling migration and securing our borders are Home Office priorities. After deciding to introduce a visit or transit visa requirement, it is necessary and reasonable to implement this as quickly as possible. The rationale for breaching the 21-day rule is that prior notification of implementation of a visa requirement could trigger a substantial increase in nationals of Botswana impacted by this change travelling to the UK prior to the visa requirement coming into effect, triggering an unpredictable and unmanageable strain upon the UK’s migration and borders system. This action continues to respect our international obligations.

11.3 Immediate implementation of a visa requirement is accompanied by a six-week transition period to prevent general unfairness and to mitigate the risk that people who arranged travel to the UK prior to the introduction of the visa requirement suffer a financial loss. Additionally, this period prevents serious operational difficulties. This approach has been successful on previous occasions and the Government is clear that implementing changes in this way is necessary and proportionate to protect the UK immigration system from abuse.

Recognition of Palestine: changes to the visa national list

11.4 Unlike previous changes that introduce a visit visa requirement, for this particular change, it is not necessary to depart from the usual convention that changes to the Immigration Rules come into force no earlier than 21 days after their being laid in Parliament. This is for the reasons set out in section 5 above.

11.5 For all other changes there are no matters of interest.

12. European Convention on Human Rights

12.1 As this Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules is subject to negative resolution procedure and does not amend primary legislation, no statement is required.

13. The relevant European Union Acts

13.1 This instrument is not being made under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (“relevant European Union Acts”). It does, however, relate to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union because it supports further implementation of the EUSS.

13.2 For all other changes, this instrument does not relate to withdrawal from the European Union or trigger the statement requirements under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

14. Consolidation

14.1 The Government has committed to the consolidation of the Rules as part of its response to the Law Commission recommendations on simplifying the Immigration Rules.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-10-14 11:58:44.091722

The village of Broadview sued to have the eight-foot fence removed, saying it posed a public safety hazard because it blocks emergency responders.

Attorneys for the federal government argued the fencing is needed for business and to protect vehicles and personnel.

Illinois legislators gathered outside the Broadview ice facility yesterday in opposition of the immigration crackdown, and calling for the fencing to come down immediately.

""Mr. Trump, tear down this fence now. Tear it down,"" said Democratic Speaker Illinois House Speaker Emanuel ""Chris"" Welch, who represents the 7th District.

In suburban Chicago last month, a masked ICE agent shot a pepper ball into the head of a Presbyterian pastor as he prayed outside an ICE facility. Another ICE agent fatally shot a Mexican immigrant in Illinois. Also last month, in New York City, an ICE officer was removed from duty after he was captured on video forcibly shoving a woman to the ground outside an immigration court. Meanwhile, earlier this month, ICE agents conducted a military-style raid on a South Side Chicago apartment building, detaining hundreds of residents, many of whom are U.S.-born children.

On Thursday, after Chicago journalists and protestors sued the federal government alleging “extreme brutality” from agents on the ground, a federal judge in Illinois blocked federal agents from using force or threatening to arrest journalists.

Sandweg worked at the Department of Homeland Security for five years, spending four years as legal counsel. He capped off his DHS tenure with a one-year term leading the nation’s immigration enforcement agency from 2013-2014.

Immigration has always been one of the most polarizing and political fields of law enforcement, Sandweg concedes. But, he adds, it’s become even more polarizing now.

In a wide-ranging interview, Sandweg also expressed concern that ICE wouldn’t be able to adequately train the rapidly expanding ICE workforce and got candid about one of the most divisive trends at the agency: “I hate that the agents are wearing the masks,” he said.

The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

We’re seeing ICE agents display really heavy-handed use of force, smashing in car windows, shoving people to the ground, smoke bombing people, pepper spraying. Has ICE ever been this aggressive before?

Obviously, I don’t think we’ve ever seen a nationwide immigration enforcement effort like this. During the Obama administration, we did a large number of nationwide operations, but they’re very targeted. They’re the kind of work where you’re going after specific individuals, people that you knew had a criminal history. They were carefully selected. There was a lot of research and investigation done before you went out to make the actual arrest. These are much more akin to area sweeps, where they’re going out and just stopping people in the streets, or working in conjunction with other law enforcement as they execute traffic stops, or hitting a large number of apartments in a building where you suspect people are undocumented. We’ve never seen anything like this. I mean, the deployment of FBI agents and other law enforcement agents to supplement DHS efforts, the pulling of these border patrol agents into these urban cities. All of this is unprecedented.

In my experience, most ICE agents do their jobs. They do, and they treat people with dignity and respect. I know we’ve seen some incidents where that hasn’t been true. And I think that’s attributable to a lot of things. I think it’s because the agents are under tremendous pressure. They’ve been under a lot of pressure to ratchet up the number of arrests. They’ve been forced to adopt some of these more aggressive tactics, because the [Trump] administration seems more interested in the quantity of people arrested, more so than the quality. It’s not like we’re seeing those more surgical operations, where you might arrest fewer people, but they have a more serious criminal history. You’re seeing just large numbers of arrested people who have been here a long time, people who have U.S. citizen family members.

And then some of the incidents, I think, have been unfortunate reactions to the protests. This nationwide sweep of people who are not just criminal aliens, it’s triggered a lot of civil unrest, public protests, and I think, unfortunately, you’ve seen some aggressive tactics in dealing with it.

It’s not always clear to me whether it’s ICE, border patrol or even what’s called Federal Protective Service, the law enforcement DHS agency that protects federal buildings. If it’s immigration related, it just gets the ICE moniker.

This kind of enforcement is much more widespread, too, than what we’ve seen before. Tell me a little bit about the Trump administration’s emphasis on quantity over quality of arrests. That seems like a very marked shift from how previous administrations have handled and deployed immigration enforcement.

Even compared to the first Trump administration, you didn’t see anything like this. What we have seen is that immigration enforcement has become probably the central priority for all U.S. law enforcement, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense. This executive order has elevated this to the highest priority. I’ve never seen a whole government effort focused like this, even in the State Department. As a result of that, we’ve never seen an immigration enforcement effort like this. And that manifests itself in a lot of different ways, really quickly.

When you’re at ICE, of course you can run down to a Home Depot parking lot. Any administration could have done this: round the Home Depot parking lot, stop a bunch of day laborers and ID them. In car washes, in places where low-wage workers work, places like that. The reason that historically hasn’t been done, is you just don’t find criminals there. Once in a blue moon you find someone, and we see that the administration highlights when they get someone who has some criminal history. But by and large, your really serious criminal threats don’t do shifts at the local car wash for minimum wage. They’re out making their money, making a living as a criminal.

And so ICE has always focused our operations on getting those individuals — that takes more time, though. You’re taking lists of people who are criminally convicted and you’re identifying them, and then once you identify them, you’re doing research on addresses, and then you’re building a dossier and sending a team out to get them. The Obama administration deported a large number of people, but generally, a very high percentage of them were people who either just crossed the border or people with a serious criminal history.

This administration, though, is taking a different tack. This administration has repurposed the way they’ve operationalized ICE — to go out and get as many people as possible, and that’s why we’re seeing these raids on the car washes and on the Home Depot parking lots. They know they can make a large number of arrests there, and they don’t seem to care whether or not those people pose a threat to public safety. They just say, “If you’re undocumented, you’re a fair target.”

It seems like this agency is much more politicized now than it’s ever been.

Immigration has always been the most politicized law enforcement work. Certainly during my time at DHS, the goal was always to just do our job, and the politics will take care of itself. Focus on the worst of the worst. Get the bad guys off the streets. Everything else will work out. It certainly seems to me that this administration has steered into the political debate. That’s unfortunate, because ICE has become this political football that makes it really hard for the agency to do its job. And it’ll make it really hard in years to come for the agency to do its job.

ICE is expanding, and has poured money into recruiting efforts. It’s looking to double its ranks, and it’s also expanding its units. So what guardrails can ICE place to properly train all of these new employees?

That’s a real concern. It begins with the recruitment. The first concern would be, let’s hope ICE doesn’t lower their standards. This administration is going to want to get as many of these new agents out in the field as quickly as possible. Normally, to hire this many people, it would take the agency three, four years.

The problem is that the agency only has the capacity to do so many background checks at once, to interview so many people at once. The training academy can only train so many people at once. It would take years to fully deploy these agents. This administration clearly doesn’t want to wait. They want to get people out there as quickly as possible. Now, some of what they’re doing makes some sense: They’re recruiting heavily from local law enforcement, other law enforcement agencies, offering signing bonuses and things. But the concern here would be, to the extent to which the administration wants to get these people deployed quickly, do they cut corners? I worry that if you start cutting corners on standards or background checks or training, that it’s only a recipe for problems down the line.

Official DHS policy requires ICE agents to use only the level of force that is “objectively reasonable,” and that’s not concretely defined. What is reasonable? From your experience, I’d love to hear how agents are trained to apply force and what they’re trained to recognize.

Just to keep it simple, the use of force needs to be commensurate with the threat that’s presented your way. It does seem to me that a lot of the episodes where [use of force] certainly seemed to push the line involved other agencies. A lot of them were Border Patrol related.

The hard part, and the reason why I’m always hesitant to question use of force, is that I just don’t know what the agents knew. This apartment building in Chicago, I don’t know what information they had before they went into the apartment building. Operations where it looks heavy-handed, but maybe they have good intel that says a violent, dangerous gang member is in the house. In a case like that, a ton of force is appropriate, if not necessary. But if it’s just a routine immigration operation, wearing the tactical gear and aggressively shoving people against walls and using long arms and some of these things certainly strikes me as excessive. But it’s hard to judge.

Speaking of Chicago, a Mexican immigrant was fatally shot by an ICE agent there in late September. And then last month in Dallas, we saw a shooter open fire at an ICE facility. This seems like such an uptick in violence, both coming from and directed at ICE. Have you seen this level of violence before? Or is this a new kind of escalation?

No, I’ve never seen it. The number one rule: You have to keep the agents safe. One thing that is tough for someone like me, having worked with people at ICE, is that they bear the brunt of people’s frustration with the administration’s policies. The agents have a duty to execute the president’s policies.

Unfortunately, there have been some psychopaths out there — the shooting in Dallas, absolutely horrific. The number of assaults, the uptick is real. There have been increased numbers of assaults, and as the officers do some of these operations, there’s rock throwing, the shooting in Dallas, all of that is real. It’s just a very unfortunate time we’re in. While I fully respect everyone’s right to protest these actions, you also have to make sure the agents themselves are safe.

I understand why it’s happening, but it’s not the agents who are crafting these policies. In my experience, most of these agents signed up with the agency because they want to make a difference in terms of making the country safer. But unfortunately, they do bear the brunt of this. But no, I’ve not seen this level of assaults on the agents themselves.

Why is this happening? Is it just because ICE is extending its reach?

Because it’s become such a symbol of the administration. I think that if people were asked to define what the Trump administration stands for, immigration enforcement would be top one or two. ICE has become the symbol of the administration, and that’s what makes it an attractive target for people.

And what about these headlines about violence and the use of force coming from ICE agents as well?

I think the whole thing has become so politically charged. It increases agitation, it makes it more likely that somebody crazy is going to try to assault an officer. I think as a result of that, the agents probably are more defensive than they otherwise would be. And more aggressive in terms of taking steps to protect their safety. It’s a difficult situation, and I don’t envy the officers at all. They’re in a very tough position.

And on this topic of officer safety, civil rights groups have raised alarms about agent masking. ICE’s current acting director, Todd Lyons, has justified agents concealing their identities, masking their faces — pointing out what you just mentioned, this increased risk of doxxing, threats, abuse and violence against officers.

It was never an issue. I spent five years at DHS working on ICE issues. It just wasn’t an issue. None of the officers felt the need to wear masks. I think it’s an unfortunate byproduct of the administration’s policies. This is a very contentious area of law, this idea that we’re not going to discern the difference between migrants who might be committing serious crimes and those who might have real long-term presence in the United States, young children and family members and things of that nature.

I hate that the agents are wearing the masks. I think it is hurting the reputation of the agency, and feeding a lot of these narratives about the agency. But I’m also sympathetic to the agents themselves, who need to protect themselves and their families. Like we just talked about, there are these upticks, these massive upticks in assaults on the agents. These threats against the agents are real, and there’s, unfortunately, a lot of people out there who can’t discern the difference between the administration and the policymakers and the agents themselves. And as a result of that, these agents feel compelled to take steps to protect themselves and their family, and I’m sympathetic to it.

Just to clarify, the decision to wear a mask, is that an individual choice? Is that coming from the agent, or is that an organization-wide policy?

My recollection, there was no policy on it. I don’t think this administration is requiring them to wear masks. There’s just no policy in place that restricts use of masks.

We’ve talked about how ICE has changed so much under the current administration, but looking back from when you were with DHS and looking at reports of activity now, and what we’re seeing on the ground, how has ICE’s work changed in the past decade?

Two big things have changed that are really significant. The first is the border. ICE has a responsibility to take people into custody who are not from Mexico, if they’re apprehended at the border. All these asylum seekers, ICE has the responsibility of detaining them, processing them through immigration court and supervising them if they were released. Since right about the time I left DHS in 2014, that’s when the border numbers really started picking up. And that has really overwhelmed ICE for 10 years. Detention beds were full of people from the border. It limited ICE’s ability to do much else on the interior of the United States.

Beginning with Biden in June of last year, the numbers at the border started declining dramatically. Those declining numbers frees up ICE, it starts to have more additional resources to rededicate to interior enforcement. And then the Trump administration comes in.

Are we seeing a brand-new shift in ICE’s mission and directive?

I wouldn’t say it’s a shift, this has always been a key part of ICE’s mission. What’s different is who they’re targeting. Under Obama, under Biden and even to a certain extent, under the first Trump administration, there were priorities. The agents were told, “Focus first on the worst. Worst first. Get the worst bad guys off the street first, we’ll deal with everything else later.” Those rules are gone.

Where do we go from here? How do we de-escalate?

Look, the country needs to pass immigration reform. We revert back to ICE’s more traditional tactics of focusing on “the absolute worst first.” This is a difficult question that the country has struggled with. We have people in this country for 15, 20 years who have been out of status, and in that time they’ve had children, they’ve married U.S. citizens, they’ve integrated themselves, they’ve gone to church, made friends with people at work. They’ve just integrated themselves in society.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe4%2Fa0%2F02aac149428dbbe452f8dfc72e50%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2224603707,N,,2025-10-14 11:59:17.233304

What we know:

Forest Park Mayor Rory E. Hoskins provided cell phone video showing federal agents demanding to be let into Concordia Cemetery, and the vapor of chemicals deployed on four cemetery workers.

One of the workers told Fox 32 they heard a man in distress in the Des Plaines River on October 7.

When they looked into it, federal agents demanded access to the locked cemetery. The agents were told it was private property.

The agents cut the lock on the gate and, according to the workers, deployed pepper spray, body slammed, and cuffed them for five hours.

""What happened to me and my co-workers was alarming and it reminded me of how important it is we all uphold the constitution,"" said Darren Eichler, one of the workers.

Hoskins met with the men about their experience.

""It’s an indication of poor training or just bad intentions on the part of ICE,"" the mayor said.

What they're saying:

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents were trying to rescue the two men from the nearby Des Plaines River.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement:

""Despite the agitation and lack of help from local government, ICE successfully arrested both illegal aliens, including Martin Martinez Guereca, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico, previously convicted of assault in 2004, and Jaime Arturo Martinez Rojas, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico with previous arrests for drug possession and driving under the influence. The four U.S. citizens who obstructed law enforcement from the rescue operation were arrested.""

Also on Monday, DHS said in a post on X that its so-called Operation Midway Blitz has resulted in the arrests of more than 1,500 people in the Chicago area.

The four workers are still unsure of the allegations.

""These are not public figures,"" Hoskins said. ""These are private men who work in a cemetery. They suffered a very traumatic incident, detained for hours at a time, maced, dehumanized, taunted and here they are back in our community, and we want to make sure they feel protected.""

Three workers were released from a facility in Lombard.

The hospitalized worker was treated and released from an area hospital.

They are considering legal action.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/snapshot-36.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-14 11:59:22.810711

The Democratic lawmaker said he had arrived to conduct official oversight amid reports of detentions, just days after video surfaced showing ICE officers forcefully restraining a 15-year-old from his district in Hoffman Estates. Despite his congressional authority, ICE officials denied him access to the site.

“I demanded access to the Broadview ICE facility to perform oversight — as is my right and my duty as a Member of Congress,” said Krishnamoorthi. “Once again, the Trump Administration slammed the door on transparency and accountability. Congress and the American people have every right to see what’s happening behind those walls.”

“This is Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, I have former Congressman Luis Gutiérrez with me, under section 527 of the appropriations law I am entitled to be able to inspect,” Krishnamoorthi could be heard saying on the phone call before the facility’s staff member interrupted him on the video posted on X.

Tuesday’s incident marks the second time in recent months that Krishnamoorthi has been denied access to an ICE facility.

In June, he and Congressman Jonathan Jackson were blocked from visiting a Chicago detention center while attempting to review conditions and obtain details about those being held.

Krishnamoorthi warned that such repeated refusals to permit lawful oversight erode transparency at a moment when federal immigration enforcement has sharply escalated under “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation drive targeting Democratic-led cities.

Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.
Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled.
ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said.
Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.","The Nigerian man described being roused with other detainees in September in the middle of the night. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers clasped shackles on their hands and feet, he said, and told them they were being sent to Ghana, even though none of them was from there.

When they asked to speak to their attorney, he said, the officers refused and straitjacketed the already-shackled men in full-body restraint suits called the WRAP, then loaded them onto a plane for the 16-hour-flight to West Africa.

Referred to as “the burrito” or “the bag,” the WRAP has become a harrowing part of deportations for some immigrants.

“It was just like a kidnapping,” the Nigerian man, who’s part of a federal lawsuit, told The Associated Press in an interview from the detainment camp in which he and other deportees were being held in Ghana. Like others placed in the restraints interviewed by the AP, he spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The AP identified multiple examples of ICE using the black-and-yellow full-body restraint device, the WRAP, in deportations. Its use was described to the AP by five people who said they were restrained in the device, sometimes for hours, on ICE deportation flights dating to 2020. And witnesses and family members in four countries told the AP about its use on at least seven other people this year.

The AP found ICE has used the device despite internal concerns voiced in a 2023 report by the civil rights division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in part due to reports of deaths involving use of the WRAP by local law enforcement. And the AP has identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

The WRAP is the subject of a growing number of federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture, whether used in a jail or by immigration authorities during international flights. Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.

DHS has paid Safe Restraints Inc., the WRAP’s California-based maker, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015 during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending. ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it’s not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

The WRAP’s manufacturer says it intended the device to be a lifesaver for law enforcement confronting erratic people who were physically attacking officers or harming themselves.

But ICE officials have a much lower threshold for deploying the WRAP than the manufacturer advises, the AP found. Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled. They said this was done to intimidate or punish them for asking to speak to their attorneys or expressing fear at being deported, often to places they fled due to violence and torture.

The West African deportee described a terrifying, hourslong experience that left his legs swollen to the point where he walked with a limp.

“They bundled me and my colleagues,” he said, “tied us up in a straitjacket.”

ICE and DHS would not answer detailed questions from the AP and refused a request for the government’s policy for when and how to use the WRAP.

“The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights has been long standing, standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’ spokesperson, said in an email to AP. “Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.”

The agency would not specify those authorities or describe its practices.

“The use of these devices is inhumane and incompatible with our nation’s fundamental values,” said Noah Baron, an attorney for the West African deportees.

Charles Hammond, CEO of Safe Restraints Inc., said his company has made a modified version of the device for ICE, with changes meant to allow people to be kept in it during flights and long bus trips.

ICE’s version includes a ring on the front of the suit that allows a subject’s cuffed hands to be attached while still allowing for limited use to eat and drink, he said. In addition, the ICE version has “soft elbow cuffs,” Hammond said, which connect in the back so a person can move for proper circulation but can’t flip an elbow out to hit someone.

An AP reporter recounted for Hammond some of the allegations made by people who had been placed in the WRAP for long flights. All of those interviewed by AP said their hands and feet were already restrained by chains. All denied fighting with officers, saying they were either crying or pleading against their deportation to countries they deemed dangerous.

Hammond said that, if true that some people were not being violent and simply protesting verbally, putting them in the WRAP could be improper use.

“That’s not the purpose of the WRAP. If (the deportee) is a current or potential risk to themselves, to officers, to staff, to the plane, restraints are justified. If it’s not, then restraints aren’t.”

‘Please help me’

Juan Antonio Pineda said he was put into “a bag” in late September and driven by immigration officers to the Mexico border. It was black with yellow stripes and had straps that immobilized his body and connected over his shoulders — the WRAP.

Pineda, who is from El Salvador, was in the U.S. legally, he said in a video from an ICE detention center in Arizona. On Sept. 3, he went to an appointment in Maryland to get permission for another year, his wife, Xiomara Ochoa, said in an interview from El Salvador. Instead, he was detained by ICE and told he’d be deported to Mexico, but the documents he was shown had someone else’s name, he said. Even so, he was sent to the Florence Service Processing Center detention facility in Arizona.

Early morning on Wednesday, Sept. 24, he said officers tied his hands and legs, placed him into the “bag” and drove him four hours to the border. When he refused to sign the deportation papers, Pineda alleges officers broke his right arm and gave him a black eye before driving him back another four hours in the “bag.” The AP was unable to independently confirm how he was injured. Pineda’s video shows him with a cast on his arm and bruising on his face.

The next day, Thursday, Sept. 25, they tied him up again, put him in the bag and drove him to the border, where Mexican immigration officials turned him away, he said.

“Eight hours there and back and they don’t give me food or water or anything,” he said in the video, which his wife shared with the AP. “Please help me.”

He was ultimately deported to Mexico, Ochoa said.

ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP regarding Pineda’s case.

In addition to the Nigerian man flown to Ghana, four others interviewed by AP said they were placed in the WRAP and carried onto deportation flights since the first Trump administration.

As U.S. immigration officials move aggressively to meet the president’s deportation goals, advocates and attorneys for immigrants are echoing the concerns of the government’s own civil rights inquiry that ICE officers aren’t trained on how to use the restraints.

“This should be a last resort type of restraint after they’ve already tried other things,” said Fatma Marouf, a Texas A&M law professor who has sued ICE over its use of the device. “Just being bound up like that can inflict a lot of psychological harm.”

Some deportees said they were left in the WRAP for an entire fight. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the Nigerian man and four others currently detained in Dema Camp, Ghana, included the allegation from one that ICE left the restraint suit on him for 16 hours, only once undoing the lower part so he could use the bathroom.

“No one should be put into a WRAP. I don’t even think they strap animals like that,” recalled a man who said he suffered a concussion and dislocated jaw being placed into the device in 2023 before a deportation flight to Cape Verde, an African island nation. AP’s review of his medical records confirmed he suffered those injuries in 2023.

“It was the most painful thing I’ve been through,” said the man, adding he was restrained most of the 10-hour flight. “Forget the assault, forget the broken jaw. Just the WRAP itself was hurtful.”

Also, the man said, the metal ring his cuffed hands were attached to — one of the ICE modifications to the WRAP designed to increase comfort — injured him. “When they slammed me face forward on the floor, that metal ring dug into my chest causing me bruising and pain which was part of my injuries that I complained about.”

ICE’s current use of the WRAP comes amid an unprecedented wave of masked federal immigration officers grabbing suspected immigrants off the street, and mounting accusations that the Trump administration has dehumanized them, including by subjecting them to cruel and unusual detention conditions.

ICE’s use of the WRAP has continued despite a 2023 report by DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or CRCL, that raised serious concerns over the lack of policies governing its use.

ICE agreed with the internal findings on some points, a then-DHS official involved in the review said, but challenged the notion that the WRAP should be classified as a “four-point restraint,” a designation that would place more limitations on its use. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the inquiry.

DHS largely dismantled the office that produced the 2023 report earlier this year amid widespread government firings, calling it a roadblock to enforcement operations.

“Without changes to the current training, and the lack of policy, CRCL has serious concerns about ICE’s continued use of the WRAP,” wrote the report’s authors, who cited a news article mentioning lawsuits claiming the device had led to deaths.

Use by police and in jails

Last year police officers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, placed Rolin Hill in the WRAP, saying he was being combative during an arrest at a convenience store. The officers left Hill in the device when they dropped him at the jail. Video from the jail shows deputies punching the WRAP-immobilized Hill in the head and back. Hill died in a hospital, and while the WRAP’s exact role is unknown, Hill’s death was ruled a homicide by “positional and mechanical asphyxia due to restraint with neck and torso compression.” Three of the deputies are now charged with his murder, and five were removed from their jobs.

Also last year, in Missouri, prosecutors charged five jailers in the death of Othel Moore Jr., who according to an autopsy asphyxiated in the WRAP. Jailhouse footage showed Moore, who’d also been sprayed with tear gas and placed in a “spit mask” covering his face, repeatedly told officers he couldn’t breathe.

AP identified many of the other non-ICE cases involving the WRAP during an investigation into deaths after police subdued people with common tactics that, unlike guns, are meant to stop someone without killing them.

While Hammond insists the WRAP has never been determined as the cause of death when used properly, the AP identified 43 times in which the WRAP was used by police or correctional officers in a case in which someone died. In 12 of those cases the official autopsy determined that “restraint” played some role in the death.

It was often impossible to determine the exact role the WRAP may have played, as deaths often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who in several cases were high on methamphetamine.

The WRAP first appeared in law enforcement in the late 1990s, presented as an alternative to tying a subject’s hands and feet together in a practice known as “hog-tying.” It first found widespread use in California jails and today is used by more than 1,800 departments and facilities around the country, according to the manufacturer, which says it has sold more than 10,000 devices.

Many of these cases have drawn little media attention, such as the 2020 case of Alberto Pena, who was jailed on a misdemeanor criminal mischief charge after getting drunk and damaging the walls and doors at his parents’ home outside Rio Grande City, Texas. The 30-year-old became erratic on the way to the Starr County Jail, beating his own head against the inside of the patrol unit and, later, the wall of his cell.

Deputies placed Pena in the WRAP for more than two hours, where he repeatedly cried out for help and complained he could not breathe. But he was left unattended in the device for significant periods of time, court records show, and no medical attention was provided for his self-inflicted head injuries.

An autopsy ruled Pena’s death “accidental,” but a forensic pathologist hired by the family attributed Pena’s death in part to the WRAP’s “prolonged restraint” and said it “could have been averted” with proper medical care.

“The WRAP should have never been used in this situation. It was a medical emergency and he should have been taken to the hospital,” said Natasha Powers-Marakis, a former police officer and use of force expert who reviewed the case on behalf of Pena’s family as part of their wrongful death lawsuit against the county and officers who placed him in the device. The arresting officers had been told Pena suffered from bipolar disorder.

The Starr County Sheriff’s Office has denied wrongdoing and maintained Pena did not require medical care. Robert Drinkard, an attorney for the county, told AP the use of the WRAP “was neither improper nor caused Mr. Pena’s tragic death.” He added that each deputy involved in placing Pena in the WRAP had been trained in its application.

A federal judge recently dismissed the Pena family’s lawsuit, ruling the deputies were shielded from liability.

‘Carrying me like a corpse’

In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer’s CEO, argues.

ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said. Given the high stakes of a violent confrontation on an airplane, Hammond believes cases like those described to the AP can warrant the WRAP’s use, even if the person is already in chains.

However, properly trained agents are supposed to loosen the straps and allow enough movement so the subject can eat and drink, as well as use the bathroom.

“With the WRAP, when it is used properly, it’s a shorter fight, which is good for everybody. It prioritizes breathing, which is good for everybody. And you have no more fight and can provide medical care or mental health care or de-escalation efforts,” Hammond said.

Those placed in one of Hammond’s restraint suits, however, recount the experience as traumatic.

One of these people was first put into five-point shackles when he became dizzy and tripped while ascending the stairs to board the ICE flight to Cameroon in November 2020. The officer mistook his stumbling as resistance, he said. Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.

Soon, he felt the straps cinching around his legs and upper body.

“They bundled me like a log of wood from all the sides and they were just carrying me like a corpse,” he said.

Another man interviewed by the AP said ICE officers put him in the WRAP after he initially resisted efforts to move him onto a deportation flight in Alexandria, Louisiana, in 2020. He’d fled political violence and persecution in his native Cameroon, and was afraid to go back. He said officers took him out of his cell in front of the other detainees and put him in the WRAP, leaving him for hours in view of the others as a warning to them not to speak up.

“I told him ‘I can’t breathe,’” the man said. “He responded, ’I don’t care, I’m doing my job.’”",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ICE-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 10:57:31.702945

But the gathering storm of a wider military deployment to Chicago with full arrest power is being considered by the White House and talked up publicly by the president, especially since Justice Department attorneys lost several legal cases here in the past week.

There were controllable skirmish lines last weekend handled by state police troopers in front of the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. The operation was conducted by police without help from National Guard troopers sent in by the president. Soldiers last week were ordered by the courts here to disengage -orders being appealed by the White House.

""Our ICE agents, the people who are enforcing our immigration laws, have faced a 1,000% increase in violent attacks against them,” Vice President JD Vance said on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday morning. “They're being assaulted. They're being beaten. They're being shot at. The problem here is not the Insurrection Act or whether we actually invoke it or not. The problem is the fact that the entire media in this country, cheered on by a few far-left lunatics, have made it okay to tee off on American law enforcement.""

If Trump invokes the Insurrection Act of 1807, most legal barriers to military use in Chicago would disappear; the president claiming a rebellion is underway here and soldiers could then assume regular police duties, including arresting people.

Northwestern University Law School professor and constitutional expert Paul Gowder told NBC 5 Investigates the use of the Insurrection Act despite stern objections by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is concerning.

“I think that it would set up a really stark conflict between the president's use of troops and our traditional understanding of the autonomy of state governments in local law enforcement that I think would be challenging,"" Gowder said.

An Insurrection Act declaration would allow the president to send in units from any service branch, including the Marines, and to employ the Air Force, regular Army or put together a federal militia, according to Syracuse Law School professor emeritus William Banks.

""They could start enforcing curfews. They could tell people to stay in their homes. They could close doors,” Banks said. “It's not martial law, but it's one step toward martial law.""

The last time the Insurrection Act was used in the United States was 1992 in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict, when LA officials asked for help.

And NBC Chicago has found that the Insurrection Act has been previously imposed on Chicago.

In 1894 - during the infamous Pullman Co. labor strike that had paralyzed the nation's rail system. Then-President Grover Cleveland sent in 2000 U.S. Army troops to break the union and stop deadly riots. And just as we are seeing in 2025, there was fierce opposition to federal soldiers from then-Chicago Mayor John Hopkins and then-Illinois Gov. John Altgeld.

""We don't talk about it very much in history classes for whatever reason,” said Northwestern Law’s Gowder. “But this extensive pattern is called the Labor Wars sometimes by historians because it turned into something that looked a lot like warfare.""

The use of the Insurrection Act and deployment of federal troops in Chicago more than 130 years ago is one of just a few dozen times in American history that it’s been used-most often to control unchecked uprisings and raging citywide riots. Presidents have great latitude to use it without oversight, unchecked by congressional review - but possibly checked by the judicial system. Legal experts say the courts can review after deployment if there are allegations a president ""acted in bad faith.""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/10/efe_ba2ab246b270a0798863e310c7b8acac28dc6bc4w.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-14 13:58:02.010257

Obama was keeping his fragile program intact by withholding the sticks and being generous with the carrots.
But the House lawsuit was more fundamental: Did the president have a kind of “prosecutorial discretion” that went beyond the criminal law?
Could the president move money around to pay for his priorities without congressional approval?
Rather than accept lame-duck status, Obama had announced before the election that he would stretch his executive authority to get around Congress.","In 2014, Congress sued the executive branch over the president’s refusal to enforce the law. It was kind of a mind-bender because the majority in Congress hated the law that wasn’t being enforced — ObamaCare — and had repeatedly tried to kill it entirely.

But there we were: U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell, in which the Republican-controlled House sued over the failure to implement provisions of then-President Obama’s signature health insurance law that the same lawmakers who brought the suit said would cripple businesses by requiring large employers to provide insurance for workers.

Another, more obvious, claim from Republicans was that the administration was using a kind of slush fund in the Treasury Department to pay subsidies to insurance companies that hadn’t been included in the original legislation passed by Democrats alone four years earlier.

Obama was keeping his fragile program intact by withholding the sticks and being generous with the carrots. There were all kinds of lawsuits from states and organizations over specific provisions, notably the requirement that policies from religious groups still had to cover birth control and that very pricey employer mandate. But the House lawsuit was more fundamental: Did the president have a kind of “prosecutorial discretion” that went beyond the criminal law? Could the president move money around to pay for his priorities without congressional approval?

That question of prosecutorial discretion was a hot one just then. The day before the lawsuit was filed in November — which was just weeks after Democrats had taken a terrible drubbing in the midterms — Obama had unleashed a raft of executive orders to shield as many as 5 million migrants without legal status from deportation and grant them a path to citizenship. Rather than accept lame-duck status, Obama had announced before the election that he would stretch his executive authority to get around Congress. His ObamaCare moves and, more significantly, immigration decrees were pretty clearly meant to be understood as putting Republicans on notice that he would go it alone.

Democrats called the suit a stunt, and the party and the health care industry came down hard on the case, including scaring off the big law firm that had initially agreed to take it. Even some on the right who coveted executive power for themselves opposed the suit. Then, there were the political calculations. What if the House won and employers got crushed by mandates and customers saw their premiums skyrocket?

But House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) plowed ahead anyway.

“If this president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well,” he said. “The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action.”

Remember that this was back when Democrats were very fond of the Roberts court’s deference to executive authority. The decision he wrote upholding the mandates as a “tax” had vaulted Chief Justice John Roberts into the firmament with Earl Warren and David Souter as the kind of Republican-appointed justice whom Democrats could love. Strange new respect was all around.

When a lower court judge appointed by former President George W. Bush threw out the part of the suit about enforcement but let the part about the slush fund proceed, the White House responded by calling it “just another partisan attack” and vowed to win on appeal. But the case went ahead, and in May of 2016, the judge ruled that “Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one.”

Had Hillary Clinton won that year’s presidential election as was expected at the time, the case would have certainly landed in the high court and we might have seen what could have been the biggest case on the separation of powers in decades. But she did not win, and new House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) swiftly came to terms with the incoming Trump administration to drop the suit because the new president would eliminate the dubious payments.

It was a smart play for Ryan because there was little sense in risking what could have been a ruling against congressional authority over a program that he, and most in Washington, believed would not survive the first year of the new administration.

As it turned out, everyone was wrong again. ObamaCare not only survived, but we are at this very moment watching Republicans discuss how long to extend extra subsidies passed in 2021 as a pandemic boost. Should it be for one more year or a $415 billion outlay to cover the next decade?

Obama was right about the premise of his executive overreaches. If he could just keep the program running long enough to get a critical mass of enrollments, it would become unrepealable from a political point of view.

Thanks in part to shifting partisan coalitions, Republicans are very much dependent on the working-class voters who like the expanded Medicaid benefits and the well-off older Americans who use ObamaCare to bridge the gap between employer insurance and Medicare.

Just as these subsidies will be extended, you can bet that one day Republicans will undo this year’s Medicaid cuts they craftily delayed until after the midterms. They took the revenue now for cuts that probably won’t ever fully go into effect. “Repeal and replace” has become “preserve and expand.”

But Boehner was right, too. One president got away with making his own laws, and future presidents have indeed done the same.

In the current funding fight, the power of Congress is to inflict pain by refusing to appropriate funds. And on the list of pain points in a shutdown, none surpass the troops going unpaid.

But by quiet, bipartisan assent, that’s being taken off the table as the president just moves some money around to make payroll. Just add that to the list of laws the president either just ignores or skirts, from the unilateral declaration of war against drug cartels to the TikTok ban.

The courts have rightly pushed back on such blind deference, with the 9th Circuit rejecting the DOJ’s argument that the president’s determination is unreviewable.
While not deferring completely to the president, courts have nevertheless given DOJ significant deference, in accordance with how they have historically treated the president’s determinations regarding exigencies that threaten national security or involve foreign policy.
Even applying such deference, however, lower courts have concluded, at least preliminarily, that the president’s determination about the situation in U.S. cities where he has sought to deploy the National Guard does not reflect “a colorable assessment of the facts and law within a ‘range of honest judgment.’” This hesitation to defer to the president’s determination is warranted, not only because, in the words of Judge Karin Immergut in the Oregon case, that presidential determination was “simply untethered to the facts,” but also because the reasons for historical deference to the judgment of the Executive Branch in matters of national security and foreign policy have been severely undermined during the first eight months of the Trump administration.
Deference to the president based on his superior access to intelligence information provided by seasoned intelligence analysts and counterterrorism and counterintelligence experts is no longer warranted where: (1) many of these experts have been fired or stripped of their security clearances for political and retaliatory reasons; (2) presidential determinations have been contrary to the considered assessments of the intelligence community (for example, contrary to Trump administration claims regarding the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TDA), the declassified National Intelligence Council assessment that “the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in theUnited States”); and (3) the administration has pushed the envelope on compliance with court orders and then sought to shield itself from review by invoking deference in matters of foreign policy and national security.","In the recent cases challenging the federalization and deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has repeatedly argued that the courts should defer to the president’s determination that protests against ICE activity in those cities has rendered the government “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” and constitutes a form of “rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” – two of the possible conditions to federalization under 10 U.S.C. § 12406.

Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.
Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled.
ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said.
Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.","The Nigerian man described being roused with other detainees in September in the middle of the night. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers clasped shackles on their hands and feet, he said, and told them they were being sent to Ghana, even though none of them was from there.

When they asked to speak to their attorney, he said, the officers refused and straitjacketed the already-shackled men in full-body restraint suits called the WRAP, then loaded them onto a plane for the 16-hour-flight to West Africa.

Referred to as “the burrito” or “the bag,” the WRAP has become a harrowing part of deportations for some immigrants.

“It was just like a kidnapping,” the Nigerian man, who’s part of a federal lawsuit, told The Associated Press in an interview from the detainment camp in which he and other deportees were being held in Ghana. Like others placed in the restraints interviewed by the AP, he spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The AP identified multiple examples of ICE using the black-and-yellow full-body restraint device, the WRAP, in deportations. Its use was described to the AP by five people who said they were restrained in the device, sometimes for hours, on ICE deportation flights dating to 2020. And witnesses and family members in four countries told the AP about its use on at least seven other people this year.

The AP found ICE has used the device despite internal concerns voiced in a 2023 report by the civil rights division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in part due to reports of deaths involving use of the WRAP by local law enforcement. And the AP has identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

The WRAP is the subject of a growing number of federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture, whether used in a jail or by immigration authorities during international flights. Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.

DHS has paid Safe Restraints Inc., the WRAP’s California-based maker, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015 during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending. ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it’s not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

The WRAP’s manufacturer says it intended the device to be a lifesaver for law enforcement confronting erratic people who were physically attacking officers or harming themselves.

But ICE officials have a much lower threshold for deploying the WRAP than the manufacturer advises, the AP found. Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled. They said this was done to intimidate or punish them for asking to speak to their attorneys or expressing fear at being deported, often to places they fled due to violence and torture.

The West African deportee described a terrifying, hourslong experience that left his legs swollen to the point where he walked with a limp.

“They bundled me and my colleagues,” he said, “tied us up in a straitjacket.”

ICE and DHS would not answer detailed questions from the AP and refused a request for the government’s policy for when and how to use the WRAP.

“The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights has been long standing, standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’ spokesperson, said in an email to AP. “Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.”

The agency would not specify those authorities or describe its practices.

“The use of these devices is inhumane and incompatible with our nation’s fundamental values,” said Noah Baron, an attorney for the West African deportees.

Charles Hammond, CEO of Safe Restraints Inc., said his company has made a modified version of the device for ICE, with changes meant to allow people to be kept in it during flights and long bus trips.

ICE’s version includes a ring on the front of the suit that allows a subject’s cuffed hands to be attached while still allowing for limited use to eat and drink, he said. In addition, the ICE version has “soft elbow cuffs,” Hammond said, which connect in the back so a person can move for proper circulation but can’t flip an elbow out to hit someone.

An AP reporter recounted for Hammond some of the allegations made by people who had been placed in the WRAP for long flights. All of those interviewed by AP said their hands and feet were already restrained by chains. All denied fighting with officers, saying they were either crying or pleading against their deportation to countries they deemed dangerous.

Hammond said that, if true that some people were not being violent and simply protesting verbally, putting them in the WRAP could be improper use.

“That’s not the purpose of the WRAP. If (the deportee) is a current or potential risk to themselves, to officers, to staff, to the plane, restraints are justified. If it’s not, then restraints aren’t.”

‘Please help me’

Juan Antonio Pineda said he was put into “a bag” in late September and driven by immigration officers to the Mexico border. It was black with yellow stripes and had straps that immobilized his body and connected over his shoulders — the WRAP.

Pineda, who is from El Salvador, was in the U.S. legally, he said in a video from an ICE detention center in Arizona. On Sept. 3, he went to an appointment in Maryland to get permission for another year, his wife, Xiomara Ochoa, said in an interview from El Salvador. Instead, he was detained by ICE and told he’d be deported to Mexico, but the documents he was shown had someone else’s name, he said. Even so, he was sent to the Florence Service Processing Center detention facility in Arizona.

Early morning on Wednesday, Sept. 24, he said officers tied his hands and legs, placed him into the “bag” and drove him four hours to the border. When he refused to sign the deportation papers, Pineda alleges officers broke his right arm and gave him a black eye before driving him back another four hours in the “bag.” The AP was unable to independently confirm how he was injured. Pineda’s video shows him with a cast on his arm and bruising on his face.

The next day, Thursday, Sept. 25, they tied him up again, put him in the bag and drove him to the border, where Mexican immigration officials turned him away, he said.

“Eight hours there and back and they don’t give me food or water or anything,” he said in the video, which his wife shared with the AP. “Please help me.”

He was ultimately deported to Mexico, Ochoa said.

ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP regarding Pineda’s case.

In addition to the Nigerian man flown to Ghana, four others interviewed by AP said they were placed in the WRAP and carried onto deportation flights since the first Trump administration.

As U.S. immigration officials move aggressively to meet the president’s deportation goals, advocates and attorneys for immigrants are echoing the concerns of the government’s own civil rights inquiry that ICE officers aren’t trained on how to use the restraints.

“This should be a last resort type of restraint after they’ve already tried other things,” said Fatma Marouf, a Texas A&M law professor who has sued ICE over its use of the device. “Just being bound up like that can inflict a lot of psychological harm.”

Some deportees said they were left in the WRAP for an entire fight. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the Nigerian man and four others currently detained in Dema Camp, Ghana, included the allegation from one that ICE left the restraint suit on him for 16 hours, only once undoing the lower part so he could use the bathroom.

“No one should be put into a WRAP. I don’t even think they strap animals like that,” recalled a man who said he suffered a concussion and dislocated jaw being placed into the device in 2023 before a deportation flight to Cape Verde, an African island nation. AP’s review of his medical records confirmed he suffered those injuries in 2023.

“It was the most painful thing I’ve been through,” said the man, adding he was restrained most of the 10-hour flight. “Forget the assault, forget the broken jaw. Just the WRAP itself was hurtful.”

Also, the man said, the metal ring his cuffed hands were attached to — one of the ICE modifications to the WRAP designed to increase comfort — injured him. “When they slammed me face forward on the floor, that metal ring dug into my chest causing me bruising and pain which was part of my injuries that I complained about.”

ICE’s current use of the WRAP comes amid an unprecedented wave of masked federal immigration officers grabbing suspected immigrants off the street, and mounting accusations that the Trump administration has dehumanized them, including by subjecting them to cruel and unusual detention conditions.

ICE’s use of the WRAP has continued despite a 2023 report by DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or CRCL, that raised serious concerns over the lack of policies governing its use.

ICE agreed with the internal findings on some points, a then-DHS official involved in the review said, but challenged the notion that the WRAP should be classified as a “four-point restraint,” a designation that would place more limitations on its use. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the inquiry.

DHS largely dismantled the office that produced the 2023 report earlier this year amid widespread government firings, calling it a roadblock to enforcement operations.

“Without changes to the current training, and the lack of policy, CRCL has serious concerns about ICE’s continued use of the WRAP,” wrote the report’s authors, who cited a news article mentioning lawsuits claiming the device had led to deaths.

Use by police and in jails

Last year police officers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, placed Rolin Hill in the WRAP, saying he was being combative during an arrest at a convenience store. The officers left Hill in the device when they dropped him at the jail. Video from the jail shows deputies punching the WRAP-immobilized Hill in the head and back. Hill died in a hospital, and while the WRAP’s exact role is unknown, Hill’s death was ruled a homicide by “positional and mechanical asphyxia due to restraint with neck and torso compression.” Three of the deputies are now charged with his murder, and five were removed from their jobs.

Also last year, in Missouri, prosecutors charged five jailers in the death of Othel Moore Jr., who according to an autopsy asphyxiated in the WRAP. Jailhouse footage showed Moore, who’d also been sprayed with tear gas and placed in a “spit mask” covering his face, repeatedly told officers he couldn’t breathe.

AP identified many of the other non-ICE cases involving the WRAP during an investigation into deaths after police subdued people with common tactics that, unlike guns, are meant to stop someone without killing them.

While Hammond insists the WRAP has never been determined as the cause of death when used properly, the AP identified 43 times in which the WRAP was used by police or correctional officers in a case in which someone died. In 12 of those cases the official autopsy determined that “restraint” played some role in the death.

It was often impossible to determine the exact role the WRAP may have played, as deaths often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who in several cases were high on methamphetamine.

The WRAP first appeared in law enforcement in the late 1990s, presented as an alternative to tying a subject’s hands and feet together in a practice known as “hog-tying.” It first found widespread use in California jails and today is used by more than 1,800 departments and facilities around the country, according to the manufacturer, which says it has sold more than 10,000 devices.

Many of these cases have drawn little media attention, such as the 2020 case of Alberto Pena, who was jailed on a misdemeanor criminal mischief charge after getting drunk and damaging the walls and doors at his parents’ home outside Rio Grande City, Texas. The 30-year-old became erratic on the way to the Starr County Jail, beating his own head against the inside of the patrol unit and, later, the wall of his cell.

Deputies placed Pena in the WRAP for more than two hours, where he repeatedly cried out for help and complained he could not breathe. But he was left unattended in the device for significant periods of time, court records show, and no medical attention was provided for his self-inflicted head injuries.

An autopsy ruled Pena’s death “accidental,” but a forensic pathologist hired by the family attributed Pena’s death in part to the WRAP’s “prolonged restraint” and said it “could have been averted” with proper medical care.

“The WRAP should have never been used in this situation. It was a medical emergency and he should have been taken to the hospital,” said Natasha Powers-Marakis, a former police officer and use of force expert who reviewed the case on behalf of Pena’s family as part of their wrongful death lawsuit against the county and officers who placed him in the device. The arresting officers had been told Pena suffered from bipolar disorder.

The Starr County Sheriff’s Office has denied wrongdoing and maintained Pena did not require medical care. Robert Drinkard, an attorney for the county, told AP the use of the WRAP “was neither improper nor caused Mr. Pena’s tragic death.” He added that each deputy involved in placing Pena in the WRAP had been trained in its application.

A federal judge recently dismissed the Pena family’s lawsuit, ruling the deputies were shielded from liability.

‘Carrying me like a corpse’

In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer’s CEO, argues.

ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said. Given the high stakes of a violent confrontation on an airplane, Hammond believes cases like those described to the AP can warrant the WRAP’s use, even if the person is already in chains.

However, properly trained agents are supposed to loosen the straps and allow enough movement so the subject can eat and drink, as well as use the bathroom.

“With the WRAP, when it is used properly, it’s a shorter fight, which is good for everybody. It prioritizes breathing, which is good for everybody. And you have no more fight and can provide medical care or mental health care or de-escalation efforts,” Hammond said.

Those placed in one of Hammond’s restraint suits, however, recount the experience as traumatic.

One of these people was first put into five-point shackles when he became dizzy and tripped while ascending the stairs to board the ICE flight to Cameroon in November 2020. The officer mistook his stumbling as resistance, he said. Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.

Soon, he felt the straps cinching around his legs and upper body.

“They bundled me like a log of wood from all the sides and they were just carrying me like a corpse,” he said.

Another man interviewed by the AP said ICE officers put him in the WRAP after he initially resisted efforts to move him onto a deportation flight in Alexandria, Louisiana, in 2020. He’d fled political violence and persecution in his native Cameroon, and was afraid to go back. He said officers took him out of his cell in front of the other detainees and put him in the WRAP, leaving him for hours in view of the others as a warning to them not to speak up.

“I told him ‘I can’t breathe,’” the man said. “He responded, ’I don’t care, I’m doing my job.’”

“All those other people are getting taken.” Days after Cruz had the encounter with federal agents, Cruz attended a hastily organized protest in Rogers Park residents.","CHICAGO — Rueben Antonio Cruz was sitting with a friend in Rogers Park when ICE agents pulled up onto the street.

The immigration officers stopped their truck and went straight after them on Oct. 9, Cruz told the Tribune.

“They asked us if we have papers. I said I do but I don’t have them on me,” Cruz, a 60-year old man with heart problems originally from El Salvador, recalled in Spanish.

The agents stood Cruz up, put him in their truck, drove around in circles, and asked questions, he said.

Where was he born? What is his name? Who is his mother? Who is his father?

“I told them, they are dead,” Cruz said. The agents said they needed the information anyway so they could look him up in their databases. Eventually, the agents verified that he is, in fact, legally in the country. And they let him go.

But not before writing him a $130 ticket for not having his papers. Cruz’s friend, who is homeless, did not have legal status and was taken away by the feds.

Under federal law, registered foreign nationals must carry proof of registration with them at all times. But prior to a second Trump administration, it was rarely enforced. As President Donald Trump escalates his immigration crackdown in Chicago and its suburbs, “Operation Midway Blitz,” agents are using broad federal authority when targeting suspected immigrants, legal experts say.

The Department of Homeland Security announced Oct. 1 that it had made 800 arrests in the area since the mission began at the beginning of September.

While federal officials claim they are targeting the “worst of the worst,” bystanders have been swept up and people across the Chicagoland region have accused the government of widespread civil rights violations. In blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois last week, U.S. District Judge April Perry said the federal government had a credibility problem that made many of their claims “unreliable.”

The National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago told the Tribune it has not yet seen any of its clients receive this sort of citation. But it’s part of a recent push by the Trump administration to ensure immigrants register with authorities and maintain their documentation to them at all times or face potential penalties.

The Immigrant Legal Resource Center calls it a “hateful tactic” meant to “cause panic and fear throughout the country.”

“America has never been a place where people need to ‘show one’s papers.’ Ticketing a lawful permanent resident — and forcing him to appear in court and pay a fine for not carrying their papers — is unnecessary and cruel,” said Ed Yohnka, communications director for the ACLU of Illinois. “It does not make our communities stronger or more safe. It is simply part of the Trump Administration’s attempt to make life uncomfortable for all immigrants. It is just awful.”

A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not return messages seeking comment.

It’s not clear how many individuals have been ticketed for not having their papers on them. The ticket Cruz showed the Tribune references a law requiring immigrants to be registered with the government and have their registration documents.

A former dishwasher, Cruz lives in a government-funded apartment but isn’t working due to his health. Cruz said he was relieved to be released but worries how he will pay the fine. The ICE agents told Cruz he has to pay it within 60 days or go to court.

“It’s not fair because I said, let’s go to my house and I’ll show you my papers. I’m a resident,” Cruz said.

U.S. citizens say they’re also being questioned by federal immigration agents for proof of citizenship.

Maria Greeley, 44, had just finished working a double shift at the Beach Bar on Ohio Street earlier this month when she said she was surrounded by three federal agents who grabbed her, forced her hands behind her back and zip tied her.

Headphones in, Greeley had been focused on getting home to her two dogs for a walk. Instead, she said she was detained by masked agents who did not answer when she asked for names. They questioned her for an hour, she said.

Greeley, who was born at Illinois Masonic hospital and is adopted, carries a copy of her passport just in case she runs into federal agents.

“I am Latina and I am a service worker,” Greeley said. “I fit the description of what they’re looking for now.”

During the encounter, Greeley said they told her she “doesn’t look like” a Greeley.

“They said this isn’t real, they kept telling me I’m lying, I’m a liar,” Greeley recalled. “I told them to look in the rest of my wallet, I have my credit cards, my insurance.”

When the agents let her go, Greeley got home and screamed when she saw the shadow on her door. Days after the incident, Greeley said, it’s still “terrifying.”

“I just have to stay strong and not think about it, I’m still here, luckily,” she said, tearing up. “All those other people are getting taken.”

Days after Cruz had the encounter with federal agents, Cruz attended a hastily organized protest in Rogers Park residents. Hundreds turned out.

Ald. Maria Hadden, 49th, represents the Far North Side neighborhood on Chicago’s City Council. She said it was an effort to “recognize people from our community who were taken” and bring people together “to remind them that we are not powerless.”

The protest organizer group, Protect Rogers Park, posted on Facebook: “Today 400+ Rogers Parkers gathered to mourn, celebrate, defy authoritarianism, (canvass) and recommit to loving their neighbors. Oh, and buy a lot of tacos.”

Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a cosponsor of the bill who is working to get fellow conservatives on board with the effort.
“I think Trump, perhaps inadvertently, is strengthening our case for the bill,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), another co-sponsor of the legislation.
“There’s no appetite for immigration legislation at all,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The American economy relies heavily on H-1B visas, with the number of people applying for slots vastly outnumbering those which are available each year.
Almost a year ago, the billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk was touting high-skilled immigration throughout the United States through H-1B visas, saying they were necessary to help fuel innovation.","The recent presidential proclamation forcing employers to pay $100,000 to hire workers under H-1B visas — a move designed to incentivize domestic hiring practices — is instilling fear and confusion inside hospitals and universities that rely on the program. It also has sent a jolt through the Senate, where the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee recently reintroduced legislation designed to strengthen the rules for the program and prioritize applicants with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering or mathematics.

“We need an immigration bill, badly,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a cosponsor of the bill who is working to get fellow conservatives on board with the effort. He’s also running for governor of a state with multiple major research universities.

“I think Trump, perhaps inadvertently, is strengthening our case for the bill,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), another co-sponsor of the legislation.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, however, are skeptical there is sufficient political will to make any meaningful progress on the issue. Immigration hard-liners still occupy senior positions throughout the White House and hold power on Capitol Hill; Trump has waffled on the question of whether the H-1B policy is worth preserving; and at least one key Democrat says any conservative enthusiasm now to tackle the program is too little, too late.

“There’s no appetite for immigration legislation at all,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is set to retire in 2027 with little to show for his work over nearly three decades in office to pass legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants.

The American economy relies heavily on H-1B visas, with the number of people applying for slots vastly outnumbering those which are available each year. And this is not the first time lawmakers have seen a glimmer of hope around efforts to overhaul the program — only to later see it fade.

Almost a year ago, the billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk was touting high-skilled immigration throughout the United States through H-1B visas, saying they were necessary to help fuel innovation. Trump, who suspended the program during his first term, suddenly appeared ready to side with Musk, lauding the initiative that he claimed to have leveraged for his own business interests.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a MAGA stalwart and Musk acolyte, also signaled an openness to revisiting the H-1B system from his perch as chair of the House Judiciary Committee.

But Musk has since that time had a public falling-out with the president, and anti-immigration hawks like White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller have Trump’s ear. Trump’s new H-1B visa fee is a reflection of the administration’s current stance.

“Anything that’s going to get done, the president’s got to sign off on it,” said Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), “So it’s going to be something that the president feels comfortable with.”

Scott worked on a previous effort to limit the number of H-1B recipients who can receive green cards annually. Different versions of that bill passed the House and the Senate in 2019 and 2020, respectively, but the two measures were never reconciled, and the legislation was never signed into law.

Wishing to seize the moment but also cognizant of the political challenges ahead, Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in an interview shifted his comments to deliver a personal plea to Trump himself.

“The president has brought attention to the problems with H-1B’s,” the Iowa Republican said. “If the president will read your story, I’d give him this message: He’s created great credibility because he has closed down the border — great credibility on immigration issues.”

Endorsing an H-1B overhaul bill, Grassley continued, “would give him a chance to get some of these really simple things in immigration that ought to pass the Congress.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on its intentions to work with Congress on a legislative fix.

George Fishman, a senior legal fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies and former Department of Homeland Security official in the first Trump administration, said Trump is being pulled in radically different directions by those advising him. Barring true interest from Trump in the matter, Fishman suspected congressional action is unlikely.

“Based on three decades of bitter experience, I’m sort of resigned to not expecting things to happen legislatively,” said Fishman, who also worked on immigration policy as a Hill aide.

Trump aside, the political dynamics around the immigration issue on Capitol Hill are broadly problematic. For years, efforts to update the nation’s outdated immigration policy have fallen short. A bipartisan Senate “gang” in 2013 managed to pass a bill that combined border security with a pathway to citizenship, but it was never taken up in the House.

Since that time, the Trump ethos around immigration has further polarized the issue, hardening even Republicans who at one point linked their personal brands to being willing to work with Democrats on it.

That includes Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who was once Durbin’s main partner in trying to pass legislation that would protect young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children — the recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.

Graham now says he isn’t interested in doing anything to expand legal immigration until the border is properly secured — and he doesn’t trust Democrats to restrain themselves.

“We all are agreed that we need H-1B reform,” Graham said in an interview. “Well, then Democrats will say, ‘Okay, let’s reform that, but what about the DACA folks?’ And they’ll want something there, and that’s just the way it goes.”

Grassley said he understood that reality. “We got some people on the right that think they aren’t going to vote for any [immigration] legislation until you load up 12 million people and get them out of the country.”

In the meantime, Trump’s new $100,000 fee is being challenged in court by a coalition of unions, education groups and others who argue the cost is unworkable and unjustified. A judge could strike down the proclamation, and the case is ongoing.

Until then, Grassley suggested the chaos and anxiety being caused by the presidential action could work to the advantage of the program’s proponents.

“The business groups that fought the Grassley-Durbin bill over the last 10 years, that are now upset with the $100,000 the president’s putting in on each one of these [visas] … maybe they would realize that they shouldn’t have fought our legislation,” he said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F0a%2F21%2Fa4f5d7dc4d86bb0a6f83ba9a9c0e%2Fu-s-congress-03541.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 07:58:19.658425

Even as an appeals court allowed a federal judge to temporarily block the Trump administration from sending 500 National Guard troops into Chicago, teams of masked immigration enforcement agents staged a series of increasingly aggressive raids across the city’s North Side.

U.S. District Court Judge April Perry issued an order on Thursday blocking “the federalization and deployment” of 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, 200 members of the Texas National Guard and 14 members of the California National Guard into Illinois.

The Trump administration immediately appealed that order to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which allowed Perry’s ruling blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois to stand, while halting her order stopping President Donald Trump from federalizing those troops.

That decision means that the hundreds of National Guard troops remain at a military facility near Joliet, where they arrived last week, but are blocked by Perry’s order from doing anything other than training on land controlled by the federal government.

But the outcome of what promises to be just the first skirmish in a lengthy legal battle that could reach all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court did nothing to stop immigration agents from carrying out the Trump administration’s combative immigration enforcement operation dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The operations carried out by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents, including members of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol, appeared to be concentrated in neighborhoods away from the course of the 47th annual Chicago Marathon, which went off without disruption despite widespread concerns.

A WGN-TV employee was detained by Border Patrol officials on Friday near Lincoln Square on the city’s North Side before being released without charges several hours later. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, that the employee “was arrested for throwing objects at law enforcement.”

As agents left that scene, they struck a vehicle and did not stop.

“Several violent agitators used vehicles to block in agents to impede & assault federal officers. In fear of public & law enforcement safety, officers used their service vehicle to strike a suspect’s vehicle and create an opening,” McLaughlin posted.

After several people were detained Thursday and Friday in the Far North Side neighborhood of Rogers Park, hundreds of people rallied Saturday near Clark Street and Lunt Avenue, the location of at least one of the raids, Block Club Chicago reported.

After immigration enforcement agents were reported outside nearby St. Jerome Catholic Church, video of a priest warning parishioners about leaving Mass unaccompanied early Sunday went viral. After word of that warning spread, a human chain formed to protect attendees, witnesses told NBC Chicago.

Community organizations have been working to identify the location of federal agents in Chicago neighborhoods to warn undocumented immigrants of their presence. Groups have distributed whistles and created text and phone networks to sound the alarm.

During a separate incident Sunday morning, federal agents appeared to point a gun at a man who was objecting to their activities in a Rogers Park alley, according to several videos of the incident posted on social media.

But perhaps the most violent encounter between Chicagoans angry about immigration enforcement operations occurred Sunday afternoon in Albany Park, on the city’s Northwest Side, when a group of Chicagoans confronted four vehicles of agents, as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times.

After agents shoved people to the ground, the agents dispersed tear gas — without any warning — to the dozens of people nearby, according to witnesses and videos posted on social media.

A federal judge ordered agents to issue two warnings before using tear gas.

‘Unreliable’ Assertions by the Trump Administration

Although lawyers for the state of Illinois and city of Chicago had asked Perry to block President Donald Trump from deploying the military into Illinois, she found that there had not been sufficient evidence presented that the president planned to take that step.

The Posse Comitatus Act, which dates to 1878, is a criminal law that bars the use of the military for domestic policing.

Trump has said he would consider enacting the Insurrection Act, which allows presidents to deploy the U.S. military within the country in response to what is determined to be an insurrection against the government, if judges block his deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois and Portland, Oregon.

“So far it hasn’t been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I’d do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors, or mayors were holding us up, sure I’d do that.”

Read Perry’s full order.

Perry said she found federal officials’ assertions that federal agents had been subjected to serious and coordinated violence by protestors “unreliable.”

Perry wrote that she took note of “a troubling trend of Defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”

“This indicates to the Court both bias and lack of objectivity,” Perry wrote.

Perry also concluded that she could not “find reasonable support for a conclusion that there exists in Illinois a danger of rebellion satisfying the demands” of the federal law allowing the president to federalize the National Guard.

“The unrest Defendants complain of has consisted entirely of opposition (indeed, sometimes violent) to a particular federal agency and the laws it is charged with enforcing. That is not opposition to the authority of the federal government as a whole,” Perry wrote. “Defendants have offered no explanation supporting the notion that widespread opposition to immigration enforcement constitutes the makings of a broader opposition to the authority of the federal government.”

Perry, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, was first tapped to serve as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Her confirmation to that post was blocked by former U.S. Sen. JD Vance, who is now vice president.

‘Countermanding the President’s Military Judgment’: Feds

During Thursday’s historic hearing, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton repeatedly asserted that Perry must give the president’s determination that the deployment of the National Guard is necessary “great deference.”

“The president’s judgement is unreviewable,” Hamilton said.

In its appeal, the Trump administration said Perry had misapplied the law.

“In countermanding the president’s military judgment, the district court largely ignored the facts on the ground, relied on an improper … factual investigation, and rested on an adverse ‘credibility’ finding that had no basis in the record,” according to lawyers for the Trump administration.

The appeals court panel could decide at any time whether to take up the Trump administration’s appeal and whether to allow the deployment of federalized National Guard troops while it resolves the case.

Perry scheduled the next hearing in the case for 9 a.m. Oct. 22, when she said she will consider extending the temporary restraining order she issued for an additional 14 days before the initial order expires at 11:59 p.m. Oct. 23.

Nearly 2,500 federalized National Guard troops from several states led by Republicans have been in Washington, D.C., since August.

While the president has credited those troops with lowering crime in the nation’s capital, crime data shows no significant drop in violent crime, records show. National Guard members have picked up trash and helped package meals for unhoused residents, according to the Associated Press.

A lawsuit brought by D.C.'s attorney general is challenging the deployment, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 24.

Of the more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines sent to Los Angeles, approximately 100 California National Guard members remain under federal authority, officials said, including the 14 soldiers sent to Illinois to provide “training and subject matter expertise.”

Los Angeles and California officials challenged that deployment in federal court. A judge found not only was it illegal, but the activities of the military violated the Posse Comitatus Act. That order has been halted by an appeals court, but the litigation remains ongoing.

Trump has also ordered National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, despite Gov. Tina Kotek’s objections.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, said the president’s claims of daily unrest in Portland were “untethered to facts” and risked violating the U.S. Constitution by imposing military rule. Immergut has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops into Portland.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could decide at any time whether to overturn Immergut’s ruling.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-14 09:57:41.546410

During an interaction Sunday with immigration agents in Northwest Side neighborhood Albany Park, video appears to show agents deploying tear gas against the public without any audible warning - something that is unlawful under a court order from last week.

Other images show immigration agents outside of a church in Rogers Park that same day during a Spanish-language Mass.

That is prompting questions over whether they had warrants targeting specific people or were there without warrants, something that requires additional probable cause and an assessment of an immigrant's flight risk.

""What we have seen now to a much larger scale is federal agents indiscriminately stopping and arresting people without warrants and without probable cause required by federal immigration laws,"" said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center.

A fence still up around the Broadview ICE facility is restricting access to a public road on Monday night after a judge ruled it should be taken down. The deadline to do so is Tuesday night -- but what happens if that does not happen?

Former federal prosecutor Ron Safer said, ""I am very worried about where we are right now. We are on the precipice, looking into the abyss of chaos, because if the norms of the government are not respected, if somebody says, the judiciary makes a decision, and then the executive branch ignores it.

Safer explained federal judges can rule according to the law, but if the executive branch, in this case federal agents, refuse to follow those rulings, judges don't have an army to enforce their orders.

""Normally, judges enforce their ruling by contempt orders, and then the person who is violating the order is fined or imprisoned, if it's bad enough. How do you do that to a cabinet level official, and who is going to enforce that?"" he asked.

At that point, the constitution and American norms require the executive branch to enforce itself.

That is something Safer is skeptical the president will do.

""It is norms that presidents will respect the decisions of the courts, that they will respect the views of the governors. That's out the window. None of the norms are being observed, and that is going to create, and is creating crises on the streets and in Washington and across the country,"" he said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18000976_101325-wls-iteam-mark-court-orders-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-14 11:59:34.880249

Andrea Peña-Vasquez, an assistant professor of international affairs who specializes in immigration at the School of Public and International Affairs, said the University may see more stark effects in international enrollment next year.","International student enrollment dropped this fall, which comes on the heels of the Trump administration’s restrictive immigration policy.

This fall, undergraduate enrollment increased by about 4.5% — marking an increase from 20,418 undergraduate students last year to 21,388 this year. Though most enrollment numbers increased across the board, international student enrollment dropped by approximately 6%. This comes after President Donald Trump’s 2025 strict immigration policies and harsh rhetoric against immigrants.

Most international students at U.S. universities use the F-1 or J-1 visa. The F-1 visa is used most commonly for international students to study in the U.S., while the J-1 visa is generally used for short-term academic exchange programs.

This fall, 2,711 students with F-1 and J-1 visas enrolled at Pitt while last fall, the number was at 2,860 students, according to University spokesperson Jared Stonesifer.

According to Stonesifer, there is no “reliable mechanism” for the University to predict future enrollment percentages with the uncertainty of current immigration policy.

“Students are advised to weigh these challenges against the substantial benefits of a U.S. education at our institution,” Stonesifer said. “The University is committed to monitoring changes in policy, visa processing and global events that may impact international students’ ability to study in the United States and to providing support strategies based on evolving circumstances.”

On April 9, the Trump administration revoked a Pitt student’s visa and two recent graduates’ visas. Shortly after, Student Government Board announced the students’ legal statuses were restored in the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.

In early October, the Trump administration sent a memo to nine U.S. colleges — not including Pitt — with specific requirements to get preferential access to federal funds. One requirement said universities can have no more than 15% internationally exchanged undergraduate students.

The University approved 215 H1-B visas in 2025, non-immigrant visas for highly educated foreign professionals to work in specialized jobs at universities and companies. Trump instituted a new $100,000 H1-B worker visa application fee in September, which previously cost $215.

Andrea Peña-Vasquez, an assistant professor of international affairs who specializes in immigration at the School of Public and International Affairs, said the University may see more stark effects in international enrollment next year.

“We might see people choosing to stay in their home countries or look into other places other than the U.S. to come for school,” Peña-Vasquez said. “Other countries that also offer opportunities for international students might become more appealing in the future because of [national immigration policy changes].”

Peña-Vasquez said she thinks federal immigration policies will harm SPIA, too.

“At SPIA, especially, we have such a large international population,” Peña-Vasquez said. ”Our international students really bring in this wealth of perspective that our domestic students benefit so greatly from.”

Peña-Vasquez said as a political scientist, she believes in the “soft power” of person-to-person discussion and connecting through educational opportunities, which international students contribute to.

“We learn so much from [international students], and the ones that do return to their home countries end up bringing back lessons from the U.S. about democracy and things like American culture,” Peña-Vasquez said. “I think that is such an important part of soft power, and I think now we’re going to see this decrease in these exchanges.”

Stonesifer said the University is working with public officials on all levels to advocate for international students.

“We work with the University’s elected officials, Pennsylvania’s Congressional delegation and federal agencies to advocate on behalf of our international community,” Stonesifer said.

“However, parliament was unable to examine this treaty.” The challenge comes as 25 asylum seekers returned to France under the terms of the treaty have drafted a joint statement about their situation in France, shared with the Guardian.

“The agreement between the UK and France will go down as a dark chapter in history because it has abandoned us completely.","Fifteen French and UK human rights organisations are calling for the suspension of the controversial “one in, one out” treaty in a legal challenge that has been launched in France.

The deal, signed by the UK and France in July, involves one asylum seeker who arrives in the UK from France in a small boat being sent back there in exchange for another selected in France to come to the UK.

Those supporting the challenge include Utopia 56, Auberge des Migrants, Secours Catholique and Doctors of the World.

Lionel Crusoé, the French lawyer bringing the challenge, said: “We have filed an appeal with the Council of State against the decree publishing the Franco-British agreement. We challenge the readmission measures provided for in this agreement.

“These measures do not provide sufficient guarantees to take into account the specific situation of exiles. Furthermore, the ‘one-to-one’ approach seems highly questionable and does not sufficiently respect the principle of human dignity.”

He added that part of the case is that the conditions breach the French constitution, saying that before the treaty came into force, a bill ratifying it should have been submitted to the French parliament. “However, parliament was unable to examine this treaty.”

The challenge comes as 25 asylum seekers returned to France under the terms of the treaty have drafted a joint statement about their situation in France, shared with the Guardian. They say they need to “urgently bring attention to the extremely difficult and unsafe conditions we are currently living in”.

Twenty-six asylum seekers have so far been sent back to France. They have fled a range of conflict zones including Eritrea and Iran. One has left France soon after arriving there and his whereabouts are not known.

Many are in their teens or early 20s. They say they have been fingerprinted in France in preparation for being forcibly removed to other EU countries under what is known as the Dublin convention.

This allows one EU country to send asylum seekers back to another they previously passed through and were fingerprinted in. After Brexit, the UK no longer had access to this mechanism but, thanks to the new treaty, Downing Street now has indirect access.

Documents seen by the Guardian given to some asylum seekers by French authorities state: “Summons for the implementation of the Dublin procedure.”

The joint statement from the asylum seekers returned to France states:

“We are writing to urgently bring attention to the extremely difficult and unsafe conditions we are currently living in. The UK government has sent us away, and the country we were returned to has not provided us with any rights, support, or protection.”

They add that they have been given inadequate and unsafe housing, a lack of access to proper healthcare – including for survivors of torture – insufficient food and separation from families in the UK.

“We urgently request your help to ensure our rights are respected and that justice is restored. We ask you to imagine if you were a parent with children – how would you feel if your children were left alone somewhere with no one to care for them? Whatever care and protection you would give them, we ask you to extend the same to us. This is a humble plea based on humanity, and we hope our voices are heard so that support and protection can reach us immediately.”

One asylum seeker who was returned to France told the Guardian: “I don’t even have one euro. I can’t stay here because I was badly attacked by the smugglers. They are so dangerous. They all have guns in their hands. I saw how they beat asylum seekers.”

“I am worried we are going to be sent back to the very countries we fled from,” said a second asylum seeker.

“The agreement between the UK and France will go down as a dark chapter in history because it has abandoned us completely. The UK government is making an example of us and this is very painful and shameful.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Those arriving in the UK on small boats illegally will now be detained and returned thanks to the French deal.

“The government is working closely with our French counterparts to scale up the deportation of illegal migrants.

“We make no apologies for cracking down on illegal migration and will do whatever to takes to secure our borders.”

Home Office sources added that those returned to France were processed according to French immigration procedures and that the legal basis for the “one in one out” deal had been agreed with France and the European Commission to ensure compliance with domestic, European and international law.

Proponents said parents at risk of deportation should get to choose someone trusted to care for their children if ICE detains them.
Critics claim strangers could get custody But Republicans, the religious right and parental rights' activists argued the bill would instead endanger children.
""What are parental rights?""","Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday signed a bill allowing a broad range of relatives to step in as children's caregivers if their parents are deported, a measure that had provoked a firestorm of conservative criticism.

Assembly Bill 495 will also bar daycare providers from collecting immigration information about a child or their parents, and allow parents to nominate a temporary legal guardian for their child in family court.

""We are putting on record that we stand by our families and their right to keep their private information safe, maintain parental rights and help families prepare in case of emergencies,"" Newsom said in a press release.

It was one of several measures the Democratic-dominated Legislature pushed this year in response to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation crackdown in Los Angeles and across California. Newsom, a Democrat, signed several of those other bills - banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from wearing masks in the state and requiring schools and hospitals to require warrants when officers show up - in a ceremony in L.A. last month.

He left AB 495 undecided for weeks, prompting a flurry of advocacy by immigrants' rights groups to secure Newsom's signature in the face of intense pushback from conservative activists. The governor announced his decision the day before his deadline to sign or veto the over 800 bills lawmakers sent to his desk last month.

The most controversial aspect of the bill concerns an obscure, decades-old form called a caregiver's authorization affidavit. Relatives of a child whose parents are temporarily unavailable, and with whom the child is living, can attest to being the child's caregiver; the designation allows the adult to enroll the child in school, take them to the doctor and consent to medical and dental care.

The new law will broaden who is allowed to sign the caregiver affidavit, from more traditional definitions of relatives to any adult in the family who is ""related to the child by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship,"" which includes people like great aunts or cousins. Parents can cancel the caregiver designation, which is intended to be a temporary arrangement and does not give that person custody.

Proponents said parents at risk of deportation should get to choose someone trusted to care for their children if ICE detains them. Expanding who is eligible for the caregiver form, they said, gives immigrant parents more options because they may not have close relatives in the country but benefit from strong ties with extended family or informal community networks.

The legislation was backed by immigrants' rights groups and children's advocates such as the Alliance for Children's Rights and First 5 California.

""I introduced this bill so children do not have to wonder what will happen to them if their parents are not able to pick them up from school,"" bill author Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, an Arleta Democrat, said at a recent press conference.

Critics claim strangers could get custody

But Republicans, the religious right and parental rights' activists argued the bill would instead endanger children.

They claimed it would allow strangers to sign the affidavit and claim the child into their care. Hundreds of opponents showed up at the Capitol by busload to rally against the legislation, organized by Pastor Jack Hibbs of the Calvary Chapel Chino Hills megachurch, who called it ""the most dangerous bill we've seen"" in Sacramento. Some of the blowback stemmed from false claims that the bill would allow strangers to get custody of children to whom they're not related.

Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, called the legislation ""a human trafficker's dream.""

In an email, Greg Burton, vice president of the California Family Council, took issue with the fact that parents might not be there when the affidavit form is signed.

""What are parental rights?"" he wrote. ""These rights are nothing if someone else can claim them by simply signing a form.""

Over the summer, Rodriguez narrowed the legislation to exclude ""nonrelative extended family members,"" but it was not enough to quell the controversy. The legislation was passed along party lines.

In comparison to a fairly progressive Legislature, the governor has often positioned himself as a moderating force on child custody and protection issues, which regularly galvanize conservative activists and put California Democrats on the defensive. In 2023, he vetoed a bill that would have required family court judges to consider a parent's support of a child's gender transition in custody disputes.

At a press conference last week where activists urged Newsom to sign the bill, Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrants' Rights Los Angeles, asked the governor ""to not listen to the lies, to not listen to all the other stuff that's being said about this bill.""

Newsom, announcing his decision, quietly acknowledged the controversy in a press release. He included statements he said were ""correcting the record"" on mischaracterizations and said the new law does not change the fact that parental rights and legal guardianships must be decided by family court judges.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17999567_101325-kfsn-newsom-ap-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-14 11:58:58.536832

Roan, 27, played two shows at Brookside at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, over the weekend. During the first performance on Friday, October 10, she reflected on the city she now calls home.

“L.A.’s my favorite city in the world, to be honest,” Roan announced to the crowd, per Variety. “I’ve been living here nine years. I’m originally from Missouri and I had a really, really tough time the first five years.”

She went on to discuss the wildfires that affected the area earlier this year, saying, “I’m not gonna be eloquent about this. I loved L.A. more than ever when I saw how the community came together in Altadena to help, same with the Palisades. I just realized that I’m so lucky to be able to live here and to play here, and the city has taken care of me, and it’s my duty to take care of it back.”

She then added: “F*** ICE forever”, before repeating the phrase as the crowd chanted along.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been the subject of multiple protests this year after stepping up immigration raids and carrying out mass deportations.

The Department of Homeland Security responded to Roan’s pronouncement in a statement to TMZ. DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said: “‘Pink Pony Club’ is good. Pedophiles are bad. That’s who we’re getting off of our streets. Get a grip.”

Earlier today, McLaughlin also responded to a Saturday Night Live sketch mocking Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem.

Amy Poehler returned to host the long-running NBC show Saturday, opening with a sketch spoofing Pam Bondi’s Senate hearing that starred Tina Fey as Noem.

McLaughlin commented on the sketch in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. “SNL is absolutely right — the Democrats’ shutdown does need to end!” she said.

The premise of the Cold Open was that Poehler’s Bondi — having not actually answered any questions during her Senate hearing — has been called back in to once again face questioning.

At one point, Poehler’s Bondi is asked why ICE agents are being sent to American cities. The question serves as a segue to introduce a special appearance by SNL legend Fey playing Noem.

Fey’s Noem walked into the sketch with an assault rifle, a baseball cap, and blinding lip gloss, living up to her recently-acquired “Ice Barbie” moniker.

Arguably the biggest laugh of the opening sketch is when a senator stand-in insists to Fey’s Noem that Democrats want to end the government shutdown more than Republicans do, to which she replied “ha — that makes me laugh more than the ending to Old Yeller.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/13/21/54/GettyImages-2213104761.jpg?trim=0,1,0,1&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-14 11:59:41.340357

The impact on the legal profession has been devastating.","Crackdowns on the legal profession — lawyers, judges and prosecutors — are part of a longstanding authoritarian playbook used around the world to silence dissent. Europe and Eurasia alone provide a plethora of examples — from European Union member Hungary — and previously Poland — to Belarus, Russia, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan — governments seeking to centralize control have openly and systematically targeted those who defend the rule of law.

The tactics differ, but the aim is the same: to silence lawyers who represent politically targeted clients, judges who issue rulings that contradict the repressive government’s political – and often personal — aims, and prosecutors who pursue cases against its favored allies. Whether through formal legislation or informal pressure, these measures aim to curtail legal advocacy, judicial independence, and the rule of law itself.

The United States has long prided itself on a tradition of public interest lawyering rooted in the civil rights movement and sustained through legal aid, legal clinics, and pro bono representation carried forward by lawyers. By framing access to justice as a professional duty, organizations such like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) or the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) institutionalized public interest advocacy. Yet, over time, these organizations have also been criticized for professionalizing and depoliticizing what began as grassroots social movements.

In recent decades, the legal profession in the West has continued to champion struggles for social justice by working alongside social movements, at home and abroad, to promote access to justice and defend fundamental rights, often supporting colleagues in contexts where the rule of law was under siege. Whether through government-funded programs like the American Bar Association’s former Justice Defenders program (where two of us, Jasmine and Natalie, used to work), or privately funded projects like the Amsterdam-based Lawyers for Lawyers, this support has taken a wide range of forms. They include trial monitoring, pro-bono assistance, training of lawyers and judges, support in drafting key legal frameworks such as constitutions, and sustained advocacy efforts. As Scott Cummings noted, lawyers have long sought to reconcile professional independence with commitments to democratic mobilization and public interest advocacy — roles that have become increasingly intertwined in polarized and fragile democracies.

Now, the U.S. legal profession is facing similar political retaliation, harassment, and institutional dismantling that it once sought to confront abroad, with a profound chilling effect at home. A comparative lens looking across multiple countries that have experienced similar – though always locally specific – conditions demonstrates that these attacks on the legal profession are not isolated incidents but part of a broader pattern of democratic erosion. The parallels between the United States and countries where legal repression has intensified, while distinct in their details and in each country’s experience, reveal a common strategy: weaken those who safeguard the law to weaken the rule of law itself. Legal communities in similar contexts have found that, by identifying early warning signs, they can better grasp the fragility of legal norms — even in long-established democracies — and the urgent need to defend them.

Public Interest Lawyering in Europe and Eurasia

Compared with the United States, public interest lawyering in Europe and Eurasia is generally more fragmented, and often constrained by historical, political, and institutional limitations. While many European countries uphold strong traditions of rule of law and fundamental rights, the infrastructure for systemic, independent public-interest lawyering, particularly in defense of the legal profession itself, remains uneven and, in some places, strikingly under-resourced.

In much of Eastern Europe and Eurasia, the space for independent legal mobilization remains narrow. In post-Soviet contexts such as Russia, Belarus, and Azerbaijan, legal aid organizations and bar associations are co-opted, tightly controlled, or outright dismantled. Lawyers who take on politically sensitive cases routinely face harassment, disbarment, and criminal prosecution. Public interest lawyering — where it exists — is often practiced informally, through fragile networks of human rights defenders and international NGOs.

Legal activism in these regions often takes the form of strategic (or impact) litigation, concentrating on pivotal cases to effect social change, rather than the more institutionalized public interest lawyering familiar to U.S. nonprofit organizations routinely pursuing broad policy goals through coordinated legal advocacy. Strategic litigation in Europe and Eurasia — particularly before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg — has become the dominant mode of legal activism, even for conservative NGOs, as many domestic systems are too weak, compromised, or underfunded to sustain systemic advocacy.

Even within the European Union there is no uniform model for public interest lawyering. In many Western European countries, legal aid systems primarily focus on access to justice but do not necessarily support strategic litigation or organized responses to political interference. Unlike in the United States — where large privately funded initiatives include Lawyers for Good Government, Lawyers Defending American Democracy, and the Society for the Rule of Law — Europe’s landscape remains more fragmented, often driven by individual lawyers, small NGOs, legal clinics in universities, or issue-specific transnational coalitions spearheaded in some member States.

As U.S. legal professionals confront mounting institutional threats at home, the experiences of their counterparts in Europe and Eurasia offer a critical lesson: legal resilience is not sustained solely by well-funded organizations or formal constitutional frameworks, because either can be quickly dismantled. Rather, resilience is forged through collective courage, strategic alliances, legal mobilization, and symbolic acts that galvanize public consciousness and professional solidarity despite the severity of suppression.

Across Europe and Eurasia, lawyers, prosecutors, and judges have found ways to push back against repression, whether through mass demonstrations, building transnational networks of support, or maintaining solidarity under severe restrictions. The following case studies from Poland, Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Belarus, and Russia, illustrate both the escalating trend of state suppression and countervailing legal resilience and civic solidarity.

Poland

Poland provided one of the early examples of how quickly judicial independence can be eroded, and how collective solidarity can serve as a powerful tool of resilience. Poland’s struggle for judicial independence started in 2015, shortly after the right-wing populist Law and Justice party (PiS) took power. Over the next several years, until it was ousted in the 2023 parliamentary elections, that government enacted more than a dozen legislative measures aimed at restructuring the judiciary to give the government more control. These changes compromised the rule of law and separation of powers and created a climate of intimidation and fear not only among the members of the legal profession but also the larger public. Judges who defended the rule of law faced harassment ranging from biased disciplinary proceedings and professional retaliation to state-sponsored smear campaigns. Some judges were openly branded as political enemies.

One of the most striking demonstrations of resistance was the January 2020 Marsz Tysiąca Tóg (“March of a Thousand Robes”). In response to intensifying government interference in the judiciary and arbitrary disciplinary proceedings, thousands of judges marched in silence in their judicial robes through the city streets of Warsaw and all over Poland. Joined by legal professionals and citizens from more than 20 countries, the march sent a clear message: attacks on the judiciary in one country are a threat to judicial independence everywhere.

The 2023 elections brought a change in government to a liberal coalition that pledged to restore the rule of law. It presented an action plan containing proposed laws to reverse or mitigate the damage the previous government had done to institutions such as the prosecution services and bodies that selected judges. But the process has been challenging, painstaking, and complex, and has yet to be completed. For instance, a new president of the previous ruling party may exercise veto power over key pillars of the government’s reforms.

For Polish lawyers, judges, and advocates, the biggest lesson has been the importance of professional and civic solidarity. Judge Monika Frąckowiak, who was herself targeted for resisting PiS’s reforms, has often discussed how simple gestures of support — a message, a photo, a reminder that “you will never walk alone” — can weaken the chilling effect authoritarianism seeks to create. She also stresses the power of organized resistance. Poland’s Justice Defense Committee brought together judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers to provide moral, legal, and public support to colleagues under fire.

Poland also offers a cautionary note: some lawyers, seeking influence or favor, sided with the ruling party and facilitated its authoritarian drift. “Lawyers are often the midwives of authoritarianism,” Frąckowiak warns. For those now confronting similar pressures in the United States, her advice is clear: document every abuse, be prepared legally and ethically, and build structures of professional and civic solidarity across national borders strong enough to withstand political retaliation.

Hungary

While Poland offers a hopeful example of democratic recovery, despite the current challenges of restoring the rule of law, fellow EU member Hungary shows how authoritarian control can become entrenched when early warning signs are ignored. Since Prime Minister Viktor Orbán returned to power in 2010, Hungary has experienced a systematic erosion of judicial independence. Through numerous constitutional amendments and legislative changes, Orbán centralized control over the judiciary, including lowering the mandatory retirement age for judges. These reforms allowed for the replacement of experienced jurists with government-aligned appointees, and restructuring the Constitutional Court to ensure a sympathetic majority. More recently, the government created a new administrative court system, placing cases involving fundamental rights under direct executive influence, thus further weakening the judiciary and dismantling separation of powers.

Beyond structural reforms, the government has targeted individual judges who spoke out. Judge Tamás Matusik, then-president of the National Judicial Council, became the subject of a government-sponsored smear campaign after holding a routine meeting with the U.S. ambassador. For weeks, pro-government outlets portrayed the encounter as evidence of foreign interference in Hungary’s judiciary, framing it as a threat to sovereignty.

Reflecting on these pressures in public sources and communications with one of us (Jasmine), Matusik stressed the importance of maintaining restraint and judicial integrity in that judges must not let external factors influence their decisions. He added that it is crucial for courts to operate with transparency and professional communication, and for judgments not to be influenced by political or ideological biases. Yet he also acknowledged the risks posed by populist rhetoric, such as when politicians label judges as “liberal” or “conservative,” creating additional pressure on judicial independence.

Matusik also noted that judges are particularly vulnerable in populist contexts because, unlike politicians, they cannot respond to attacks with press conferences or media campaigns. Populist leaders exploit these dynamic, making judges easy scapegoats.

Despite this chilling environment, resistance has not disappeared. As recently as February 2025, thousands of Hungarian judges and court staff protested outside the Ministry of Justice in Budapest, demanding judicial independence, freedom of expression for judges, and fair pay, after a covert agreement between the Minister of Justice and the National Office for the Judiciary linked salary increases to sweeping reforms without proper consultation with the judiciary.

The Hungarian legal community also continues to draw strength from international solidarity and transnational advocacy networks. Organizations such as the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ) and the International Association of Judges (IAJ) have amplified their concerns, ensuring that Hungary’s judicial reforms came under scrutiny from the European Commission.

The Hungarian experience carries a stark warning for the U.S. legal community and the public: once judicial independence is eroded, restoring it is far harder. For American judges, lawyers, and prosecutors now facing mounting political and institutional pressures, the Hungarian example underlines the urgent need for collective organization, legal mobilization and professional solidarity to safeguard the institutional integrity of the judiciary, before it is too late.

Kyrgyzstan and Georgia

Kyrgyzstan and Georgia illustrate an intermediate stage in the erosion of legal independence: the legal profession still functions, but the two governments increasingly suppress lawyers who take on politically sensitive cases.

In Kyrgyzstan, defense attorneys representing human rights defenders often become targets themselves as the government identifies them with their clients. Lawyers linked to foreign-funded NGOs or politically sensitive defendants now operate under constant surveillance and intimidation. One emblematic case is that of human rights lawyer Samat Matsakov, arrested on Nov. 29, 2024, and accused of large-scale fraud and document forgery — charges widely regarded as retaliation for representing activists linked to the investigative outlet Temirov Live and political dissidents. The arrest drew international condemnation, including warnings from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of human rights defenders and from legal bodies, both underscoring the broader assault on the right to defense.

Another legal professional, Klara Sooronkulova, a former Supreme Court judge and human rights defender who led an NGO called School of Law was herself prosecuted for advocacy on judicial reform and free speech. Her experience stands as a warning: legal reformers are routinely reclassified as threats.

Similarly, in Georgia, legal professionals are being swept up in the broader crackdown on civil society and democratic freedoms. Since late 2024, mass protests erupted after the government suspended EU membership talks. Lawyers and judges defending demonstrators or participating in movements have been increasingly targeted. For instance, Giorgi Davituri, a lawyer with the Institute for Development of Freedom of Information, was detained, physically assaulted, and subsequently fined in what observers called a blatantly unfair trial.

The lesson is clear: harassment of legal professionals is not merely external pressure from those outside the justice system (e.g., political actors, media, public opinion), but can quickly become systemic once the law itself is weaponized as a political instrument. As a result, solidarity, resilience, ethics, and integrity are no longer luxuries — they are survival strategies, helping lawyers preserve independence, credibility, and the very ability to continue practicing their profession.

Russia

If Kyrgyzstan and Georgia show increasing pressure on the legal profession, Russia exemplifies the next, darker stage, in which the law itself becomes a weapon, with defense lawyers being prosecuted alongside their clients. Professional independence has been almost entirely eliminated.

Russian authorities have long systematically harassed, intimidated, and prosecuted lawyers who defend opposition figures, journalists, and others perceived as a threat to the government. One of the most famous cases was that of Sergei Magnitsky, a tax lawyer for British-American investor Bill Browder who exposed government corruption and was then targeted for prosecution and died in prison in 2009. The U.S. and global Magnitsky anti-corruption and human rights sanctions laws were enacted in his name.

Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, repression in Russia has only intensified. In 2023 alone, human rights monitors documented more than 150 cases of harassment against lawyers, including detentions, disbarments, and fabricated charges. Government actions have effectively folded all independent lawyers into a single state-controlled bar, eliminating the last vestiges of professional autonomy.

As in the Magnitsky case, the repression is personal as well as structural. In 2023, three lawyers who represented opposition leader Alexei Navalny were sentenced to prison terms of three and a half to five years on fabricated charges of “extremism,” a label the government routinely applies to political opposition figures and their supporters. Another prominent attorney, Vadim Prokhorov, longtime defender of opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza, was forced into exile after facing threats of prosecution.

Prokhorov draws lessons, during our communication, from Russia’s previous eras of repression. He recalls the Stalinist gulag-era maxim: “Don’t be afraid. Don’t trust. Don’t beg.” From the Tatar-Mongol era, he notes how tax collectors gauged peasants’ reactions to assess what more could be taken from them. Those who pleaded or despaired lost everything; those who laughed were left alone. For lawyers, he suggests, resilience — and even defiant humor — can be a form of survival. Prokhorov’s advice is pragmatic and sobering: in repressive systems, trust no official assurances, not even from courts or prosecutors. Instead, resilience depends on self-reliance and solidarity with fellow lawyers.

Belarus

Belarus represents the endpoint of this trajectory: the near-eradication of an independent legal profession. Here, the system no longer merely pressures, harasses, or prosecutes lawyers; it extinguishes them.

Since the disputed 2010 presidential election, Belarusian lawyers, especially those representing opposition figures, journalists, or protesters, have faced waves of disbarments, prosecutions, and systemic harassment. After strongman Alexander Lukashenko rigged the 2020 election and brutally suppressed the resulting mass protests, the crackdown intensified: more than 5,500 people have been convicted in unfair trials, and at least 141 lawyers have been disbarred, 23 arbitrarily detained, and 11 convicted, six of whom remain imprisoned.

The impact on the legal profession has been devastating. The pool of practicing lawyers shrank from approximately 2,200 in early 2020 to just over 1,600 by the end of 2023, depriving citizens of independent legal aid even in non-political cases. National and regional bar associations, controlled by the Ministry of Justice, have fast-tracked disciplinary hearings to strip lawyers of their licenses under pretexts ranging from “lack of qualification” to spurious ethics violations.

Natalia Matskevich, a distinguished lawyer who defended political opposition figures and Nobel laureates, was disbarred and forced into exile. From this hardship, she offers a lesson, in a conversation with one of us (Jasmine), with profound relevance for the United States:

“Democracy and the rule of law are not a gift—they require constant effort. Lawyers serve as intermediaries between society and justice. When the regime makes lawlessness the norm, society still looks to lawyers as the last bastion of truth… Every lawyer must choose: either submit for personal safety or uphold your ideals despite the risks. My advice: do not give up, build communities, and never lose faith in the rule of law.”

Conclusion and Recommendations

The varied experiences of legal professionals across Europe and Eurasia — from Poland’s resistance and Hungary’s capture to the mounting pressures in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia, to Russia’s weaponization of law, and Belarus’ near-eradication of the independent legal profession — carry a clear warning: unchecked interference with the independent legal profession escalates quickly into systemic repression.

The lesson for U.S. lawyers is urgent and humbling: as they have already seen, no democracy is immune. Solidarity, resilience, and strategic resistance are essential to safeguard institutions before they reach a breaking point. American lawyers, judges, and prosecutors, whether acting as individuals or in firms, agencies, or other organizations, should:

Uphold the rule of law not only in the courtroom but also in broader public life, safeguarding democratic principles and constitutional rights — for example, by documenting abuses, engaging policymakers, and supporting those targeted for exercising their constitutional rights.

Refuse to remain silent in the face of injustice and have the courage to stand up to any regime or authority that seeks to undermine judicial independence or dismantle the foundations of the rule of law.

Build strong networks and coalitions across professions and borders to provide mutual support, to learn comparatively from each other, and coordinate strategic resistance against authoritarian pressures.

Promote solidarity and ethical commitments with legal professionals facing repression, both at home and abroad, by amplifying their voices, defending their integrity, and advocating for their protection.

Engage the public and educate society about the importance of an independent judiciary and dangers of its politicization, thereby reinforcing public trust in democratic institutions.

Document and expose abuses through legal channels, media, and international forums to ensure accountability and maintain historical truth.

In honoring these commitments, U.S. legal professionals not only defend their democratic institutions, but also bring this struggle to the broader public, while standing in solidarity with colleagues worldwide who continue to strive for justice, accountability, and the rule of law.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Poland-2020-judges-march-small.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 01:56:19.486853

“The Common School Fund remains healthy with over $1.4 billion of assets and tens of millions of dollars going into the school fund each year.” The Board of Commissioners of Public Lands manages four funds: the Common School Fund, Normal School Fund, University Fund and Agricultural College Fund.
“The Common School fund has grown over the years to $1.5 billion,” German said.","A provision in the 2025-27 Wisconsin budget allowing Milwaukee County to divert $4.4 million from school libraries to fund district attorney positions is being challenged in court.

The Common School Fund was established in the Wisconsin Constitution in 1848. The fund is maintained by money generated by counties through traffic fines and forfeitures.

But a provision in the biennial budget exempted Milwaukee County, instead allowing the county to use that money — $2.2 million per year — to help pay for 12 prosecutors.

The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, or WILL, filed a lawsuit last week in Waukesha County Court, calling the move a “flagrant and unconstitutional money grab by Milwaukee County.”

The suit says if the provision stands, the next budget could include more carveouts from the Common School Fund.

Milwaukee County Treasurer David Cullen, who is named in the suit, and other county officials did not respond to requests for comment.

WILL is representing Waukesha County resident Christine Stueland, a former Menomonee Falls School District board member who is referred to as a “library user and taxpayer.”

The suit argues Stueland is directly harmed because her library will have fewer resources. And it contends the state Legislature overstepped its constitutional authority by granting a unique carveout to a single county.

“It’s frustrating to watch politicians in Madison give Milwaukee special treatment while others are shortchanged,” Stueland said in a statement. “If we don’t fight back for fairness and equal treatment for all, it will only get worse.”

In 2025, the Common School Fund distributed $70 million to school libraries across the state. The biennial budget increased school library aid by $36 million over the biennium.

The Common School Fund is managed by the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, or BCPL.

The group has been uneasy about the budget provision since it was passed and has also considered taking action, said Tom German, executive secretary.

German and the BCPL board believe the provision violates a 1973 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision regarding the fund and the Legislature’s authority.

The Legislature’s budget committee added the provision during the last executive session of this budget cycle under a “miscellaneous items” section of the motion as part of a budget deal with Gov. Tony Evers.

On Sept. 2, the BCPL board passed a resolution “expressing its serious concerns” with the budget change.

“BCPL recognizes Milwaukee County’s need for funding the District Attorney’s office, but not at the expense of a constitutionally created and protected trust fund that benefits public education,” the resolution states. “BCPL and the other parties seek a legislative solution that addresses the above concerns prior to commencement of litigation.”

Board member and Attorney General Josh Kaul abstained from voting to avoid a potential conflict of interest.

Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said providing additional assistant district attorney positions for Milwaukee County was part of the negotiations with Republican leaders during the budget process, but the mechanism for funding them were not.

“The decision to specifically use the Common School Fund was made by Republican lawmakers alone,” Cudaback said.

In a statement to WPR, Joint Finance Committee Co-Chair Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, said Milwaukee has serious public safety challenges and the justice system is stretched thin.

“This isn’t an abstract issue—citizens are afraid, violent crime is rising, and the impact reaches far beyond city limits to the entire state,” Born wrote. “The Common School Fund remains healthy with over $1.4 billion of assets and tens of millions of dollars going into the school fund each year.”

The Board of Commissioners of Public Lands manages four funds: the Common School Fund, Normal School Fund, University Fund and Agricultural College Fund.

German said the funds become less consequential if their financial support does not continue to grow.

“The Common School fund has grown over the years to $1.5 billion,” German said. “But the University Fund and the ag college fund did not have a mechanism for growing, and so those funds are roughly the same size as they were 150 years ago. At one time, the University Fund could pay for about half the cost of running the entire system. Now it couldn’t pay for the cost of a (teacher’s assistant).”",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2025/02/Scales-Depositphotos_6077491_XL-w.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 23:57:11.809415

Meanwhile, lawyers for the GOP-controlled Legislature and the state’s Republican U.S. House members say the court’s newest liberal justices should recuse themselves and the cases should be dismissed.

The cases were filed against the backdrop of a state-by-state redistricting battle aimed at swaying the balance of political power in Congress. In Wisconsin, which is known for its 50-50 elections, Republicans hold a 6-2 edge in the state’s U.S. House delegation. The two redistricting lawsuits from the Elias Law Group and Law Forward are somewhat unique because they rely on a 2011 law written by Wisconsin Republicans. That law, which is untested, instructs the Supreme Court to form a panel of three judges to hear redistricting cases.

After weeks without action, the Supreme Court ordered legal briefs in late September on whether or not the judicial panels are required in these cases. Elias and Law Forward both argue the statute is clear and the court has a duty to appoint circuit court judges from around the state to hear the lawsuits.

In an interview with WPR, Law Forward attorney Doug Poland said the judicial panel law is a “venue statute” and has clear directions for the Supreme Court.

“Our point here is that this is a purely ministerial or administrative task for the court,” Poland said. “This isn’t a statute that gives the court any kind of jurisdiction or supervisory authority over the case. It’s just, the court is just supposed to do something that’s purely administrative or ministerial in nature.”

Attorneys representing the Legislature, GOP House members and the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, or WILL, argue the statute was meant for lawsuits challenging maps drawn by the Wisconsin Legislature. Attorney Luke Berg of WILL told WPR the current congressional districts were adopted by the Supreme Court’s former conservative majority during another redistricting lawsuit three years ago, so the 2011 law doesn’t apply.

He said regardless, the lawsuits should be dismissed because the liberal firms waited years to file their lawsuits and the Supreme Court’s current liberal majority rejected another Elias challenge earlier this year.

“Whether this requires a three-judge panel or not, it’s so procedurally improper and so meritless that you should just dismiss it now and save everyone the time,” Berg said. “We’ll see if the court does that or not.”

Along with their briefs urging justices to dismiss both congressional map challenges, attorneys representing the state’s six Republican House members are urging liberal Justices Janet Protasiewicz and Susan Crawford to recuse themselves and not rule on the venue question.

The GOP congressmen argue Crawford shouldn’t participate because she was part of a call with Democratic donors during her 2025 Supreme Court campaign that was billed by liberal group Focus for Democracy as a “chance to put two more House seats in play for 2026.”

“Here, Wisconsin law requires Justice Crawford’s recusal because of Focus For Democracy’s donor advisors briefing, the Democratic Party’s overwhelming campaign contributions, and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee’s support,” said the brief from GOP congressmen.

The congressman also demanded Protasiewicz step aside from any decisions in the cases, reiterating past GOP complaints about comments she made about GOP maps during her Supreme Court campaign in 2022. They noted Protasiewicz declined to participate in the court’s March 2024 decision to reject yet another attempt by Elias to overturn the state’s congressional map. However, Protasiewicz did not recuse herself in a state legislative redistricting lawsuit decided in 2023.

Both lawsuits filed by Elias Law Group and Law Forward claim Wisconsin’s congressional districts are gerrymandered, but they take different legal approaches to get there.

Elias is using the more traditional partisan gerrymander argument, claiming Republicans initially drew the House districts in 2011 to keep their party in control of a majority of the seats. The Law Forward case takes a more novel approach and argues the congressional map is what the firm calls an anti-competitive gerrymander, meaning voters in a Democratic leaning district can’t elect a Republican and vice versa.

Currently, the GOP holds six of the Wisconsin eight House seats. Democrats have tried repeatedly to get the congressional map overturned ahead of the 2026 midterm election.",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2014/07/gavel10.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 00:57:15.039111

ACLU Colorado sues Trump administration to stop “indiscriminate” ICE arrests

The Colorado chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and two Colorado law firms filed a lawsuit against Trump administration officials on Oct. 9, seeking to restrict Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials’ authority to detain people without judicial warrants.

The lawsuit, brought on behalf of four people who were allegedly arbitrarily detained earlier this year, claims ICE agents are arresting individuals without determining probable cause and flight risk, requirements they must evaluate case by case for each person detained.

Instead, the legal groups argue, their clients were apprehended based on their “skin color, accent or perceived nationality” to meet quotas they argue have been unlawfully set by Trump administration officials.

The lawsuit also requests a class certification for “people who have been or will be subject to ICE’s warrantless arrests,” allowing the plaintiffs to serve as representatives in a class-action lawsuit and potentially extending any ruling to others similarly affected by the agency’s practices.

Supreme Court to hear arguments on Louisiana redistricting case

On Oct. 15, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill will ask the Supreme Court to bar states from considering race when drawing congressional districts. She’s arguing that the Voting Rights Act (VRA) provision that sometimes compels race-conscious redistricting has become obsolete.

In 2022, a federal court ordered Louisiana to redraw its congressional districts based on that provision after a group of voters sued, claiming the state had unconstitutionally diluted the power of Black voters. The new map created two Black-majority districts instead of one. That map is now being challenged by non-Black plaintiffs.

The case, Louisiana v. Callais, is the latest in a long list of lawsuits challenging how states draw congressional districts. These cases focus on the difficult balance between avoiding racial discrimination and complying with federal laws like the Voting Rights Act (VRA), which sometimes requires considering race to protect the voting rights of marginalized groups.

Because Republicans hold a slim majority in the House, how the case is decided — and thus, how the district maps are ultimately drawn — could have significant consequences in the upcoming midterm elections.

Peruvian Congress ousts President Boluarte amid crime increase

On Oct. 10, Peru’s Congress voted to remove President Dina Boluarte from office, citing her government’s inability to combat rising crime and “permanent moral incapacity.” Congress leader Jose Jeri, now the country’s seventh leader in less than a decade, was sworn in as interim president.

Then-Vice President Boluarte succeeded former President Pedro Castillo after he was imprisoned in December 2022, when he attempted to dissolve the legislature to prevent his own impeachment.

Several scandals and a surge in crime, including a shooting at a concert in Lima on Oct. 9, ultimately led to what was the ninth attempt to impeach Boluarte, this time supported by nearly all of Peru’s legislative factions.

Boluarte was one of the world’s most unpopular leaders, with an approval rating of 2 to 4 percent. In the first three months of her presidency, there were more than 500 protests calling for her resignation.

Hostages and prisoners freed as part of Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement

On Oct. 13, Hamas released 20 Israeli hostages in exchange for 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as a key first step in the ceasefire both sides agreed to last week. Meanwhile, President Trump traveled to Egypt to attend a summit on the future of Gaza and the broader Middle East with leaders from more than 20 countries.

In the West Bank, crowds gathered in Ramallah to celebrate the return of 88 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons, where they had been serving life sentences. Meanwhile, Gazans in Khan Younis welcomed 1,700 Palestinians detained without charge since Oct. 7, 2023. About 160 Palestinians were deported through Egypt following their release.

In Tel Aviv, 65,000 Israelis assembled to welcome the 20 remaining Israeli hostages, who spent 737 days in captivity in Gaza. They were reunited with their families at a military base before undergoing medical evaluations.

Meanwhile, world leaders in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, began a peace summit “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability,” according to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

Former Trump White House chief strategist and influential far-right commentator Steve Bannon reportedly compared Congress’s role in the second Trump administration to that of the Russian Duma under dictator Vladmir Putin.

In an expansive report for The Wall Street Journal, Josh Dawsey reported that President Donald Trump’s recent actions — including his Department of Justice’s prosecution of New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey — “reflect a buoyed commander in chief who feels emboldened to go further after feeling as though he has faced surprisingly little resistance to his ambitious agenda in the first nine months.”

From Dawsey’s story:

Inside the White House, top advisers joke that they are ruling Congress with an “iron fist,” according to people who have heard the comments. Steve Bannon, the influential Trump ally, likened Congress to the Duma, the Russian assembly that is largely ceremonial. When senior White House aide Stephen Miller recently held a party at the exclusive Ned’s Club to celebrate his 40th birthday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) showed up to honor Miller, the people said.

Bannon, who worked in the first Trump administration, attributed some of the faded resistance to Trump’s comeback after four years “in the wilderness,” a period that he said hardened Trump. “He’s doing things now he wouldn’t have ever considered the first time,” Bannon said. “He’s jackhammering away on levels you haven’t seen before.”

For his part, the president observed this summer that “Everyone’s on my side now,” has “expressed amazement” at the speed with which law firms have been cowed by his administration’s threats and private firms have set aside funds for his pet projects, including a White House ballroom.

Jessie Fuentes (26th Ward) is preparing to file a lawsuit against the ICE agent who handcuffed and threatened to arrest her at Humboldt Park Health earlier this month.

In an interview with Windy City Times, Fuentes said she has been consulting with lawyers about taking legal action and could file a lawsuit as soon as this week.

The lawsuit would stem from an Oct. 3 incident inside the hospital’s emergency room, where Fuentes was responding to support a man injured during an encounter with federal immigration agents.

“I’ve been doing fine since then, and my major focus has been making sure that we can get the support that’s needed for the individual who’s in the hospital,” Fuentes said.

A video shared by Fuentes’ office shows an agent suddenly grabbing Fuentes, turning her around and handcuffing her after she questioned whether the agents had a warrant for the man’s arrest. The incident prompted citywide outrage and a formal condemnation from most members of the City Council.

For several days, ICE agents forbade the man from speaking with an attorney or making phone calls, Fuentes said. He underwent reconstructive leg surgery and may need another.

ICE agents detained the man and several others at a work site, Fuentes said. He had temporary protected status and had filed for a renewal. He also has no criminal record.

“And so he’s the one that’s vulnerable right now,” Fuentes said. “He’s the one that needs support.”

Fuentes added that the same ICE agent who handcuffed her has been filmed in at least three other violent encounters, including one at a Walmart, the viral arrest in Waukegan where the mayor was present, and another incident involving a woman.

“It seems that he’s a bit unhinged,” Fuentes said. “He’s obviously a danger to individuals and particularly women.”

Fuentes said the violence she experienced is part of a broader campaign of control and intimidation.

“What’s happening in the city of Chicago is not about safety,” Fuentes said. “It’s about a white supremacist project—about eradicating people,” Fuentes said. “As a queer, masculine-presenting Latina, I pose a great threat.”

She compared recent federal actions to “Gestapo-like tactics” and said they reflect the authoritarian playbook of President Donald Trump and Project 2025, a federal blueprint for a radical restructuring of the executive branch.

Project 2025 was written by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that opposes abortion and reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, immigrants’ rights and diversity and equity initiatives. Although Trump attempted to distance himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, policy analysts note that his administration has already implemented 48% of the policy agenda.

“I’ve been saying this is not very different from Nazi Germany in the 1930s, and this level of fascism is what Trump seeks to achieve,” Fuentes said. “We have to understand that this is not about fighting ICE agents that are quote, unquote, carrying ‘carrying out immigration enforcement.’ What we are fighting is fascism.”

Fuentes is among a coalition of alderpeople raising alarms that ICE’s recent actions in Chicago threaten not only immigrant communities, but democracy itself in the U.S.

Last week, 37 members of City Council—along with Mayor Brandon Johnson, City Clerk Anna Valencia and City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin—signed a letter condemning ICE’s conduct at Humboldt Park Health and other recent enforcement operations.

Thirteen alderpeople declined to sign on, including Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th), who is one of nine openly LGBTQ+ alderpeople in City Council. Lopez did not return a request for comment.

Fuentes said she hasn’t been in contact with any of the alderpeople who didn’t sign the letter, adding “this is not a moment to be silent.”

“What we are watching is an erosion of due process and an assault on peoples’ rights, and all elected officials should be enraged,” Fuentes said. “The fact that there are alders who see nothing wrong with this picture—even the incident with me being handcuffed at the hospital—it’s disappointing.”

A related lawsuit filed by the city government led a federal judge to temporarily block the deployment of National Guard troops to the city, a move that Trump’s administration claimed was necessary to “restore order.”

Fuentes praised the decision, calling it “the right side of history” and saying it gave her hope that “the courts can still stand up to authoritarian overreach.”

Fuentes said the same forces driving federal crackdowns on immigrants are also behind renewed attacks on LGBTQ+ rights across the country. Both are part of a broader effort to strip away civil protections and concentrate power in the hands of a few.

She drew a direct connection between the two fights, noting that many queer and transgender people are also immigrants or come from immigrant families.

“These struggles are not separate,” Fuentes said. “When immigrant rights are attacked, so are queer rights.”

Fuentes said these overlapping fights demand a unified response that brings together immigrant, queer and trans communities to defend one another against rising hostility and state violence.

“This is not a moment for us to stay silent and on the sidelines,” Fuentes said. “We have a city to protect.”",https://windycitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ald.-Jessie-Fuentes-speaks-at-an-April-7-2025-City-Council-meeting.-Photo-by-Jake-Wittich-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 01:56:23.260258

When Protecting Children Makes Us All Safer Some may look at the evidence of harm to children and think it does not impact them.
Who is protected and who benefits by our government engaging in traumatizing children and subjecting them to fear and despair?","Masked men with guns drawn came in the middle of the night, rappelling from helicopters. Flashbangs cracked down the apartment building’s corridors where families were sleeping. Federal agents were screaming and forcibly knocking down doors on an entire apartment complex in South Chicago. Children – still in pajamas, some “buck naked” – were pulled from their beds, separated from parents, zip‑tied, and detained in the middle of the night.

The disregard that these children were subjected to was expressed by a masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer when a resident asked him about their lack of humanity. His response was simply:

F- them kids!

Some have claimed the reports were exaggerated. But DHS embraced it. As writer Greg Olear observed:

Not only did it really happen, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, didn’t even have the common decency to deny it. On the contrary, DHS produced a slick video clip bragging about it, making it seem cinematic, heroic, cool—like a video game come to life.

Here is that video:

In broad daylight, families with children are followed by masked men to school drop-off and pick-up lines. In those lines in front of schools, parents have had their car windows smashed by men in tactical gear who have targeted them based solely on appearance.

The violence is so sudden and severe that glass flies and nearby children and parents scream and run away in fear.

And as if school shootings and active shooter drills were not causing enough trauma, children now face a new threat: tear gas launched by our own government near schools.

In some communities, parents have started forming watch patrols around schools – stationing themselves near entrances and walking perimeter routes to try and protect children from what they now see as an invading federal force of armed and masked “kidnappers.”

Meanwhile, child care centers have a unique set of worries. Although they also worry about drop-off and pick-up lines, their child care providers are being forced into the shadows, as they are often immigrants themselves.

At a press conference in July, DHS Secretary Noem said the goal was to “make America safe again” and proclaimed that DHS was going after the “worst of the worst.”

But what we are seeking far exceeds those claims. DHS’s actions are just targeting criminal removals. These are raids with helicopters, flashbangs, and armed agents storming entire apartment buildings or officers smashing windows in elementary school or child care drop-off lines.

These sorts of activities by our own government in U.S. citizens is something we have never seen.

And who benefits from this cruelty?

How, for example, does Noem justify the jailing and trauma being imposed on the woman and her 4-year-old son, who is literally praying and begging for armed government officers to leave his family alone, in this video? Is that 4-year-old and his mother living in Peekskill, New York, the “worst of the worst” who need detainment and incarceration?

I provided links to these articles and videos to demonstrate that these stories of attacks on children, their parents, and caregivers cited above are not aberrations.

They are an increasing reality of fear and trauma being caused by an Administration that has moved from border enforcement and a proclaimed focus on “criminal aliens” to an interior siege and the weaponizing of government, including state National Guard units, against American communities and innocent children.

Protecting Children’s Basic Human Rights

While lawsuits have been filed and some courts have ruled that DHS’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has overstepped its authority by threatening people’s basic constitutional and human rights, the Supreme Court has failed to protect people from this abuse.

In a shadow document opinion, Noem v. Perdomo, the Supreme Court ruled that ICE could continue its current operations, including its racial profiling of people. Although a formal opinion was not issued, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a “concurring opinion” that the government’s actions were fine:

The Government sometimes makes brief investigative stops to check the immigration status of those who gather in locations where people are hired for day jobs; who work or appear to work in jobs such as construction, landscaping, agriculture, or car washes that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English. If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go. If the individual is illegally in the United States, the officers may arrest the individual and initiative the process for removal.

Do any of these videos reflect Justice Kavanaugh’s words? And what about ICE’s terrifying and trauma-inducing interactions with children?

In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote:

We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.

Sotomayor adds that families with children are being negatively impacted in many ways, including:

Many are “struggl[ing] to make ends meet” because they are “afraid to go to work.” Others are “reluctant to attend school meetings” and “pick their children up from school” for fear of being detained.

Kids do not carry paperwork related to citizenship, such as passports, Social Security cards, birth certificates, immigration paperwork, or real ID cards. It is nonsensical to expect them to prove their citizenship.

Furthermore, children often have a different citizenship status than their parents, so even if ICE ascertains the parent(s)’ or caregiver’s status, that should never justify the detention, incarceration, and deportation of children, including some who are U.S. citizens.

Children must rely on adults to provide for and to protect them from harm. These adults – both parents and the government itself – should serve the best interests of children. Nobody can reasonably argue that the detention and incarceration of children in these cases is in their best interest, especially when government agents are inflicting terror and trauma on kids with taxpayer funding.

When Children Are Placed in Custody

In many corners of the U.S., children are being held in Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody or under ICE oversight and remain detained well beyond traditional limits. In violation of long-standing court rulings and the Flores Settlement, children are languishing in detention settings.

Family separation is also back. The Trump Administration has resumed detaining parents apart from their children – and, in some cases, using that separation as leverage.

As Maria Sacchetti reports for the Washington Post:

In July, the Trump administration withdrew a Biden administration policy urging that parents be detained only in “limited circumstances.” As a result, immigrant advocates and lawyers say, ICE officers are arresting growing numbers of people with children to meet the president’s mass deportation goals and, in some cases, using the threat of separation to push them to abandon their immigration cases and leave the country.

When parents are deported, many children are falling into foster care. Torn from families, communities, and schools, they now face a new trauma: indefinite limbo in a system not built for them without any ties to family.

Perhaps the most gut-wrenching of this Administration’s cruelty is the deportation of children who are either U.S. citizens or medically fragile – or both.

In a case earlier this year, three U.S.-born children – aged 2, 4, and 7 – were deported to Honduras with their non-citizen mother. The 4‑year‑old had advanced, stage-4 cancer. She was ripped from her treatment team, separated from her physician, and flown out before the courts opened.

In this and other cases, the Administration claims parent consent or “in absentia orders” – but internal memos and court challenges show the record is murky at best and deceitful at worst.

U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, appointed by President Trump, blocked a rushed deportation of dozens of Guatemalan children after finding the Administration’s argument for “family reunification” had, in his words, “crumbled like a house of cards.”

Judge Kelly wrote in his 43-page opinion:

There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return. To the contrary, the Guatemalan Attorney General reports that officials could not even track down parents for most of the children whom Defendants found eligible for their “reunification” plan. And none of those that were located had asked for their children to come back to Guatemala.

This is a reprieve, not a resolution – and the stakes remain the same: children’s lives, rights, and dignity remain on the line.

Broken Laws, Silent Standards, and Collapsing Ethics

These tactics are not just cruel: they violate U.S. law, international norms, and the moral fabric of child protection.

Advocates have also documented cases in which ICE agents conducted “wellness checks” on families – only to use those visits as a pretext for detention and deportation. What should be a tool for protection has become a vehicle for harm.

There is also a clear assault on due process. Children are being detained without lawyers. Parents are coerced into giving up claims. The right to a fair hearing is no longer guaranteed – but rationed. People who are working their way through the immigration process and showing up for court dates are being arrested inside the courthouse.

Ethically, we are in the midst of a paradigm collapse: the state treating children as pawns, coercion as strategy, suffering as policy, and enforcement masquerading as care. We are normalizing cruelty to children under this system.

Scars That Last: Trauma, Distrust, Broken Futures

When a child is wrenched from the safety of their home, their school, and their community and placed in a cold, unfamiliar detention facility, their world fractures.

These are not just temporary disruptions. Neuroscience shows that repeated stress disrupts the brain’s architecture, impairs emotional regulation, memory, and trust. It leaves a mark – often for life.

Many children arriving at U.S. custody already carry trauma from home and a journey that often involves violence, loss, and fear. To be re-traumatized by their host country, to which they were seeking shelter and protection, is a cruelty no child should endure.

Some children retreat inward. Others lash out. Many develop anxiety, behavioral disorders, PTSD, insomnia, and distrust of adults – even of caregivers. The damage seeps into every aspect of life: education, health, and identity.

We are building a lost generation: kids who may never fully recover from something done to them by a government.

When Protecting Children Makes Us All Safer

Some may look at the evidence of harm to children and think it does not impact them. But it does.

When federal law enforcement agencies – the FBI, ATF, National Guard, and other functions within DHS – are diverted from their core missions of anti-trafficking, counterterrorism, and child exploitation, every community becomes more vulnerable. Rather than stopping child traffickers and sex abusers, DHS is engaging in arresting and detaining the mom and 4-year-old in Peekskill, New York.

Meanwhile, in communities terrorized by raids, people stop reporting crimes. They stop cooperating. They stop trusting law enforcement.

That silence does not make anyone safer. It hides danger. It protects abusers. It silences victims.

When Government Fails Children, We All Lose

Immigrant parents bring their kids to this country to either provide them a better life or to protect them from grave harm in their country of origin.

Some argue that the children of immigrants are put in harm’s way by their parents. But even if you believe that, why should our government ever engage in the amplification of harm? Who is protected and who benefits by our government engaging in traumatizing children and subjecting them to fear and despair?

There is a moment in every healthy society when a child’s suffering becomes intolerable for the collective conscience. That moment should be now.

Today, children are being zip-tied, detained, ripped from treatment, deported, and coerced. They are silenced, invisibilized, and ignored. They pay for policies they had no hand in creating.

As Olear writes:

. . .little children were among those herded out of the apartments. Some of those children had their hands zip-tied, too – by grown men decked out in enough military gear to occupy Fallujah.

And when a woman – an American citizen, not in any way affiliated with a gang, guilty of nothing more than living in Chicago, a city Trump hates because Obama’s from there – called out the ICE agents on their egregious lack of humanity, she was given the dismissive three-word response:

F- them kids.

We must choose a different path: one where protecting children isn’t optional, where humanity and moral legitimacy includes empathy and heart. Podcaster Joe Rogan has thoughts on this.

We must act NOW and here are places to begin:

Congressional oversight : the government’s actions desperately need oversight. Committees must demand internal DHS memos, agent reports, and protocols that led to zip‑ties, night raids, and coerced deportations.

Restore legal counsel and due process: no child should face legal proceedings without legal counsel or fundamental rights.

Limit militarization: ban the use of National Guard, no‑knock tactics, or joint agency raids and use of force on children.

Reclaim “wellness”: child protection must be in the hands of social workers — not ICE. Let the professionals protect children and not interrogate them.

Support trauma-informed care: invest in mental health, education, and recovery systems in the best interests of children and not detention systems.

Mobilize narrative: we must center children’s voices and best interests.

“The Court finds that there is no present, existing, and actual controversy,” Judge Michael Valenzuela wrote.

What’s the law about?

Last year, 63% of voters cast their ballots in favor of Proposition 314, also known as the “Secure the Border Act.” The initiative was a priority for the GOP legislative majority, and it enshrined a bevy of new criminal penalties into state law, including making it a misdemeanor for a person to cross the Arizona-Mexico border anywhere other than an official port of entry. First-time offenders would face up to six months in jail. Other provisions make it a felony to submit false documents to apply for jobs or public benefits and enact harsh prison sentences for people convicted of knowingly selling fentanyl that causes someone else’s death.

The parts of the law allowing Arizona to take up federal immigration enforcement haven’t gone into effect because of a trigger provision that makes it dependent on a similar law in Texas being implemented first. That law, called SB4, remains frozen by a federal appellate court but litigation is ongoing.

What’s the lawsuit about?

In April, Living United for Change and the Arizona Center for Empowerment, sister organizations that advocate for progressive legislation and frequently oppose anti-immigrant proposals, filed a lawsuit against Prop. 314, urging the court to permanently block it from ever being enforced. The groups argued that the law violates the Revenue Source Rule, a provision in the state constitution that requires ballot initiatives to identify a dedicated funding source if they are likely to cost the state money.

During legislative debates, multiple law enforcement officials and critics of the Secure the Border Act warned lawmakers that it would cost money to arrest, jail and transport immigrants to the ports of entry once deportation orders were issued, but Republicans refused to set aside any funding for the initiative. The Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry, which would be forced to take custody of people accused of illegally crossing the border if local law enforcement agencies don’t have the capacity to hold them, estimated a cost increase of up to $178 million. And a nonpartisan think tank projected Arizona could end up paying $325 million every year if the provisions involving the enforcement of federal immigration laws are ever implemented.

The progressive groups also claimed that the law should be nullified because a large part of it relies on Texas’ version becoming effective before it can be completely enforced. They argued that doing so violates a legal principle known as the “unlawful delegation of legislative power,” which prohibits giving anyone other than the state legislature power over Arizona laws.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, along with Senate President Warren Petersen and House Speaker Stephen Montenegro who both helped send the initiative to voters last year, filed motions opposing the lawsuit. The trio argued that the provision detailing Arizona’s potential future involvement with federal immigration laws is currently frozen and the harms outlined in the lawsuit are therefore nothing more than hypothetical.

What did the judge say?

In a 10-page ruling, Valenzuela concluded that problems posed by LUCHA and ACE aren’t timely and don’t merit judicial review because the Texas law is still frozen by a federal appellate court’s order, making Arizona’s version a nonissue for now. The courts, he said, can’t issue opinions on what might happen.

“(Arizona’s) provisions never become enforceable if that injunction is upheld,” Valenzuela wrote. “They are dormant. Ultimately, declaratory relief must be based on the facts as they exist and not what may occur in the future.”

The act only allows the unauthorized immigration provisions in Arizona’s law to be enforced 60 days after its Texas counterpart, or another similar law in another state, has been implemented. The rest of its new criminal penalties, and a requirement that state and local agencies use the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements federal database to determine a person’s eligibility for public benefits are active now. The Latino advocacy groups’ argument that the act falls afoul of the state constitution hinges on the costs baked into the SAVE system. The database has a $25 monthly fee and an additional $2.25 fee per individual verification.

But Valenzuela wasn’t convinced that the fees in the SAVE program constitute a violation of Arizona’s Revenue Source Rule. He noted that only federal agencies are currently required to pay those fees; in April the Trump administration eliminated all transaction charges for state, tribal and local agencies in a bid to encourage the program’s use.

Valenzuela also rejected the claim that making the Arizona law dependent on its Texas mirror makes it unlawful. The courts, he wrote, have long recognized that lawmakers have the authority to imbue their laws with contingency plans and that’s what the trigger in the Secure the Border Act is. It doesn’t mean that Texas politicians have been given the power to write Arizona’s laws.

“The Act sets forth provisions that apply within Arizona and the subjects that it seeks to control by legislation,” Valenzuela wrote. “The Act leaves no incomplete provisions that require further defining by another other entity.”

What’s next?

The progressive groups have 30 days to file an appeal, and their attorney Jim Barton told the Arizona Mirror he expects to do so. Valenzuela’s conclusions that the 2024 law doesn’t violate the state’s Revenue Source Rule because of its trigger clause and the elimination of local costs in the SAVE system are wrong, Barton said.

“There was a law passed. That law is in effect. And that law requires expenditures,” he said.

Just because the current administration has waived the fees in the SAVE program for now doesn’t negate that the 2024 law mandates expenditures, Barton said. He pointed out that the waiver might very well be temporary and said the actions of a “particular regime” shouldn’t sway the court’s review of the law. In the end, he said, it violates the Arizona Constitution’s revenue source requirement.

“The fact that we have a temporary expenditure waiver doesn’t change the fact that it does mandate expenditures,” he said.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/arizona-ice-act-protest-signs.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 20:57:54.650382

Las Vegas police serve civil immigration warrants upon people in their custody, who otherwise would be ready to be released, and then hold them for up to 48 hours so they can be transferred to ICE.
As of Sept. 1, the police department had received a total of 957 requests from ICE this year, the ACLU said.
Moreover, the ACLU argues, holding someone in custody despite their release on criminal charges constitutes an arrest under Nevada law.","(CN) — The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday asked a Nevada court to put an end to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s collaboration with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown on immigrants who are in the U.S. without proper authorization.

The ACLU of Nevada filed a writ petition on behalf of Sergio Morais-Hechavarria, who’s been detained for months at the Clark County Detention Center pursuant to an “ICE hold” even though a judge ordered him to inpatient treatment as part of a misdemeanor conviction.

Attorneys with the ACLU argue that Nevada law doesn’t give local law enforcement the authority to enter into agreements with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law.

While many liberal-leaning states don’t allow such agreements, ICE has entered into so-called 287(g) agreements with state and local police forces across the country under which ICE trains and certifies local officers to serve and execute arrest and removal warrants on people in custody.

“While ICE officials seemingly believe they can use local police to further destabilize communities, we don’t subscribe to their theory,"" ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said in a statement.

A representative of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Las Vegas police serve civil immigration warrants upon people in their custody, who otherwise would be ready to be released, and then hold them for up to 48 hours so they can be transferred to ICE. As of Sept. 1, the police department had received a total of 957 requests from ICE this year, the ACLU said.

An ICE warrant, or “ICE hold,” means a detainee can’t be released even if they post bond or are ordered to home incarceration as part of pre-trial monitoring on their state criminal charges.

In the case of Morais-Hechavarria, the ICE warrant prevents his release from the Clark County Detention Center, notwithstanding the judge’s order that he’d be directly transferred to an inpatient treatment facility. At the same time, according to the ACLU petition, the judge’s order has prevented him from being handed over to ICE, purportedly due to the police department’s belief that the order indicates his criminal case is still active.

As a result, Morais-Hechavarria has been stuck in detention since the Aug. 19 court order.

“A person shouldn’t rot in a detention facility when ordered into treatment because the federal government has pressured local governments and local police into complicity with a disastrous, destabilizing, and destructive approach to immigration enforcement,” Haseebullah said.

The ACLU argues the Las Vegas police’s agreement with ICE violates the “Dillon Rule,” which holds that unless the power to do something has been expressly granted to the county by the state legislature through the adoption of a statute, they do not possess it.

The only authority local law enforcement in Nevada has to hold people on behalf of the federal government, according to the ACLU, is when they are prisoners — detained for criminal conduct, not for civil, immigration violations — and the federal government covers the cost of their incarceration.

Moreover, the ACLU argues, holding someone in custody despite their release on criminal charges constitutes an arrest under Nevada law. While there are a limited number of cases in which local law enforcement can make a civil arrest, in general, state law prohibits peace officers from making arrests in noncriminal matters, including civil immigration arrests, according to the ACLU in its petition.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/ice-arrest.jpeg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-13 20:58:00.247008

Nevada’s cooperation with federal agents violates state law, is eroding the integrity of the judicial system, and is hurting tourism, the ACLU alleges.

“This isn’t intended to disparage LVMPD,” ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said Monday at a news conference announcing the legal action against Metro and Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill. He suggests Metro acquiesced to the federal government because of President Donald Trump’s “administration’s perpetual threats against municipalities, local governments and state governments.”

Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE, named for a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows police to issue civil immigration warrants and detain individuals up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release so that federal agents may take them into custody. The agreement violates Nevada law, according to the lawsuit, because it was not condoned by state lawmakers.

Nevada is a Dillon’s Rule state, Haseebullah noted, meaning “if the Nevada Legislature does not grant authority for the local agency to act, the agency cannot do that action.”

State law provides that county jails may house prisoners at the request of the federal government, “but only upon payment of ‘all actual and reasonably necessary costs’ of such confinement,” the suit says, adding even if the term ‘prisoner’ referred to someone with a civil immigration infraction, Metro’s agreement with ICE violates Dillon’s Rule, because it requires Metro to cover all associated costs.

The suit was filed on behalf of Sergio Morais-Hechavarria, who was found guilty of attempted possession of a stolen vehicle, a gross misdemeanor. He was sentenced by Judge Tara Newberry Clark to an inpatient treatment facility for substance abuse and mental health, and upon completion, to outpatient treatment. Instead, he is being held in the Clark County Detention Center.

“The unlawful hold, caused by ICE’s 287(g) agreement with LVMPD, has trapped him in indefinite detention, directly obstructing a lawful court order issued by a Nevada judge,” the ACLU said in a news release. The filing asks a court to lift the hold and order Metro to end its agreement.

The suit, Haseebullah said, is another ACLU has “had to file because of this administration’s desire to create as much instability as they can within our communities.”

He says he expects the case to land before the Nevada Supreme Court.

“We’d love to get the proper outcome at the District Court level, but I imagine this will go up,” he said at the news conference. “We need a substantive ruling to know whether or not Nevada municipalities or local law enforcement agencies have the ability to act without approval from the state that funds them in large part.”

McMahill, who long maintained Metro would not assist federal agents with immigration enforcement, entered into a 287(g) Memorandum of Agreement with ICE on June 16 of this year, according to the lawsuit, “after the federal government idiotically labeled Las Vegas a ‘sanctuary city’ without even defining ‘sanctuary city,’ and forced Nevada taxpayers to cover the cost of ICE’s work…” Haseebullah said. An exhibit attached to the suit reveals that as of Sept. 1, LVMPD received 957 requests for assistance from ICE this year.

“In Nevada, sheriffs and political subdivisions, such as LVMPD, have no existence or powers except by grant of Nevada’s Legislature,” says the ACLU’s pleading.

“I recognize the tough position that the sheriff’s been put in, that the Mayor of the city of Las Vegas has been put in when they signed an agreement,” Haseebullah noted. “We recognize the decisions made by this administration don’t come with any sort of intellectual honesty.”

The sanctuary designation, he noted, is a “legal misnomer” that is bereft of common definition.

Nevada was removed from the federal list of sanctuary designations last month after Gov. Joe Lombardo agreed to fully cooperate with federal immigration initiatives.

In 2019, then-Sheriff Lombardo suspended Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE after a federal court ruled that ICE detainers could be honored only in states that permitted arrests for civil immigration violations. Nevada was not among those states.

Lombardo, however, informally honored provisions of the agreement after he announced its suspension.

She was planning to make albóndigas, a meatball stew, for her children that day.

She didn’t make it far.

Just steps away from her house, she was intercepted by a group of Border Patrol agents armed and wearing dark masks. These agents, whose primary mandate is to secure the national borders, are now patrolling Chicago suburbs.

It’s part of Operation Midway Blitz, a campaign the U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched Sept. 8 saying it would target “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” in the area.

But the government’s own data and detentions like that of Rosales — a mother of three who has no apparent criminal record — cast serious doubt on whether that’s really the mission.

On Oct. 3, DHS announced that since the operation began in September, more than 1,000 undocumented migrants had been arrested across Chicago and its suburbs — “including the worst of the worst pedophiles, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers.” However, the agency provided detailed information for only 10 men with a criminal background, about 1% of those detained, making independent verification difficult.

In one particularly jarring raid, on Sept. 30 federal agents with Black Hawk helicopters and military-type vehicles descended on an apartment complex in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood. DHS said the location was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members,” a Venezuelan criminal gang targeted by the Trump administration.

According to DHS, 37 people were arrested during the operation; however, only eight of them were confirmed to have a criminal record — and that includes crimes ranging from aggravated battery to retail theft. The agency did not say whether any of those cases resulted in convictions.

Just one “verified” Tren de Aragua member and one U.S. citizen with an active warrant were among the 37, DHS said, without saying how it had verified that gang affiliation. Others taken that day, the agency said, were “illegal aliens.”

In other words, while the administration says it is disrupting transnational gang activity, the bulk of those detained seem to have no serious record. In fact, federal data shows that over 70% of detainees who were being held as of last month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement nationally had no criminal convictions.

One of Rosales’ daughters, Samantha Rojas Rosales, only learned about her mother’s detention after watching a video obtained by MSNBC. “That’s her,” she said. “She always wears that blue sweater.”

In tears, Rojas said these immigration operations ostensibly aimed at gangsters are tearing families apart. Her mother came to the U.S. from Mexico in 1995, she said.

“She has worked hard. She has paid her taxes. She’s done everything possible to make sure she isn’t a problem here,” the 21-year-old daughter said. “And she has raised me here my entire life.”

Asked about the arrest, a Homeland Security official focused on what Rosales did 30 years ago: “Rosales Castillo admitted to being illegally present in the U.S. to Border Patrol officers which is a crime,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told MSNBC in an email.

Grabbed up while grabbing coffee

The same morning Rosales was arrested, just blocks away in Cicero — an area with the highest concentration of Latinos in the state — another immigration operation unfolded. Two mechanics, Mario Martínez Serrano and Daniel Cabrera García, were standing outside a bakery drinking coffee when unmarked vehicles and Border Patrol agents surrounded them.

Surveillance footage obtained by MSNBC shows Border Patrol agents chasing the men inside the bakery. Cabrera was violently thrown to the ground, three witnesses said. Both men were taken away in an unmarked vehicle.

Rosie Rodríguez, who has an insurance agency next door to the bakery and witnessed the arrests, told MSNBC that immigration agents are snatching away “good people.”

“They’re my clients. These are hardworking men. These are not criminals,” she said.

DHS disagrees.

Martínez is a “criminal illegal alien with an extensive criminal history, including arrests for battery, DUI, domestic abuse, possession of a controlled substance, and two prior removals from the U.S.,” McLaughlin told MSNBC.

Martínez’s wife, who did not want to be named for fear of immigration authorities, said he's lived in Illinois for 30 years. She acknowledged he’s “made mistakes in the past, but in the 10 years we have been together he had no issues with the law. He’s a good husband, a father to two teenage U.S. citizens, and a hard worker.”

Cabrera’s cousin, David González, described him as a family provider. “He’s a good man. He had dreams. He was about to open his own car shop. He didn’t do anything wrong. Now everyone around here feels like a target, even U.S. citizens like me,” he said.

Asked about Cabrera’s case, McLaughlin only said he was “an illegal alien from Mexico who attempted to evade arrest.”

The scene in Chicago

Over a five-day span in greater Chicago, MSNBC received dozens of reports from families and neighbors alleging that their loved ones had been taken by immigration officials, seemingly without any reason other than being undocumented.

On Wednesday — the day after the detentions in Cicero and Berwyn — two sisters were stopped and dragged out of their vehicle in front of a school in Chicago’s Little Italy neighborhood by at least 10 agents, some of them wearing face coverings. Video obtained and verified by MSNBC shows one of the women pinned to the ground as she pleaded for help.

“They don’t have a warrant. They forcefully opened the door of the truck. It was locked, it was locked,” the woman repeated. MSNBC confirmed both women were later released.

“When Donald Trump campaigned, he said he was going after criminals, rapists and drug dealers,” said Humberto Fuentes, a resident who said he witnessed the women being detained. “Now, they’re assaulting women, deporting children, mothers and fathers — not criminals. And if they’re criminals, he needs to prove it. We haven’t seen that evidence yet.”

That’s the main argument being made by legal observers and state and local officials, including Gov. JB Pritzker.

“It’s not going after the worst of the worst when you’re just literally stopping people who happen to be brown and asking them for papers,” Pritzker told MSNBC. “We don’t want people picked up off the streets just because they happen to be undocumented and have committed no crime.”

President Trump insists Chicago is in crisis, that undocumented migrants are driving crime and that Democratic leaders including Pritzker aren’t doing anything about it.

A number of studies have found that immigrants — including undocumented ones — are less likely to commit crimes than Americans born in the U.S., and challenged claims that unauthorized immigration increases violence.

In Chicago, which has received over 50,000 asylum-seekers since 2022, ""Violent crime is down,"" Mayor Brandon Johnson told the U.S. House Oversight Committee in March, adding that ""the city ended 2024 with its lowest homicide rate in five years.”

In the first six months of 2025, those numbers declined even further, with all major crime categories lower than during the same period in 2024.

“We are good people,” insisted Fuentes, who is from Mexico and has lived in Chicago for 22 years. “Immigrants can’t be the scapegoat for all the things that go wrong in this country. Sooner or later, someone will have to admit this is all for show.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251013-jacob-soboroff-chicago-zz-05-7c0ab6.jpg",N,,2025-10-13 18:56:53.803708

“I see it very prevalent in my community here from Orlando, Florida, with our Haitian community that is being targeted, and also with Black Latinos that are being targeted,” Frost said during a panel discussion at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s legislative conference in Washington, D.C.

The discussion came on the day that Des Moines Public Schools superintendent Ian Roberts, who is Guyanese, was detained. School district officials said they had no information on why he was being held.

Frost questioned the need for ICE.

“The fact of the matter is that we have other federal law enforcement to help ensure that we have an orderly and humane immigration process at the federal level,” he said. “Creating a whole agency to literally go to our communities and now en masse and terrorize our people, I think is not needed.”

President Donald Trump has authorized National Guard troops to take over law enforcement duties in Washington D.C., and dispatched them to cities led by Black Democratic mayors, including Los Angeles and Memphis, while weighing whether to send troops to Baltimore, Chicago and New Orleans.

Some Republican governors such as Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia and Mike DeWine of Ohio were quick to send their National Guard units to D.C., while Republican Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee deployed troops to Memphis, his state’s second largest city, in aid of Trump’s orders.

Haddy Gassama, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said people need to know the laws in their states.

Gassama said local and state agencies can participate in 287g agreements with ICE, allowing the federal agency to delegate certain tasks to state and local law enforcement officials such as executing warrants in their jails and identifying and beginning removal proceedings against individuals arrested by local law enforcement.

“The Trump administration has said that their goal is to, just this year alone, detain and potentially deport up to 100,000 immigrants. They’re well on their way to that goal,” Gassama said. “Currently, there are over 60,000 immigrants in detention. It’s almost flipped on its head where it is using immigration policies to expand the mass incarceration system.”

The immigration officers stopped their truck and went straight after them Thursday, Cruz told the Tribune.

“They asked us if we have papers. I said I do but I don’t have them on me,” Cruz, a 60-year old man with heart problems originally from El Salvador, recalled in Spanish.

The agents stood Cruz up, put him in their truck, drove around in circles, and asked questions, he said.

Where was he born? What is his name? Who is his mother? Who is his father?

“I told them, they are dead,” Cruz said. The agents said they needed the information anyway so they could look him up in their databases. Eventually, the agents verified that he is, in fact, legally in the country. And they let him go.

But not before writing him a $130 ticket for not having his papers. Cruz’s friend, who is homeless, did not have legal status and was taken away by the feds.

Under federal law, registered foreign nationals must carry proof of registration with them at all times. But prior to a second Trump administration, it was rarely enforced. As President Donald Trump escalates his immigration crackdown in Chicago and its suburbs, “Operation Midway Blitz,” agents are using broad federal authority when targeting suspected immigrants, legal experts say.

The Department of Homeland Security announced Oct. 1 that it had made 800 arrests in the area since the mission began at the beginning of September.

ICE arrests increase across Chicago under Trump, many with no convictions, data shows

While federal officials claim they are targeting the “worst of the worst,” bystanders have been swept up and people across Chicagoland have accused the government of widespread civil rights violations. In blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois last week, U.S. District Judge April Perry said the federal government had a credibility problem that made many of their claims “unreliable.”

The National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago told the Tribune it has not yet seen any of its clients receive this sort of citation. But it’s part of a recent push by the Trump administration to ensure immigrants register with authorities and maintain their documentation to them at all times or face potential penalties.

The Immigrant Legal Resource Center calls it a “hateful tactic” meant to “cause panic and fear throughout the country.”

“America has never been a place where people need to ‘show one’s papers.’ Ticketing a lawful permanent resident — and forcing him to appear in court and pay a fine for not carrying their papers — is unnecessary and cruel,” said Ed Yohnka, communications director for the ACLU of Illinois. “It does not make our communities stronger or more safe. It is simply part of the Trump administration’s attempt to make life uncomfortable for all immigrants. It is just awful.”

A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not return messages seeking comment.

It’s not clear how many individuals have been ticketed for not having their papers on them. The ticket Cruz showed the Tribune references a law requiring immigrants to be registered with the government and have their registration documents.

A former dishwasher, Cruz lives in a government-funded apartment but isn’t working due to his health. Cruz said he was relieved to be released but worries how he will pay the fine. The ICE agents told Cruz he has to pay it within 60 days or go to court.

“It’s not fair because I said, let’s go to my house and I’ll show you my papers. I’m a resident,” Cruz said.

In Chicago, immigrants who thought they were following the legal path are also facing deportation under Trump crackdown

U.S. citizens say they’re also being questioned by federal immigration agents for proof of citizenship.

Maria Greeley, 44, had just finished working a double shift at the Beach Bar on Ohio Street earlier this month when she said she was surrounded by three federal agents who grabbed her, forced her hands behind her back and zip-tied her.

Headphones in, Greeley had been focused on getting home to her two dogs for a walk. Instead, she said she was detained by masked agents who did not answer when she asked for names. They questioned her for an hour, she said.

Greeley, who was born at Illinois Masonic hospital and is adopted, carries a copy of her passport just in case she runs into federal agents.

“I am Latina and I am a service worker,” Greeley said. “I fit the description of what they’re looking for now.”

During the encounter, Greeley said they told her she “doesn’t look like” a Greeley.

“They said this isn’t real, they kept telling me I’m lying, I’m a liar,” Greeley recalled. “I told them to look in the rest of my wallet, I have my credit cards, my insurance.”

When the agents let her go, Greeley got home and screamed when she saw the shadow on her door. Days after the incident, Greeley said, it’s still “terrifying.”

“I just have to stay strong and not think about it, I’m still here, luckily,” she said, tearing up. “All those other people are getting taken.”

Days after Cruz had the encounter with federal agents, Cruz attended a hastily organized protest in Rogers Park residents. Hundreds turned out.

Ald. Maria Hadden, 49th, represents the Far North Side neighborhood on Chicago’s City Council. She said it was an effort to “recognize people from our community who were taken” and bring people together “to remind them that we are not powerless.”

In a statement, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said she decided on the restriction after protests outside the facility on Saturday night ""degenerated into chaos.""

""There were 15 arrests, and 10 of those were around the age of my own daughter. As a mother and a mayor, I am mad at what happened,"" Thompson said in the statement. ""Broadview didn't choose to have the ICE facility in our community. But it's here. And so are Broadview residents.""

Thompson wrote that some of the protesters have been making life difficult for Broadview residents.

""There are too many protesters are raising their fists rather than their voices, creating chaos at the expense of the people who call Broadview home,"" she wrote. ""Broadview residents lack the protestors' privilege to return to calm, quiet neighborhoods for undisturbed rest.""

For that reason, Thompson said she has signed a new executive order in consultation with the Illinois State Police and the Cook County Sheriff's office, which will permit protests only in the safety zone at the ICE facility on Beach Street. Protests will no longer be allowed at 2000 S. 25th Ave. between Lexington and Fillmore streets, Thompson wrote.

""Additionally, it has been only God's grace alone that a protester has not been struck and killed by a motorist on 25th Avenue given how frequently protesters dash onto this busy, four-lane street,"" Thompson wrote. ""This new measure will provide for both the serenity of residents and safety of protestors.""

Thompson emphasized that she respects, supports, and defends everyone's right to protest, and decried the use of chemical munitions by federal agents at the site.

""Nevertheless, my first priority is to defend public safety and the residents who live here and people who work here,"" she wrote.

On Monday, barriers were placed on South 25th to prevent protestors from spilling into the streets.

Protester Jon Ort, one of the few demonstrators standing outside, said it seems as if the facility is being fortified.

""We are a city where we protect one another,"" he said.

Neighbors came out too when they realized the barriers had been put down. Some were placed on top of their plants.

James Baker lives on South 25th and says it's been almost impossible getting in and out of his home in the last few weeks.

""I went to the grocery store four days ago. Me and my son had to carry groceries from the end of that light right there to the house,"" Baker said.

Around the corner from where the barriers were placed, Thompson stood with other local mayors and elected leaders. She explained the barriers are meant to keep people out of the streets when protests spill over the sidewalk. A judge's order will soon take the fence outside the facility down.

""This unity is more powerful than any show of force that has come from the other side of that illegal that illegally build fence,"" Thompson said.

This comes after Thompson signed an earlier executive order restricting protest times to between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

New York recently enacted a law permitting the New York Public Employment Relations Board to assert its jurisdiction over private employers

The National Labor Relations Board has filed a lawsuit challenging the law, arguing that it is preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution

Amazon has also filed a lawsuit challenging the law on similar grounds

On September 5, 2025, New York Senate Bill S.8034A was signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul, effective immediately. The law amends Section 715 of the New York State Labor Relations Act, permitting the New York Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to assert jurisdiction over private-sector employers. PERB is an agency created by Section 205 of New York Civil Service Law, which traditionally oversees public-sector labor relations.

The law’s sponsor memo indicates that its purpose is to ensure “employees still receive protections by the National Labor Relations Act” when the NLRB is unable to successfully assert jurisdiction. Currently, the NLRB lacks a quorum, which limits its authority.

In response to the law’s enactment, on September 12, 2025, the NLRB filed a lawsuit against the State of New York and PERB in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the law. The NLRB argues (1) that the law is preempted by the NLRA under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution; and (2) that the law usurps the NLRB’s authority to regulate areas which are “explicitly reserved for federal oversight.”

On September 30, 2025, the NLRB filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin New York State and PERB from implementing and enforcing the law. The NLRB argues that the law “creates a parallel regulatory system that undermines the federal labor policy Congress designed to be national in scope.” Stated differently, the NLRB argues that its congressionally granted jurisdiction over private employers has been directly displaced by PERB under the law. Moreover, the NLRB argues that in the absence of a preliminary injunction there is a threat of imminent irreparable harm since the law operates to displace the NLRB’s jurisdiction even after its quorum is restored. The NLRB argues that a preliminary injunction is in the public’s best interest and that issuing an injunction is favorable because the NLRB will continue to process labor practice cases and PERB can continue to oversee public-sector labor matters.

On September 22, 2025, Amazon also filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against PERB and PERB officials, seeking to strike down the law for similar reasons as the NLRB. In response, PERB has filed a motion seeking to halt this lawsuit, given the parallel lawsuit that the NLRB has already filed. Meanwhile, certain unions have filed a motion to intervene in both lawsuits seeking to have the law upheld, and certain business associations have sought to file briefs in both lawsuits in support of the arguments that the law should be struck down. These legal battles are expected to play out over the next several months.

Lawmakers in other states have already adopted or considered laws which displace the NLRB’s jurisdiction. For example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law which will expand the jurisdiction of the California PERB to private-sector employees, effective in 2026. Additionally, Massachusetts is considering a law which would make key aspects of the NLRA part of state law. Similar challenges to the legality of bills in other states are expected.

New York employers should continue to monitor developments in these cases, assess their labor policies, and prepare for possible situations where PERB seeks jurisdiction over private-sector matters.

“I had at least one girlfriend from Broadview, I'm sure of it,” Rivers said, adding a little levity to the session.","CHICAGO – A day before arriving in his hometown of Chicago for a game between his Milwaukee Bucks and the Bulls at the United Center, Glenn “Doc” Rivers spoke about his team busing down for the game on Oct. 11 and said, “hopefully we get through the night, and not get arrested by ICE. And then we’ll be in good shape. Lot of brown people on our team.”

That set the stage for Rivers, on the eve of his 64th birthday, to express his disappointment and anger about the mass arrests by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Chicago.

“It bothers me. I’m trying, I’m trying; I mean, it’s just awful what you watch and see, people getting zip tied. I mean, that’s not this country. That’s not what we’re about,” Rivers said in his pregame press conference Oct. 12 at the United Center, located on Chicago’s west side.

""I think the mayor’s (Brandon Johnson) done an amazing job with everything he says. You know, I think this is starting to separate us all, which I hate. This is not, you can be pro-civil rights or what’s right and not be, like, anti-white. And I think that’s what it’s starting to become in some ways. And it shouldn’t be. It really shouldn’t be. I would hope that if this was Ukrainian immigrants being detained that everyone on both races would fight for it. That’s wrong. It’s just wrong.

“I think every American is good with if there’s criminals on the street, we want to arrest the criminals. My dad (Grady) was a (Maywood) cop for Christ’s sakes. My dad would not be proud of this. I know that. My dad would have a major problem; I couldn’t imagine my dad going to work right now and have to protect ICE agents and doing what they’re doing. I couldn’t imagine him wanting to go to work. I think he’d call in sick. And it’s just so – did you walk around the city today? This is an amazing city.

“Riding down the elevator with a couple, I wish I could remember where they’re from, their daughter ran in the marathon and the couple was so proud and they were saying, man, this is the best marathon, the city is amazing, I’ve never been to this city, wow. And the dad says, but we were so scared, we thought there was civil unrest everywhere. And he was like, ‘where is it?’ It’s nowhere. It’s just sad. We hate it. We hate it. I’m from Chicago. I’m very prideful about this place, so I hate it.”

Since the beginning of October, ICE raids in and around Chicago have escalated – along with protests of its activities – resulting in President Donald Trump deploying members of the Texas National Guard to the city.Rivers is a Chicago native who grew up in Maywood, Illinois, a village just west of the city. Maywood is also located just blocks from Broadview, which is the location of an ICE processing facility and has been the site of continued protests.

“I had at least one girlfriend from Broadview, I'm sure of it,” Rivers said, adding a little levity to the session. “Yeah, it's awful. I know it well. My brother (Grady Jr.) lives in Elmhurst. You gotta go from Maywood to Broadview to drive through it. Again, it's the same thing. And it almost feels like it's intentional, like they're trying to create unrest. It wasn't here, and now it's here.

""It's just, there's gotta be a solution. I mean, protest is legal. You should be able to protest, and I think it's being made violent in some ways, so I don't know. Antifa? Does anyone know what that is? I actually looked today. I really did. I actually looked it up and there were 15 different answers for it. Yet we have all these other groups. The Proud Boys, no one's going after (them). It's just, this is getting sickening.

“I'm going to say this the last time and then move back to basketball. This should be about the morality of our country and not about the race. This has nothing to do with black and white.

At least five U.S. airports will not air a politicized video message from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming the government shutdown on Democrats—but a legal expert tells Forbes the video does not violate the Hatch Act, which restricts federal employees from some kinds of partisan messaging.

Key Facts

Does Kristi Noem’s Video Violate The Hatch Act?

“This is probably not a Hatch Act violation, because it's not tied to an election,” Cynthia Brown, senior ethics counsel at the non-partisan ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), told Forbes. “But it's entirely inappropriate to be using federal resources to message on a partisan basis and disparage the opposing political party.” The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees—with carve outs for the president and vice president—from making partisan attacks while on the job “to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation,” according to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). A 2021 report from the OSC found 13 administration officials from President Donald Trump’s first term violated the Hatch Act by engaging in partisan messaging, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, acting secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and national security adviser Robert O’Brien. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway violated the act dozens of times in her official capacity, according to a 2019 OSC report recommending that Trump fire her.

What Is The Penalty For A Hatch Act Violation?

None, unless Trump decides otherwise. “As a general matter, if you violate the Hatch Act, you are subject to discipline” including potential suspension, loss of pay or even removal from position, Brown told Forbes. “But there aren't a lot of teeth for the most senior officials, when it is someone at the cabinet level who reports to the President.” The 2021 OSC report concluded that “the Hatch Act is only as effective as the White House decides it will be” and noted “President Trump’s failure to ensure compliance by his senior officials allowed for, as one federal court said of a senior administration official, members of the administration to ‘violate the Hatch Act with seeming impunity.’”

Tangent

A memo sent last week from Ha Nguyen McNeill, acting administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), blaming “Senate Democrats’ recalcitrance” for the shutdown angered many in the workforce, according to three TSA officers who told Forbes “people are very put-off by this rhetoric” and “we feel sickened.”

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo shook the legal world when it overturned one of the cornerstones of administrative law: the Chevron doctrine. Established by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., the Chevron doctrine directed federal courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute that the agency administers.

In Part I of this series, we looked at how the federal courts have begun to implement Loper Bright one year after the seminal case; here, we dive into where things stand at the state level.

In a minute or less, here is what you need to know.

States Still Free to Go Their Own Ways

The Chevron doctrine was a rule about how courts should interpret federal law; state courts were never bound by it.1 In overturning Chevron, Loper Bright relied purely on statutory grounds under the Administrative Procedure Act. Because of this, state courts and state agencies are not bound by this decision either. However, many states tend to look to federal law and its trends as persuasive precedent for their own legal structures.

State of Play in the States

While at least 34 states give some level of deference to state agencies, there has been a recent trend limiting or eliminating such agency deference.2 In 2025 alone, North Carolina, Missouri, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Kentucky have either ended or significantly limited deference to state agencies.

Generally, states are split into four general categories regarding deference practices:

Fifteen states provide substantial deference to state agencies similar or stronger than Chevron. Examples include Illinois, D.C., and Massachusetts.3

Fourteen states provide a moderate level of deference, although with great variety. Some states use a sliding scale to determine the weight of deference, others only providing deference to the interpretation of regulations but not statues, and some add additional tests that must be met in order for deference to attach. These standards vary and there are many unique tests for states that fall under this category. For example, Connecticut provides Chevron-like deference, but only if the agency’s interpretation has been previously subjected to judicial scrutiny or is “time tested.”4 In North Carolina, interpretations are treated as non-binding, with deference based on the ability of the agency to persuade the court. In Michigan, interpretations are given “due consideration,” but courts must provide “cogent reasons” for overturning.

Four states appear inconsistent in their application of deference, with courts ruling both for deference and de novo review or declining to formally set rules of deference. Examples include Nevada and South Dakota.

Eighteen states provide no deference.5

Despite Shift From Deference, States Remain Diverse

Even with seven states limiting deference this year, states that apply deference outnumber the states that don’t. And within the deference states, there still lies significant variation. Some states such as Illinois provide a “presumption of correctness” even in the absence of ambiguity, while others, such as Maryland, provide deference to regulatory interpretations based on a multi-factored sliding scale test. Virginia applies deference based on the ability of the agency to persuade the court based on reasoning and expertise.

The recent shift to abolish or limit deference is also not universal. The Hawai’ian Supreme Court rejected the reasoning set forth in Loper Bright, stating: “[n]ow, the U.S. Supreme Court considers itself and other federal courts the experts on exceedingly complicated areas of American Life…In Hawai‘i, we defer to those agencies with the na‘auao (knowledge/wisdom) on particular subject matters to get complex issues right.”6

The Takeaway

While the abandonment of the Chevron doctrine has led many states to end or restrict deference to state agencies, there still remains significant variation in state application. This trend is not likely to change anytime soon.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-10/litigation%20courts%20verdict%20word%20cloud%20%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=T7rwXqBc,N,,2025-10-13 13:57:18.450733

One, filmed by a photographer in Hyattsville, Md., shows a man pinned to the ground by two ICE officers. He pleads in Spanish and English for someone to help him.

During the incident, one of the officers drops his gun and fumbles for it. Then, he appears to point it at bystanders. Emily Covington, an assistant director in ICE's Office of Public Affairs, told NPR in a statement that drawing a weapon can be used as a de-escalation tactic.

Another video, from Broadview, Ill., near Chicago, appears to show a man outside an ICE facility getting shot in the head with a pepper ball, a projectile filled with chemical irritants. That man, Pastor David Black, has sued the Trump administration.

Late last month, a local CBS reporter said a masked ICE agent fired a pepper ball at her car at that same facility, causing her to vomit for hours. The reporter, Asal Rezaei, said there was no protest happening at the time. Broadview Police are now investigating.

""These are just the tip of the iceberg,"" says Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. ""People being tackled, people getting pepper sprayed or tear gassed. We've seen people getting threatened. And we've seen at least two incidents involving gunfire.""

A majority of Americans do not approve of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics, according to a recent survey from The New York Times and Siena University. Yet in Chicago, immigrant advocate groups say federal immigration officers are escalating those tactics and becoming more violent.

""This administration overall seems more interested in heightening the tensions instead of trying to ramp them down,"" Tsao says.

In late September, federal officers broke down doors and arrested dozens of people during a massive apartment raid on Chicago's south side.

Earlier this month, federal officers shot a woman in the city, and a few weeks before, they killed a man in a nearby suburb. In both shootings, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the victims threatened officers. But in body camera footage from the fatal shooting, the officer who responded says his injuries are ""nothing major.""

In the case of the woman, her lawyer says officer body camera footage from the incident contradicts that narrative, too. On Thursday, a grand jury indicted her and another man, alleging that they ""impeded, intimidated and interfered"" with the duties of a federal officer.

""What we're seeing is a general escalation of violence and the use of excessive force by ICE officers,"" says Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at the ACLU of Illinois, which has brought a lawsuit against the Trump administration for violating the constitutional rights of protesters.

In Covington's statement to NPR, she said ICE officers are ""highly trained and act accordingly with law and policy."" The statement also cited a sharp increase in assaults against ICE officers, though reporting from Colorado Public Radio suggests those claims are overblown.

Gil Kerlikowske, the former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration, says federal immigration officers are not prepared for what is being asked of them.

""They do not have the training or skillset or experience to police an urban environment,"" says Kerlikowske, who was also the police chief in Seattle and police commissioner in Buffalo, N.Y.

Good policing in cities, he says, relies on de-escalation, trust and public cooperation. The show of force federal agents are using in Chicago and elsewhere is unnecessary, he says.

""These are tactics and strategies that are clearly not needed to be able to do their job,"" Kerlikowske says. ""I couldn't be more disappointed.""

Courts have weighed in on the amount of force a police officer — whether they're local, state or federal — can legally use, and determined that any use-of-force must be ""objectively reasonable.""

""What does it mean to be objectively reasonable? That term by itself doesn't actually mean anything without context,"" says Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who trains police officers.

DHS, which includes ICE, uses that standard. The agency's most recent use-of-force policy notes that officers should only use force when ""no reasonably effective, safe and feasible alternative appears to exist."" Among the agency's principles are ""de-escalation"" and ""respect for human life.""

For use of force to be constitutional, there must be a valid threat. But threats can range from someone with a gun, to someone resisting arrest, to many scenarios in between. How police respond to a situation also must be proportional to the danger of the situation.

""We look at the situation through the lens of the reasonable officer on the scene,"" adds Stoughton. ""It might be perfectly reasonable for an officer to step in front of someone, raise a hand and say, 'Stop. I need to talk to you.' And it would be totally unreasonable for the officer to put a gun in that person's face and say, 'Stop or I'm going to shoot you.'""

Many uses of force can be legally justified, but Stoughton says just because officers can do something doesn't mean they should.

""I don't think most people are asking the question, is this action in this particular video consistent or inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment?"" Stoughton says, referring to the law that governs searches and seizures, which also protects against excessive force. ""I think what they're asking is, is this a socially and democratically legitimate police action? And that's a very different question than whether it's a legal police action.""

Immigrant rights groups in Chicago, including the ACLU of Illinois, say federal agents are violating the law – by using ""violent force"" against protesters and others.

Because of that, they say it's important for bystanders to document what they witness, which helps make questions of force a little less open for interpretation.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5300x2981+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4d%2Fa8%2Fbaf668f44ed9a5363cc655419105%2Fgettyimages-2239229963.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 13:57:01.795049

Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Oct. 3 incident in Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood sent students running into the school and prompted teachers and staff to create a barrier between the children and federal authorities.

“The escalation of ICE raids does nothing to keep our young people safe; in fact, it makes them afraid, and it disrupts their learning,” Johnson, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said at a recent news conference.

Now, a new line of protection has surrounded students in the Chicago Public Schools system. Armed with whistles and know-your-rights pamphlets, these community volunteers call themselves “guardian angels.” Together, they secure the perimeters of elementary, middle and high schools across the city.

Asked about the incident, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls when protesters impeded the arrest of an alleged undocumented immigrant. In general, federal policy prohibits immigration authorities from raiding sensitive locations such as churches and schools, although agents have been seen conducting operations in nearby neighborhoods.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “During a targeted immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, U.S. Border Patrol vehicles were impeded by protesters. After repeated vocal attempts to disperse the crowd, USBP deployed tear gas and pepper balls. During this operation an illegal alien was arrested and later complained of a leg injury after attempting to flee law enforcement. Out of an abundance of caution he was taken to the hospital for medical treatment.”

McLaughlin accused protesters of trying to break into the hospital where the detainee was receiving medical care after the arrest.

“Our brave officers are facing a surge in increase in assaults against them, including sniper attacks, cars being used as weapons on them, and assaults by rioters. This violence against law enforcement must END. We will not be deterred by rioters and protesters in keeping America safe,” she said in a statement.

Volunteers fan out across Chicago schools

When the call for volunteers went out, 500 community members stepped up, filling more than 1,000 shifts at nearly 100 schools on Chicago’s northwest side. The goal is to ensure students can attend class for an education without fear of a confrontation with ICE.

This “guardian angel” movement has continued to grow, and volunteers have shown up in droves daily at school pick-up and drop-off locations.

“They’re just regular people who understand that people have the right to eat, to work, to go to school,” said Juliet De Jesus of the Logan Square Neighborhood Association.

Johnson said he’s hopeful there won’t be a repeat of what happened outside the school, thanks to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits federal authorities from using force against citizens.

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X.","Overview:

The deployment of the Texas National Guard to Illinois to support federal authorities in immigration enforcement has been ruled lawful by a federal judge, despite protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants' rights. The troops, who are currently under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command, will remain in a federalized status. The deployment is part of a broader immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, which has flooded Chicago with ICE agents using increasingly aggressive methods to apprehend undocumented immigrants.

Hundreds of Texas-based National Guards deployed this week to Illinois to boost federal authorities can stay there, but can’t be activated, a federal judge ruled Saturday.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the latest ruling states.

This comes after fierce pushback from local residents and Democratic leaders in both Texas and Illinois who have called the president’s decision to deploy the National Guard — with the blessing of Gov. Greg Abbott — unlawful. Two days ago, U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked the guard from being deployed, but the Trump administration appealed the decision, prompting Saturday’s ruling.

In a Fox News interview Monday night, Abbott said that the National Guard troops were being deployed to “safeguard” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The Trump administration over the last month has flooded Chicago with ICE agents who have been using increasingly aggressive methods to go after undocumented immigrants — drawing sharp protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants’ rights that in some instances has escalated to violent clashes on the streets.

Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Perry issued her ruling and order.

Around 200 members from different units of the Texas Guard are currently in Illinois, according to an update from the U.S. Northern Command. It also says that the troops were “mobilized for an initial period of 60 days and will be under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command.” After the initial ruling, the Department of Defense said the federalized National Guard troops “will remain in a federalized status,” though it declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.

Some troops were already at an immigration building in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when Perry heard arguments on Thursday. The building has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and agents.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in President Donald Trump’s “animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” she said.

Since the Chicago-area crackdown began about a month ago, ICE has apprehended more than 1,000 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. U.S. citizens and children have been caught up in raids and altercations between masked federal agents and locals in the nation’s third largest city.

“The president has the constitutional responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States, and those laws include the immigration laws,” Abbott told Sean Hannity. “The president has the authority to call up National Guard to assist in enforcing those laws, and that’s exactly what the president is doing and what Texas is doing — we’re assisting the president in that cause.”

The leveraging of soldiers to help Trump carry out his promised mass deportations of undocumented people echoes a vision the president laid out on the campaign trail, when he pitched an approach of using multiple levels of authority much like former President Dwight Eisenhower’s infamous immigration crackdown.

Here is what you need to know:

What is the Texas National Guard?

The Texas National Guard, made up of more than 20,000 soldiers, is overseen by the Texas Military Department. Guard members are often deployed in response to natural disasters, and in the past have helped rescue people stranded by floodwaters after a hurricane and delivered basic necessities to communities ravaged by storms.

The Military Department’s mission is to provide the president and the governor with “ready forces in support of state and federal authorities at home and abroad,” according to TMD.

The governor has the authority to deploy the Guard as its commander-in-chief. Additionally, a president can take control of troops to deploy them as the nation’s top executive sees fit.

Trump’s federalization of Texas’ troops was blessed by Abbott, who authorized the request.

When has the Texas National Guard been used for non-traditional deployments?

No mission has drawn as much attention to the Texas National Guard or been drenched in politics more than Operation Lone Star.

Abbott launched the border security mission in 2021 in response to what he characterized as the Biden administration’s “open border” immigration policies. The mission became a long-term domestic military deployment, as the governor surged thousands of troops to the 1,254 miles of border that Texas shares with Mexico.

While it was not the first time that military personnel had been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border, the deployment was unique due to the large number of troops quickly dispatched for an indefinite period of time. Also while soldiers in previous federal operations had provided logistical support roles, Texas tested the boundaries of how much immigration enforcement a state could undertake.

The Operation Lone Star deployment was initially defined by its messiness: Troops reported deplorable conditions for a mission that upended their lives.

It was also accompanied by scandal and questions of authority. Guard members were accused of spying on migrants, started shooting would-be border crossers with pepper ball irritants and helped block federal immigration authorities from parts of the border — dragging the Biden administration into court over a constitutional dispute as courts had long held that federal authorities have sole jurisdiction over the enforcement of immigration laws.

Earlier this year, Abbott directed the Guard to help the Trump administration with its immigration crackdown. The Guard is one of two statewide agencies that entered into an agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement which grants it limited authority to enforce immigration laws during regular duties.

In June, the governor deployed 5,000 soldiers across the state in anticipation of massive protests in the state’s largest cities against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Guard members can augment local police in certain circumstances — like during civil unrest — but federal law prohibits the use of troops as civilian law enforcement.

Is it legal for the Texas National Guard to be used for non-state purposes?

Under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the president is able to call upon the National Guard in the case of an invasion, a rebellion or the danger of one, or if the federal government cannot execute its laws “with the regular forces.”

On Sunday, the Texas governor said he “fully authorized” such a deployment.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott said in a post on X.

Trump’s attempts to federalize some blue states’ guards over their objections have, however, resulted in lawsuits.

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily barred the deployment of any state guards to Oregon. A three-judge panel — which includes two Trump nominees — from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then heard arguments on Thursday about the mobilization, but has yet to issue a ruling.

Illinois sued on Monday, saying that the federal government can still enforce its laws in the state and conditions have not been met to justify the mobilization. A federal judge then granted a partial temporary block on Thursday, but specific details were still unclear.

Ten Democratic U.S. representatives from Texas have called Trump’s deployment of national guards unlawful. They also said it set a bad precedent that could undermine Texas’ ability to resist deployment from other states in the future.

“If any other state deployed their National Guard to Texas without our consent, we would call that an invasion of Texas,” the lawmakers said in a Tuesday letter to Abbott.

Amid challenges against his use of the National Guard, Trump has also discussed invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 if necessary, which would allow the president to use the military for civilian law enforcement. But it can only be used under specific situations, such as when requested by a state or when “unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion … make it impracticable” to enforce federal laws.

The Insurrection Act was last invoked in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots following an aid request from California’s governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

What do we know about what the Texas National Guard is doing in Illinois?

Texas Guard members were sighted in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to The Chicago Tribune.

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X. “They are putting America first by ensuring that the federal government can safely enforce federal law.”

The following day, the U.S. Northern Command said in an update that troops were active in the greater Chicago area effective Wednesday. It says they are tasked with protecting ICE and other federal officers who are enforcing federal laws, as well as safeguarding federal properties. Troops may also “temporarily detain” individuals to stop them from interfering with federal officers, but they will not be performing arrests because “that is a law enforcement activity,” the command said.

Some Texas guards were then seen at the Broadview ICE facility, according to local media.

Laura Fine (D-Glenview) and advocacy groups, including the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, held a community workshop in Lovelace Park on Sunday in response to continued federal immigration crackdowns in the Chicago area.

Around 150 people attended the session, titled “Together For Our Neighbors: People’s Defense Workshop.” The event included updates from mutual aid and legal organizations, and advocacy groups fielded questions on a variety of topics, such as whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are required to read detainees their Miranda rights and to what extent local police are barred from cooperating with immigration enforcement.

After the event, several organizers and attendees traveled to the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, which has been the site of confrontations between protesters, political candidates and Department of Homeland Security agents.

Fine, who is running to replace U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Evanston) in Illinois’ 9th Congressional District, said her office has received an influx of messages from residents concerned about immigration raids in the district.

“Today, we heard that somebody was taken from the Home Depot in Evanston,” Fine said. “We had landscapers who were taken across the street from Glenbrook South High School when school was in session. This is happening in our communities with our friends, our neighbors, the people we shop with at the grocery store, the families that our kids go to school with.”

In an X post, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss confirmed ICE was present in Evanston on Sunday morning. Multiple community members were taken, and ICE was also present in Rogers Park, according to the post.

The Department of Homeland Security also arrested an individual in Evanston near the intersection of Church Street and Brown Avenue on Sept. 10, according to a city statement released later that week.

Fine said she is optimistic that the Illinois General Assembly will pass new restrictions on ICE agents when it reconvenes Tuesday.

Jewish Child and Family Services Chicago also participated to highlight the effect of ICE raids on mental health, Skokie resident and JCFS CEO Stacey Shor said.

“What we see happening is, for people who may be directly impacted, there’s increased isolation,” Shor said. “They’re afraid to leave their homes. People are afraid to go about their business.”

Organizers also collected food donations for communities affected by the raids. The concrete tiles around the speakers had “God Bless Democracy” and “Love Thy Neighbor” written on them in chalk.

Chicago resident Carter Cleland, an activist with the anti-war group Chicago Area Peace Action, held a sign reading “Jail Bibi” on one side and with a symbol of the “No Kings” movement on the other.

Cleland said he has hosted weekly rallies in Wilmette for the last eight months to protest against President Donald Trump, the Israel-Hamas war and climate change. Attending this workshop was another element of that activism, Cleland said.

Ben Isabel, Fine’s chief of staff, told the crowd that “no human being is illegal,” prompting cheers from attendees. Before introducing Fine, he emphasized that Chicago is a city of immigrants.

“Our immigrant neighbors are our coworkers, our classmates, our friends and our family,” Isabel said. “They deserve safety, dignity and the full protection of their rights.”

An excellent piece by Telnaes that can be taken a couple of ways. Certainly, the brutality of the lawless attacks has damaged our freedom, but you can also take Liberty as a personification of the American people and those who wish to be American and interpret the attacks as happening to all of us.

An eagle, or Uncle Sam, wouldn’t include the immigrants as effectively. We’ve spent the last century-plus glorifying the concept of immigrants and refugees seeing the Statue of Liberty as they sail into New York harbor despite the plain fact that not everyone arrives either by ship or through that port.

We invented the myth of the First Thanksgiving as an embodiment of the friendship of the established inhabitants for those who might come seeking freedom. And, oh, BTW, to fill jobs in our growing mines and factories.

This was part of a view of American history I call “the virus that spread from Plymouth Rock,” since the Jamestown colony was already more than a decade old when that friendly feast happened or perhaps never did.

And Spain had begun establishing settlements here as soon as Columbus landed, but our kids don’t learn about the extensive and important Spanish settlements in the West until the land had become part of the United States, or until the virus reached that part of the country.

Not only does history not happen until the white folks arrive, they have to be the right white folks, and the Know-Nothings of the 1830s and 40s were quite sure that Catholics, and especially Irish Catholics, were not who belonged here. The burning of the Charlestown Nunnery was only one of the attacks on the wrong kind of people by a group that had surprising political success peddling their bigoted program.

And, by golly, didn’t they come back about 75 years later.

And again 75 years after that.

The Know-Nothing Party is long gone, but the current crop of nativists creates their own mythology, and I wasn’t surprised this morning by a report on social media that another bullet has been found, proving that Kirk’s murder was part of a conspiracy, though there was no mention of a grassy knoll.

Though speaking of conspiracy theories, I got a laugh when it happened that I saw Whamond’s cartoon just before I spotted this on social media:

Humor is an effective tool against hate, though you have to be cautious, since bullies don’t like being made to look revealed to be stupid.

Bagley’s accusation is very effective at comforting the afflicted, but likely not so good at afflicting the comfortable, given that a substantial number of the bullies think the January 6 events were a good thing, even as they put “Support the Blue” stickers on their bumpers.

They should understand the second panel, but the combination doesn’t click for them. Which is how we got to where we are.

Again.

They do hate, but don’t see themselves as motivated by hatred. Telnaes paints Noem as the evil reincarnation of Aimee Semple McPherson, which is probably unfair to McPherson, who was certainly flamboyant and religiously extreme but politically fairly moderate.

The thing is, Telnaes did not make up some bizarre phrase to stick in Noem’s mouth: Rather, she used the journalist’s sneaky trick of quoting her directly and accurately. Kosplay Kristi was speaking of sending ICE to the Super Bowl, under the impression that a lot of lawn workers and motel maids will be shelling out six grand each to watch Bad Bunny.

I have the responsibility for making sure everybody goes to the Super Bowl, has the opportunity to enjoy it and to leave, and that’s what America is about.

In case you wondered what America is about. It’s about going to the Super Bowl, enjoying it and then self-deporting. Or something.

You can’t copyright a book title, but I don’t think David Halberstam’s estate has to worry about anyone writing about this administration and calling it The Best and the Brightest.

It would all be hilarious if it weren’t so unspeakably, incredibly brutal and cruel. Part of the problem is that, while people being dragged out of their cars and beaten in the streets should be appalling, when seen on TV it seems to be happening to someone else, somewhere else.

I’ve seen a demonstrator hit in the face with billy clubs less than 10 feet from me, and it’s a whole lot different than seeing it on television. She was screaming in pain and fear and her face looked like bloody liver as they dragged her away, but I really think you had to be there, because three months later I watched the Chicago Convention on TV and it was the same town and the same cops, but it just felt like TV.

On the other hand, once budget cuts begin to double insurance premiums, and to simultaneously limit what financially-burdened hospitals are able to provide, the impact of a less physical, more organizational cruelty will hit more people more directly.

Unfortunately, the midterms are likely to be over before the worst of it has struck, which sounds heartless, but if it’s going to happen, it ought to at least have some strategic value.

One piece of cruelty that is beginning to hit a wide target is the flood of layoffs triggered by the shutdown. Trump once more proves that you can be clever without being intelligent, because he’s threatening to fire workers in revenge for the shutdown but had the good instinct to order the military paid, although they weren’t supposed to be.

The threats could bring a few legislators to heel, but there are lots of young families in the military and letting them starve or lose their housing would be directly felt.

“Crocodile tears” is a wonderfully well-chosen metaphor.

It’s odd to look back on Nixon nostalgically, but being on his enemies list was more of a compliment than a threat. It meant he didn’t like you. He might decide to have your phone tapped or order your taxes audited, but you didn’t have to worry about your family’s safety.

Those were the good old days.

“Then we had Purple Line construction, which took away business when it became too difficult to travel here.","Sit down in the San Alejo Salvadoran restaurant, near the corner of New Hampshire Avenue and University Boulevard in suburban Maryland, and you have entered the heart of Langley Park — like a mini Central America.

Situated on the border where Montgomery County ends and Prince George’s County begins, Langley Park’s mostly Latino community is proud of its 100-year history as a lively neighborhood of immigrants, filled with Hispanic markets, restaurants and small businesses that line its busy streets.

But challenges from landlord neglect and the impacts of the Maryland Transit Administration’s new Purple Line are making life more difficult for the residents who call Langley Park home. And more recently, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have put the community on edge.

National politics hit home

As she sat eating tamales at San Alejo, Maryland State Del. Deni Taveras talked about how the ICE raids in the neighborhood have also reopened old wounds.

“A lot of people here lived through wars in their countries. To have masked men with machine guns breaking down doors at 6 a.m., that brings trauma,” she said, referring to how ICE officers have been entering homes in Langley Park. “People are afraid to go to work. They’re afraid to make a living,” she said.

Lindolfo Carballo, senior director of community economic development of the Latino advocacy organization CASA, which is located in the center of Langley Park, agreed with Taveras. “What this administration is doing has horrified our community,” he said and added that he’s seen ICE officers pull people right off the street and social media posts have tracked the abuse in the neighborhood.

Carballo said ICE officers broke the window of a Langley Park woman’s car with her teenage daughter inside. “Her daughter saw the whole thing. And that’s not only illegal but it’s inhumane,” he said.

The reason for the targeting? About 85% of the neighborhood’s 22,000 residents are from Central America, and some are undocumented, Carballo said. The majority are from El Salvador and Guatemala, along with immigrants from Nicaragua, Honduras and other countries.

Thousands of Latino immigrants moved to Langley Park during the 1970s and 1980s, a time when civil wars were tearing through El Salvador and Guatemala, Carballo said. Now, the community has one of the highest populations of Salvadorans in the U.S.

Carballo himself is an immigrant who escaped El Salvador in the early 1980s after he was arrested for participating in anti-government activities during the nation’s civil war. Fearing persecution under a military government, he was able to get asylum in D.C. before coming to the Langley Park area. He is concerned that Central American immigrants now are being denied the opportunities he received.

Even before he came to work in Langley Park, the area was always a neighborhood of immigrants, Carballo said, stretching back to the 1920s when a British immigrant, Frederick McCormick-Goodhart bought the land where Langley Park now sits.

The mining magnate built a 30,000-square-foot mansion, where CASA is now headquartered. Developers built low-cost garden apartments surrounding the mansion, which attracted large groups of immigrants over the past 90 years, from Eastern European Jews to Africans to an influx of Central Americans starting in the 1970s.

Housing, economic strains and fentanyl

While ICE raids are the latest concern for Langley Park residents, the neighborhood has had some longstanding problems that leaders are still addressing.

Carballo said while immigrants were able to find cheaper housing in Langley Park, its housing stock has long suffered neglect. For years, landlords often deferred maintenance and faced few consequences because non-English speaking tenants didn’t have the tools to legally challenge them — leaving some occupants living in deteriorating buildings.

“Drive around here and you can see windows made of cardboard,” Carballo said. “And in the wintertime, that is cruel.”

About 20 years ago, with the help of CASA, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary next month, some tenants organized and fought to improve living conditions, which brought about upgrades in some buildings.

“This is a hardworking area of individuals that want to make their American dreams come true,” Taveras said. But now people are paying $1,700 a month for rent, which is very high for someone making just $15-$20 an hour, she said.

To make ends meet, many people rent out rooms or families double up so they can make rent, causing overcrowding in some buildings.

Taveras has represented different parts of Prince George’s County on the council for 12 years, and now represents Langley Park while living on the edge of the neighborhood. She came to the D.C. area from New York in the early 2000s.

Of Dominican heritage, she says she’s proud to fight for the neighborhood, a community grappling with the same housing and economic struggles she knew growing up as an orphan in one of New York’s Hispanic neighborhoods.

Adding to the economic strains, fentanyl is also eating away at the neighborhood, especially among young people, Taveras said. “It was an onslaught, especially at Northwestern and High Point high schools” where many Langley Park teens attend.

Over the past 10 years, however, “we’ve been able to address the addiction through Narcan,” she said. Legislation and distributing fentanyl detection strips have also helped “because a lot of people didn’t know that what they were taking was laced with fentanyl.”

The Purple Line — hopes and hazards

The Purple Line, MTA’s long-awaited 16-mile light rail stretching from Bethesda to New Carrollton, cuts directly through Langley Park.A 2017 report said few deny that the Purple Line will bring new amenities and services to what researchers referred to as a “long-neglected portion of the county.”

While many in Langley Park welcome better transit access, they also worry it will accelerate gentrification, Carballo said.

Construction of the line over the past seven years has cut into profits for businesses along the rail’s path, according to Yolanda Brewster, a Guatemalan immigrant who runs the Xelaju kiosk, which sells Guatemalan food, clothes and souvenirs in La Union Mall on University Boulevard.

“First we had the pandemic, which wiped us out,” she said. “Then we had Purple Line construction, which took away business when it became too difficult to travel here. Now it’s like a cemetery — no one comes here anymore.”

Culture helps build community

Despite these challenges, Langley Park endures as a place where families build futures. Carballo of CASA said that, to him, the neighborhood represents “everything positive.”

“It’s a very young neighborhood, right? There are so many kids here, so many people, and that is the future of the United States.”

Del. Taveras agrees on how deeply that spirit runs. “We have children here that are on their way to Dartmouth. We have families starting their businesses, that are extremely entrepreneurial.”

“We have a sense of resilience here, a sense of community here, a sense of culture that is extremely rich and very endearing,” Taveras said.

She said this is especially important to point out during Hispanic Heritage Month, when the U.S. celebrates all things Latino. She remembered celebrations past at Langley Park’s MegaMart Hispanic grocery store, which had a party for Guatemalian Independence Day on Oct. 15 last year that was “so big, it lasted until the next day.

“As somebody who could have lived anywhere, I chose to be here,” Taveras said, “and I’m so proud of where I live.”

What we know:

Thompson said the protests at the ICE facility ""degenerated into chaos,"" adding that 10 of those arrested were ""around the age of my own daughter.""

""As a mother and a mayor, I am mad at what happened,"" Thompson said in a statement. ""Broadview didn’t choose to have the ICE facility in our community. But it’s here. And so are Broadview residents.""

Under a new executive order signed by Thompson, demonstrations will now be limited to the safety zone located directly at the ICE facility on Beach Street. The previous protest area on South 25th Avenue between Lexington and Fillmore has been eliminated.

What they're saying:

Thompson said the decision was made in consultation with the Illinois State Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.

""It has been only God’s grace alone that a protester has not been struck and killed by a motorist on 25th Avenue given how frequently protesters dash onto this busy, four-lane street,"" Thompson said.

While reaffirming her support for peaceful demonstrations, Thompson condemned violent behavior at recent protests and said her top priority remains protecting residents and first responders.

""I respect, support, and defend the protesters’ free and – peaceful – speech against the outrageous injustices and deplorable unprovoked chemical arms attacks by ICE agents against American citizens, journalists, and ministers that put Broadview police and firefighters in harms’ way,"" she said.

Dig deeper:

Under the current framework, USCIS confirms that renewal applications for existing DACA recipients continue to be processed nationwide without interruption.

This development comes amid continuous legal challenges to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides protection from deportation and work authorization for undocumented individuals who arrived in the United States as children.

The current status reflects the ongoing legal battle that has plagued DACA since its establishment in 2012. Recent court decisions, particularly from the Southern District of Texas under Judge Andrew Hanen and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, have determined that DACA was not lawfully implemented. In January 2025, the Fifth Circuit struck down key portions of the Biden Administration’s DACA regulation while stopping short of completely terminating the program, sending the case back to Judge Hanen for further determination.

Under the current framework, USCIS confirms that renewal applications for existing DACA recipients continue to be processed nationwide without interruption. However, initial applications from first-time applicants are being accepted but placed on indefinite hold. The agency will receive and store these filings but will not review, adjudicate, or issue work authorization until further court direction emerges. Advance Parole for international travel remains available to current DACA holders on a case-by-case basis.

This acceptance without adjudication approach stems directly from the injunction still in place under the Texas court order. Until that order is modified or lifted, no new DACA grants can be approved regardless of application submission. The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security have requested that the court permit adjudication of new DACA applications outside Texas, arguing that Dreamers nationwide should not face penalties due to a geographically limited ruling. That proposal remains pending before Judge Hanen.

Legal experts anticipate that regardless of the Texas court’s next decision, the case will likely return to the U.S. Supreme Court for a final determination on DACA’s future in 2026. The program continues to stand at the center of legal and political debate in the United States, with this latest development representing both a technical step and a potential turning point in the ongoing litigation surrounding Dreamers’ protections.",https://www.citybuzz.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/favicon-65x65.png,N,,2025-10-13 12:58:08.114322

Villegas Gonzalez was killed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Sept. 12 during what authorities initially described as a routine traffic stop that Villegas Gonzalez tried to flee.
Though DHS said Villegas Gonzalez was a targeted undocumented immigrant because of his criminal background of “reckless driving,” the Tribune found no criminal history for Villegas Gonzalez, who had been living in the Chicago area for the past 18 years.
Since getting his children, Villegas Gonzalez dedicated his time to work and taking care of his two sons, his loved ones say.
That trip was also the last time she hugged Villegas Gonzalez goodbye.","On a recent humid morning in Michoacán, Mexico, hundreds gathered to mourn Silverio Villegas Gonzalez. His body had finally come home after getting shot and killed by an ICE agent in Franklin Park after he allegedly tried to run him over.

The small town where he was born and raised was filled that late September day with neighbors, friends, and relatives, many of whom have family members working or living in the United States. Among them were Silverio’s elderly parents, dressed in white, leaning on others for support as they made their way through their town, paying homage to Villegas Gonzalez.

Their faces were etched with sorrow; their steps heavy not just from age, but from the weight of a grief that may never leave them. At 38 years old, he was the youngest of their 10 children.

“Mi hijo era un buen hombre. Por qué me lo mataron así?” cried Esperanza Gonzalez, 77, his mother, on a phone call with Tribune. “My son was a good man. Why did they kill him that way?”

On the day of his burial, as they lowered their son into the ground, one absence loomed larger than the rest: Villegas Gonzalez’s two children were not there.

Villegas Gonzalez was killed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Sept. 12 during what authorities initially described as a routine traffic stop that Villegas Gonzalez tried to flee. A few weeks later, the state of Idaho took custody of his two kids, according to his family and Mexican officials.

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare could not immediately provide a comment regarding the case, but his family said Villegas Gonzalez had been seeking custody of his two sons, 7 and 3, in court before his death and had obtained partial custody. Their biological mother had moved with the children to Idaho about three years ago, the family said.

“The (U.S.) government killed their father and now they want to take them away from us,” Graciela Villegas, one of his sisters, told the Tribune. “Those children adored their dad.”

Now, from across the border, his family is not only seeking to reunite with his children, they’re also fighting for something just as important, they said: justice.

Earlier this month, Illinois Democratic leaders, including U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García and other congressional representatives sent a letter to the Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asking for transparency and accountability about the fatal shooting by the ICE officer. Meanwhile, the Mexican Consulate in Chicago confirmed it is working to help reunite the children with their extended family who live in the United States.

Ambassador Reyna Torres Mendivil said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is demanding a “thorough investigation.”

In the weeks since Villegas Gonzalez’s death, new video evidence has emerged, including footage from witness cellphones and, most notably, body cameras worn by Franklin Park police officers who responded to the scene. Democratic leaders requesting the investigation say there are “inconsistencies between publicly released surveillance footage and allegations made by DHS,” which claimed that Villegas Gonzalez dragged an officer with his vehicle and attempted to run him over, causing serious injuries.

Back in Michoacán, the calls for justice can seem louder than the wailing at the burial. For Graciela Villegas, who had not seen her brother in nearly two decades, seeing her brother in a casket was “excruciating.”

Her brother, she said, was wrongfully portrayed as a criminal.

“They killed him for no reason,” Graciela said.

Though DHS said Villegas Gonzalez was a targeted undocumented immigrant because of his criminal background of “reckless driving,” the Tribune found no criminal history for Villegas Gonzalez, who had been living in the Chicago area for the past 18 years.

Since getting his children, Villegas Gonzalez dedicated his time to work and taking care of his two sons, his loved ones say. He was working on getting healthier and on saving money, his sister said.

“That’s because he wanted to prove that he could be a good father to gain full custody of his children,” she added.

She thinks that her brother was “so worried of losing his children” and “that’s why he may have tried to run away” from the federal agents who were questioning him.

Penny Kostoglakis, the mother of the children and Villegas Gonzalez’s wife, said she has not been able to see her children since the state of Idaho picked them up from Chicago. Though she lives in that state and intends to seek custody, she said she thinks her children will be well taken care of by the Villegas family if they stay in the United States.

“He was always good to me,” she said about Villegas Gonzalez. “He was always working and I would stay home to take care of the kids.”

When she found out about the shooting she immediately asked her sister in Chicago, “Were the kids with him?”

Villegas Gonzalez had just dropped off his kids at day care and was on his way to work when the agents approached him. Mexican officials say they are monitoring the welfare of the children.

“We are doing everything necessary, in coordination with the consular network, to ensure that these children are being taken care of now,” Torres Mendivil said. “(The custody of the children) will not be determined by the family or the consulates. No one else will intervene other than a judge who must assess whether the children are being placed in a safe environment.”

Graciela Villegas remembers her brother as a quiet and reserved man who left his rural hometown in Mexico to pursue opportunities to earn more money in the United States when he was 20 years old.

That was the last time Graciela saw her brother alive.

“But he would call or message me almost every day,” she said through tears. “Whenever he could, he would send us money, especially since our parents have been sick lately.”

The family lives in Loma de Chupio, a small town with dirt roads and houses made of stone with tiled roofs. The community lives off the land, raising cattle and relying on what they can grow.

Most people in their town have family members living in the United States without legal status, Villegas said. Many of them knew him personally.

“The whole town is grieving, and everyone is scared of what might happen to their loved ones in the U.S.,” said Lourdes Alejandra Lopez, director of migrant services in Irimbo, Michoacán, the municipality that includes Loma de Chupio. Lopez has been supporting the Villegas family through the repatriation process, the burial, and now serves as their liaison as Mexican authorities demand an investigation into the fatal shooting.

Local officials have also started compiling information on residents with family members abroad, aiming to provide resources and guidance in case of deportation for when they return.

“For now, the family needs to rest,” Lopez said. “They are facing not only the pain of losing a loved one but also the burden of a legal battle.”

For Esperanza Gonzalez, the only comfort amid the grief would be having her two grandchildren, Villegas Gonzalez’s sons, back home with them.

She met her eldest grandson during a visit to Chicago a few years ago. That trip was also the last time she hugged Villegas Gonzalez goodbye.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-L-Silverio-Villegas-procession-03_243180638_228574.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-10-13 12:57:55.323307

The survival of our nations, our families, and our children hinges on protecting both our tribal and U.S. citizenship.
Indigenous Peoples’ Day as Resistance In this political landscape, Indigenous Peoples’ Day reminds the public that the survival of Native nations is inseparable from Native sovereignty.","Indigenous Peoples’ Day has always been an act of celebration, resistance, and truth. When we gather and organize for Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we affirm that we are still here. It is a reminder that our stories did not begin with Columbus, and they do not end with the myth of American exceptionalism and conquest. But today, it carries an urgency we can’t ignore. In the current political climate, that affirmation takes on new meaning as questions about the legitimacy of our U.S. citizenship are raised in efforts to end birthright citizenship and erase the political existence of Native nations.

On October 9, 2025, Trump issued the 2025 Columbus Day Proclamation, declaring Christopher Columbus “a visionary who paved the way for the founding of our great Nation.” He urged Americans to honor “the values of courage, faith, and discovery that built Western civilization.”

In the proclamation, Trump made no mention of Indigenous people, unless you count the mention of a “vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage.” The wording of Trump’s phrase echoes a similar line in the Declaration of Independence, which accuses King George III of acting against the colonists who opposed British rule by colluding with “the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.” Instead of taking the opportunity to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples’ Day, Trump doubled down on a myth of discovery that glorifies genocide and rebrands colonization as destiny.

This same worldview underpins Trump’s renewed effort to end birthright citizenship, a move that threatens not only immigrants but also the very foundation of Native existence. In one of the administration’s own legal arguments, officials claimed, “The United States’ connection with the children of illegal aliens and temporary visitors is weaker than its connection with members of Indian tribes. If the latter link is insufficient for birthright citizenship, the former certainly is.”

This suggests that tribal citizenship, the political relationship that predates the United States itself, is somehow incompatible with being American. It echoes the logic used to justify centuries of termination policies, removal, and forced dependency.

The Trump administration’s attacks on birthright citizenship do not just threaten immigrant communities. They strike at the very heart of Indigenous sovereignty. They threaten to bring back an era of termination and removal, creating the conditions for Native people to once again be treated as wards of the state, stripped of rights, and relocated to lands or countries we have never set foot in.

Recent reports from the Oregon Capital Chronicle describe how Navajo citizens were detained in immigration sweeps across border states, raising alarm among tribal leaders who warn that racial profiling and the refusal to recognize tribal identification put Indigenous people in the same danger as undocumented immigrants.

The American Immigration Council has also warned that the Supreme Court’s refusal to restrict racial profiling in immigration raids has encouraged law enforcement to target anyone who looks “foreign,” a pattern that puts Indigenous people at particular risk because our identities and documents are not consistently recognized or treated as valid government documents.

Tribal Nations have alerted their citizens to this threat, suggesting they carry their tribal IDs, Certificate of Indian Blood (CIB), passports, and other photo IDs to help reduce the risk of detainment in the event of ICE raids.

The Indian Law Resource Center also reminds us that many of those being deported are Indigenous people themselves. The center has raised concern over the planned deportation of more than 600 Guatemalan children, at least 90 percent of whom are Maya, stressing that these children are Indigenous and have rights under both U.S. and international law.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day has never been just a celebration. It is a call to action against the ongoing assault on our sovereignty and existence — and an assertion that, despite these threats, we will not be erased, silenced, or eradicated.

Sovereignty and Citizenship

Indigenous Peoples’ Day stands in defiance of a nation that has always treated Native sovereignty as an obstacle to overcome in upholding the myth of Manifest Destiny. In 1871, theIndian Appropriations Act ended the recognition of tribes as sovereign nations. With that single act, Congress declared that no tribe would be acknowledged as an independent power capable of making treaties. Our nations were reduced to wards of the state, entirely dependent on the same government that had stolen our lands.

TheDawes Act of 1887 went further. It divided tribal lands into individual allotments and stripped millions of acres from Native control. It was designed to assimilate Natives into mainstream society and dismantle tribal sovereignty, breaking apart communities and leaving many Natives impoverished and landless. The act also tied land allotments to U.S. citizenship, granting it to those who accepted allotments, severed their tribal affiliations, and left reservations, making citizenship a tool of assimilation rather than recognition of rights.

With the 1934 passage of theIndian Reorganization Act, also known as the Wheeler-Howard Act, tribes regained a measure of sovereignty. The Indian Reorganization Act allowed tribes to re-establish governments and manage their own lands, but the recognition came with heavy federal oversight. Yet even within those restrictions, our nations rebuilt and strengthened the scope and boundaries of our sovereignty.

Dual Citizenship

As Native peoples, we are citizens of the United States, but we are also citizens of our tribal nations. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 extended U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans without requiring them to sever their tribal affiliations, as was previously necessary. The Act created a dual framework, where we not only have the right to self-determination but also hold rights and responsibilities in two nations simultaneously.

This reality is fragile, and not all Native nations share the same protection. As Teen Vogue reported, nearly 400 tribes in the United States lack federal recognition, which means they do not share the same nation-to-nation relationship that federally recognized tribes have with the U.S. government. This also leaves their people without the legal rights, resources, or protections guaranteed to federally recognized tribes. For these communities, the lack of recognition means they exist in a legal limbo when federal policy turns hostile.

As Dina Gilio-Whitaker, author and professor of American Indian studies and lecturer at the California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center, explained to Truthout:

Tribal sovereignty as a legal principle and self-determination as tribal autonomy has always been what’s at stake for tribal nations. Throughout U.S. history it has never been unassailable in U.S. law because of underlying logics of Euro-Christian superiority; that is what the doctrine of discovery is.

History has shown that while our sovereignty is an organic, inalienable right, it is not a fixed or guaranteed right in relation to the U.S. government. Indigenous nations must continually nurture the nation-to-nation relationship that we have and defend our sovereignty against political systems designed to limit or erase it.

If tribal sovereignty were ever dissolved as it was in 1871 with the Indian Appropriations Act, recognition of our tribal citizenship would disappear with it. If our U.S. citizenship were also revoked, we would be left stateless in our own homelands. That is the depth of what is at stake when sovereignty is undermined. Native identity, rights, and futures are tied to the recognition of both forms of citizenship, to the survival of our nations as sovereign powers, and to the protection of the land and water that sustain us.

Contemporary Threats to Citizenship and Sovereignty

The Trump administration’s attacks on Native sovereignty and citizenship are not isolated incidents. They are part of a consistent effort to undermine the rights of tribal nations and the people who belong to them. Treaty obligations are dismissed whenever they conflict with corporate interests. Sacred lands such asBears Ears andOak Flat are stripped of federal protection and opened to mining and drilling.Pipelines are forced through Native territories without consultation or consent. Federal funding for housing, health care, and education — already limited in many communities — is repeatedly threatened, further weakening the foundations of Native life.

Native children face a direct threat to their connection to their nations through attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, which has been challenged in multiple cases in state and federal courts. Native tribes and organizations successfully defended and even expanded this law.

Passed in 1978 to stop the mass removal of Native children from their families and communities, the Indian Child Welfare Act protects the right of children to remain with their families, in their communities, and connected to their cultures.

Despite ongoing challenges, the law remains one of the most important protections for tribal sovereignty and Native families. In June 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act’s constitutionality in a 7–2 decision in Haaland v. Brackeen, rejecting all challenges to the law.

More recently, in August 2024, the California Supreme Court strengthened the Indian Child Welfare Act by requiring child welfare agencies to investigate a child’s potential Native ancestry before separating families. But around the same time, the rejection of the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act denied survivors of cultural genocide a path to justice. The proposed commission would have investigated the legacy of Indian boarding schools and given survivors a chance to tell their stories and seek accountability.

Attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, birthright citizenship, and tribal sovereignty are interconnected. Each is a threat to the dual citizenship Native people hold. Undermining either form of citizenship puts Native people at risk of legal limbo, statelessness, and social and economic marginalization. The survival of our nations, our families, and our children hinges on protecting both our tribal and U.S. citizenship.

Refusing to Surrender

Despite continued threats to our sovereignty, Native nations, communities, and organizations use every means available, from the courts to direct action, to defend our rights and existence. The victories won and even the losses show that even in the face of systemic erasure and violence, Native people refuse to disappear, refuse to surrender.

The fight to protect Oak Flat in Arizona is a current example of this. Oak Flat, a sacred Apache site, is threatened by a copper mine authorized through a congressional land swap pushed by the Trump administration. Tribal leaders, activists, and allies organized to defend Oak Flat, arguing in court and mobilizing to ensure that sacred land is not exchanged and destroyed for foreign private profit.

As of October 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear further appeals, supporting lower court rulings that allow the transfer to proceed. However, a federal appeals court issued an emergency injunction blocking the transfer and delaying the mine’s advance while legal challenges are considered.

At Standing Rock, hundreds of tribes and tens of thousands of allies gathered and occupied land near the Cannonball River in North Dakota to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline to protect treaty lands and water. Although the pipeline was completed, the resistance led to widespread awareness of Indigenous rights and environmental justice.

Standing Rock sparked solidarity actions around the world, inspired divestment campaigns targeting banks that financed the pipeline, and brought issues such as broken treaties, environmental racism, and missing and murdered Indigenous women into global conversations. It also resulted in ongoing legal challenges and inspired a new generation of Native activists who understand that sovereignty is not negotiable.

These interventions, whether through the courts or activism, are not symbolic but the literal defense of rights that are supposed to be guaranteed under tribal and U.S. law. It is the refusal to accept marginalization, neglect, erasure, and defeat. Indigenous Peoples’ Day is both a reflection of these struggles and a call to continue the fight.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day as Resistance

In this political landscape, Indigenous Peoples’ Day reminds the public that the survival of Native nations is inseparable from Native sovereignty. When birthright citizenship is questioned, when sacred lands are desecrated, when funding for essential programs is threatened, and when cultural institutions are ignored or attacked, the very survival of our communities is at stake.

In an interview with Truthout, Dina Gilio-Whitaker explained:

Tribes will always be a threat to a certain segment of the American population (currently coded as Republican) because the doctrine of tribal sovereignty erects a system of guardrails to protect the rights that hundreds of treaties guaranteed, and the small amount of land that tribes still control. Those lands hold coveted resources that tribes have the power to choose to develop or keep in the ground.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day calls on everyone to honor our survival and acknowledge the ongoing struggle against colonization and genocide. Our struggles are not isolated; they echo in other parts of the world, from the defense of our homelands here to the fight for survival in Gaza, where people continue to resist displacement and violence. It is a reminder that what happens to Native nations today is a glimpse of what can happen to any community when power goes unchecked and rights are violated. Indigenous Peoples’ Day reminds us that defending our sovereignty is defending justice for all.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2220129370-1536x1025.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 10:57:17.820348

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants—regardless of status—have been pulling back.
Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64.
""Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what's happening to immigrants,"" she said.
""I can't express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,"" Durazo said.","An estimated 1.4 million immigrants who are in the country legally but are not citizens stand to lose their government-subsidized health care coverage under the sweeping tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law this summer, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts federal spending on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. It also places new eligibility restrictions on lawfully present immigrants, including refugees and asylees, who are enrolled in a variety of government-subsidized health programs: Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicare and Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Immigrants who are in the country illegally have long been ineligible for federally funded health coverage.

But seven states—California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington—plus the District of Columbia have extended state-funded coverage to some income-eligible noncitizen adults regardless of their immigration status. Fourteen states plus the district provide state-funded coverage to noncitizen children whether they are here legally or not.

The new restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with other Trump policies limiting public benefits for immigrants, put those states in a financial bind. With less federal money to provide health benefits to immigrants who are here legally, states will be hard-pressed to maintain their programs that offer coverage to all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.

""We're taking a giant step backwards from that public health and preventive health measure by excluding more people and draining federal resources from states that need it,"" said Tanya Broder, a senior counsel specializing in immigrant health policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.

""And the result will be that our health—individually, as families and as communities—will be in jeopardy, and the health care infrastructure that serves all of us will also be compromised,"" Broder said.

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants—regardless of status—have been pulling back.

To help close a $12 billion deficit, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Current enrollees between the ages of 19 and 59 will have to pay a new $30 monthly premium beginning in 2027. In July 2026, the state will eliminate dental care for noncitizens.

Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64. The state still operates a state-funded plan for residents 65 and older regardless of immigration status, but enrollment has been paused. And Minnesota also plans to exclude adult immigrants who are here illegally from a program that used to provide coverage regardless of immigration status.

New York is in an especially tough spot, since its state constitution prohibits discrimination against lawfully present immigrants in providing public benefits.

""States have had some type of leeway to fund resources for migrant communities if they want to,"" said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor and the founding director of the Medical-Legal Partnership Clinic at Penn State Dickinson Law who studies immigrants' access to health care. ""But now this [federal] law makes it difficult for them to do that.""

Making it less attractive to stay

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration policies, said these efforts are part of both Trump's larger anti-immigration stance and ""Congress' interest in getting rid of any incentive or benefit for people who are in the country illegally.""

""It's a way of making it less attractive for people to stay here illegally, right?"" Vaughan said. ""They're trying to give people reasons to leave rather than reasons to stay.""

As noncitizens who are here legally lose access to federally funded benefits, the demand for state-funded coverage is ""likely to increase,"" Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research group, told Stateline.

""However, at the same time, states are facing increasing budget pressures, especially with the Medicaid cuts,"" Pillai said. ""So it's almost a double whammy, where there will likely be increased demand for state-funded coverage programs, but also states will have fewer resources to cover people.""

Makhlouf said the Trump administration's policy changes reflect a broader strategy of stripping public benefits from marginalized and poor communities.

""Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what's happening to immigrants,"" she said. ""When it becomes normalized to be able to sacrifice certain people's humanity or their vulnerability, or to minimize their contributions to society, and say, ""You don't deserve access to health care,"" then that can be turned on to any group.""

Under Trump's domestic policy law, California expects to lose at least $28.4 billion in federal Medicaid funding, according to Newsom's office.

On the California Senate floor June 27, Democratic state Sen. María Elena Durazo expressed her sorrow at the state's decision to deny coverage to immigrants.

""I can't express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,"" Durazo said. ""Today, that joy that I was so happy about, that joy has turned into pain, that joy has turned into shame.""

Democratic Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, however, said the state had little choice.

""We are a state of immigrants, 10.6 million strong. And we will never turn our backs on those who are part of the heart of the largest economy in the United States of America,"" McGuire said during the debate. ""So we've had to make some tough decisions. I know we're not going to please everyone.""

Obligated in New York

One state, New York, is particularly in a bind, because its constitution requires it to provide coverage to lawfully present noncitizens.

New York mostly picked up the tab for immigrants and other lawfully residing immigrants until 2016, when it launched coverage it called the Essential Plan under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Under the ACA, the plan has no deductibles or monthly premiums for patients, and the federal government has picked up almost the entire cost—90%—of the plan, a huge economic relief for the state.

Now, New York faces an annual loss of $13.5 billion in federal Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funds. Additionally, the phasing out of premium tax credits for noncitizens under Trump's law would lead to a loss of $7.5 billion in annual funding to the state's Essential Plan, which covers 1.7 million New Yorkers.

""These are billions of dollars that are being taken away and out of New York's delivery system,"" Amir Bassiri, director of Medicaid at the New York State Department of Health, said at a United Hospital Fund conference on July 30.

The next, her son said, she was bundled into a van, the latest victim of U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive crackdown on immigrants.

Maria's family was left to pick up the pieces, removing her cart, food containers and umbrella before launching a frantic search for the Mexican-born mother of seven who has lived in the United States for two decades, albeit undocumented.

By Saturday morning, 24 hours after her arrest, her family had still learned ""nothing"" about her status from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency conducting aggressive raids in and around the nation's third largest city.

""It could be days, it could be months, it could be years, or we may never see her again,"" Eduardo Santoyo, 22, said of his mother.

Maria's detention in broad daylight — witnesses posted video online — fit a recent pattern: Agents swoop in without warning, snatch an unsuspecting resident and drive off, with relatives left to panic over the fate of their loved ones.

""What are we going to tell my sister?"" Santayo asked, referring to his mother's youngest child, who is only six years old.

Anguish colored the faces of Maria's son and another daughter, age 16, as they stepped in to continue running the tamale cart in the very spot where their mother was taken into custody.

This week saw scores of immigration detentions in Chicago, many of which only came to light after witnesses posted footage of the arrests on social media.

Alerts about raids are popping up regularly online as activist groups warn residents about sweeps in neighborhoods with a large Latino population like Cicero, Little Village and Pilsen.

Migrants reportedly have been detained at Chicago-area construction sites, near a university building, along strip malls and outside schools.

A local television producer, who holds U.S. citizenship, was arrested by federal agents during immigration enforcement operations on Chicago's North Side, her employer WGN said. She was later released.

Federal agents also targeted rideshare drivers in a sweep Friday at O'Hare International Airport, resulting in 12 arrests, according to local reports.

While protesters have been beaten, tear-gassed and arrested in recent weeks at an ICE facility in the suburb of Broadview, anti-immigration unrest across the rest of the city has been sporadic.

But the impact of the raids has been nothing less than chilling.

""You may not see a raid, but this is affecting our community,"" said Casey Caballero, 37, a self-described soccer mom from Lombard who is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Caballero and others accuse immigration agents of discriminatory racial profiling.

Santoyo has U.S. citizenship, but expressed anger and fear that such status may matter little if agents are doing what he suspects: targeting people because of the color of their skin and the language they speak.

""That's racism,"" he said. ""If they come after me, I have papers, but how would they know that?""

Another tamale street vendor not far from Maria's cart said she had heard of her detention and quickly teared up over what happened.

""It could be anyone"" swept up in the raids, she said.

A heavily tattooed man, who said he was driving past when Maria was taken into custody, expressed outrage at the operation, noting she had been serving food to the community for years.

Nae Campbell, a longtime customer, recalled how this ""good woman"" could be found vending year-round, whether in searing heat or Chicago's famously bitter cold.

As for the raids, Campbell called them ""the most ... inhumane gesture I've ever seen.""

""People have taken root here, they have families here now"" and federal agents ""basically just stripped them from their life. That's crazy,"" the 32-year-old hospital worker said.

Doctors at Adventist Health White Memorial hospital in Boyle Heights told LAist that hospital administrators are allowing federal immigration agents to interfere in medical decisions and block doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care.

Administrators at White Memorial have told doctors not to call a detained patient’s family members, even to find out what type of medication they’re on or what conditions they have, doctors told LAist. Hospital leaders also have told doctors to allow immigration agents to remain by a detained patient’s side, even during consultations, inhibiting frank discussions between doctors and their patients and potentially violating patient privacy laws. Doctors say this is not typical protocol for any patients, including those brought in by local police or sheriff’s deputies.

These doctors are equally concerned about their inability to ensure follow-up care for patients released to the ICE processing facility known as B-18 in downtown L.A., where critics say some detainees have been held for days on end with no proper beds or medical care.

Why this matters

White Memorial is part of a network of private, nonprofit hospitals affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with $7 billion in annual revenue. The hospital has been operating for more than 110 years. Its calling is to “help improve the lives of our friends and neighbors in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights,” according to its website.

Five physicians at White Memorial shared the details with LAist about ICE’s presence at the hospital and hospital administrators’ response on the condition that they not be named for fear of retaliation from their employer or from immigration authorities. LAist reviewed internal emails supporting their claims.

“We have an ethical and moral duty to provide excellent medical care and to serve the patient’s interest,” one doctor at White Memorial told LAist. But the doctor said the frequent presence of masked, armed immigration agents in the hospital makes it “very difficult to do that.”

The physicians told LAist they believe the directives from their bosses conflict with the responsibilities all doctors have to their patients and with guidance from the California attorney general.

White Memorial did not respond to a request for an interview from LAist or to our emailed list of questions.

In a statement, a White Memorial spokesperson said the hospital’s staff “are passionately committed to providing the highest standard of medical care to all who come through our doors, regardless of their circumstances” and that the hospital has “protocols in place that are designed to help support the lawful respect of patient rights.”

“We are doing everything in our power to provide safe and compassionate care to our community during this time of unrest,” the statement reads. It also urged people not to “delay the medical care you need.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, did not respond to specific questions from LAist or agree to an interview.

In a statement, she wrote that “ICE is not denying any illegal alien access to proper medical care or medications.” McLaughlin said it was “longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.”

She added that she hoped LAist “would consider NOT writing this garbage” in the wake of the recent shooting outside an ICE detention center in Texas, where one detainee was killed and two injured.

“These types of smears are contributing to our officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them,” she wrote.

An analysis of federal court filings for assault on a federal officer by Colorado Public Radio shows a sharp increase in charges in recent months. The data is far short of the scale suggested by officials.

The bigger picture

A version of the conflicts described at White Memorial is happening across the state and the country as hospitals are forced to contend with fallout from the Trump administration’s mass deportation program. Caught in the middle are doctors and other medical professionals who have a legal duty to provide medical care to patients and ethical concerns about policies they feel affect the traditional standards of care.

The five doctors who spoke with LAist say the conflicts are especially acute at White Memorial, a hospital whose patient and surrounding population is mostly Latino and where several doctors told LAist they’re seeing two to three detained patients per shift.

The situation also raises questions about medical privacy at a time when the federal government is seeking access to sensitive personal information, including medical information from both immigrants and U.S.-born citizens.

Lorenzo Antonio González is a physician who volunteers with Unión del Barrio, which patrols Boyle Heights and other neighborhoods to warn people about ICE raids. He does not work at White Memorial but is aware of the doctors’ concerns. He said he fears ICE’s frequent presence at the hospital will further the chilling effect already causing many Boyle Heights neighbors — where more than 80% of households speak Spanish and a quarter of residents are noncitizens — to forgo medical care and avoid leaving their homes. González called White Memorial’s alleged behavior “an erosion of trust within this pillar of a community.”

How we got here

As immigration raids ramped up in Los Angeles this year, some detainees have needed urgent medical care, either because they were injured while being detained, had a pre-existing illness, or because they became ill while being held at the downtown immigration facility.

Some of these incidents became headlines. In July, a Salvadoran woman was brought to Glendale Memorial Hospital with injuries suffered during a raid. In that case, camera crews descended on the hospital as activists protested the presence of ICE agents in the public lobby.

Meanwhile, White Memorial stayed out of the news. In June, a hospital leader sent an email to colleagues, flagging several incidents involving immigration detainees, including one in which agents remained in the room with a detained patient during the patient’s entire stay at the hospital. The email also noted that agents told doctors they could not call the patient’s family members when the patient couldn’t remember her medications, according to the email and doctors who spoke with LAist.

Doctors at White Memorial and other hospitals told LAist it’s not typical for law enforcement officers to remain in the room during patient care, even with criminal detainees, unless there’s a serious security risk. People in ICE custody are civil, not criminal detainees. Doctors also told LAist it’s common practice to call family members, with a patient’s permission, to inquire about their medical history and current medications.

So the doctors at White Memorial pressed hospital administrators for a clear policy and legal guidance on how to balance ICE agent demands with the hospital’s responsibilities for patient care.

The answer that came back from hospital administrators: defer to the agents.

Hospital leaders told doctors — both verbally, doctors say, and in writing in several emails reviewed by LAist — that immigration agents are allowed to be present at all times, even during discussions about a patient’s sensitive medical information. Doctors also were told they could not call a detained patient’s family member without an agent’s permission. In one email to subordinates, a hospital leader told White Memorial staff that doing so could be a “security risk.”

“That’s like encouraging medical negligence,” one White Memorial doctor told LAist in response to this guidance.

At least one doctor told LAist they are defying hospital leaders’ guidance, deferring instead to their medical duty to the patient and to follow medical privacy laws.

“There’s no way you can get me to not call a patient’s family if they’re hurt and need support,” the doctor said.

Why detainee care is under scrutiny

The concerns about White Memorial come at a time when the care of people in ICE custody is under scrutiny. In August, a man was severely injured while being detained at a car wash in Carson. Agents brought him to Harbor-UCLA medical center for treatment and remained by his bed, to which the man was cuffed, for over a month, according to a recent court ruling. He was never charged with violating any immigration laws, and in October, a federal judge ordered the agents monitoring him to leave the man’s hospital room and remove restrictions on the man’s “ability to make telephone calls to family and friends and to confer confidentially with counsel outside the presence of ICE agents.”Concerns about the medical care of detainees also extends to formal ICE detention centers. In September, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a Westminster man who was being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, became the 17th person to die in ICE custody this year. Last year, 12 people died in ICE custody, according to agency statistics.

Ayala-Uribe, 39, was a former DACA recipient who supporters say had lived in the country since he was 4 years old. He was picked up in an ICE raid in Fountain Valley in August and sent to Adelanto. From there, a medical provider at the detention facility sent Ayala-Uribe to a nearby hospital, where he was evaluated for an abscess, scheduled for surgery and sent back to the facility. He died in custody the following day.

Earlier this year, as immigration raids ramped up, the advocacy group Disability Rights California interviewed 18 people detained at the Adelanto ICE facility. In a subsequent report, the group concluded that “due to the surging numbers of people at Adelanto, conditions appear to have quickly deteriorated.” The report claimed detainees faced “inadequate access to medical treatment, such as life-saving medication and wound care and exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses.”

In response to LAist’s emailed questions about medical care for ICE detainees, McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, said detainees received “medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare … many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she wrote.

McLaughlin did not respond to LAist’s follow-up email asking her to specifically respond to questions about hospital care for detainees outside of detention centers or to questions about the availability of health care at the B-18 processing center, which unlike the Adelanto facility, is not an official detention center.

In a recent, ongoing lawsuit over the L.A. immigration raids, the ACLU and other groups called out alleged unsanitary conditions and a lack of medical care at B-18.

“Individuals with conditions that require consistent medications and treatment are not given any medical attention, even when that information is brought to the attention of the officers on duty,” reads the initial complaint, filed in July.

One doctor at White Memorial told LAist she had called ICE supervisors at the holding center on several occasions to inquire about follow-up care for patients and was told there were no doctors at the facility and there was no way to obtain medication.

What this all means for detainees — and doctors

Other groups have tried to bring attention to the problems associated with immigration agents in hospital settings. The Committee of Interns and Residents, which is is part of the Service Employees International Union, publicly denounced the presence of ICE agents at University of California hospitals in July, saying it creates “an unsafe environment that … directly contradicts our mission to provide safe, effective and quality healthcare to every member of our community.”

Mahima Iyengar, a doctor at L.A. General hospital and secretary-treasurer of the committee, told LAist that having a law enforcement officer present during doctor-patient conversations can compromise care.

“There’s that level of trust that people have with their doctor that they don’t necessarily have when somebody else is listening,” Iyengar told LAist. “Your doctor is then not getting as much information as they need, and that information … very well could be what helps them come up with a diagnosis or what helps them decide what treatment [the patient] is going to be on.”

Iyengar said doctors also are unlikely to feel comfortable asking a patient important non-medical questions when an ICE agent is present.

“A lot of what determines our patients’ health are all of these social determinants, like where they’re living, how they’re getting to the hospital, if they have money, if they have kids that need childcare right now while they’re hospitalized,” she said. “All of those questions are important questions to ask that I would not personally feel comfortable asking if an officer was standing right there.”

McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, did not respond to LAist’s specific questions about whether the agency recognizes detained patients’ privacy rights at hospitals.

What do legal experts say?

Last December, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued “guidance and model policies” for health care facilities in responding to the anticipated increase in immigration enforcement. The guidance is not mandatory for private hospitals, like White Memorial, but all health care facilities were “encouraged to adopt” model policies. Doctors who spoke with LAist said they had read the guidance and felt beholden to it.

The document states that:

State and federal medical privacy laws apply to all patients “regardless of immigration status.”

Health care facility staff “should identify circumstances in which granting immigration enforcement officers access to patients may interfere with physicians’ duty to provide competent medical care, to safeguard patient confidences and privacy, and to otherwise prioritize their obligations to their patients”; and

Facilities “should educate patients about their privacy rights and reassure them that their healthcare information is protected by federal and state laws.”

A spokesperson for Bonta told LAist the attorney general could not comment on whether the office had received complaints about ICE privacy breaches in health care settings because they are confidential.

“We continue to monitor compliance with all state and federal laws,” the spokesperson said in an email.

LAist also asked two health care legal experts about White Memorial’s direction to staff to allow ICE agents to be present during patient exams and bar calls to detained patients’ family members. Both said the guidance could violate medical privacy laws and ethical standards.

“From a patient safety perspective, it certainly raises red flags,” said Paul Schmeltzer, an L.A.-based health care and data privacy lawyer, referring especially to the prohibition on calling a detained patient’s family member. Schmeltzer also said letting an ICE agent remain next to a patient throughout their hospital stay without the patient’s consent is likely illegal. Patient privacy is protected under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. Both generally prohibit doctors and hospitals from disclosing a patient’s medical information without their permission or a search warrant or other court order.

Schmeltzer said he saw “no permissible situation” under these laws for “disclosing” a detained patient’s hospital treatment to an ICE agent.

“The fact that an ICE agent is present in the room while this patient is receiving treatment, that’s a disclosure,” he said.

Deven McGraw, chief regulatory and privacy officer for the company Citizen Health, a patient data platform, agreed.

“ You’re basically saying, ‘Yeah, patient, you don’t have a choice but to disclose your medical information to this law enforcement official,’” she said.

McGraw was in charge of enforcing HIPAA at the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights from 2015 to 2017. She said there are personal and public health reasons for shielding a patient’s medical information from law enforcement. For example, a patient might hide that they have a communicable disease out of fear they’ll be targeted or isolated.

“ We’re supposed to treat people,” McGraw said. “The failure to treat them has potential consequences for their own health, plus the health of others.”

Schmeltzer and McGraw both said the administration at White Memorial might be making a calculated decision when weighing the hospital’s potential liability for violating the privacy rights of immigration detainees versus angering the Trump administration. Only the federal government and state attorneys general can prosecute a hospital for violating HIPAA, Schmeltzer and McGraw noted.

Some of the behavior described by doctors could be prohibited under a new state law, enacted in September as an “urgency” measure. The law requires health care facilities to ban immigration agents from entering non-public areas without a valid warrant and to advise staff on how to respond to agents’ requests for entry.

Even before the law, groups like the Committee of Interns and Residents had begun to train colleagues on the privacy rights of detained patients and how to handle ICE agents. Iyengar said doctors at L.A. General, for example, distribute “Know Your Rights” cards to immigrant patients and hospital employees are instructed to immediately call hospital directors if immigration agents appear.

“ Even just if there is an ICE officer in the hospital, that will put people off from visiting a loved one, or if word gets out, the community finds out, and they don’t want come to that hospital,” she said. “So, it’s just an unsafe environment to have an ICE officer in a hospital, especially [a hospital] that’s serving mostly immigrants.”

Bradford Exchange, Ltd., the Ninth Circuit addressed a plaintiff's attempt to sidestep the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) by structuring a complaint to avoid federal jurisdiction. The decision confirms that defendants can keep such cases in federal court by expressly waiving the ""adequate remedy at law"" objection that might otherwise deprive the court of equitable jurisdiction.

Plaintiff's Strategy: Equitable Remedies Only

The plaintiff filed a putative class action in California state court alleging that the defendant failed to disclose that his product purchase was part of a subscription program. Instead of seeking damages, the plaintiff sought only equitable restitution under California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and False Advertising Law (FAL).

The plaintiff admitted that he could have pursued damages under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), a legal remedy, but elected not to do so. His omission was deliberate. By limiting his complaint to equitable relief, the plaintiff sought to avoid removal by arguing that federal courts lack equitable jurisdiction when a plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law.

Initially, the plaintiff's strategy worked. The district court granted plaintiff's motion to remand on the grounds that the court lacked equitable jurisdiction. Notably, the district court held that the defendant could not waive this ""jurisdictional"" defect.

The Ninth Circuit: Waiver Saves Federal Jurisdiction

The Ninth Circuit reversed. In doing so, the Court reaffirmed that, while federal courts lack ""equitable jurisdiction"" where a plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law, the defendant may waive that defect. Specifically, the Court held ""district courts are empowered to remand a removed case to state court for lack of equitable jurisdiction, but only after the removing defendant is given the opportunity to waive the adequate-remedy-at-law issue to keep the case in federal court."" The Court described the impact of its holding plainly: ""if a plaintiff files a lawsuit in state court seeking only equitable relief and the case is properly removed to federal court, a defendant can defeat remand on equitable jurisdiction grounds by waiving the adequate-remedy-at-law issue.""

Practical Implications

The Ninth Circuit's ruling provides defendants with a new mechanism to defeat anti-removal tactics increasingly seen in California consumer class actions. While plaintiffs may continue to tailor complaints to seek only equitable restitution under the UCL and FAL, defendants can now neutralize that strategy and stay in federal court by waiving the argument that plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law, ensuring that CAFA's jurisdiction reach remains intact.

In UK News:

The number of hate crimes committed in England and Wales has risen since the previous year, according to statistics released by the Home Office. In the year ending March 2025, 115,990 hate crimes were recorded by the police: this marks a 2% increase overall, a 6% increase in race hate crimes, and a 3% increase in religious hate crimes. A 19% increase in religious hate crimes targeting Muslims coincided with the time of the Southport murders and the subsequent race riots across the country.

Kemi Badenoch has confirmed at the Conservative Party Conference that her party would withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights and repeal the Human Rights Act if they form the next Government. This follows a legal review by the Shadow Attorney General, Lord Wolfson, into the impact of remaining in the ECHR. The Wolfson Report concluded that ‘it is hard to overstate the impact the ECHR has had on government decisions’, placing ‘substantial’ limitations on government policies to do with immigration, veterans’ rights, benefits, and reforms to sentencing and protest laws.

In International News:

A ceasefire has been agreed for the war in Gaza. The deal, brokered by the US, provides for a cessation in the conflict between Israel and Hamas which has been ongoing since 2023. The full text of the deal — entitled ‘Implementation steps for President Trump’s proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War’ — has not been publicised, though parts have been published by Israeli media. Trump’s 20-point plan, announced last week, provided for Gaza to be a ‘deradicalised terror-free zone’ which will be ‘redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza’; all hostages will be released, and full aid will be sent to the Gaza Strip.

In the Courts:

An asylum seeker unsuccessfully challenged the housing and financial support given to him by Enfield Council. In R (on the application of BLV) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2025] EWHC 2516 (Admin), the Claimant was a disabled man suffering from deafness, impaired eyesight, and major depressive and anxiety disorders. The Defendant was obliged, under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, to provide ‘adequate’ accommodation and other ‘essentially living needs’ to the Claimant; under the Equality Act 2010 and Human Rights Act 1998, it was also bound to adjust its general approach to providing support under the IAA 1999 to account for the Claimant’s specific disabilities. The Defendant contended that Enfield’s support was inadequate for two reasons:

His accommodation was inadequate, because it was too far away from his support network and did not have a suitable disabled lift;

His internet access was inadequate, because it was not sufficient for him to access mental health and other support services via video-call (his deafness made it impossible to rely on voice call alone).

The court applied the ‘twin-track’ test, namely: 1) whether the Secretary of State met an objective ‘minimum standard’ for ‘ensur[ing] full respect for human dignity and a dignified standard of living, maintain[ing] an adequate standard of health and meet[ing] the subsistence needs of the asylum seeker’; 2) even if the minimum standard has been met, whether the Secretary of State complied with public law standards including rationality. The court found that (stage 1) the Claimant’s accommodation did meet the minimum standard. Furthermore, (stage 2) the Defendant’s treatment of the Claimant did not violate its duties under the EA 2010, HRA 1998, or other public law principles.

An interesting aspect of this case was that internet video calling was deemed capable of being an ‘essential living need’ because of the Claimant’s disabilities. The court ruled that ‘the concept of ‘need’ is…affected by technological progress and consequent changes in societal expectations’, and that ‘internet-based communication… has become essential for interacting with other people and accessing public services.’",https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.png,N,,2025-10-13 10:57:29.726233

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — HOSTAGE AND PRISONER RELEASES

All 20 of the remaining living hostages in Gaza have returned to Israel this morning. They have been brought to the Re’im military facility in southern Israel to undergo initial medical screenings. Oren Liebermann reports for CNN.

Buses carrying Palestinian prisoners released by Israel arrived in Ramallah in the West Bank today. These are the first of nearly 2,000 detained Palestinians expected to be freed in the coming hours. David M. Halbfinger, Aaron Boxerman, Natan Odenheimer, Isabel Kershner, Adam Rasgon, and David E. Sanger report for the New York Times.

Israel has not included Marwan Barghouti, a popular and potentially unifying Palestinian leader, in the list of around 250 prisoners to be released from Israel. Senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk told Al Jazeera that the group that Hamas insists on the release of Barghouti, and other figures, and that it was in discussion with mediators. Lee Keath, Julia Frankel, and Jalal Bwaital report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

The first aid trucks since the ceasefire began arrived in Gaza yesterday. A spokesperson for the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that supplies of cooking gas had entered Gaza for the first time since March. The easing of restrictions has allowed the agency to deliver medical and emergency supplies where they are most needed, OCHA added. BBC News reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not travel to Egypt today for a summit on ending the war in Gaza due to the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, according to a statement from his office. This statement came following an announcement by Egypt’s presidency and a White House official that Netanyahu would be attending. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will be attending the summit. Wafaa Shurafa, Samy Magdy, and Melanie Lidman report for AP News; Eyad Kourdi, Kevin Liptak, Tal Shalev, and Kaitlan Collins report for CNN.

“Only by embracing the opportunities of this moment can we achieve our goal of ensuring that the horrors of recent years will never happen again,” Trump told the Knesset today during his speech, adding that “the long and painful nightmare is finally over.” Two members of the Knesset held up signs that said “Recognize Palestine” as Trump spoke, according to a Knesset spokesperson. As the two were escorted out of the room, other members of the Knesset began chanting “Trump! Trump!” Trump was still speaking to the Knesset at time of writing. CNN reports; NBC News reports.

Egyptian and Qatari mediators told Hamas leader Khalil Al-Hayya that Trump’s deal was his last chance to end the war, following Al-Hayya’s immediate reaction to refuse the deal, according to officials. The sources said that Turkey warned him that Turkey and Qatar would remove all diplomatic and political cover if Hamas did not agree to the deal. Jared Maslin and Summer Said reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Fighting between Hamas Security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City over the weekend killed at least 27 people. The Hamas-run interior ministry said that eight Hamas members were killed in “an armed assault by a militia.” Medical sources said that 19 Dughmush clan members had been killed. Both sides accused the other of triggering the clashes. Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to assert control over areas of Gaza vacated by Israeli troops, according to sources. Rushdi Abualouf reports for BBC News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

U.S. intelligence shared with Kyiv has enabled Ukraine’s strikes on Russian energy assets, including oil refineries far beyond the frontline, according to Ukrainian sources and U.S. officials. Officials said that the United States has been helping Ukraine mount these long-range strikes for months, in an attempt to weaken Russia’s economy and force them to negotiate. Christopher Miller, Amy Mackinnon, and Max Seddon report for the Financial Times.

Trump said that he had spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday on the phone about Ukraine obtaining long-range Tomahawk missiles. Trump told reporters during his flight to Israel that before he agrees, he “might speak to Russia about that, in all fairness,” because it would be a “step up” in the war. Megan Messerly reports for POLITICO.

First Lady Melania Trump said on Friday that she has had an “open channel of communication regarding the welfare of children” with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the last three months. The First Lady claimed that eight Ukrainian children had been reunited with their families in the past 24 hours due to the initiative, adding that both sides had “agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all the people involved.” Sophia Cai and Diana Nerozzi report for POLITICO.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

The Rapid Support Forces paramilitary has killed at least 57 people and wounded 43 others in a series of drone and artillery strikes on the besieged Sudanese city of El-Fasher overnight into Saturday, according to local medics and aid groups. The Sudan Doctors Network medical advocacy group said the attack targeted a shelter for displaced people and was a violation of international law. The RSF denied that civilians were killed as a result of its strikes. Pranav Baskar reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

A spokesperson for Afghanistan’s Taliban government yesterday claimed that Afghan forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in “retaliatory” border operations overnight into Sunday. The Pakistani army disputed the figure, stating that 23 of its armed forces’ members had died and that “200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralized.” The Taliban have accused Pakistan of violating Afghan airspace and bombing a market in eastern Afghanistan last Thursday. Pakistan did not claim responsibility for the alleged assault. Carrie Davies, Stuart Lau, and Ethirajan Anbarasan report for BBC News; Riaz Khan reports for AP News.

French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu late yesterday announced his new government, two days after French President Emmanuel Macron re-appointed Lecornu as France’s Prime Minister on Friday. Lecornu resigned from the premiership last Monday after his coalition partners’ pushback to his first attempt at forming a government last week. Giorgio Leali reports for POLITICO; Noemie Bisserbe and Sam Schechner report for the Wall Street Journal.

Qatar and other Arab states have expanded security cooperation with the Israeli military over the past three years, according to leaked U.S. documents. The documents show that in May 2024, senior Israeli and Arab military officials convened at al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar to discuss the threat posed by Iran. Presentations reviewed by the Washington Post detail the creation of what the U.S. army describes as the “Regional Security Construct”, involving Israel, Qatar, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. David Kenner reports.

5.7 million Haitians are facing a deteriorating food security situation, with 17% of Haiti’s population suffering emergency levels of acute food insecurity, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) hunger watchdog said in a report published on Friday. According to the IPC, the situation is expected to deteriorate in 2026, with 54% of Haiti’s population projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity. UN News reports; Reuters reports.

Israel yesterday carried out airstrikes in southern Lebanon, killing one person and wounding seven others, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. The Israeli military said it struck a place where machinery was stored for rebuilding Hezbollah infrastructure. AP News reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

A federal judge on Friday said the Trump administration had presented a “totally inconsistent” case to keep Kilmar Ábrego García in immigration detention. Since Uganda and Eswatini had refused to take Ábrego, “we’re getting to ‘three strikes and you’re out,’” the judge added. Ghana’s foreign minister posted on social media on Friday that Ghana would also not take Ábrego. The judge said she will decide soon whether Ábrego should remain in custody while his challenge moves forward. Separately, the judge presiding over Ábrego’s criminal case on Friday set a hearing for November 3 to take evidence on whether the charges should be dismissed. Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO; Minho Kim reports for the New York Times.

The Labor Department warned last week that “the near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens” is threatening “the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S. customers,” according to a document filed with the Federal Register. “Unless the Department acts immediately to provide a source of stable and lawful labor, this threat will grow.” Lauren Kaori Gurley reports for the Washington Post.

The Homeland Security Department announced on Friday that it has awarded 10 construction contracts worth $4.5 billion to add 230 miles of wall along the southwest U.S. border. Reuters reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The U.S. military is moving forward with plans to build a facility in Idaho dedicated to training pilots from Qatar, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on Friday. Hegseth’s announcement drew a rebuke from far-right influencers, including Laura Loomer, who accused Qatar of funding Islamic terror organizations. Hegseth later on Friday posted what he called an “important clarification” on social media, stating that “to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base.” Konstantin Toropin reports for AP News; Lillian Rizzo reports for CNBC.

Venezuelan government officials offered the Trump administration a large stake in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth in order to end hostilities during months-long negotiations preceding the U.S. strikes, according to several sources. The sources stated that Venezuela offered to grant preferential contracts to U.S. businesses and terminate contracts with Chinese, Iranian, and Russian firms. The Trump administration last week cut off diplomacy with Venezuela, effectively killing the deal, the sources added. Anatoly Kurmanaev, Julian E. Barnes, and Julie Turkewitz report for the New York Times.

Trump announced on Friday that he would impose 100% tariffs on all Chinese products, adding that they would take effect on November 1. Earlier on Friday, Trump said that he may cancel his planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping due to Beijing’s “sinister and hostile” curbs on the exports of rare-earth materials. A spokesperson for China’s Commerce Ministry said yesterday that “threatening to impose high tariffs at every turn is not the right way to engage with China” and that Beijing will retaliate with “corresponding measures.” Ana Swanson reports for the New York Times; Phelim Kine reports for POLITICO.

The U.N. Security Council met on Friday to discuss the United States’ recent strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean. The 15 members of the council held varying opinions on the strikes, with European and African countries avoiding direct denunciation of the Trump administration’s policies. “The United States will not waver in our actions to protect Americans from narco-terrorists,” John Kelley, a political counsel with the U.S. mission to the U.N. said. Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

“The [Reductions in force] have begun,” Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced on Friday. Vought provided no further details on which federal workers would be fired or how many people had already been laid off. Senior OMB adviser Stephen Billy confirmed that RIF notices would be going out to at least 4,100 employees across several agencies, according to a court filing in a lawsuit filed by unions to stop the layoffs. Irie Sentner and Jennifer Scholtes report for POLITICO; Josephine Walker and Emily Peck report for Axios.

The Trump administration on Saturday rescinded layoffs of hundreds of scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who were terminated during the mass firings within CDC on Friday. A senior official said that the employees were sent “incorrect notifications, which was fixed … with a technical correction,” adding that the terminations were mistaken and have been remedied. A CDC official told POLITICO that “entire offices are being eliminated, including people in leadership roles.” Apoorva Mandavilli and Sheryl Gay Stolberg report for the New York Times; Sophie Gardner and Lauren Brensel report.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche were not given notice that federal prosecutors would indict New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged bank fraud last Thursday, according to sources. The sources said the lack of communication was a result of the government shutdown, the rush to bring the indictment, and divisions between department leaders and the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Viginia Lindsay Halligan. Devlin Barrett and Glenn Thrush report for the New York Times.

Trump yesterday announced that he has appointed his longtime aide Dan Scavino as the White House Presidential Personnel Office. Scavino will remain the White House Deputy Chief of Staff while being “responsible for the selection and appointment of almost all positions in government,” Trump posted on social media. Yan Zhuang reports for the New York Times; Sarah Fortinsky reports for the Hill.

Trump also announced on Saturday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will “use all available funds to get our troops PAID on October 15th,” adding “I will not allow the Democrats to hold our military … HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government shutdown.” About $8 billion is being redirected from accounts that fund military research and testing to pay the army, according to two sources. Ben Johansen and Jennifer Scholtes report for POLITICO.

MIT on Friday rejected the Trump administration’s offer for the school to receive special funding treatment in exchange for signing the administration’s Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. “Fundamentally, the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone,” MIT President Sally Kornbluth said. Vimal Patel reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Over 30 sitting federal judges told the New York Times that the Supreme Court’s brief and opaque emergency orders in cases relating to the Trump administration have caused confusion in the lower courts about how to proceed with those matters. In response to a questionnaire, 47 out of 65 judges also said that the Supreme Court had been mishandling its emergency docket since Trump returned to office. Matthias Schwartz and Zach Montague report.

BOSTON (Reuters) -A federal judge in Boston had some pointed words for Donald Trump as he issued one of the dozens of decisions by courts in four New England states against the Republican president in challenges to the legality of his policies.

""I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,"" U.S. District Judge William Young wrote in ruling that Trump's administration was violating free speech rights by moving to deport non-U.S. citizen pro-Palestinian activists at American colleges.

Young's September 30 ruling was an example of how federal judges in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maine have become key players in the legal wars over Trump's policies since he returned to office in January, as litigants seek a friendly venue to challenge the president.

A Reuters analysis found that at least 72 lawsuits challenging Trump's policies have been filed in federal courts in those four states by plaintiffs, including Democratic state attorneys general, advocacy groups and institutions targeted by the administration. Trial court judges have made at least an initial decision in 51 of those cases, ruling against Trump in 46 of them, the analysis showed.

These have included challenges to Trump's policies to restrict birthright citizenship, gut the U.S. Department of Education, revoke the legal status of thousands of migrants and fast-track deportations of migrants to countries other than their own - so-called ""third countries"" - including politically unstable South Sudan.

While nationwide the U.S. judiciary is closely divided among judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents, in these four states 17 of the 20 active federal trial judges are Democratic appointees. These states fall under the umbrella of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, whose five active judges all were appointed by Democratic presidents while a Trump nominee awaits Senate confirmation.

""I don't think there is another court that, in terms of composition, has those sorts of odds for groups advocating on the liberal side,"" University of Virginia law professor Payvand Ahdout said of the 1st Circuit.

Ahdout said the ideological composition of that appellate court has turned the New England federal trial courts below it into attractive litigation venues offering the ""best shot"" for challengers to Trump's policies.

The 1st Circuit, in handling Justice Department appeals of rulings by these trial judges against the president's policies, has issued 15 decisions, granting the administration's request to set aside judicial orders only three times.

To be sure, the 1st Circuit does not have the final word on cases. It is one of the 12 regional federal appellate courts that cover specific geographic areas of the United States. All of these are one step below the U.S. Supreme Court, whose 6-3 conservative majority has moved American law dramatically rightward under Chief Justice John Roberts.

The administration repeatedly has gone to the Supreme Court with emergency requests to implement policies impeded by lower courts, and the justices have almost always backed Trump. The Supreme Court already this year on seven occasions fully or partially put on hold judicial orders against Trump policies arising out of the 1st Circuit's jurisdiction in cases concerning the Department of Education, legal status of migrants and third-country deportations.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Reuters that the administration's policies have been ""consistently upheld by the Supreme Court as lawful despite an unprecedented number of legal challenges and unlawful lower court rulings from far-left liberal activist judges.""

Trump himself has criticized some of the New England judges. After Boston-based U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy blocked several deportations to South Sudan, Trump called him and other judges ""out of control."" And Trump labeled Boston-based U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, who ruled against the administration in a case involving Harvard University, a ""total disaster.""

""Regardless of where Democrats try to file their challenges, our winning will continue,"" Jackson said.

FORUM SHOPPING

The idea of ""forum shopping,"" seeking a friendly legal venue, is nothing new, as litigants across the political spectrum long have steered cases to ideologically sympathetic judges. For instance, conservatives challenging the agenda of Trump's Democratic predecessor Joe Biden flocked to Texas courthouses stocked with Republican-appointed judges to challenge policies concerning LGBT rights, immigration, student debt relief and gun control.

The regional federal appellate court that has jurisdiction over the most challenges this year to Trump's policies is the one that covers Washington, D.C., as might be expected considering it is the seat of the U.S. government. But the courts under the 1st Circuit have attracted the second-most such lawsuits, according to data from Just Security, an online publication based at New York University School of Law.

During Trump's first term in office from 2017 to 2021, the federal courts of Northern California were a favored venue for legal challenges. Trump called the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which handles appeals from there, a ""disgrace"" after it ruled against him in cases including his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries, a policy later allowed by the Supreme Court.

Yet by the end of his first term, Trump had appointed 10 judges to the 9th Circuit, reducing the likelihood that Democratic appointees would dominate its judicial panels that decide appeals.

'KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING'

While the Supreme Court has backed the administration in some important cases this year arising from the 1st Circuit, the Justice Department has not yet asked the justices to review some other adverse rulings from judges in the region.

That means, for example, that decisions by judges in Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, remain in place blocking the administration's efforts to make changes in federal elections including limits on counting mail-in ballots, cap federal research funding to universities and disfavor arts organizations seeking grant funding because they support ""gender ideology.""

Among the rulings the administration has not asked the Supreme Court to stay was one by Providence-based U.S. District Judge John McConnell, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, blocking a sweeping federal funding freeze that Trump's White House budget office issued in January.

Until this year, the Rhode Island court rarely heard such cases. Yet when deciding where to file the funding freeze case, Democratic Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said the states pursuing the challenge considered New York City before settling on Providence, whose three active judges are, in his words, ""known quantities.""

""You kind of know what you're getting,"" Neronha told Reuters. ""You have some confidence that you'll get a decision that will be well-reasoned and based on the law.""

Democratic state attorneys general have filed 43 lawsuits in which multiple states have challenged Trump policies this year. Of those, 26 have been brought in Massachusetts (13), Rhode Island (12) and the 1st Circuit appellate court directly (one).

Judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the past two months have blocked the administration's cancellation of Harvard's federal funding, its immigration-related conditions on disaster aid and housing grants, and its bid to exclude children of certain migrants from the federally funded Head Start preschool program.

Burroughs, an Obama appointee, wrote in the Harvard ruling that courts must ""step up"" to safeguard free speech rights ""even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost.""

'WE THE PEOPLE'

Young was appointed to the bench in 1985 by Republican former President Ronald Reagan.

The judge's docket remains filled with Trump-related cases. The Supreme Court put a hold on one of his rulings reinstating diversity-related National Institutes of Health research grants. Meanwhile, Young is weighing challenges on issues including the administration's halting of wind energy projects, its gutting of climate regulations and its weakening of government vaccine policies.

In his ruling on targeting campus activists for deportation, Young found that Trump's policy violated the U.S. Constitution's protection against government abridgment of free speech. The judge also included in his written decision part of a postcard he received from an anonymous sender who asked him: ""Trump has pardons and tanks ... What do you have?""

""Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, We the People of the United States - you and me - have our magnificent Constitution,"" Young wrote, quoting the document's preamble. ""Here's how that works out in a specific case.""",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/fea3f0a/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F5c%2F8d9b419aa1b890da7d8a42787dc0c3%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2025%3Anewsml_LYNXNPEL9C0EK%3A12025-10-13T105335Z_1_LYNXNPEL9C0EK_RTROPTP_3_USA-TRUMP-NEWENGLAND-COURT.JPG,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:44.813442

Today's statement by the UK's legal professional bodies warns that politically motivated attacks on lawyers and judges are irresponsible and dangerous, and have led to violence and death threats.
Mark Evans, President of the Law Society of England and Wales, added: ""Nobody should be put at risk for doing their job, least of all when that job is to uphold the law.
Attacks on the legal profession undermine the rule of law and can have real-life consequences.
Politicians have a responsibility to respect the role of judges in upholding the rule of law and interpreting legislation that has been agreed by parliament.","The UK's legal professional bodies representing over 250,000 lawyers have today issued a strongly worded statement expressing grave concern over increasing hostility towards lawyers and judges, warning that it threatens not only individual safety but the very principles of justice and democracy.

Image credit: UK GovernmentThe statement was issued by the Bar Council of England and Wales, the Law Society of England and Wales, the Law Society of Scotland, the Faculty of Advocates, the Bar of Northern Ireland and the Law Society of Northern Ireland.

The statement comes after the Shadow Secretary of State for Justice, Robert Jenrick, recently denounced what he called 'activist' immigration judges in his speech to the Conservative Party conference and on social media.

In his speech to the Conservative conference last week, Jenrick stated: ""I've uncovered dozens of judges with ties to open-borders charities, who take to social media to broadcast their open-border views, who've spent their careers fighting to keep illegal migrants in this country."" He continued by saying that judges who ""blur the line between adjudication and activism can have no place in our justice system.""

Jenrick said on X last week that ""[m]ore than 30 sitting immigration judges have former links to the very activist groups that have ground our court system to a halt,"" noting they had supported and volunteered for organisations and charities such as Bail for Immigration Detainees, which works to end immigration detention.

The Shadow Justice Minister said the examples he had found were not isolated examples but ""point to a judiciary where activism and adjudication seem to go together."" More generally, he also said in his conference speech that British people ""face the prospect of two-tier justice under two-tier Keir.""

Today's statement by the UK's legal professional bodies warns that politically motivated attacks on lawyers and judges are irresponsible and dangerous, and have led to violence and death threats.

Mark Evans, President of the Law Society of England and Wales, added: ""Nobody should be put at risk for doing their job, least of all when that job is to uphold the law. Attacks on the legal profession undermine the rule of law and can have real-life consequences. In recent years, negative language used about legal professionals has seen waves of online hate and death threats causing many lawyers to seek police protection.""

The bodies' full statement follows below:

The Bar Council of England and Wales, the Law Society of England and Wales, the Law Society of Scotland, the Faculty of Advocates, the Bar of Northern Ireland and the Law Society of Northern Ireland representing 250,000 lawyers have come together to express grave concern about the climate of increasing hostility towards lawyers and judges.

Legal professionals have been vilified and targeted simply for doing their job. The judiciary is independent from parliament and politicians, and lawyers represent their clients without fear or favour. Politicians have a responsibility to respect the role of judges in upholding the rule of law and interpreting legislation that has been agreed by parliament. Unlike politicians, members of the judiciary are expected to be strictly impartial when considering how the law should be applied. Lawyers must abide by their professional ethics code and ensure that people facing life changing legal problems get a fair hearing.

Politically motivated attacks on the legal profession are irresponsible and dangerous. They weaken public trust and confidence in the rule of law and erode the very foundations of justice that underpin fairness and democracy.

Barristers, solicitors and judges have been subjected to violence, death threats and rape threats. Some have faced threats to their family members. We have repeatedly seen law firms and offices be set upon by protestors. We are deeply disturbed by this rising tide of intimidation targeting those who serve our justice system and uphold democratic principles.

Lawyers should never suffer adverse consequences because they are identified with their clients or their clients' causes. Lawyers are not their clients. Those who are unpopular or despised are still entitled to access the courts just as much as anyone else. Nobody is above the law, including politicians. Nobody is beneath the law's protections.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a614d02ed915d7dfb585275/MoJ_image.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 07:56:33.365486

The D.C. Circuit recently addressed that question in Chen v. FBI, Dkt. No. 24-5050 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 30, 2025), accessible here, reaffirming, and modestly extending, D.C. Circuit caselaw. This post will discuss the D.C. Circuit’s opinion, and then consider some broader issues related to the interaction of the Privacy Act and the journalist’s privilege ─ most particularly potential ways to relieve some of the burdens Privacy Act plaintiffs face.

I. The Constitutionally Mandated Journalists Privilege

In Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665 (1972), the U.S. Supreme Court nominally held that the First Amendment does not confer upon journalists a privilege to refuse to testify before grand juries. The Court split 5-4, with a critical concurring opinion by Justice Powell. He explained that in his view Justice White’s opinion for the Court did not preclude recognition of a qualified First Amendment based journalists’ privileged, asserting:

[As the opinion for the Court suggests] no harassment of newsmen will be tolerated. If a newsman . . . is called upon to give information bearing only a remote and tenuous relationship to the subject of the investigation, or if he has some other reason to believe that his testimony implicates confidential source relationships without a legitimate need of law enforcement, he will have access to the court on a motion to quash . . . The asserted claim to privilege should be judged on its facts by the striking of a proper balance between freedom of the press and the obligation of all citizens to give relevant testimony with respect to criminal conduct. . . In short, the courts will be available to newsmen under circumstances where legitimate First Amendment interests require protection.

Id. at 909-710 (Powell, J. concurring)(emphasis added). Journalists’ apparent loss in Branzburg v. Hayes turned out to be something of a victory, with most Court of Appeals recognizing a qualified First-Amendment-based journalist privilege.[1] However, the federal courts of appeal have held that the privilege can be overcome by “showing that the [journalist’s] information is highly material and relevant, necessary or critical to the maintenance of the claim, and not obtainable from other available sources.” E.g., McGraw–Hill, Inc. v. Arizona (In re Petroleum Prods. Antitrust Litig.), 680 F.2d 5 (2d Cir.1982); Zerilli v. Smith, 656 F.2d 705 (D.C.Cir.1981). The D.C. Circuit has distilled this test into two elements, believing that the inquiry into the necessity of the information subsumes the question of whether the information is highly material and relevant.

The D.C. Circuit applied its centrality/exhaustion test in Lee v. Department of Justice, 413 F.3d 53 (2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1187 (2006), which like Zerilli, involved a Privacy Act plaintiff.[2] In Lee, the full D.C. Circuit denied rehearing en banc, but Judges Rogers, Tatel, and Garland each authored dissentals urging full court reconsideration of the panel’s decision.[3] Both Garland and Tatel noted that even though the centrality/exhaustion test sufficiently protected journalists’ First Amendment interests with respect to most types of civil litigation in which a journalist might possess relevant information derived from a confidential source, it was inadequate in Privacy Act cases. In most Privacy Act cases, they explained, the identity of a leaker is itself “the heart of the matter.” Lee v. Department of Justice, 428 F.3d 299,301-302 (2005)(Tatel, J. dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Only “an unexpected confession by the leaker” would avoid the prospect of breaching the First-Amendment-based journalists’ privilege in relation to a plaintiff’s pursuit of a Privacy Act claim. Id. (Garland, J. dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).

II. Chen v. FBI

A. The Controversy and Proceedings Below

Born in China, plaintiff Yanping Chen came to the United States in 1987 to study at George Washington University. She became a lawful permanent resident in 1993 and a citizen in 2001. In 1998, Chen founded the University of Management and Technology (“UMT”) in Arlington, Virginia. The School participated in the Department of Defense’s (“DoD”) Tuition Assistance Program” which subsidized servicemembers’ tuition at the School.

In 2010, the FBI began investigating the veracity of Chen’s statements on various immigration forms, suspecting that Chen had concealed her prior work for the Chinese military. In 2016, after a lengthy investigation and apparently some dispute between the FBI and Government prosecutors over whether prosecution was warranted, prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia declined to file charges against Chen.

Unfortunately, that did not end Chen’s troubles. In 2017, Fox News revealed the allegations regarding Chen’s connections with the Chinese military.[4] Catherine Herridge was one of Fox News’ reporters on the story. Fox News published an FBI form memorializing an agent’s interview with Chen’s daughter, personal photographs seized from Chen’s home during an FBI search, as well as information from Chen’s immigration and naturalization papers. Fox News cited anonymous sources describing a conflict between the FBI and prosecutors regarding whether to file charges against Chen. In addition, Fox News noted an anonymous FBI agent’s concern about UMT’s continued participation in DoD’s Tuition Assistance Program. Unsurprisingly, in 2018 DoD terminated UMT’s participation in that program. DoD’s action and the negative publicity from the Fox News reporting precipitated a sharp decline in UMT’s enrollment and reputation.

Chen brought a suit under the Privacy Act, The Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1896 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. § 552a), to recover damages for the disclosure of private information in various files maintained on her by the Government.[5] The Privacy Act prohibits agencies from publicly disclosing certain records regarding individuals without prior consent. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(a)(4), (b). An individual harmed by a Privacy Act violation may bring a civil suit against the offending agency, id. § 552a(g)(1), (5), to recover “actual damages,” subject to a statutory floor of $1,000, for any “intentional or willful” disclosures. Id. § 552a(g)(4)(A). Prevailing plaintiffs may also obtain “the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees.” Id. § 552a(g)(4)(B).[6]

Chen engaged in extensive discovery to identify Fox News’ source for the information leaked from her government files. In addition to submitting various document requests, interrogatories, and requests for admission, Chen’s attorney took eighteen depositions of current and former government employees. Chen’s lawyers also issued over a dozen third-party subpoenas, and obtained declarations from 22 government officials and employees connected to the FBI investigation. Through those efforts, Chen developed a theory that the leaked material came from an internal FBI PowerPoint presentation created by the lead FBI agent on Chen’s case. She surmised that one of the presentation’s recipients had leaked its contents to Herridge. But her theory was not sufficient (at least in her view), so ultimately her indominable efforts at discovery from the Government had proven unsuccessful. Chen v. FBI, 687 F.Supp.3d 115, 118 (D.D.C. 2023).

Consequently, Chen sought to subpoena and depose Fox News and Catherine Herridge.[7] Both moved to quash the subpoenas, but the trial judge found that Chen had met the D.C. Circuit’s centrality/exhaustion test for defeating an assertion of the First-Amendment journalist’s privilege. Id. at 124-28; see, Chen v. FBI, supra, slip op. at 5. Chen was allowed to depose Herridge, possibly to be followed by a deposition of Fox News should the Herridge deposition prove insufficient. Herridge refused to identify her confidential source, even declining to provide information regarding when and how she received the leaked items. The Judge held Herridge in civil contempt.

B. D.C. Circuit Opinion

Herridge raised several arguments on her appeal of the judgment of contempt. First, she argued that Chen had failed to satisfy the “centrality” requirement due to the frivolous nature of her claim. Second, she asserted, the centrality/exhaustion test was inconsistent with the case-by-case balancing approach the D.C. Circuit mandated with regard to breaching the journalist’s privilege. Third, she argued that Chen suit was too unimportant to warrant breaching the journalists’ privilege. Fourth, she urged the Court to use its authority under the Federal Rules of Evidence, Fed R. Evid. 501, to recognize a journalist privilege that extended beyond the scope of the First-Amendment-based journalist privilege.

As to the first, the Court noted that the “centrality” inquiry can encompasses an assessment of the underlying Privacy Act claims’ frivolousness.[8] But it quickly dismissed Herridge’s argument that Chen’s claim was frivolous. Herridge claimed that Chen’s claim was “frivolous” even though she did not deny that there had been an actionable Privacy Act breach, given that there almost certainly was one. Instead Herridge pronounced the claim frivolous because (1) “most” of Chen’s alleged damages were caused by DoD’s independent decision to cut off funds to UMT rather than the disclosure to the public of information from Chen’s file, and (2) “almost all” of Herridge’s reporting was based upon sources other than government files protected by the Privacy Act.

The panel noted that some of Chen’s alleged damages had been sustained before DoD’s funding cut-off.[9] Moreover, even if “almost all” of Herridge’s reporting came from non-government sources, Chen had plausibly alleged that at least some derived from Privacy Act violations—such as the disclosure of photographs seized from Chen’s home during the FBI search. The panel explained that even if Herridge were correct in her assertion that Chen would at best establish she was entitled to only a small amount of damages, the potentially small size of any damages award would not make the case “frivolous.”

With respect to Herridge’s more general argument that the the case was simply not that important in relation to “the social importance of the news story,” the panel refused to engage in the sort of free-form balancing in the name of determining the “centrality” of the information a reporter refuses to disclose. In the panel’s view, that approach was foreclosed by Lee.

Nor was the straightforward application of the centrality/exhaustion test inconsistent with D.C. Circuit precedent. In Zerilli, upholding the subpoena to a journalist in a Privacy Act case, the Court had indeed asserted that “courts should look to the facts of each case, weighing the public interest in protecting the reporter’s sources against the private interest in compelling disclosure.”[10] However, that general observation, used by the Zerilli Court to determine whether any First-Amendment-based journalist privilege existed, did not require case-by-case balancing. Rather, the Zerilli Court had gone on to established “more precise guidelines … to determine how the balance should be struck” ─ setting out the exhaustion/centrality test.[11] In short, the Zerilli Court had engaged in “definitional” or “categorical” balancing, rather than prescribing ad hoc case-by-case balancing.[12]

The Court then refused to recognize a reporter’s privilege under Rule 501. Having concluded that” the First Amendment itself did not entitle Herridge to disobey discovery obligations imposed on every other citizen in the circumstances of this case,” the panel saw “little reason to create that entitlement as a matter of judge-made common law.” In doing so, the panel noted that state shield laws “var[y] widely in [their] scope . . ., both in the abstract and on the question whether case by-case interest balancing is appropriate.” Though the Court did not mention it, the media has been lobbying for a federal reporter’s shield law for years, without success.[13]

III. Observations

The panel’s decision seems clearly correct and faithful to Zerilli and Lee. However, the Chen litigation does prompt some more general observations.

A. The Burden of Exhausting Potential Other Sources of Information

One of the most striking aspects of Chen litigation saga is the costly and time-consuming process involved in exhausting potential alternative sources of information. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit has said that as many as 60 depositions could be required to satisfy the exhaustion prong of the centrality/exhaustion test.[14] Few plaintiffs are likely to have the fortitude, the financial resources, and prospect of a sufficiently sizable recovery to bear such expenses over years. Granted, attorney’s fees and litigation costs are available to successful plaintiffs, but such a recovery comes well after the initial expenditure of resources for litigation expenses. Perhaps the option of litigation financing and the potential for representation on a contingency fee basis make engaging in such costly litigation manageable. But even such options may be impractical for plaintiffs with small value cases.

Perhaps the system works acceptably, despite the financial disincentive to sue over a Privacy Act breach that caused only a modest tangible financial harm.[15] But perhaps the process might be fairer and less onerous if either the burden of production were shifted to the Government to prove that the information did not come from a leak, or the plaintiff were able to rely on a presumption that damaging information was improperly disclosed from government files. In some situations, the plaintiff may well be able to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, or even by clear and convincing evidence, that the information disclosed to the public had its origin in an improper release of information from plaintiff’s file compiled by a government agency. Indeed, that seems to be true in Chen’s case (even before the extensive discovery in which she engaged).

In those situations, if no contrary evidence has been offered, the inference that the agency disclosed the information, and that it did so intentionally or willfully, might be a sound evidentiary inference. The information was probably leaked from the plaintiff’s personal files, and given the unacknowledged nature of the leak and the leaked material’s use in such a damaging manner, the release was probably intentional or willful. Thus, at a minimum, the courts should allow a plaintiff to rely on such a presumption in making out a prima facie case, without requiring the identification of the specific leaker. Such a presumption would at least allow plaintiff to surmount the hurdles of summary judgment and directed verdict motions. And given the increased probability that plaintiff will prevail courtesy of such a presumption, defendant agencies may be encouraged to investigate for themselves if, and by what means, their records on the plaintiff were breached. As discussed below, any government efforts on this score will likely prove more fruitful and perhaps less expensive than plaintiffs’ efforts to discover the breach.

But courts could go further and shift the burden of production to the defendant agency once the plaintiff has established its prima facie case with the assistance of the above-referenced presumption. This would mean that the agency would be liable unless it proffered an affirmative case that the information came from some source other than its files on the plaintiff, or that the information was released due to an innocent mistake. Such a shifting of the burden of production might provide important incentives for government agencies in two ways.

First, forcing the Government to bear the burden of production will encourage agencies to engage in substantial efforts to identify the employee or employees responsible for the Privacy Act breach. The agency whose file has been breached will ordinarily be in a better position than a private citizen to ferret out the leaker. The agency is more familiar with its own records systems and any restrictions on access to those systems. Moreover, as the employer of those in charge of the records and those with access to it, the agency has means to encourage cooperation and truthful disclosures that private individuals lack. It has more flexibility in questioning its employees; it can question individuals on several occasions as its investigation develops rather than being limited to one deposition. And it also has the power to threaten, or to impose, employment consequences upon employees who may have unlawfully disclosed Privacy-Act-protected data, who failed to take adequate steps to protect its security, or who simply fail to cooperate with investigators.

Second, the greater prospect of Privacy Act liability might well encourage agencies to create or modify mechanisms for monitoring access to personal filed held by the Government. The government could perhaps more easily show that it has exhausted other means that would allow it to carry its burden that it was not the source of the leak.

In any event, with such a shift in the burden of production, Privacy Act plaintiffs would not have to be put through significant financial burdens before the case is concluded. Such financial burdens may well work as a disincentive to bringing suits to vindicate their Privacy Act rights. The journalist’s privilege would remain as robust as it is currently; however, the Government, rather than the the person whose file was likely breached, would have the burden of exhausting potential sources of information before subpoenaing journalists. (Indeed, perhaps the journalist’s privilege may more likely be upheld. Courts considering subpoenas addressed to journalists may view an agency seeking to avoid liability to a Privacy Act plaintiff for a damaging news story less sympathetically than a Privacy Act plaintiff seeking to recover financial losses from what appears to be a Privacy Act breach.)

It is possible, of course, that diligent and well-financed plaintiffs will nevertheless wish to conduct their own discovery, either in an attempt to affirmatively prove their case or due to fears that the Government will be lax in seeking to determine the source of the leak. In such circumstances, it is not clear how much the shift in the burden of production will change the current state of affairs. Moreover, under a regime in which the Government bears a burden, both plaintiffs and the agency defendants might compete in seeking the same information, ultimately resulting in both seeking to subpoena reporters and news organizations. It is not clear, however, that such a situation is problematic.

The approach of shifting the burden of production after some initial showing by the plaintiff is not unprecedented. Such a regime is applicable in the employment discrimination context. See, Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254–55, 258 (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).

The tort doctrine of res ipsa loquitur has a similar rationale (granted the doctrine focuses on negligent, rather than intentional or willful, conduct). If a plaintiff proves that an injury-causing event would not ordinarily occur in the absence of negligence and that the defendant has some level of control over the injury-causing “instrumentality,” plaintiff is entitled to an inference that the defendant beached its duty of care, i.e., was negligent.[16]

In some states, res ipsa loquitur serves to shift burden of production to defendants to prove that the injury-producing event was not caused by their negligence.[17] Indeed, one admittedly controversial case resembles the government leak scenario, namely Ybarra v. Spangard, 25 Cal.2d 486, 154 P.2d 687 (1944); see, RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL & EMOTIONAL HARM §17, comm. f. There plaintiff suffered a neck injury that was very likely caused by negligence, but a number of medical personnel were potentially responsible, and plaintiff could not determine which one or more members of that group had acted negligently. The California Supreme Court shifted the burden of production to the defendants to explain how plaintiff’s neck injury occurred.

B. What if Congress Finally Enacts a Robust Reporter’s Shield Law?

As mentioned earlier, there have been efforts to enact a robust federal shield law for a number of years, the most recent version of proposed shield legislation being the Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act (“the PRESS Act”).[18] Indeed, that PRESS Act passed the House on January 18, 2024. H.R. 4250, 118th Cong. 2d. Sess. (engrossed). (The Senate failed to act on the measure.)[19] The PRESS Act seems to be focused on Government efforts to determine the source of leaks that Executive Branch officials consider harmful to their endeavors;[20] there appears to be little focus on subpoenas to journalists and news organizations in the context of Privacy Act suits. See, H.R. Rep. 118–299 118th Cong., 1st Sess.,[21] For example the House Report on H.R.4250, which passed the House of Representatives on voice vote, did not even reference the Privacy Act litigation.

The PRESS Act provides a virtually absolute reporters’ privilege except in a few circumstances. The Act precludes journalists from being required to disclose “any information identifying a source who provided information as part of engaging in journalism,” or “any records, contents of a communication, documents, or information that a covered journalist obtained or created as part of engaging in journalism.” H.R.4250, §2(8). The privilege may be defeated upon a finding either that “disclosure of the protected information is necessary to prevent, or to identify any perpetrator of, an act of terrorism,” or that “disclosure of the protected information is necessary to prevent a threat of imminent violence, significant bodily harm, or death.” Id., §3. The prohibition does not apply to defamation litigation. Id., §6(1).[22] It also does not apply to any investigation of a journalist or news organization “suspected of committing a crime,” or to any investigation in which a journalist or news organization “is a witness to a crime unrelated to journalism,” or “suspected of being an agent for a foreign power.” Id., §6(2)(A)-(C). In addition, it does not apply to certain investigations involving terrorists. Id., §6(2)(D)-(F). None of these qualifications or limitations on the scope of the privilege would be applicable in the typical Privacy Act litigation.

If a similarly robust shield law is ultimately enacted, the locus of the burden of production in Privacy Act cases will become even more important. Journalist could assert an absolute privilege to refuse to identify a confidential source in Privacy Act litigation, whether the subpoena comes from the private plaintiff or the Government. Thus, the definitive information regarding the identity of any person that breached the Privacy Act and leaked plaintiffs records would be unavailable to both parties. In such a situation, the locus of the burden of production may prove dispositive. The party that must bear the burden of production, whether the Privacy Act plaintiff or the Government, will have difficulty shouldering it. And if some sort of res ipsa loquitor like inference is not available to Privacy Act plaintiffs to survive a motion for summary judgment or a directed verdict, they will not be able to press their cases.

In such circumstances, the Government should have to bear the cost of the unavailability of the evidence. It is likely the files maintained by the Government, under a legal obligation to keep them private, have been released for dissemination to the public in a willful or intentional manner. And it will be the Government, by virtue of a federal statute like the PRESS Act, that would have made the dispositive testimony unavailable, albeit for laudable and substantial reasons. Ultimately, without the prospect of securing journalists’ testimony, Privacy Act litigation will become even more needlessly expensive than it is already and private citizens’ ability to vindicate their Privacy Act rights will be frustrated all the more.

One final analogy suggests that Congress should perhaps include some form of exception for Privacy Act cases, similar to the exception for defamation cases, in any federal shield law.[23] Of course, Privacy Act litigation differs from defamation litigation, because in the latter case the journalist or media entity is a party to the suit, and has allegedly engaged in a wrongful act. The journalist or media entity is neither a defendant nor an alleged wrongdoer in a Privacy Act case. Though, ironically, journalists’ concerns regarding potential defamation liability, or simply getting the story right, may lead them to demand from leakers document contained in government files to which they have access that back up their assertions.[24]

But in another important respect, Privacy Act litigation mimics defamation litigation brought by public officials and public figures, in that both require proof that the defendant acted intentionally, willfully, or with a similar level of culpability. In the defamation context plaintiff must show “actual malice,” namely that the information was published with knowledge of its falsity or with recklessness disregard as to its truth or falsity. New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-280 (1964). In the Privacy Act context, the plaintiff has the burden of showing that the agency acted intentionally or willfully. See, Mulhern v. Gates, 525 F. Supp. 2d 174, 183 (D.D.C. 2007).[25]

In the defamation context, courts have explained that the need to show “actual malice,” provides a particularly compelling justification for requiring disclosure of a journalist’s confidential sources.[26] In Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153 (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court refused to recognize a privilege protecting journalists from having to testify or provide documentary evidence regarding the media entity’s editorial process for the story at issue. In addition to noting in general that “[e]videntiary privileges in litigation are not favored,” id. at 174, Justice White observed that it would be inappropriate to create an impenetrable barrier to the necessary proof required to meet the New York Times standard demanded of a public figure. Id. at 170. Similarly, in Zerilli v. Smith, the D.C. Circuit observed: “Proof of actual malice will frequently depend on knowing the identity of the newspaper’s informant, . . . Protecting the identity of the source would effectively prevent recovery in many [public figure] libel cases.” 656 F.2d at 714.

Despite the closeness of the analogy, some government officials might use a Privacy Act suit as a justification for identifying the source of a leak that exposes mistakes, abuse, corruption or other matters that will tarnish the agency. Thus, the exception to the shield law for Privacy Act claims will presumably need to be tailored to diminish the likelihood that such a gambit would succeed.

IV. CONCLUSION

In all likelihood, the trends in the application of the First-Amendment-based journalist privilege in the Privacy Act context will likely continue on along the lines that it has so far. However, one of the two courses suggested above might reduce some of the burdens on plaintiffs in vindicating the rights conferred upon them by the Privacy Act. Plaintiffs would be benefitted by permitting an inference allowing them to establish a prima facie case without identifying the specific government official responsible for the unlawful disclosure of their information. They would benefit even more from shifting the burden of production to the Government, upon some preliminary showing that material disseminated to the public by journalists came from public files.

During Lee’s last three years at DOE, the Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) investigated him for spying on behalf of the People’s Republic of China. Though the government indicted Lee on 59 counts of mishandling of classified computer files, Lee ultimately pled guilty to just one count. Lee had been held under demanding conditions of pre-trial detention before the plea agreement, for which both the federal Judge overseeing the case and President Clinton expressed remorse.

Lee subsequently brought a Privacy Act suit, alleging that DOE and FBI officials leaked information from his personnel file to tarnish his image. The leaked information included his wife’s employment history, their joint financial transactions, details of their trips to Hong Kong and China, and specifics of the investigation, including Lee’s interrogation, and purported results of polygraph tests.

[5] The defendant agencies included the FBI, DoD, and two other federal agencies. Chen v. FBI, 687 F.Supp.3d 115, 118 (D.D.C. 2023).

[6] Ironically, sometimes Privacy Act breaches of the may occur result from faulty agency production of documents in response to Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests. See, e.g., Human Rights Defense Center v. U.S. Park Police, 126 F.4th 708 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 24, 2025)(refusing to allow agency to claw back portions of records it erroneously provided in response to a FOIA request that had implications for employees’ privacy).

Some of these errors in responses to FOIA request may be less than innocent. The Postal Service released Democratic congressional candidate Abagail Spanburger’s Postal Inspection Service file in 2018 (including, for example, her social security number), in response to a FOIA request by her Republican opponent. Laura Vozzella, Ex-CIA Officer’s Full Personnel File Released in ‘Human Error,’ Postal Service Admits, WASH. POST (Aug. 30, 2018); Michael Tackett, C.I.A. Officer-Turned-Candidate Says PAC Obtained Her Security Application, N.Y. TIMES (Aug. 28, 2018); Michael Tackett, Postal Service Improperly Divulged Spanberger’s Sensitive National Security File, and Asks for It Back, N.Y. TIMES (Aug. 30, 2018). Similarly, the military records of Mickie Sherrill, Democratic candidate for Governor of New Jersey, were released (with her social security number unredacted) pursuant to a FOIA requester affiliated with opposing candidate Jack Cittarelli’s campaign. Tracey Tully, Release of Democrat’s Naval Record Scrambles a Tight Governor’s Race, N.Y.

Both “errors” seem suspicious.

[7] Up to that point, the Court had already been called upon the issue opinions on several issues related to the litigation: Chen v. FBI, 435 F. Supp. 3d 189 (D.D.C. 2020); Chen v. FBI, Dkt. No. 20-mc-107 (CRC), 2020 WL 7668880 (D.D.C. Dec. 24, 2020); Chen v. FBI, Dkt. No. 20-mc-107 (CRC), 2021 WL 6125379 (D.D.C. Nov. 23, 2021); Chen v. FBI, Dkt. No. 22-mc-0074 (CRC), 2022 WL 17851618 (D.D.C. Oct. 18, 2022). Chen v. FBI, supra, 687 F.Supp.3d at 117-118.

[8] Chen v. FBI, supra, slip op. at 8 (“if a claim would fail regardless of what the requested discovery might reveal, there is no good reason for deeming the discovery to be centrally important, much less for abrogating the privilege”).

[9] Though it did not so note, presumably even some of the damage to Chen’s business after DoD’s removal of the school from the program resulted from the damaging publicity rather than the DoD’s decision to cut off funding. Indeed, DoD’s own decision might have been influenced by the public nature of the leaks regarding Chen. And, of course, the Privacy Act can be breached by unauthorized sharing of information with another federal agency.

[10] This is true to Justice Powell’s concurrence in Branzburg v. Hayes.

RESEARCH SERVICE (Jan. 19, 2011), accessible here; Reporters Committee on the Freedom of the Press, A Short History Of Attempts To Pass A Federal Shield Law (up to 2004).

[14] Zerilli v. Smith, supra, 656 F.2d at 714 & n.50.

[15] The Privacy Act is particularly critical given the extensive private information held in files compiled on individuals by the federal government and the media’s Free Speech and Free Pless Clause protections for publishing private information improperly provided to it by a government official, see, Florida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524, 534-36 (1989)(police report on plaintiff’s rape mistakenly provided to journalists).

[16] RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: LIABILITY FOR PHYSICAL & EMOTIONAL HARM §17 (“The factfinder may infer that the defendant has been negligent when the accident causing the plaintiff’s harm is a type of accident that ordinarily happens as a result of the negligence of a class of actors of which the defendant is the relevant member.”). Traditionally, res ipsa loquitur required plaintiff to show that the defendant possessed exclusive control over the injury-causing instrumentality. The courts have wholly or partially abandoned the “exclusive control” requirement. Id. at comm b.

In part, the rationale for res ipsa loquitur is the soundness of the inference from negligence; in part it can also be attributed to the fact that the defendant will usually have better access to the critical information in such circumstances. Id. at comm i.

[17] Id. at comm. j (“[i]n at least a few jurisdictions, res ipsa loquitur creates a rebuttable presumption, thereby requiring the defendant to come forward with some exculpatory evidence or suffer a judgment as a matter of law”); see generally, DAN B. DOBBS, THE LAW OF TORTS §156 (2000) (discussing various procedural effects of establishing res ipsa loqutor).

[18] Protect Reporters from Exploitative State Spying Act (“the PRESS Act”), S. 2074, 118th Cong.; The PRESS Act, H.R.4250 — 118th Cong. (passed in the House).

[19] A shield law bill was also passed by the House in 2007, only to die due to Senate inaction. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, House Passes Federal Shield Law (Oct. 16, 2007); Free Flow of Information Act of 2007, H.R. 2102, 110th Cong.

[20] “In recent years,” federal and state governments clashes in court with the press over the compelled disclosure of confidential source, have involved efforts to identify and prosecute those who leak classified information to reporters. H.R. Rep. 118–299 118th Cong., 1st Sess. 2. The Committee went on to observe:

Journalists argue that these actions have a chilling effect that disincentives whistleblowers and informants from coming forward with critical information. In turn, Americans may be prevented from learning information of a compelling public interest. . . At times, journalists rely on confidential sources to gather information vital to holding public and private institutions accountable.

Id. at 3.

[21] The Act does not apply to civil defamation, slander, or libel claims. This is consistent with some state shield laws, which do not apply or can be waived in defamation cases. See, e.g., Or. Rev. Stat. §44.530(c); 735 ILCS 5/8-9032(b); Tenn. Code Ann. § 24-1-208(b); THE LAW OF DEFAMATION, supra note 1, at §12:62; see generally, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Reporter’s Privilege Compendium.

[22] In general, the First-Amendment-based journalists’ privilege is applied less robustly when a journalist is a party to a litigation, such as in defamation actions. See, Zerilli v. Smith, 656 F.2d 705, 714 (D.C. Cir. 1981)(the “equities weigh somewhat more heavily in favor of disclosure” in libel cases; the journalist is a party and successful assertion of the privilege “will effectively shield him from liability”); see Weinberger v. Maplewood Review, 668 N.W.2d 667, 674 (Minn. 2003)(construing Minnesota Statutes § 595.025 (2002), which provided the prohibition of disclosure . . . shall not apply in any defamation action where the person seeking disclosure can demonstrate that the identity of the source will lead to relevant evidence on the issue of actual malice.”).

[23] The 2007 journalists’ shield law bill that passed the House included exceptions that permitted the privilege to be breached to discover the source of unlawfully disclosures of “individually identifiable health information” and “nonpublic personal information . . . of any consumer.” H.R. 2102, supra, §2(a)(3)(C)(ii) & (iii).

[24] A journalist would understandably insist upon seeing documentary proof or some sort of objectively verifiable proof of the credibility of a leaker’s assertions. Thus, if a source is purporting to describe some photograph in government files or some statement on an immigration application, the journalist may be reticent to publish a story based on such assertions without seeing the relevant document for themselves.

[25] Mulhern suggests that “gross negligence” is sufficient. Id. at 183 (citing Albright v. United States, 732 F.2d 181, 189 n. 25 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).",https://www.yalejreg.com/wp-content/themes/bedstone/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:49.763918

The protest was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a national, anti-capitalist political movement with a chapter in Vermont.

The protest was organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a national, anti-capitalist political movement with a chapter in Vermont. Speakers decried ICE’s plans, laid out in federal contracting records, made public earlier this month, to hire at least a dozen contracted workers at the agency’s National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center. It uses intelligence-gathering networks to generate leads for immigration enforcement agents operating across the eastern U.S.

Demonstrators gathered in the middle of Harvest Lane, the road that runs in front of ICE’s Law Enforcement Support Center — a facility that houses a national ICE tip line — with local police routing traffic around them.

Across the street from that center is another building run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security which, on Saturday morning, was vandalized with threatening graffiti that appeared aimed at federal workers. The vandalized building was cordoned off by police tape on Sunday afternoon while the protest was taking place.

Cora Honigford, one of the protest’s organizers, said the group was not responsible for the graffiti and had no information about who had done it. Local and federal law enforcement were beginning to investigate the vandalism on Sunday.

The National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, which is where the plans that sparked Sunday’s protest would be based, is located about 1.5 miles away from where the demonstration took place and the site of the vandalized building.

Contractors at the targeting center would use social media platforms and online databases to help federal agents locate people who could be facing deportation, as well as friends and coworkers of those people, according to federal records. The plans are preliminary but say work could start as early as May 2026.

“We need to tell ICE our message that their surveillance will not slow us down. It will not stop us. It will only bring us out stronger,” said Honigford, who’s from South Royalton, in remarks to the crowd, drawing loud cheers.

Protestors held signs bearing slogans such as “No ICE Surveillance” and “ICE Fuera,” using the Spanish word for “out.” They chanted, among other refrains, “No justice, no peace! No ICE or police!”

Several speakers described ICE’s plans for social media surveillance in Williston as an escalation in the agency’s operations on top of the sharp increase in immigration enforcement that has defined President Donald Trump’s second term. The proposed surveillance is likely to target people already impacted by that enforcement the most, said Kate Paarlberg-Kvam, of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project, a legal advocacy network for immigrants.

“Make no mistake, that the primary targets for this enforcement would be our Black and brown neighbors, who are advocates for their own dignity,” Paarlberg-Kvam told her fellow demonstrators.

Michelle and Scott Stinson traveled up to Williston for the demonstration from Ludlow. Michelle held an upside-down American flag, which she said was a protest against ICE’s actions and future plans in the state.

“This is wrong,” she said of the proposed surveillance. “They should not be using us as a hub — for anything.”",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ice-protest-williston-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-13 07:56:47.187341

Reclaiming the narrative of control in migration Ultimately, irregular migration is not only a policy challenge but a test of political leadership.
Both legal migration and fair returns are part of that order.","The gathering of over 100,000 people at the “Unite the Kingdom” rally in London in September — framed as a “free speech” protest and led by far-right figures — was a potential watershed moment for political discourse. These previously unthinkable scenes now play out across Europe.

Right-wing parties have enjoyed a resurgence on a wave of anti-immigration sentiment. As a result, governments across Europe are becoming increasingly hardline on migration. This leads to short-sighted responses that may temporarily reduce numbers, but often come at a high financial, human and ethical cost.

Just days after the rally on 15 September, the first “one in, one out” deportation flight — part of the new Franco-British migration deal — was set to take off. Under the scheme, the UK can return people who arrive by small boats in exchange for an equivalent number of asylum seekers already in France.

But no migrants boarded the flight. A last-minute court intervention halted the first deportation of an Eritrean man, with the ruling citing a potential trafficking claim. The “one in, one out” scheme sits uncomfortably between criticism from both human rights groups and right-wing commentators: the former for its perceived erosion of protection, the latter for being “completely inadequate” to address the scale of the challenge.

It is a familiar story. Like Italy’s attempt at offshore asylum processing in Albania or the UK’s now-defunct Rwanda plan, another “innovative” migration policy so far fails to deliver — even though by now a handful of people have left for France.

Yet, despite a near absence of tangible results, the push for “innovative solutions” remains strong. At the European Political Community Summit in Copenhagen in October, a group of 17 countries issued a joint statement committing to put “innovation at the heart of migration reform.”

The real reasons migration deterrence isn’t working

At the heart of the continuing migration policy failures are a number of misconceptions.

First, the illusion that we can act sequentially: that we must first stop irregular arrivals and increase returns, and only then expand regular migration. Real progress requires doing all three in parallel.

Second, policymakers frequently express a belief that we can “smash the gangs” and disrupt their business model through enforcement directed at smugglers alone. But tackling the supply (the smugglers) without addressing the demand for migration — which in the absence of legal pathways translates into demand for irregular migration — doesn’t work. A comparison with the war on drugs can be made: Many decades and many billions have been spent on fighting the cartels, but this hasn’t done anything to change the demand for drugs.

Instead of disrupting the business model, the current approach to smuggling is boosting their business model. Smugglers we interviewed in North Africa described exactly that dynamic: tighter European controls made the demand for their services increase and their work more profitable.

Third, we must abandon the false dichotomy between “open” and “closed” migration policies. Control and openness are not opposites. Allowing people to migrate legally, in an organised and transparent way, is control. It restores order, ensures vetting, and prevents smugglers from profiting.

Fourth, the eternal cycle of small-scale pilots, especially on regular and labour migration pathways, has to end. From legal migration schemes to cooperation agreements, we have spent years experimenting at the margins. The “one in, one out” deal, capped at 50 people per week, is emblematic of this smallness. If we are serious about reducing irregular migration, we must scale up — not pilot forever.

Learning from recent migratory experiences

Recent experiences have provided valuable learnings. When the EU activated the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) for Ukrainians, granting millions immediate protection, as well as free movement and access to labour and education, it effectively carried out the largest anti-smuggling operation in history. Because there was a legal pathway, there was no market for smugglers.

In the United States, the Biden administration’s combination of significantly expanded legal pathways — both for employment and protection — and stricter border enforcement eventually brought irregular crossings down to less than a quarter of 2023 levels. The model worked, but too late, and without sufficient political ownership and public communication. Europe can and should learn from both successes and mistakes.

A blueprint for a workable European approach to migration

If the current approach and so-called innovative approaches continue to fail, a credible alternative would require the following five elements —to be implemented in parallel.

Migration “one-stop centres” must be established along key routes, providing humanitarian support, information on, and access to, legal migration options, return counselling and support, and opportunities for local integration. This would build on the “Safe Mobility Offices” model launched in the Americas, adapted and expanded for Europe’s context.

Substantially expanded regular labour migration pathways, matched to Europe’s identified labour shortages. This is not only humane but economically sound.

Implementation of fair, fast, and efficient asylum processing at Europe’s external borders, coupled with an effective relocation mechanism among Member States for those granted protection.

Strengthened resettlement programmes that become a genuinely viable solution for those in need of protection, not a symbolic gesture.

Finally, and crucially, ensuring that there are timely, efficient, scalable but fair and dignified return processes for those without a legal right to stay. Significantly expanding regular migration channels could also unlock cooperation from origin countries on returns – stressing again why this all needs to be done in parallel, not sequentially.

Together, these elements create a credible system that combines openness and enforcement — a balance that both voters and migrants can trust.

Reclaiming the narrative of control in migration

Ultimately, irregular migration is not only a policy challenge but a test of political leadership.

People do not just want fewer arrivals; they want order. Both legal migration and fair returns are part of that order. Allowing people to come through safe, legal pathways is taking back control — because it brings migration under the rule of law, not the rule of smugglers.

The task for Europe’s leaders now is to replace rhetoric with realism: to act collectively, communicate clearly, and scale up what works.

Because the real crisis is not one of numbers — it is one of credibility, protection and human dignity.

“I’m scared right now, but I had to bring them.” Across Chicago Public Schools and surrounding districts, the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has left families on edge — including the city’s youngest residents.
Their mother, her cousin, is undocumented, so on days when immigration enforcement is especially visible, Diaz steps in to help.

Just in recent weeks, Chicago schools are reporting that more children are missing from class, she said.","Monica Perez scanned the street as she left Funston Elementary, five of her children in tow. She kept her head down, her family close. After school pickup was once a familiar routine — in recent weeks, though, fear had crept into the family’s life and festered.

“Rápido,” Perez told her children, ushering them along Logan Square sidewalks. “Quickly.”

Perez came to Chicago from Mexico in 2007 without authorization. All seven of her children, ages 7 to 16, were born in the U.S. But as federal immigration enforcement intensifies across the city, even the short walk from school feels dangerous.

Perez mentally mapped their route, again and again: one block west, a few blocks north. They moved fast. Just the day before, she had kept her younger children home after hearing reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity near campus.

“Ahorita, ando con miedo, pero los tuve que traer,” Perez, 36, said in Spanish. “I’m scared right now, but I had to bring them.”

Across Chicago Public Schools and surrounding districts, the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has left families on edge — including the city’s youngest residents. School staff have scrambled to offer support in the classroom, while volunteers have organized ICE watch groups and student escorts for safe arrival and dismissal.

In response, CPS is expanding its 24-hour Student Safety Center with a dedicated team to triage incidents related to federal law enforcement. The center allows school leaders to report incidents and receive real-time guidance, the district said in a statement.

Schools have also been directed to establish ICE protocols and hold staff trainings, CPS interim Superintendent Macquline King told the Chicago Board of Education Wednesday.

“We understand the weight many of our families are carrying,” King said.

Since the launch of “Operation Midway Blitz” in September, federal agents have made more than 800 arrests in the Chicago area, according to the most recent count from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Trump administration has vowed to target “the worst of the worst,” but many of those detained have no criminal record.

Chicago-area schools have been swept up in the chaos. Several have gone into lockdown and canceled field trips or homecoming events in response to nearby ICE activity. Some parents say they fear being targeted during drop-off or pickup; others are keeping their children home as a precaution. Schools have reported a growing number of students now walking to class alone.

Standing watch

Earlier this month, recess at Funston Elementary was held indoors, after masked federal agents deployed tear gas just across the street. The agents had thrown the smoke canisters when bystanders blocked their vehicle. In the days that followed, scores of volunteers began surrounding the school during dismissal, mobilized through rapid response networks and social media.

On a recent afternoon, Evelyn Medina, 43, stood on a sidewalk handing out neon whistles, flyers and “ICE Out!” signs. Medina owns a gift shop directly next to the school. The tear gas had drifted into her boutique during the recent incident — but her main concern was for the students. Since then, she’s purchased hundreds of whistles for community members.

“I was afraid for the children,” Medina said, watching families walk by. “I think at this point, we have to do what we can to protect each other.”

Just a block away on West Armitage Avenue, Carson Bell, 25, held an “ICE Out” sign beside a small group of volunteers. As children crossed the street, Bell instructed community members to blow their whistles and alert school staff if they spotted federal agents. Bell’s wife works as a special education classroom assistant at Funston.

“It’s scary, because of how the targeting has ramped up around schools … They’re trying to grab people picking up their kids,” said Bell. “How can you plan to face something like that, especially when they’re teargassing right outside?”

Dozens of schools have organized similar patrols. At least three schools on Lincoln Square and Ravenswood went on lockdown following reports of ICE activity Friday. In response, community members are taking proactive steps. At Hibbard Elementary in Albany Park, for example, parents are coordinating a “walking school bus” — a group of children who walk to school together along a set route, accompanied by adult chaperones.

“It has been really an enormous effort, and we’ve been talking about how we can make it more sustainable,” said Maggie Cullerton Hooper, a parent representative on Hibbard’s Local School Council.

In the suburbs and beyond

The surge in ICE activity has extended beyond Chicago’s city limits, bringing anxiety and unrest to neighboring school districts — particularly in the south and southwest suburbs, where many communities are predominantly Latino. But even north of the city, parents have called school officials to say they’re worried about their children waiting at school bus stops.

Students regularly recount their fears to Marisa Mills, a seventh grade teacher at Unity Junior High in Cicero. They’re scared for themselves, their families and their friends. They often have difficulties concentrating, she said. School staff are feeling helpless.

“I’ve had students tell me, ‘I’m really worried about my family … I’m scared that something is going to happen,’” said Mills, who is also the president of Cicero’s teacher union. “To hear that come from one of your kids is devastating.”

Marlene Diaz, 30, receives terrified text messages from her 10-year-old son throughout the school day, begging her to pick him up early. Though they live just two blocks from Cicero East Elementary, Diaz now drives him to school: He’s too afraid to walk. Some of his friends haven’t been to class for weeks.

“It’s just hard. All the time, he’s like, ‘Mom, what about if they deport my friends? Why is all this happening?’” Diaz said. “Sometimes it’s hard to answer him.”

Since President Donald Trump began his second term, Diaz has also started driving her niece and nephew to school. Their mother, her cousin, is undocumented, so on days when immigration enforcement is especially visible, Diaz steps in to help.

The car rides are often silent. “I feel like it’s traumatizing them in all types of ways,” she said.

Learning environments

Experts warn that persistent fears of immigration enforcement can hinder children’s ability to learn and thrive. The deportation of a family member — or even the prolonged absences of a classmate — can lead to ambiguous loss, a type of grief marked by lack of closure, according to Rebecca Ford-Paz, a clinical child psychologist at Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago.

“Unlike death, where a kid can process grief, ambiguous losses are in limbo, where they don’t really know if and when they will be able to see their loved one again,” Ford-Paz said. “That creates persistent anxiety.”

Chronic stress in children is associated with behavioral issues and longer-term health challenges. A significant body of research also links high rates of absenteeism to lower academic achievement, disengagement and a greater risk of dropping out.

Rebecca Vonderlack-Navarro, vice president of education policy and research at the Latino Policy Forum, said she’s concerned that the visible presence of ICE will compound with chronic absenteeism already facing schools — a residual impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Just in recent weeks, Chicago schools are reporting that more children are missing from class, she said.

“This is the antithesis of a safe and steady and inclusive learning environment that students need to do well successfully,” Vonderlack-Navarro said.

‘What else can we do?’

At CPS, parents and community groups have called for a range of additional responses from the district, including expanded safe zones, automatically excused absences and remote learning options.

The Chicago Teachers Union urged the district to prepare for remote learning last month in light of the escalating threat. CPS spokespeople did not respond to questions on whether the district was preparing a remote learning plan.

At the Board of Education committee meeting Wednesday, Chicago Principals & Administrators Association President Kia Banks said school leaders have struggled to navigate the ICE threat, despite weekly briefings. She called on the district to address its current attendance metrics.

“It is tone-deaf right now to ask about enrollment and attendance when parents are afraid to take their children to school,” Banks told board members.

Back at Funston, mom-of-seven Perez guided her son Eduardo by the strap of his backpack. The 8-year-old has autism, and needs a high level of support at home. “Le pongo más pensar en él,” she said. “I worry most about him.”

Perez had spent all day at her mother-in-law’s house, which is closer to the school, so she could walk a shorter distance to pickup. She clutched a small bag of groceries, which she had hurriedly grabbed on the way to reduce her trips outside.

“¿Qué más podemos hacer?” she wondered aloud. “What else can we do?”

The family kept walking.

A Landmark Legal Victory

In what is seen as a landmark ruling, the High Court in Pretoria recently declared the woman a permanent resident, nearly six years after she first applied to the DHA for permanent residency back in September 2019.

Jaco Brits, Head of Immigration at Xpatweb who handled the application and acted on behalf of the applicant, says DHA not only refused her initial application, but also dismissed her subsequent appeal application, dated October 2022, and failed to process her Retired Person’s Visa renewal submitted in February 2023. This renewal was crucial to maintain her legal stay in South Africa while awaiting a decision on her permanent residency and was, in fact, a prerequisite for the PR application to proceed.

“After years of unjustified delays, refusals, bureaucratic dead ends and frustration, the applicant has now been vindicated on all fronts,” says Brits.

Court Orders Immediate Action

In its ruling, the Court ordered the Minister of Home Affairs and Director-General (DG) to issue both a Retired Person's Visa and a Permanent Residence Permit “forthwith”. This brings finality to the woman after years of uncertainty.

Significantly, Brits notes that this is a rare outcome. “In most cases, courts direct the Department to make a decision within a specified timeframe. It does not happen often that the court itself declares an individual a permanent resident.”

In addition, the Court made strong provisions to protect the applicant’s rights in the interim. She may enter, reside and work in, and exit South Africa freely. The Department is prohibited from taking any action that could result in her arrest, detention, deportation, or her being declared undesirable. She may not be sent back to the UK or any other country.

The Minister and DG were ordered to pay the costs of the application, including the costs of Counsel.

Litigation Increasingly the Only Way Forward to Resolve Unduly Long Delays

Brits says the order is indeed a welcome relief, especially as many applicants are left in limbo due to government administrative inaction or when excessive delays impede visa progress that can cause significant disruptions to personal and business affairs.

The recent drive to expedite visa processing appears to have introduced new challenges, including an increase in the rejection of applications and a surge in consequent appeals.

It is clear litigation has become a necessary legal route for applicants facing unreasonable delays in visa or permanent residence adjudication flowing from the historic backlog inherited from the previous administration.

Expert Legal Strategy Can Make the Difference

Individuals who are subject to unduly long delays, should consider expert legal guidance on a formal and structured pathway to resolve these issues promptly, protecting their legal rights and ensuring timely decision-making.

“Our legal professionals are best placed to develop a personalised legal strategy that ensures the Department focuses on a single applicant’s case or family unit. This targeted approach leads to quicker adjudication and increased chances of success,” Brits explains.

We Showed Up. - Organizing My Thoughts,"Kelly Hayes, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://organizingmythoughts.org/they-came-for-our-neighbors-we-showed-up/,"Soon, we learned that the vendor was still there, but that two other neighbors had been seized.
Neighbors fanned out, searching streets and alleyways for any sign of ICE activity, following up on reports, and communicating what we found.
The corridor of businesses on Clark Street, where many immigrants shop and work, was clearly defended by this mass presence.
Some of us showed up on Thursday in ways that we wouldn’t be able to if this level of ICE activity were a daily occurrence.
Attendees were also encouraged to support businesses on Clark Street, to keep the area active and prosperous in the face of federal attacks.","I was still groggy, drinking my morning tea, when my phone started buzzing with alerts about ICE hitting a corner within walking distance of my home. At first, it was unclear if they had taken a street vendor who was familiar to many of us. Soon, we learned that the vendor was still there, but that two other neighbors had been seized.

That series of texts would soon activate a neighborhood.

I left my apartment on foot, in the clothes I had slept in, and made my way up Clark Street, watching for any signs of ICE. When I saw a suspicious vehicle, I relayed what I’d seen through neighborhood channels that coordinate ICE watch activity. When I reached the intersection of Clark and Lunt, where the abductions had occurred, other neighbors, including some old friends of mine, were already assembling and taking directions from local organizers who had been preparing for this moment for months.

While some parts of Chicago have been targeted relentlessly during the recent federal onslaught known as “Operation Midway Blitz,” Rogers Park had seen more scattered reports of ICE activity—until Thursday, when their presence was confirmed at the start of the day with immigration arrests, and continually reported throughout the morning and afternoon. Neighbors fanned out, searching streets and alleyways for any sign of ICE activity, following up on reports, and communicating what we found. Before long, there were dozens, and then hundreds of people in the streets, watching and responding.

“Clark Street was flooded with people,” Daniel*, an activist with Protect RP, told me. “We had over 200 people on the streets. That was power.” Daniel noted that many people left work early, or “dropped whatever they were doing” to join the effort.

Longtime ICE watchers wore bright orange whistles around their necks, which are used to signal the presence of ICE. Newcomers received whistles from volunteers distributing them in the streets, making the crowds of ICE watchers a clear presence. The corridor of businesses on Clark Street, where many immigrants shop and work, was clearly defended by this mass presence.

Wherever I went Thursday, to follow up on a reported ICE sighting, I was quickly met by many neighbors—and often, they were already there when I arrived. We talked to witnesses who had spotted ICE. We talked to business owners and concerned staff at schools. When people spotted vehicles that had been identified as belonging to ICE, they blew their whistles and jeered loudly, making locations as inhospitable to ICE as possible, while also warning vulnerable people nearby that ICE was present.

“[ICE] had a much harder time trying to take people because there were so many watchers out observing and confronting them,” Rosemary, an organizer with Rad Rogers Park, told me. “Everybody had their orange whistles on, and they were clearly ready. ICE had to be a lot more careful about where they were hitting, and so it was a lot harder for them to take more people.”

In some cases, people on bikes and in cars followed ICE vehicles to track their movements, and even blocked vehicles or otherwise obstructed their path. These actions are risky, as ICE has a history of using chemical weapons and committing other acts of violence against people who attempt to block their vehicles. In one incident, a woman who allegedly blocked in ICE vehicles with her car in Brighton Park—who has also been the subject of other highly questionable allegations—was shot by an ICE agent on October 4, in a moment that stirred another community mobilization.

On Sunday, ICE agents arrested one rapid responder in Rogers Park and pulled their guns on at least three others. In east Albany Park, ICE agents targeted rapid responders with tear gas. “This activity is not risk-free,” Manuel, an organizer with Protect RP told me on Sunday. “People have to make their own decisions—and we are not going to judge anybody for making any decision about what their risk level is, because we don't walk in their shoes, we just walk next to them.” Manuel did offer advice to rapid responders who are trying to remain as safe as possible. “Our first advice to people is to don't do this alone,” he said. “The feds seem to be more cautious when we are in groups, which makes perfect sense because they're bullies.”

Despite the risks, people on the ground are making autonomous decisions about how to confront the violence in their communities as it occurs, and even though these actions are not bound by a unified directive, they are all committed in the interest of solidarity and community safety.

Our city has been rendered wholly unsafe for immigrants, or for anyone who federal agents might profile as an immigrant. To get to work, to take their children to school, to move about their communities, immigrants in Chicagoland must engage with risk. ICE could seize them at the bus stop, at the gas station, or from their own beds in the night. So, some of us have elected to defend immigrants by stepping into zones of unsafety ourselves. For many, this involves taking risks, from the risk of being unlawfully detained by ICE agents while exercising the legal right to film an immigration arrest, to the risk of placing one’s body or vehicle in the way of ICE’s work, or the risk of facing the violence of ICE agents or state police while protesting near the Broadview ICE facility. We are taking these actions to defend our neighbors, the sanctity of our values, and the character of Chicagoland. This is a place where immigrants are loved, needed, and appreciated, and we will not give up members of our beloved communities without a fight.

Some people participated in Thursday’s mobilization remotely, by managing communications between people on the ground or staying in touch with people who were patrolling without a buddy. Maisie, an activist with Protect RP who helped coordinate communications on Thursday, told me that as a disabled person, “to be doing things that were accessible to me physically was really important.” She emphasized that “everybody has a place in this movement and everybody can do something.” As we spoke at a community gathering on Saturday, Maisie told me, “There are people right now who are folding brochures to be sent out in walk packets that we just decided to put together, and people are going to get materials because of them.”

As we took action together on Thursday, we were also aware that this single day of frenzied ICE activity was a daily reality for some neighborhoods across the city. Some of us showed up on Thursday in ways that we wouldn’t be able to if this level of ICE activity were a daily occurrence. As I moved from one reported ICE sighting after another, I felt tremendous empathy for organizers in Pilsen, Little Village, and other neighborhoods for whom this level of federal aggression is a daily grind. They are exhausted. They are constantly grieving the loss of neighbors. And they are also constantly teaching neighborhoods like mine lessons about how to mobilize and respond in the face of shifting conditions.

This is not a story about a moment of victory, but a moment of being reminded of our power. “It took months of us building infrastructure and relationships for something like Thursday to happen,” Rosemary told me.

Being a part of that fabric of relationships and preparedness is rewarding, but it can also be challenging—especially for people who are accustomed to the straightforward intensity of frontline protest. While Rapid Response sometimes involves confrontation, it can often feel like an unfinished sentence or an unanswered question. When we follow up on reports at locations ICE has targeted and left, or may never have been, or patrol fixed areas as a preventative measure, there is a lot of uncertainty, and often, we are holding space as a deterrent, documenting events, or comforting our neighbors, rather than squaring off with the forces that are harming our communities. It’s a form of resistance that requires us to put aside ego, and the need for personal gratification, to become a node in a living network of care, support, and defense.

Maisie urged people who feel moved to protect their communities to find a way to get involved. ""Get out, meet some people, get involved in the groups that are doing this,"" she said. “There are ways for literally everybody to do something, and we have to do it because no one else is going to do it.”

We cannot prevent all of the harm that ICE will do in our communities, but we can make their work harder, and we can make our values, our presence, and our solidarity known. We can make our neighborhoods and our relationships stronger, as we forge bonds in opposition to this violence. On Saturday, nearly 500 people gathered in Rogers Park to protest the recent ICE activity in the community, mourn the theft of those taken, and celebrate the community mobilization that formed in response. Attendees were also encouraged to support businesses on Clark Street, to keep the area active and prosperous in the face of federal attacks.

On Sunday, ICE alerts in Rogers Park began early, with more sightings and arrests, and continued into the afternoon. Many of us took to the streets again, and will continue to do so. Because our community is worth fighting for.

In the central West Bank, Israeli troops stormed homes in Ramallah and al-Bireh governorate, focusing on families of detainees slated for release.

Towns affected included Abwein, Mazari’ al-Nubani, ‘Arura, Beit Rima, Kafr Ni’ma, Deir Ibzi’, ‘Ein ‘Arik, Nabi Saleh, Ni’lin, Deir Jarir, Silwad, and neighborhoods in al-Bireh such as Umm al-Sharayet and al-Am’ari refugee camp.

Occupation forces threatened relatives with retaliation if they displayed any signs of joy or celebration.

At military roadblocks north of Ramallah, soldiers intensified their presence, harassing civilians and blocking dozens of vehicles entering the city.

In the northern West Bank, Israeli troops abducted Hilal Mohammad Azar from his home in Nablus and invaded nearby villages including Zawata and Beit Iba, conducting house-to-house searches.

Earlier, in the Shakara area east of Duma village, illegal Israeli paramilitary colonizers assaulted Palestinian homes and obstructed schoolchildren on their way to class.

At dawn, dozens of colonizers—escorted by Israeli soldiers—invaded the eastern part of Nablus and headed toward Joseph’s Tomb.

The military preemptively invaded the area with bulldozers, firing stun grenades and tear gas, which caused multiple cases of suffocation among residents.

South of Bethlehem, in Deheishe refugee camp, Israeli forces abducted 18-year-old Mohammad Mousa Herzallah after ransacking his family’s home.

Meanwhile, in the village of Umm Safa northwest of Ramallah, colonizers carried out two separate attacks on Palestinian homes under military protection.

They targeted the home of Nadim Khasayeb with stones, damaging solar panels, windows, and a water tank. Hours later, they returned to assault additional homes before being repelled by local residents.

Additionally, Israeli soldiers intensified restrictions at the Tayasir military roadblock on Monday morning, further obstructing Palestinian access to the northern Jordan Valley. Human rights activist Aref Daraghma stated that soldiers closed the roadblock in line with a degrading schedule recently imposed on Palestinian movement through the area.

The Tayasir roadblock has been a site of ongoing repression for over two years, with Israeli forces routinely closing it for extended periods and disrupting traffic.

In recent weeks, authorities have enforced a daily opening and closing schedule, severely limiting freedom of movement for residents and farmers in the region.

Also, the soldiers invaded the home of detainee Ahmad Ka’abna in Aqabat Jabr refugee camp near Jericho in northeastern West Bank, searched the property, and warned his family against holding any celebrations or traveling abroad to receive him.

Ka’abna has been imprisoned since April 26, 1997, and is serving two life sentences plus six additional years.

In the latest development, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it is accepting new (initial) DACA applications once again—but under current court orders, it cannot process or approve those applications at this time.

This announcement comes as many applicants seek clarity on their options and turn to trusted legal professionals for help. Working with an experienced immigration lawyer Los Angeles, CA can provide much-needed insight into how these developments may affect both pending and future filings.

While this may sound like a small technical step, it signals a potentially significant turning point in the ongoing litigation surrounding DACA and the government's intent to keep the program alive for so-called ""Dreamers.""

Background: The Legal Battle Over DACA

DACA was first established in 2012 to provide certain undocumented individuals who arrived in the U.S. as children with protection from deportation and the ability to obtain work authorization.

However, a series of court challenges—most notably in the Southern District of Texas (Judge Andrew Hanen) and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals—have found that DACA was not lawfully implemented.

In January 2025, the Fifth Circuit issued a decision striking down key portions of the Biden Administration's DACA regulation but stopped short of completely ending the program. The court sent the case back to Judge Hanen to determine how the program should operate moving forward.

The Current Status: Acceptance Without Adjudication

As of October 2025, USCIS confirms the following:

- Renewal applications for current and prior DACA recipients continue to be accepted and - processed nationwide.

- Initial (first-time) applications are being accepted but placed on hold.

- USCIS will receive and store the filings but will not review, adjudicate, or issue work authorization until further court direction is given.

- Advance Parole (for travel) remains available to current DACA holders on a case-by-case basis.

This ""accept but don't process"" approach stems directly from the injunction still in place under the Texas court order. Until that order is modified or lifted, no new DACA grants can be approved—even if applications are submitted.

For those pursuing long-term legal status or naturalization, consulting a knowledgeable citizenship lawyer Los Angeles, CA may help identify alternative immigration pathways while the courts continue to deliberate.

What Might Come Next

The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have asked the court to allow adjudication of new DACA applications outside Texas, arguing that Dreamers nationwide should not be penalized by a geographically limited ruling. That proposal remains pending before Judge Hanen.

Legal analysts expect that whichever way the Texas court rules next, the case is likely to head back to the U.S. Supreme Court for a final decision on DACA's future in 2026.

“ICE was once again a presence in Evanston and Rogers Park this AM, with masked men taking multiple members of our community off the street,” he said.

At about 10:30 a.m, ICIRR’s Rapid Response Network also “verified that federal agents abducted two people at the Home Depot on Oakton.”

Following that alert, Evanston’s youth soccer program, AYSO, sent an email to participants allowing coaches to cancel or postpone games scheduled for Sunday.

“James Park is directly across from Home Depot,” the email from AYSO Evanston said. “If you do not feel safe playing your soccer game today, do not go!”

“I am not officially canceling all games today, as many of them are in areas where there is no reported [ICE] activity,” the email continued. “If you feel the need to cancel your game today, please do so. Safety of our players, parents, coaches, referees, and all volunteers is our top priority!”

Sunday’s detention of two people comes on the heels of heightened ICE activity on the North Side of Chicago in recent days, according to ICIRR.

“We were not notified of any pending ICE operation,” said Evanston Police Department Cmdr. Ryan Glew. “We did receive a call about ICE operations on Oakton, but whatever occurred was wrapped up before we responded to assess.”

Under the Welcoming City Ordinance, Evanston is a sanctuary city, meaning that the city and EPD do not collaborate with federal immigration authorities.

It was just after 8:30 a.m. when a woman named Julie looked out her Rogers Park window to see Border patrol agents interrogating a man stopped right in front of St. Jerome Catholic Church.

""I think they've been casing the church... the mass times are down,"" Julie said. ""I think they've been casing the church. There was somebody up there the other day who got picked up. They're in this neighborhood for a reason.""

With a Spanish-language mass going on at that hour, Julie and her partner alerted the priest, along with several others in the neighborhood who took it upon themselves to make sure people were able to leave the church safely.

""I felt really badly for them,"" Julie said. ""They were inside, scared to come out. I can understand why.""

Frontline organisations working with people seeking asylum, including health, housing and emergency relief services, are stretched to breaking point as demand continues to rise.
Elijah Buol, CEO of Asylum Seekers Centre, says “The systemic lack of a safety net for people seeking asylum has created a growing poverty crisis in our communities.","As we mark Anti-Poverty Week today, the Refugee Council of Australia (RCOA) and Asylum Seekers Centre (ASC) are urging the Australian Government to take immediate action to ensure that people have the right to work to support themselves and to end the systemic exclusion of people seeking asylum from basic services, which is driving thousands into poverty and homelessness.

This exclusion forces individuals and families into cycles of destitution, homelessness, ill health and labour exploitation with devastating long-term impacts, including exposure to modern slavery.

Adama Kamara Deputy CEO of RCOA says “Australia has both the capacity and the responsibility to provide a safety net for all, not just some. People seeking asylum want to contribute, to work, study and build a life, but they continue to be left behind by policies that deny them basic support, putting them at risk.”

“These issues must be addressed as part of broader anti-poverty measures and the Government’s commitment to tackling modern slavery and migrant worker exploitation in Australia.”

Ali* who applied for asylum in 2016 but lost his work rights, continues to struggle without any government support as he awaits the outcome of his case.

“It is very difficult for me, my wife and my daughter who was born here. Since I lost work rights, we all eat less food and we are struggling. We can’t pay the rent and have had to borrow money from friends. This has been the case for over 5 years now.

“If I had work rights and was able to do work, I could help my wife and feed my daughter.”

These experiences are not isolated. The Refugee Council has consistently warned that people seeking asylum are being locked out of essential services and pushed into poverty by design. The same concerns were also raised in Australia’s 2025 NGO Report to the UN Human Rights Council, which was endorsed by over 100 civil society organisations and calls for a restoration of basic support.

Frontline organisations working with people seeking asylum, including health, housing and emergency relief services, are stretched to breaking point as demand continues to rise.

Elijah Buol, CEO of Asylum Seekers Centre, says “The systemic lack of a safety net for people seeking asylum has created a growing poverty crisis in our communities. On the frontlines, we see the devastating consequences every day – families facing homelessness, women escaping domestic violence left with nowhere to turn, people skipping meals or going without essential medical care.

“This is not just a policy failure – it’s a test of our national character. Australians believe in fairness for all. That principle must extend to people in crisis, regardless of their visa status. The government must act to ensure no one is left behind.”

Together with a growing number of sector leaders, peak bodies and community groups, the Refugee Council and Asylum Seekers Centre call on the Federal government to restore a basic safety net for people seeking asylum. This includes access to income support, housing and healthcare, the right to work and study while asylum claims are being assessed, and urgent expansion of the Status Resolution Support Services program so it reaches those in real crisis. Greater investment is also needed in frontline services, and a pathway to permanency for those who have been living in limbo for years.

These solutions are clear, practical and entirely within reach. What is needed now is the political will to act — to save lives, prevent hardship and ensure people seeking protection in Australia are treated with dignity, inclusion and the chance to belong.",https://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SafetyNetHeroImage2.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 20:57:12.720438

On October 10, 2025, during a performance at the iconic Rose Bowl, Roan paused between her energetic hits to deliver a message that reverberated far beyond the stadium’s walls. With passion, she shouted, “F*** ICE forever,” repeating the phrase to a chorus of cheers from her California audience, as reported by NME and LADbible.

Videos of the moment quickly spread across social media platforms, capturing not just Roan’s words but the electric response from her fans. The scene was one of jubilation, with some attendees later sharing their emotional reactions online. One fan wrote, “We were there and she was spectacular. She certainly didn’t mince her words!!” Another, visibly moved, posted, “I'm getting misty eyed. I have not heard so many people in one place cheer. It makes my heart beat a bit stronger. Seeing all the hate against my people, has been so devastating to me. Seeing this, makes my heart thank you!!”

Roan’s comments were a clear critique of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency frequently at the center of controversy for its handling of immigration enforcement and the detention of individuals, many of whom have no criminal record. According to NME, Roan not only criticized ICE’s treatment of immigrants but also encouraged her fans to stay informed and involved in advocating for more humane immigration policies that respect human rights.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, wasted no time in responding. Just two days later, on October 12, 2025, DHS issued a statement that was as brusque as it was dismissive. In a comment to TMZ, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, “Pink Pony Club is good. Pedophiles are bad. That’s who we’re getting off of our streets. Get a grip.” The reference to “Pink Pony Club” nodded to Roan’s popular song, but the message was clear: DHS was standing firm behind its agency and its mission, brushing off the singer’s critique.

This exchange didn’t just highlight the growing friction between artists who use their platforms for activism and the federal agencies they criticize—it also underscored the ongoing, deeply polarized debate over U.S. immigration enforcement. ICE, established in 2003 as part of the post-9/11 reorganization of federal security agencies, has long been a lightning rod for controversy. Critics argue the agency has overreached, detaining individuals without criminal records and sometimes separating families, while supporters maintain that ICE plays a crucial role in keeping dangerous individuals off the streets.

The public’s reaction to Roan’s outburst was swift and divided. Many fans lauded her courage and willingness to speak out, especially in an industry where taking a political stand can alienate segments of the audience. “People screamed louder after that line than they did for the chorus of Pink Pony Club,” one attendee noted on social media. Another joked, “Y'all know how many birds she's gonna anger by this? I love it and I don't even listen to her.”

Yet, not everyone was impressed. Some critics, including Roan’s own fans, questioned the timing and sincerity of her activism. On social media, one user asked, “Where was this energy earlier with Trump/elections?” Another pointed out, “She refused to endorse any Democrat candidate last election but wants to speak up now that she sees real people pushing back.” A third, more cynical voice commented, “I'm sorry, but rich people saying things means nothing to me at this point. I agree with her sentiment, but I'm not going to worship someone who's able to sit in their mansion or go on a stage and say something that people are getting beat on the street for saying.”

This backlash reflects a broader skepticism about celebrity activism—especially when it comes to issues as contentious as immigration. While some see artists like Roan as champions for the marginalized, others view their statements as performative or disconnected from the realities faced by those directly impacted by ICE actions.

The Department of Homeland Security’s response was notable not just for its bluntness but for its attempt to redirect the conversation. By stating, “That’s who we’re getting off of our streets,” DHS sought to frame ICE’s mission as one focused on removing dangerous individuals, specifically mentioning “pedophiles.” This rhetorical move is common in debates about law enforcement, where agencies often highlight their work against the most reviled criminals to justify broader, sometimes controversial, enforcement tactics.

But the exchange also shines a light on the difficulties of public discourse around immigration. As NME observed, the rapid response from DHS demonstrates how controversial these discussions have become, and how challenging it is for public figures to engage with political issues without encountering pushback. The complexities of immigration policy—balancing national security, humanitarian concerns, and the rights of immigrants—make it a minefield for anyone who enters the fray.

The Roan-DHS episode also illustrates the enduring challenge of holding federal agencies accountable and ensuring transparency in their actions. Critics of ICE have long demanded greater oversight, citing cases of abuse and the psychological toll of detention on families and children. Supporters, meanwhile, argue that robust enforcement is necessary to maintain the rule of law and public safety.

For policymakers and citizens alike, the debate remains fraught. Immigration is a perennial issue in American politics, shaping elections and fueling passionate arguments on all sides. The 2024 presidential election saw immigration as a central topic, with candidates offering starkly different visions for the future of agencies like ICE. As the country heads into another election cycle, moments like Roan’s outburst—and the reactions they provoke—are likely to become even more common.

Ultimately, the incident at the Rose Bowl is a microcosm of a larger national conversation. It raises questions not just about immigration enforcement, but about the role of artists in political life, the responsibilities of federal agencies, and the power of public protest. Whether or not Roan’s words will lead to lasting change is uncertain, but they have undeniably added fuel to an already raging debate.

As the music faded and the stadium emptied, the echoes of Roan’s message lingered—reminding everyone that in America’s ongoing struggle over immigration, the battle for hearts and minds is being fought not just in courtrooms and Congress, but also on the nation’s stages.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-10-12 20:57:34.854903

During the demonstration, officers received reports that a man had been assaulted and injured near S Bancroft Street and Bond Avenue. The man was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, officials said.

Officers later arrested a suspect, a 32-year-old man, who was booked into the Multnomah County Detention Center on a charge of fourth-degree assault.

Meanwhile, police said the victim, a 33-year-old Beaverton man, was identified as a suspect in a separate assault. While in the hospital, he was criminally cited for fourth-degree assault, officials said.

Throughout the evening, dozens of protesters maintained a presence at the ICE facility, including many in costumes and an appearance from the Unipiper.

While it remained an active scene as night fell, the mood was not tense, but more “party-like.”

However, at around 10:15 p.m., federal agents deployed pepper spray on the crowd.

Additionally, OHSU said medical helicopters would not be landing at their facility, due to possible reports of lasers being shined at Customs and Border Patrol helicopters sent in to support ICE operations.

KOIN 6 News has not been able to confirm any reports of this happening as of Sunday morning.

But after approaching Illinois State Police officers standing outside the facility, the group’s communion request was rebuffed.

The processing facility has been at the center of ongoing demonstrations in recent weeks. About 11 a.m., protesters marched down Lexington Street toward the center, praying and singing.

Illinois State Police Lt. Col. Jason Bradley called the facility with the religious leaders’ request to give communion. Bradley said ICE denied the request.

Bradley said no reason was given for the denial.

ICE didn’t immediately return a request for comment on why the request was denied.

About 1,000 members of Chicago-area parishes and of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership were part of the delegation.

When the leaders announced to the group that ICE had declined the request, people started yelling “Shame! Shame!”

The group had communion among themselves in the parking lot and street before dispersing to either walk home or board yellow school buses the organizers had rented to take people home.

The Rev. Larry Dowling, one of the priests holding the communion elements, said, “We’re just very disappointed because we simply wanted to bring the love of God and the presence of the Eucharist to these prisoners, which we had been allowed to do before all this stuff happened. So they’re basically rejecting us bringing the presence of Christ and the love of God.”

A spokesperson for the coalition pointed to the 2008 Access to Religious Ministry Act, which allows religious workers “reasonable access” to jails and people in immigration detention facilities to meet with those who wish to “consult about their spiritual needs.”

“ICE has completely shut down and [is] not allowing any ministers inside to provide communion and religious support for many weeks now,” said spokesperson Sarah Rand of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership. Rand was unsure whether any attempts by other groups had been successful.

Chuck Fitzsimmons led the singing during the procession along Lexington Street to the ICE facility.

“In one sense [the music] keeps up your spirits, but also it focuses us on the message that we are here as one, brothers and sisters all,” he said.

He said he was sad to not be able to share communion with the detainees. “However, these are the times and these are the morals, and I think we were prepared to be denied,” he said.

On Saturday, crews put up barricades in front of the fence that a judge ordered removed by Tuesday per state police orders, according to a crew person on site.

U.S. District Judge LaShonda A. Hunt issued a temporary restraining order Thursday ordering the removal of the fence outside the processing facility to be taken down immediately.

The fence, erected in September, was still up as of Saturday afternoon. Officials have until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday to take it down.

Before the clergy arrived, dozens of protesters had already gathered at Harvard Street and 25th Avenue.

About 30 minutes ahead of Broadview’s 6 p.m. protest curfew, some protesters went onto 25th Avenue to heckle a vehicle full of federal agents. Police then declared an unlawful assembly and pushed protesters down the street. State and sheriff’s confirmed 15 arrests throughout the day. Protesters arrested earlier Saturday face charges including destruction of government property, aggravated battery to a police officer, mob action and resisting or obstructing an officer.

About 7 p.m. Illinois State Police retreated and protesters cleared the roadway as Illinois Department of Transportation made small adjustments to the barriers around the designated free speech zones along 25th Avenue and demonstrators largely dispersed.

The ICE facility is the site of ongoing and often tense demonstrations, with agents deploying chemical irritants and rubber pellets, since President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively ramped up a deportation campaign in the Chicago area last month under the name “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Since then, protesters have arrived at the facility in the early morning hours, sometimes as early as 5 a.m. and have clashed with federal authorities into the late night hours.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d21b62f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7712x4402+0+371/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2Fa8%2F6fb987c244eb9fa51696a552be7f%2Fbroadview-101225-035.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 19:57:04.156810

We at Migration Watch have watched and listened closely. Here’s a brief summary of the Labour, Conservative and Reform proposals.

Labour Party

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood promised to stop small-boat crossings, crack down on smuggling gangs (again), and end hotel use for those awaiting the outcome of asylum applications. The focus was, in the main, illegal migration. She would extend the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for those who have arrived on visas from five to ten years and require applicants to be working, paying taxes, be able to speak English and have clean criminal records.

Conservative Party

Chris Philp, Shadow Home Secretary, unveiled the Borders Plan. This includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, a ban on asylum claims by people who have entered the UK without permission, or those who make a claim at the point of being required to leave having been here for prolonged periods, deport illegal small boat arrivals to safe countries, abolish immigration tribunals and legal aid for those entering, deport foreign criminals and establish a Removals Force to deport 150,000 people per year, including those already in the UK illegally and future illegal arrivals and foreign nationals convicted of serious offences.

Reform UK

Reform UK’s plan, announced by Nigel Farage, would scrap indefinite leave to remain. Migrants would instead have five-year work visas with higher salary requirements and no welfare access; existing ILR holders would reapply and would be able to apply for British citizenship seven years following granting of ILR. Before the conference Reform pledged to detain illegal small-boat arrivals, leave the ECHR, repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and deport 600,000 migrants with no right to be here over five years, focusing on the ‘Boriswave’.

Migration Watch view

We have no expectation that the Liberal Democrats, the Greens or ‘Your Party’ will embrace the policies needed to control and reduce immigration. While Rupert Lowe (Restore Britain) and Ben Habib (Advance UK) both advocate policies which resonate with many people, according to the polls, they are unlikely to be involved in forming the next government.

What Reform and the Conservatives had to say about illegal immigration and asylum was welcome, if expected. However, we were disappointed that their focus was confined largely to this aspect of the immigration problem, with scant attention given to overall immigration, which is more than 20 times the number who have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.

There was no mention of the fact that net migration added more than 2.5million to our population in the five years to mid-2024, or that our population grew by 755,000 in the year to mid-2024 – 98 per cent of that increase due to immigration – with every local authority in England bar one seeing growth. The Labour Party, for its part, also largely avoided addressing this wider issue.

Like the majority of the British public, we want illegal immigration brought to an end, but we also want to hear how the parties propose to deal with the catastrophic levels of legal migration that are driving such profound demographic change – levels which could lead to the white British population becoming a minority by the early 2060s. It was precisely this scenario that prompted Sir Keir Starmer to warn of the risk of Britain becoming an ‘island of strangers’. What a pity that the courage he showed in May appears since to have deserted him.

Migration Watch UK, and the millions who share our concerns, now want to hear from the parties most likely to form or join the next government how they intend to tackle this existential challenge. We would be pleased to share our proposals for how this can be achieved.",https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ukborder.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 19:56:48.737263

where federal officers deployed various crowd control measures at demonstrators. KATU reporters on the scene at the time said officers deployed what seemed to be a mixture of tear gas and pepper balls at protesters.

Today's protest aims to stand against what organizers describe as the ""military occupation"" of Portland streets and to demand the shutdown of the ICE Facility.

The event coincides with the emergency Naked Bike Ride, scheduled for 3:00 p.m. on the same day.

“This event is a protest against the Militarization of our city. The Military are being sent to protect ICE agents and their efforts in kidnapping indigenous, Latino and Hispanic people. Migrant workers are being targeted as are indigenous women and Palestine protesters,"" the World Naked Bike Ride Portland group said in a post on social media. ""This event is to bring attention to these issues and to give voice for local protestors to speak at the start.""

The ride will begin at the Oregon Convention Center Plaza in Northeast Portland but a full route has not yet been announced.

However, the post stated that the route will take about six miles total.

“Of course, we were denied access,” Coulter said.","Three Evanston ministers drove to the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Friday to pray and share a Communion outside the detention facility, but were denied access to the facility.

The Rev. Jason W. Coulter, senior pastor at First Congregational Church of Evanston; the Rev. Britt Cox, executive pastor at United Methodist Church of Evanston; and the Rev. Eileen Wiviott, senior minister at Unitarian Church of Evanston, joined dozens of clergy members representing several religions from across the Chicago area.

“I came to witness this unfolding tragedy that is happening in our community,” said Coulter, as he looked at the two-story detention facility behind high fences about a block away.

The faith leaders organized the Communion service to share what they view as the body of Christ. They wanted to offer it to fellow protesters gathered in Broadview, along with police officers and detainees inside the facility, too.

“Of course, we were denied access,” Coulter said. “But this meal that we understand to be available to all people is being denied to the detainees simply because of their status.”

First visit

Friday was his first time visiting the Broadview facility, about 25 miles southwest of Evanston.

“The treatment that we’re seeing here before our very eyes is heartbreaking, and it really needs to end, and it needs to end now,” he said. “The scene is so very militarized. It is like an occupation — the walls, the barriers, the over-the-top police presence. It’s clear that they’re here not to keep us safe, but to keep us in our place.”

It was Cox’s first visit, too.

“People said it felt a little bit less chaotic and violent as some of the other days before … but it still felt very heightened and controlled,” she said. “It felt that there was a force managing our space, wanting to manage our movement. It was scary having helicopters and federal agents take pictures.”

Wiviott had attended a demonstration in Broadview in early September, before the area was fenced off and before federal agents used tear gas and pepper spray on demonstrators.

“It was clear immediately just how different it was from five weeks ago,” she said. “Now, the road is blocked off by police, and you feel the heavy, heavy presence of ICE officers and police.”

Wiviott’s Unitarian Church does not practice the Christian Holy Communion, “but I found that attempting to offer Communion to those who are being caged was really powerful,” she said. “And as somebody who doesn’t explicitly identify as Christian, I still found grace.”

First Congregational Church’s Coulter said he plans to talk to his congregation about what he saw. The trip to Broadview from Evanston takes about an hour. He said he parked on village streets about two blocks from the protest area.

“I want to tell them what is happening in our backyards and let them know that we’re all called in whatever way we can to resist this, to defend our neighbors, to support those that are in trouble and to speak out to say this is not right and it has to stop,” he said.

‘It matters’

“Everybody can come to Broadview to be witness to what is happening, to see the different forms of resistance that are on display here, and to say that you were there. It matters.”

Wiviott added that she would be careful before telling parishioners to come to Broadview.

“I do think it’s dangerous, and I would not ask anybody to do it,” she said. “I have relied on my clergy symbols to give me a measure of safety, although the last several weeks have made me feel much less secure. … I really encourage people to find what ways they can show up.”

One way, she said, is to attend immigration-policy protests called “Shine the Light” in Evanston at 6:30 every Thursday night at one of three intersections: Dempster Street and Ridge Avenue, Chicago Avenue and Main Street, and Lincolnwood Drive and Central Street.

“This is a way of saying we won’t be silent and we won’t be complicit,” Wiviott said. “We want to be beacons of light and show there is another way.”

Said Cox: “This is not going to be a one-time protest. This is going to be a long haul, and it’s going to take all of us. It’s going to take those of us who aren’t used to showing up to events like that, to come out in number.”

Coulter said he was worried before driving to Broadview. “I certainly didn’t want to be tear gassed or struck with a baton or pushed to the ground like some of my colleagues have,” he said. But that did not deter him. “There was a chance that I would face arrest, but that’s not a reason to stay home. I really wanted to be here with all my heart.”

He plans to return. “I’m imagining extending invitations to my family, my friends, my parishioners. I’ll say: ‘If you want to be witness to this with me, we’ll drive down together.’ And I think it’d be good thing to do.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC1773-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 18:58:33.348267

One topic on the agenda concerns the deportation of migrants to centres in third countries.
Under its rules, refugees must apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.
However, he is also concerned about potential human rights violations, particularly regarding restrictions on movement in secondary facilities and return centres in third countries.
Italy, for instance, sought to host migrants in asylum centres in Albania, but the plan met legal resistance because the facilities were effectively detention centres.","A row erupted in Germany's Bundestag on Thursday over the new European asylum system CEAS.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt wants tougher measures to control illegal migration. One topic on the agenda concerns the deportation of migrants to centres in third countries.

""Balancing humanity and order,"" that is Dobrindt's guiding principle. In other words: not all burdens should fall on the shoulders of just one state, but they must be equally distributed across Europe.

Up to now, the Dublin Regulation was meant to ensure fair distribution. Under its rules, refugees must apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.

In practice, however, the system did not always function as intended. Deadlines have been missed, member states have not fully cooperated, and migrants bypassed the procedures altogether. The result has been secondary migration and an overburdened system.

Dobrindt: No right to a country of choice for the asylum procedure

There is a right to an asylum procedure, but no right to a country of choice for the asylum procedure in Europe, Dobrindt believes, proposing the deportation of migrants who have committed criminal offences to Afghanistan, as well as establishing secondary centres and return hubs in third countries.

""We are making concrete progress on this,"" Alexander Throm, the CDU/CSU's domestic policy spokesperson, said to Euronews.

In addition to repatriation centres, Throm is calling for the creation of new detention criteria to make deportations ""more feasible"".

""These are people who have come to Europe illegally and have no right to protection, no right to stay here,"" Throm said. ""They should be returned to their home country or, if this is not possible, to another safe third country.""

A 'great idea' but will it fail due to implementation?

AfD's Bernd Baumann considers the idea a fundamentally good one, but has questioned the SPD's ability to implement it

Speaking on repatriation centres, Baumann told Euronews that ""it's a great idea, and it comes from us. We've been doing it for years.""

""But anyone who wants to implement this cannot form a coalition with the SPD,"" Baumann said, adding that ""it won't work with the EU either.""

Baumann believes that implementation can only succeed with national policies.

""The CEAS is anything but effective, because anyone can continue to come in across European borders. Illegal migration would not be stopped, only redistributed because of the 'compulsory quotas',"" he told Euronews.

Can human rights be safeguarded?

Green Party MP Claudia Roth said the concept runs counter to the principle of asylum enshrined in Germany's constitution.

""This permanent reduction to criminalisation of people on the run is really wrong,"" Roth told Euronews.

Roth also emphasised Germany's historical responsibility, ""Nobody leaves their home country without a reason,"" she said.

Left Party MP Clara Bünger pointed out that third countries are not guaranteed to be safe.

""The new CEAS reform will ensure that hardly any people arriving in the EU, in Germany, will receive protection here,"" Bünger warned. ""In the future, the vast majority of people will be sent to detention centres and then shipped to third countries that are not safe.""

The Left Party MP expressed concerns regarding human rights ""Every human being has human rights, fundamental rights, and these are being taken away from them,"" she said, ""They are being moved, put into some kind of camp, and the procedures are being increasingly undermined, and the right to asylum is unrecognisable; it effectively no longer exists"".

Meanwhile, SPD remains divided.

""There are many points in the CEAS that point in the right direction, Hakan Demir, SPD MP, told Euronews. However, he is also concerned about potential human rights violations, particularly regarding restrictions on movement in secondary facilities and return centres in third countries.

In principle, repatriation centres are legally possible, says the SPD MEP. ""But whenever I ask: 'Name me a country that makes this possible now and where the legal conditions are right', I never get an answer,"" Demir said.

In fact, there have already been unsuccesful attempts in the past. Not because of the concept itself, but due to its surrounding conditions.

Italy, for instance, sought to host migrants in asylum centres in Albania, but the plan met legal resistance because the facilities were effectively detention centres. An Italian court later ruled the project as unlawful. However, granting freedom of movement in Albania would have allowed rejected asylum seekers to travel back to the EU via Serbia, rendering the plan ineffective.

The UK's attempt to deport migrants to Rwanda also failed. In this case too, it was not because of the idea of return centres itself. The original plan involved outsourcing asylum procedures directly to the third country, but British courts rejected this approach.

The Conservative Party then proposed handling asylum procedures within the UK instead, but the plan never materialized after Labour blocked it.

The Netherlands, however, has taken a more pragmatic path. The Dutch government recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Uganda to establish a return centre for rejected asylum seekers. Unlike detention facilities, this would serve as an accommodation centre. The pilot project is now moving toward final approval and legal clarification in the coming months.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/50/47/96/1200x675_cmsv2_27b8a229-b5d2-5636-a6bc-d856e5957e9d-9504796.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 15:57:15.164239

Mali said the US programme breaches a 2005 accord guaranteeing long-term visa access between the two nations, and vowed to apply the same financial barriers to US passport holders under the principle of reciprocity.

In a statement released by its Foreign Ministry, Mali said it “has always collaborated with the United States of America in the fight against irregular immigration, with respect for law and human dignity”.

The dispute highlights escalating tensions as the administration of US President Donald Trump deploys visa restrictions as diplomatic leverage to pressure African governments on immigration enforcement and deportation cooperation.

Mali is among seven African countries facing the bond requirements under a year-long pilot scheme that the US State Department says targets nations with high visa overstay rates.

Mauritania, Sao Tome and Principe, and Tanzania were also added to the programme alongside Mali in late October, while Gambia, Malawi and Zambia were added earlier.

Trump immigration moves

Travellers subject to the bonds must pay up front through a US Treasury Department portal, and can only enter and exit the US through three designated airports.

The money is refunded if visitors depart on time, but forfeited for overstays or asylum applications. Consular officers determine individual bond amounts based on applicants’ circumstances.

The US justified the pilot by citing national security concerns and US Department of Homeland Security data showing more than 300,000 business and tourist visa holders overstayed their authorised periods in 2023.

Critics warn the fees – imposed atop standard $185 visa costs – could deter legitimate travel and harm the US tourism economy ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Mali said it was interested in “fruitful cooperative relations”, but was introducing the measure against US citizens attempting to travel there in the spirit of reciprocity.

The visa bonds are the latest immigration measure following months of efforts by the Trump administration to pressure African nations into accepting deportees, including those not from their own countries.

Several governments have received expelled migrants in exchange for payments or political favours, while others faced swift punishment for refusal.

Burkina Faso had all visa services suspended at its US Embassy after rejecting demands to accept third-country deportees, forcing residents to travel to neighbouring Togo for applications.

South Sudan initially had visas for all passport holders revoked following a deportation dispute, though it later accepted eight people from Asian and Latin American countries.

She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.","The Trump administration has attempted to postpone at least nine challenges to its immigration policies during the government shutdown, including cases that could determine whether people can be held in detention centers without bail.

Federal judges have repeatedly said no.

In the detention-without-bail case, Judge Brianna Fuller Mircheff said that if the deportation apparatus is still running during the shutdown, an immigration-related challenge should continue too.

“Despite the government shutdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to remove noncitizens from the community; noncitizens continue to be detained under the policy that is challenged in this case; and immigration courts continue to process cases involving detained respondents,” the court’s order states.

“Given that individuals are continuing to be detained subject to the challenged policy, the Court declines to indefinitely stay adjudication of whether such individuals are lawfully detained,” it states.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the class action lawsuit in California against a July 8 policy change ending bond eligibility for people who have lived in the country for years but are in detention centers while their immigration cases continue.

It’s one of at least nine legal challenges to the Trump administration’s immigration policies that the Department of Justice has sought to pause during the shutdown, which is now in its second week with no progress toward an end.

Most judges are insisting on keeping their scheduled deadlines, pointing to continued immigration enforcement and urgency of the lawsuits, which also include challenges against the end of temporary deportation protections for Venezuelans, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s deportation and federal funding freezes for so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

Starting Oct. 1, the first day of the government shutdown, DOJ attorneys began approaching courts with requests to delay immigration-related proceedings as part of the department’s plan to limit civil litigation during the lapse in federal funding.

The DOJ shutdown contingency plan states that it will continue to deal with cases where the safety of human life or protection of property would be compromised significantly by a delay. It also states attorneys have to keep working if judges deny the department’s requests.

Some groups suing the government over immigration matters argue that there would be serious impacts to putting the cases on hold.

The case over whether the Department of Homeland Security can end temporary protected status for Venezuelans, for example, affects about 600,000 people directly and could have repercussions for others with these protections.

“It is important because it’s one of the only hopes with little possibility of continuing the protection for people with TPS,” said Jose Palma, a national coordinator for the National TPS Alliance, which is suing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over ending TPS for Venezuelans.

Palma said moving ahead with the legal challenge is particularly vital in light of a recent Supreme Court decision that allows the government to cut off deportation protections and work authorization for Venezuelans while the ultimate fate of TPS for the population is determined in lower courts.

The case is set to move forward in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel denied the federal government’s request to pause the case because of the government shutdown. However, a federal judge agreed to pause a similar case out of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts until the end of the shutdown.

Despite DOJ’s efforts to pause proceedings in the lawsuit seeking to stop the second deportation of Abrego Garcia, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland is requiring the DOJ to bring to a Friday hearing witnesses with first-hand knowledge of the steps the government has taken to deport him to Eswatini, Costa Rica or any other country.

During a hearing on Monday, Xinis lost her patience with the government attorneys’ inability to provide information about the administration’s plan to once again deport Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.

DOJ also failed to secure an indefinite pause in the lawsuit filed in February by several cities and counties over the Trump administration’s attempts to withhold funding for “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Santa Clara and San Francisco, along with multiple other counties and cities, have been granted preliminary injunctions by District Judge William Orrick twice, as the lawsuit has grown to include other counties, most recently at the end of August.

Following the most recent ruling, the Trump administration’s attorneys had a deadline of Oct. 16 by which they could respond, but on Oct. 1, they filed for a motion to stay, similarly citing the government shutdown as the reason for the need for an extended deadline.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the federal defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” the DOJ motion states.

Attorneys representing Santa Clara cited the DOJ’s own contingency plan in response, noting “the Department’s (contingency) plan assumes that the judicial branch will continue to operate, though possibly at a reduced level, through the lapse.”

Orrick promptly denied the motion to stay, and the administration has until the original deadline to reply to the ruling.

The judge’s motion “helps ensure that accountability doesn’t stop when it’s inconvenient for those in power,” said Jonathan Miller, the chief programs officer at Public Rights Project, which is representing some of the cities in the lawsuit.

“The federal government can’t use a shutdown as an excuse to halt oversight while continuing to pursue the policies we’re challenging,” he said.

Operation Dudula has since denied the allegations, stating that none of its members were at the clinic on that day, News24 reported.
Several organisations have had Operation Dudula in their crosshairs even before the group’s latest target campaign.","The South African Human Rights Commission’s legal bid to protect the healthcare rights of migrants has failed, as Operation Dudula has expanded the reach of its anti-migrant campaign, now targeting the right to education.

The latest legal bid to stop anti-migrant groups from violating the rights of migrants has failed after the KwaZulu-Natal Division of the High Court in Durban ruled against the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) on Friday, 10 October.

Since June this year, the anti-migrant group turned political party, Operation Dudula, and NGO March and March have focused attention on blocking migrants from accessing healthcare at public hospitals and clinics across Gauteng and pockets of KwaZulu-Natal.

This targeted campaign has continued for months, even though it violates Section 27 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to access healthcare regardless of immigration status or nationality.

On Friday, the SAHRC turned to the Durban high court to interdict Operation Dudula and March and March from refusing migrants access to medical care outside hospitals and clinics in Durban.

The ministers of police, home affairs, health and the MEC for health in KwaZulu-Natal were added as respondents in the urgent application for failing to fulfil their constitutional obligations to protect the healthcare rights of migrants.

According to the SAHRC, the addition of the government officials came after multiple engagements over the disruptions, with both the Department of Health and the office of the National Commissioner of Police, failed to result in tangible action.

“These state organs, through their engagements with the SAHRC and in the media, indicated that steps would be taken to prevent the denial of access to public healthcare facilities by vigilante groups and individuals. The conduct of Operation Dudula and March and March continues unabated, and no steps appear to be taken to assist the affected patients seeking medical services,” the commission said.

However, Acting Judge David Saks struck the SAHRC’s urgent application from the roll, stating that it was not urgent enough to give the respondents only two days to respond to the 260-page founding affidavit, as they were notified only on Monday, 6 October, three days before the application was set to be heard.

In its founding affidavit, the SAHRC detailed how the commission and several people, including South African citizens, permanent residents and asylum seekers, were denied access to Addington Hospital in July.

Commissioner Chris Nissen said the hospital’s security personnel were increasingly refusing to intervene and allegedly ignoring the actions of March and March and Operation Dudula at the medical facility’s gates.

Advocate Vishalan Naidoo, representing the ministers and KZN health MEC, argued that the incidents outlined in the answering affidavit happened in July, and the SAHRC did not provide evidence of recent incidents, which meant there was no urgency regarding the application.

However, several civil society organisations have reported that the disruptions continue. This was echoed by the SAHRC’s legal representative, advocate Muhammad Zakaria Suleman, who told the court that incidents had been ongoing since July.

Acting Judge Saks agreed with the respondents and struck the urgent application off the roll, with costs.

Dudula sets sights on schools

While another legal bid to interdict the violation of migrant rights has faltered, Operation Dudula, which has set its sights on contesting the local government elections next year, is expanding its focus to public schools with an announcement that it would bar the children of migrants from accessing education when the new academic year starts in 2026.

Dudula’s announcement was more than just empty words. On 22 September, the group took to the streets of Soweto, Johannesburg, to call for the schools to “put South Africans first” and deny migrant children placement.

The organisation claims that migrant children take school placements from South African children, and says that this compounds overcrowding in the South African school system. The group has not provided evidence to support this claim.

EWN reported that Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona met Operation Dudula during the disruptions in Soweto and told the group that schools were not immigration centres and their only role was to provide education.

“We have a constitutional obligation to make sure that we teach all children. Constitutionally, all children of school-going age must be at school. Now it’s even worse – there is an introduction of (mandatory) Grade R and law dictates that those children must be taught,” Mabona said.

Dudula’s disruption of schools and the group’s plans also evoked the ire of Basic Education Minister Siviwe Gwarube, who said Operation Dudula would face the full might of the law if it disrupted schools.

According to the Department of Basic Education, Gwarube had met the Acting Minister of Police and requested that the joint operations structures between the Department of Basic Education, the South African Police Service (SAPS) and Provincial Education Departments be activated to monitor and manage these disruptions.

Strong statements have been issued condemning the group’s actions. The government has been criticised for not taking tangible action to protect the rights of migrants.

Daily Maverick sent questions to both SAPS in Gauteng and the Gauteng DBE to find out how the departments planned to stop Dudula’s continued disruptions.

The questions included:

What steps are being taken to address these disruptions and protect the rights of those affected?

What are the plans to prevent future disruptions and ensure that all residents—regardless of nationality or legal status—can safely access healthcare and education?

Responding to the questions, Gauteng SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo said:

“The South African Police Service in Gauteng, Johannesburg Metro Police, as well as Gauteng traffic wardens, deploy officials to restore calm and maintain law and order at health facilities where protests have been reported. These deployments are as and when needed.”

Masondo said officials were not passive at the affected health facilities. Gauteng law enforcement agencies worked closely with the departments of health and education to prevent, combat and investigate crimes affecting them.

Daily Maverick had not received a response from the Department of Basic Education by the time of publication.

EFF, NGOs step in

In the meantime, several non-government entities have taken it upon themselves to protect the interests of targeted migrant groups by taking action in the courts.

In September, the Economic Freedom Fighters filed a murder case against Operation Dudula. This followed the death of a one-year-old Malawian child in July, after Operation Dudula allegedly barred the baby and mother from accessing medical care at the Alexandra Community Health Centre in Johannesburg.

Operation Dudula has since denied the allegations, stating that none of its members were at the clinic on that day, News24 reported.

Several organisations have had Operation Dudula in their crosshairs even before the group’s latest target campaign.

In June, Daily Maverick reported on migrant rights group Kopanang Africa Against Xenophobia (KAAX), the South African Informal Traders Forum, the Inner City Federation, and Abahlali baseMjondolo’s legal bid to have the Gauteng Division of the High Court in Johannesburg interdict Operation Dudula from assaulting, harassing or intimidating migrants and to stop Operation Dudula from impeding access by the children of migrants to healthcare services and schools.

The Department of Home Affairs and the SAPS were added as respondents to the application for what the civil society organisations called “state-enabled xenophobia”. Home Affairs and the SAPS were accused of collusion for failing to protect migrant communities from Operation Dudula’s targeted harassment and assault since the political party’s inception in 2021.

Judgment was reserved on 11 June, and not much has been heard since.

Speaking to Daily Maverick on behalf of KAAX, Dale McKinley said that Operation Dudula’s continued harassment of migrants indicated its disregard for the rule of law. “They are thumbing their nose at our law, at any kind of judicial oversight,” he said.

“The reason we took the legal case was precisely to prevent these kinds of things – so that we could get a court injunction and interdict to prevent Operation Dudula from harassing … violating other international migrant rights. Yet they’re doubling down and continue to do this,” McKinley said.",https://i0.wp.com/www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Lerato-OperationDudula-Accountability-copy-scaled.jpg?fit=1280%2C640&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-12 14:57:05.484327

The measure, signed into law this past week by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, comes on the heels of other recently enacted state laws meant to shield students in schools and patients at health care facilities from the reach of President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement actions.

Democratic-led states are adding laws resisting Trump even as he intensifies his deportation campaign by seeking to deploy National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities to reinforce U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are arresting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally.

By contrast, some Republican-led states are requiring local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE agents.

“The actions of the states really reflect the polarization of the country on this issue,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports immigration restrictions. “We have seen some states move to cooperate to the greatest extent that they possibly can” with Trump’s administration and others “doing what they can to try to thwart immigration enforcement in their state.”

Across the U.S, state lawmakers this year have passed more than 100 bills relating to immigration, according to an Associated Press analysis aided by the bill tracking software Plural. The measures are divided almost evenly between those providing and denying protections to immigrants.

California is shielding immigrant information

Immigrants comprise a significant portion of California's urban sidewalk vendors. Some have been swept up in immigration enforcement actions, in part, because their outdoor work in public places makes them easier targets than people behind closed doors.

California's street vendors typically need permits from cities or counties. The new law prohibits local governments from inquiring about vendors' immigration status, requiring fingerprinting or disclosing personal information — name, address, birth date, social media identifiers and telephone, driver's license and Social Security numbers, among other things — without a judicial subpoena.

The law, which will take effect Jan. 1, was prompted by concerns that vendor databases kept by local governments could be accessed by federal immigration agents to target people for detention and deportation.

“We’re talking about really security –- security for businesses, security for human beings, security for people who have gone through so much,"" said Sergio Jimenez, a street vending organizer with the nonprofit Community Power Collective in Los Angeles.

Additional laws recently signed by Newsom add immigration status to a list of protected medical information and prohibit schools from granting access to immigration enforcement officials without a court warrant. Another new California law directs schools and higher education institutions to immediately notify staff and students or parents when immigration officials are on campus.

Democratic states create safe places for immigrants

Upon taking office, Trump reversed a policy restricting federal immigration agents from arresting people at sensitive locations such as schools, churches and hospitals. Like California, other Democratic-led states responded with laws attempting to create safe places for immigrants.

A Maryland law enacted earlier this year requires public schools, libraries and health care facilities to restrict access for immigration enforcement officials unless presented with a court warrant. Nevada's Republican governor vetoed a similar measure for schools that had been passed by the Democratic-led Legislature.

Meanwhile, a new Colorado law allows civil penalties of up to $50,000 for public child care centers, schools, colleges, health care facilities and libraries that collect information about people’s immigration status, with some exceptions. New laws in Rhode Island prohibit health care providers and landlords from inquiring about people's immigration status. Oregon also enacted a similar law for landlords.

States split on aiding federal immigration agents

By contrast, Republican-led states have passed numerous laws intended to bolster Trump’s immigration policies.

New laws in Texas, Florida and Arkansas require sheriffs who run jails to enter into federal agreements for their officers to be trained to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. State and local participation in the federal 287(g) immigration enforcement program — named after the section of law that created it — has exploded from 135 agreements in 21 states before Trump took office in January to more than 1,000 agreements presently in place in 40 states.

But some Democratic-led states have refused to take part. A new Delaware law prohibits participation in the program, similar to statutes already in place in California and Illinois. Democratic-led Vermont also tightened its restrictions on participating in federal immigration enforcement programs, repealing an exemption that had allow it during emergencies.

A Connecticut law that took effect in October allows people to sue local governments that cooperate with federal immigration authorities in violation of the state’s “Trust Act.”

Public benefits are a point of contention

In Washington, new state laws allow workers to take paid leave to attend immigration proceedings for themselves or family members and prohibit employers from using immigration status to coerce their employees.

But some Republican-led states have enacted laws limiting benefits for people in the country illegally.

A new Idaho law prohibits immigrants without legal status from receiving some publicly funded health benefits, including vaccinations, crisis counseling and prenatal and postnatal care for women. A new Louisiana law requires applicants for public benefits to be screened for legal immigration status and, if lacking it, reported to federal immigration authorities

Several Republican-led states — including Florida, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Wyoming — have adopted laws invalidating certain driver’s licenses issued to immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

College tuition discounts are diminishing

Entering into this year, nearly half the states provided in-state tuition to public colleges and universities for residents living in the U.S. illegally. But that number has dwindled since Trump took office and the U.S. Department of Justice began suing states. The federal lawsuits assert states are violating the Constitution by providing in-state tuition for people without legal status while not offering the same benefit to out-of-state U.S. citizens.

Florida repealed its decade-old law allowing in-state tuition for students lacking legal status, effective July 1. Republican-led Texas and Oklahoma both ended similar tuition policies after getting sued by the Justice Department. Kentucky, which has a Democratic governor, also has taken steps to halt its policy after getting sued.

California lawmakers attempted to enhance tuition benefits for immigrants with a first-of-its kind measure allowing community college students who get deported or voluntarily leave the U.S. to continue receiving in-state tuition while taking online courses from afar. But Newsom vetoed the measure earlier this month, citing “significant constitutional concerns” that the tuition break was offered only to students who left the country and not also to residents of other U.S. states.

A bill passed by New Mexico's Democratic-led Legislature this year would have expanded in-state tuition breaks to immigrants who earned income in New Mexico during the previous two years or who attended at least two semesters of adult education courses. But Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham let the bill die without her signature.",https://images.wral.com/bcd78a81-bb10-54f1-ad41-f2ec0be91e14?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-10-12 16:56:43.603353

The shutdown came as Democrats were looking to regain their footing with voters, who re-elected Trump last year and relegated them to the minority in both chambers of Congress.
An estimated 750,000 federal employees have also been furloughed.
As the Hill reported, however, federal workers are generally paid once a shutdown ends, whether they are furloughed or working.
After the last shutdown in 2018, Congress wrote into law that federal workers must be paid once the government reopens.","Donald Trump claimed on Saturday that he had found a way to pay US military troops despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, saying he had instructed his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, to release funds.

Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “I am using my authority, as commander-in-chief, to direct our secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our troops PAID on October 15.”

Trump said he had identified the funds to make the payments happen, adding: “I will not allow the Democrats to hold our military, and the entire security of our nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous government shutdown. The radical left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.”

The recent federal government shutdown began on 1 October and is the first since a 35-day closure that happened in December 2018 and extended into the new year during Trump’s first presidential term. The shutdown came as Democrats were looking to regain their footing with voters, who re-elected Trump last year and relegated them to the minority in both chambers of Congress.

More than 1.3 million military personnel across the country would not have received their first post-shutdown paychecks this month, only getting paid for the 21-30 September period. An estimated 750,000 federal employees have also been furloughed.

As the Hill reported, however, federal workers are generally paid once a shutdown ends, whether they are furloughed or working. After the last shutdown in 2018, Congress wrote into law that federal workers must be paid once the government reopens.

On Thursday, the US Senate remained deadlocked on legislation to end the shutdown, even as Trump repeated his threat to make Democrats pay for the funding lapse that has closed federal agencies and furloughed employees across the nation.

Speaking to Punchbowl News, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, expressed confidence in the strategy, saying: “Every day gets better for us.”

The White House announced the layoffs of federal workers on Friday, following through with a threat it made to initiate the mass firings of government employees.

A document filed with a federal court on Friday evening revealed that hundreds of layoffs took place across the executive branch, including about 315 at the Department of Commerce, 466 at the Department of Education and 187 at the Department of Energy.

Union leaders warned the layoffs would have “devastating effects” on services relied upon by millions of Americans, and pledged to challenge the moves in court.

“It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which represents 800,000 federal and DC government workers.

After Russell Vought, the director of the White House office of management and budget, wrote on social media that “RIFs have begun”, referring to the government’s reduction-in-force procedure to let employees go, the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, responded, saying: “America’s unions will see you in court.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee44816f3936ce5e6f2f15fcd261554e2048c339/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54f4a4ff3250c65c182c24c643e51c21",N,,2025-10-12 13:57:10.605767

Good Sunday afternoon. I’m Ali Bianco, taking the lead today. As always, inbox is open.

INSIDE TRUMP’S WAR ON DRUGS: POLITICO’s Nahal Toosi pens her latest Compass column, digging into President Donald Trump’s war on drugs that has another target in mind: “The first time President Donald Trump tried to push Nicolas Maduro out of power, he wasn’t coy about it. He accused the Venezuelan dictator of stealing an election, stripped U.S. recognition from Maduro’s government, imposed sanctions on Caracas and rallied other countries to pressure Maduro to quit. It didn’t work.

“In his second term, Trump is targeting Maduro differently, and his message is, uncharacteristically for Trump, less direct. Even though Trump continues to say Maduro is an illegitimate leader, he has said ‘we’re not talking about’ regime change in Caracas. Instead, he’s emphasizing the long-standing accusations that the strongman is a drug lord and a dangerous criminal. The plan, people familiar with the situation tell me, is to force Maduro out as part of Trump’s ongoing fight against drug cartels.”

DRIVING THE DAY

THE CRACKDOWN CONTINUED: A federal appeals court temporarily lifted the block on Trump’s federalization of National Guard troops in Chicago yesterday, but stopped short of green-lighting their deployment in the city, POLITICO’s Gregory Svirnovskiy and Josh Gerstein report. In Portland, where troops are also waiting in the wings, an appeals court appears primed to soon let the deployment move forward.

The two cases mark the latest in a series of whiplash-inducing legal battles over Trump’s mass immigration crackdown and efforts to deal with crime in cities led by Democratic mayors — which has at times been brushed back at the lower levels before receiving friendlier rulings from the Supreme Court. But it’s also part of a larger aggressive escalation of interior enforcement that has become the marquee agenda item of Trump’s second term.

A raft of favorable Supreme Court emergency decisions this year — stripping protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants with temporary protections, among them — has given Trump space to increasingly test the reach of his executive authority to enact what he promised to be the largest mass deportation in history.

The view from the White House: “The administration is confident that our actions will be upheld as lawful, because at the end of the day, they are lawful,” one White House official granted anonymity to speak candidly told Playbook. “You know, if it has to go to a higher court, it has to go to a higher court.”

The military deployments to Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland have been reactive to protests, the official said. Trump has also floated sending troops to other major cities in the future, which the official did not rule out. “Obviously you’ve seen the president wants to and won’t hesitate to protect federal law enforcement officers,” they added.

That confidence extends to Trump’s allies outside the White House. “Even these recent court rulings that you might characterize as setbacks, they’re going to get overturned,” Ken Cuccinelli, who served as DHS deputy secretary during the first Trump administration, told Playbook. “No other president has done this in our adult lifetimes in terms of how they implement immigration policy.”

The National Guard deployment, multiple immigration lawyers and experts told Playbook, is no exception and is poised to be one of the biggest tests of his power.

“He’s winning,” Mark Krikorian, director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, told Playbook. “He’s not going to win every case, I don’t think, but he’s winning a lot of them, because the immigration law is designed that way.”

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council agreed that the office of the president provides Trump with “an enormous amount of hidden weapons,” which he’s deploying at a scale unseen before. But he also said the resistance to Trump’s immigration agenda isn’t causing the administration to consider pumping the brakes. “It’s causing them to step on the gas pedal,” Reichlin-Melnick said.

Rise of the resistance: Still, Democratic leaders from Chicago and Portland aren’t backing down from the fight. “I am not afraid. Do I think that he could do it? He might,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said this morning on ABC’s “This Week” when asked whether he worried about Trump potentially coming after him, given the president’s Truth Social post saying he should be jailed. “But as I’ve said before, come and get me.” Oregon AG Dan Rayfield said Trump’s moves amount to an abuse of power in an interview with Playbook’s own Dasha Burns for “The Conversation” this week.

Where this is headed: Any of Trump’s most controversial moves that land on the Supreme Court’s desk will be meeting a different reality than the first few months. Trump began his second administration in the middle of the high court’s last term, and gained significant deference through so-called “shadow docket” decisions. With the new term just kicking off, there’s more time for the court to chew on cases.

“Trump’s been fortunate to do a lot of the stuff that he got away with during the shadow docket time. I’m not so sure that will continue happening when the Supreme Court has to sit there every week and hear arguments,” immigration lawyer Charles Kuck told Playbook.

But Trump has the time to duke this out in court — and the impact could be far-reaching. “The legal piece will gradually fall away. That may take a little while, like a year and a half, but Trump has started very early in his term,” Cuccinelli said. “There’s plenty of time to legally see these through and to permanently eliminate questions on the legal front, all while employing this relatively new tactic.”

Democrats are still holding out hope that the rule of law will keep Trump in check. “Look, we’ve got to rely on the courts to do the right thing. I realize that sometimes that’s risky business, especially when some have been appointed by Donald Trump,” Pritzker said on ABC this morning. “But we’ve seen that even a Trump-appointed judge out in California, on the West Coast, has ruled against the administration.”

But Trump has found ways to work around court orders slowing his immigration crackdown in the past. Even while the temporary blocks on troop deployments are in place, Trump’s end goal won’t be stymied, said David Bier, immigration director at the libertarian Cato Institute.

“They say you can’t do a National Guard deployment, well, is there some other way to get the military involved?” Bier told Playbook. “There’s a million different ways in which you can kind of get to the same outcome under different rubrics. … We haven’t even seen the half of it yet.”

— House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on negotiating with Republicans, on “Fox News Sunday”: “This should be a bipartisan negotiation. … My friends on the other side of the aisle, they seem to believe that health care is an extraneous issue. … It’s a central issue.

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. MIDDLE EAST LATEST: Trump will head to Tel Aviv at 3:30 p.m. today, arriving in the Middle East at a tense moment as the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel seems to be holding, but is pending the hostage release and prisoner swap that marks the first phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan to end the two-year war, AP’s Aamer Madhani and colleagues write. Hamas told Israel that it has 20 living hostages in hand and is ready to release them as early as today, WSJ’s Summer Said and colleagues scooped. They will be exchanged for about 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, per NYT’s Isabel Kershner.

How it’s playing: Thousands of people have been returning to Gaza City as the fragile ceasefire takes effect, but the area has been ravaged by war and many are returning to find their homes and former lives are gone, NYT’s Liam Stack and Bilal Shbair report. But the families of Palestinian prisoners said they feel “rare happiness” at the imminent exchange, NYT’s Fatima AbdulKarim writes from the West Bank. Preparations are also underway for an influx of critical humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, per AP.

Order of operations: Trump arrives in Tel Aviv at 2:20 a.m. Eastern time Monday morning, where he will meet with hostage families and deliver remarks to The Knesset around 4 a.m. Eastern. He will then fly to Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for a Middle East peace ceremony at 7:30 a.m. Eastern. He will depart Egypt to return to the White House at 10 a.m. Eastern.

For your radar: Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the phone yesterday, per CBS. “If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well - including the Russian war,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X recounting the call.

2. SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN: Trump said yesterday he directed the Pentagon to pay U.S. military troops despite the government shutdown, heading off the prospect of troops missing their paychecks this Wednesday, POLITICO’s Ben Johansen and Jennifer Scholtes report. The Pentagon is redirecting about $8 billion from their research and development accounts to pay the troops. “I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Cutting deep: After reduction-in-workforce orders were sent Friday kicking off mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies, a number of employees at HHS who were initially tabbed to be laid off are now being rehired, POLITICO’s Sophie Gardner reports. Sources said an unspecified number of CDC employees were mistakenly fired through a “coding error.”

Where things stand: The Senate remains at an impasse on how to proceed. WSJ’s Lindsay Wise writes “even the ‘Groundhog Day’ jokes are getting old now.” House Democrats will be on the Hill Tuesday for an in-person caucus meeting — but the House remains out and is nearing a month without any votes.

The impact: WaPo’s Jacob Bogage and Hannah Natanson break down how the shutdown has already caused flight delays, closed helplines at the IRS, shut off national parks and more — but the effects will only get worse as missed paychecks could cause a consumer spending dip.

3. WEAPONIZATION WATCH: Federal prosecutors met yesterday to square the details of a potential indictment against former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, CNN’s Katelyn Polantz reports. Bolton is under investigation in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland, and prosecutors there initially pushed back on the investigation against the desires of DOJ leadership, requesting more time to prepare a case by the end of the year. But the office is now discussing potential charges, and whether to subject Bolton to a “perp walk” or otherwise public arrest.

Trump vs. James: Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s U.S. attorney in Virginia, faced intense backlash after charging former FBI Director James Comey, but it didn’t deter her from presenting charges against New York AG Letitia James days later, WSJ’s Sadie Gurman and Meridith McGraw write. Halligan “wanted to just get it done,” and will likely bring more charges against James.

On the charges: “In the Eye of a Political Storm, a Tiny Yellow House in Norfolk, Va,” by NYT’s Jonah Bromwich and colleagues: “Attorney General Letitia James of New York purchased the $137,000 home for a grandniece who needed tranquillity. Prosecutors say it is an impermissible investment property.”

4. IMMIGRATION FILES: “Trump administration says immigration enforcement threatens higher food prices,” by WaPo’s Lauren Kaori Gurley: “The Labor Department warned in an obscure document filed with the Federal Register last week that ‘the near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens’ is threatening ‘the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S. consumers.’ … The Labor Department’s comments appear to be the first time that the Trump administration has publicly acknowledged that its hallmark immigration policy — sealing the border and deporting undocumented immigrants — threatens labor shortages and higher food prices.”

5. SCOTUS WATCH: The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Wednesday on a landmark case that could erode what remains of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, NYT’s Abbie VanSickle writes. The case centers around 12 Louisiana voters who challenged the state’s district map, saying that they had been discriminated against as white voters, because state lawmakers took race into account when the map was drawn in 2020. Though figures from such high-profile cases can sometimes become publicly known names, the identities of the 12 voters in this case have largely remained hidden.

6. CALIFORNIA SCREAMIN’: The viral videos depicting California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter derailing an interview and berating staffers are driving momentum for strategists trying to coax other candidates like Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) into the race, NYT’s Laurel Rosenhall and Benjamin Oreskes report. “The videos offered fresh evidence of fears expressed behind closed doors by power brokers in Sacramento, San Francisco and Los Angeles: Can a politician who appears so volatile run the state of California?” One political consultant told the NYT that Porter’s record of staff turnover “is the worst kept nonsecret in California politics.”

ANATOMY OF AN ENDORSEMENT: Florida AG James Uthmeier was endorsed by Trump to run again next year, a move that initially jolted Florida Republicans but stemmed from Uthmeier’s work on “Alligator Alcatraz” and securing the land for Trump’s presidential library, POLITICO’s Gary Fineout and Kimberly Leonard break down this morning. “The president’s endorsement lowers the possibility of a contentious Republican primary next year and lessens the chance of a full-blown Trump-DeSantis proxy war across the ballot.”

8. DANCE OF THE SUPERPOWERS: China hit back today at Trump’s threat of a potential 100 percent tariff on its products. “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one,” China’s Commerce Ministry said, per AP’s Ken Moritsugu. Trump threatened to ramp up import costs by Nov. 1 — and a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping is on the rocks after Trump cast doubt on whether it would be productive. “If the U.S. side obstinately insists on its practice, China will be sure to resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the Commerce Ministry post said.

The bigger picture: POLITICO’s Megan Messerly and Phelim Kine write that the tit-for-tat actions on tariffs this week is “the sharpest escalation in tensions between Washington and Beijing since the two countries slapped triple-digit tariffs on each other this spring and threatens to derail months of quiet efforts to stabilize the relationship” and it “raises fresh doubts about whether Trump, operating with a hollowed-out national security team and a fragmented China strategy, is prepared for Beijing’s latest power play.”

9. THE MAHA AGENDA: The massive backlash to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s calls for pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol is bringing out a bigger problem — most drugs don’t have enough data on their safety during pregnancy, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports. State abortion bans are worsening existing barriers to women’s health, including drug trials and other studies, as the legal repercussions loom over scientists. Much of the “gold-standard science” lauded by the administration has become more difficult to test on pregnant women and throwing a wrench in the greater mission to do safety testing.

TALK OF THE TOWN

IN MEMORIAM — “Bart Barnes, a Washington Post journalist for five decades, dies at 87,” by WaPo’s Harrison Smith: “Reflexively self-deprecating, [Bart] Barnes was 87 when he died Oct. 5 at his home in Washington. As a Post reporter, he had covered a little bit of everything: Local news, politics and sports (including an NFL players’ strike), along with cops and courts. … But he found an enduring home on the paper’s obituaries desk, where he wrote thousands of stories about the famous, the infamous and the hardly known.”

Immigration officers deployed tear gas and fired pepper balls to disperse protesters. Schools emailed parents in the middle of the day with warnings: Immigration agents might be nearby.

These scenes from the Chicago area in recent days looked far different from what residents were seeing along city streets about a month ago, when the Trump administration announced the start of a crackdown on illegal immigration in Chicago and its suburbs.

What began with a slow uptick in arrests has escalated rapidly. One unauthorized immigrant was fatally shot. American citizens have been detained along with undocumented immigrants. Border Patrol agents have walked in groups through downtown Chicago. Residents have given chase to federal agents’ vehicles. And chemical agents have been used on protesters, journalists and clergy members.

By this week, tensions were high, and many Chicagoans said they sensed a city on edge.

The New York Times reviewed more than 100 videos taken in the Chicago area over the past month, chronicling the actions of federal agents and the response by the public. Videos captured protests, raids, arrests on city streets and residents’ confrontational responses. Together, the videos show how tensions have risen, unfolding in charged and adversarial scenes in locations scattered around the city.

Federal authorities originally told local officials that they expected the operation to last 45 days. There now appears to be no end in sight.

Sept. 5-11

A Slow Ramp Up

From the beginning, residents in heavily Latino neighborhoods in the city were wary of the promised escalation by immigration authorities. But in a city of 2.7 million spread out across more than 200 square miles, other residents seemed unconcerned or unaware, with few early signs of a crackdown visible along their streets.

Some residents began sharing information on social media about possible sightings of immigration authorities in the city and in far-flung suburbs, warning one another to stay alert. Other residents applauded the actions of federal agents, saying that they supported efforts to more strictly enforce immigration law.

Thousands marched downtown in an energetic protest, chanting and beating drums while denouncing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and shouting support for other causes, including the plight of Gazans in the Middle East.

Immigration arrests by federal agents were nothing new in Chicago. And small, regularly scheduled protests and prayer groups had been held outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, a suburb about 30 minutes from downtown, for years. But this felt different. Federal authorities boarded up windows and doors of the ICE facility, and more and more protesters began gathering outside on some evenings.

Celebrations for Mexican Independence Day mostly carried on. But tensions flared. On the Southwest Side, a street vendor who was known for the flowers he sold outside a car dealership was arrested by federal agents. He was later deported to Mexico.

A video of his arrest spread on social media, angering community members. For days, neighbors left flowers and candles on the sidewalk where he had worked.

On Sept. 8, the Department of Homeland Security officially announced the start of Operation Midway Blitz, targeting “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago.” Sightings of immigration arrests began to multiply.

Sept. 12-28

A Shooting Alarms the City

On the morning of Sept. 12, two immigration officers pulled over a man driving a silver Subaru on a busy street in a Chicago suburb shortly after he had dropped off his children at an elementary school and day care. When the driver attempted to pull away, an agent shot him in the neck. Officials said that the man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a Mexican national who federal officials said was not authorized to live in the United States, had attempted to hit the officers with his car. He did not survive.

Last weekend, tensions escalated further.

Outside the ICE facility in Broadview, federal agents threw smoke bombs at a large group of protesters, tackling and slamming others to the ground. Protesters heckled agents about their roles in carrying out President Trump’s deportation efforts, calling out questions to the agents like “What are you going to tell your children?”

In footage shared with The Times, federal agents shouted at a group of protesters to move. “You’re getting ready to get it,” Mr. Bovino told the crowd, threatening them with arrest, while members were yelling at the agents. Mr. Bovino grabbed a man and tackled him to the ground with the help of another agent.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/us/politics/Cover_top-art_Chicago01/Cover_top-art_Chicago01-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 12:57:14.371869

“We don’t need another detention center here.” About 30 miles northeast of Denver, Hudson’s once-privately run prison has been shuttered for more than a decade.
In August, members of Colorado’s congressional delegation were told that the Hudson facility was going to reopen for that purpose.
But it’s unclear when exactly the facility will reopen or if ICE is still planning to do so at all.
(Geo also operates the Aurora contract facility, ICE’s only detention center in the state.)","HUDSON — More than 70 people protested Saturday against plans to open a new immigrant detention center near a rural community north of Denver, with organizers calling on state and local leaders to stop the facility from reopening.

Carrying signs that likened immigrant detention facilities to concentration camps, protesters organized mass phone calls to Gov. Jared Polis’ office and to elected officials in Hudson, urging them to oppose the reopening of the Hudson Correctional Facility. They chanted and voiced broader opposition to the mass arrest-and-deportation program undertaken by the Trump administration, the scale of which prompted federal officials this year to seek new detention options in Colorado.

Jessica Hernandez and her sister Michelle, both of Greeley, held a sign for their father, who they said was a military veteran deported in 2005. He still lives in Juarez, Mexico, they said. As protesters chanted and spoke into a microphone, tuba player Yehuda Serotta punctuated sentences and chants with the horn slung across his body.

“Excuse my language, it’s [expletive],” Michelle M., who provided only her last initial because of concerns about her job, said of the plans to reopen the Hudson prison. “We don’t need another detention center here.”

About 30 miles northeast of Denver, Hudson’s once-privately run prison has been shuttered for more than a decade. But documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union indicated that its owners had offered the prison to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as a potential new detention center. In August, members of Colorado’s congressional delegation were told that the Hudson facility was going to reopen for that purpose.

Shortly after, the Washington Post reported that Hudson was one of three new detention facilities that ICE officials were targeting in the state, based on leaked agency documents.

Hudson’s city manager, Bryce Lange, and Mayor Joe Hammock did not return messages seeking comment this month. When The Denver Post reported in August that the Hudson facility was apparently set to reopen as a detention center, Lange said the town had not been informed of the plans. In July, Hammock told Denver 7 that he considered the prison reopening to be like any other new business coming to town and that he would support it.

In a statement Saturday, Polis spokeswoman Shelby Wieman said the governor’s office has “not heard any communications directly from the administration about potential facilities or ICE operations in Colorado.” She noted that the Hudson prison was not a state facility and was not on state-owned land, suggesting the decision to reopen the prison was up to private companies and a federal agency.

“Gov. Polis has repeatedly called for the Trump administration to be transparent about their operations in Colorado and has not received that courtesy,” Wieman wrote.

When it was last open, the Hudson Correctional Facility had a capacity of 1,250 beds. If it opens and is filled to that same capacity, the detention center’s population would nearly rival that of Hudson, which is home to more than 1,600 residents.

The protest was organized by Jenifer Montes of the Immigrant Partnership Team of Greeley and Weld County, and it spread on social media. Shelby Mendoza drove from the nearby town of Keenesburg after hearing about the protest on TikTok. She said she felt sick when she learned that ICE was planning to reopen the prison.

“My son goes to school down Highway 52,” she said as a light rain fell. “It makes me sick knowing that he is going to school in a town — or in between a town — that has a concentration camp.”

According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, ICE officials were planning to rechristen the former Hudson Correctional Facility as the “Big Horn Detention Facility.” The newspaper reported that it was set to be opened before the end of year.

But it’s unclear when exactly the facility will reopen or if ICE is still planning to do so at all. Highlands REIT, the Chicago-based real estate investment trust that owns the prison and offered it as a detention center, did not return a message seeking comment.

Geo Group, the private prison company that previously operated the prison, also did not return a message seeking updates on the facility. (Geo also operates the Aurora contract facility, ICE’s only detention center in the state.)

Geo has not publicly disclosed any contracts with ICE to open or operate the facility, and no such contracts have been released on federal spending databases. In July, congressional Republicans’ tax-and-spend bill provided tens of billions of dollars in new funding to ICE, including $45 billion for detention.

Some of that money appears to now be moving: CoreCivic, another private prison company, recently announced new ICE contracts to operate detention facilities in California, Oklahoma and Kansas. Geo has also extended its contract for the Aurora facility and increased the detention capacity there, federal contracting records show.

Lucie Donovan, a 25-year-old teacher who attended and spoke at the protest Saturday, said her husband has been detained in the Aurora detention center for the past eight months. The two married last month. Donovan said they signed the marriage license separately because they couldn’t do it together.

With the help of a lawyer, she’s working to get him released from the Aurora facility.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit ruled that members of the National Guard in Illinois right now can remain federalized, but they can not be deployed in the state.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” they added.

The move came after the Trump administration appealed an earlier decision by a federal judge to temporarily block the deployment of National Guard troops in the state.

In response to Saturday's ruling, a White House spokesperson indicated that a further appeal was coming.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,"" Abigail Jackson said in a statement. ""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Representatives for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

Hundreds of National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas had originally deployed to Illinois earlier this week at the direction of the Trump administration.

It comes as President Donald Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law, to continue to deploy members of the military in American cities if the courts uphold the deployment of the troops in multiple legal challenges.

Last week, Trump federalized members of the National Guard to deploy troops near Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, saying that the troops would help keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Oregon and Illinois safe and that they would help these cities address crime.

The Democratic governors and mayors of Illinois and Oregon have pushed back on Trump’s moves, with each state engaged in ongoing litigation to block the deployment of National Guard troops in their states.

In response to reports about a growing threat of wildfires in Texas, Pritzker wrote in a post on X that “Texas is preparing emergency resources for wildfires and floods. The Texas National Guard should be THERE — not in Illinois. We stand ready to support their return home so they are best positioned for helping Texans respond to any natural disasters.”

Earlier this year, the Trump administration federalized the California National Guard to quell anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. That was blocked by a federal judge who ruled in September.

California sued again this month and won when the Trump administration aimed to send California’s National Guard troops to Oregon after a federal judge blocked the deployment of Oregon’s National Guard there.

A three-judge panel for the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in California is currently weighing a case on the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon. The Trump administration appealed a federal judge’s ruling that blocked the state’s National Guard from being federalized and deployed.

The panel, made up of two Trump appointees and a Clinton appointee, seemed likely to grant the administration’s request that the lower court’s temporary restraining order be reversed, with one judge suggesting Trump, in his capacity as president, should get more deference in his decision-making.

One of the judges said the court would deliver a decision as soon as possible, but did not offer a specific timeline.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251011-national-guard-ch-1535-0740c6.jpg",N,,2025-10-12 12:57:47.058445

A man recording the incident asked for her name. Brockman, whose LinkedIn lists her as a producer, identified herself and said she works for WGN, a Chicago-based news station. “Let them know,” she said.

Agents then placed her in the back of an unmarked gray Chrysler minivan with tinted windows as onlookers yelled at them.

In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs at DHS, said Border Patrol was conducting immigration enforcement operations at the time of the incident. She said “agitators” used their cars to block agents, and agents then hit a suspect’s vehicle to create an opening.

As agents were driving, Brockman, an American citizen, “threw objects” at the car, McLaughlin said. Agents then placed her under arrest on suspicion of assault on a federal law enforcement officer, she added.

Another video of the incident, published by WGN, showed an object flying in the air near a van. Later, Brockman was cuffed.

WGN confirmed in a statement that the employee has since been released and no charges were filed against her. The statement didn’t name her out of respect for her privacy.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago didn't immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by USA TODAY on Saturday, Oct. 11.

What's going on in Chicago?

The incident came a day after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against federal agents targeting journalists covering protests against immigration enforcement in the Northern District of Illinois, which includes Chicago. USA TODAY contacted the Chicago Headline Club, one of the news representatives that requested the order, about Brockman and the Oct. 9 order, but has not received a response.

Chicago area communities have been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, for more than a month.

President Donald Trump has also deployed the National Guard to Illinois, arguing that clashes between federal agents and protesters require troops in the state. Illinois officials say sending troops is unwarranted and have challenged their deployment in court.

On one side, President Donald Trump declares the city a war-torn “hellhole” requiring deployment of National Guard troops to help enforce his administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts as the Department of Homeland Security posts propaganda videos on social media.

Appeals court denies Trump administration request to halt judge’s ruling on National Guard pending appeal

On the other, more than a million people, largely tourists from around the world, are gathering across the city and at Grant Park to urge on runners in the Chicago Marathon after tens of thousands had converged in Wrigleyville to cheer on the Cubs.

“This is JB Pritzker reporting from war torn Chicago,” the state’s Democratic governor said Thursday in a mock field report for “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” wearing body armor while walking along a quiet sidewalk on the riverfront’s Wacker Drive.

“As you can see, there’s utter mayhem and chaos on the ground. It’s quite disturbing,” he said. “The Milwaukee Brewers have come in to attack our Chicago Cubs. We’ve seen people being forced to eat hot dogs with ketchup on them and our deep dish pizza, well, has gone shallow. So it’s a challenge to survive here in the city of Chicago, but there’s no hellscape that I’d rather be in.”

Pritzker’s “report” came as U.S. District Judge April Perry on Thursday handed the governor, along with other Illinois Democrats and administration opponents, a major victory by issuing a temporary restraining order that blocked the president’s federalized Illinois and Texas National Guard troops from duty to assist with immigrant enforcement activities.

Pritzker knows that Chicago’s issues are more than binary pictures. And while the governor has placed his faith in the judiciary, there are questions whether a stream of recent federal court defeats for the Trump administration will only prompt a more serious reaction from Trump, using the powers of the presidency at his disposal and his willingness to go after those who he perceives as his political enemies.

Trump did not have a good week in federal court in Chicago.

In addition to the National Guard ruling, U.S. District Judge LaShonda Hunt on Thursday ordered the removal of a fence erected outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility’s Broadview detention facility for violating the west suburb’s right to access its own land.

Also Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued a temporary restraining order preventing federal agents from using pepper-spray bullets, tear gas and other weapons associated with riot control against journalists and protesters who don’t pose a serious threat. Ellis also banned federal agents from using physical force or arrest against journalists unless they are crime suspects.

And on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings extended until February a consent decree that limits ICE agents’ authority to make warrantless arrests and requires them to disclose monthly any warrantless arrests they make. Cummings also found that the agency had violated the consent decree earlier this year.

“You want me to express joy? Look, I am pleased, if that doesn’t come across my face and my words. I am very pleased,” Pritzker told reporters Friday of Perry’s National Guard ruling.

“We’ve always said that we have to rely on the judiciary to be the check and balance on what the president and the Congress are trying to do or sometimes failing to do,” he said. “So we’re going to take them to court. We think we’re going to get the right results, because we know that it’s unconstitutional for him to attack our states and our cities the way that he has.”

But the victory may only be temporary. The Trump administration has already appealed Perry’s ruling to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. And as Perry was hearing arguments in the case, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to be favoring Trump and presidential “deference” in a challenge to a similar ruling by a federal judge in Oregon who blocked the president’s federalization of the California and Oregon National Guard for deployment in Portland.

As Perry did in her ruling, Judge Karin Immergut found conditions on the ground at protests of ICE facilities did not constitute a “rebellion” or were as dire and in need of a federal response as portrayed by administration lawyers. Immergut said the federalization issue was “untethered to the facts.”

But during a simultaneous hearing of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump-appointed Judge Ryan Nelson questioned whether the judiciary can put conditions on presidential National Guard deployments.

“I am sort of trying to figure out how a district court of any nature is supposed to get in and question whether the president’s assessment of executing the laws is right or wrong,” Nelson said.

If the 7th Circuit in Chicago and 5th Circuit based in San Francisco reached opposite conclusions, it would provide the legal grist for the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to decide — a prospect viewed as providing Democrats an unfavorable outcome.

“This thing could be in the Supreme Court in a couple of weeks. So it is a victory, certainly, but it’s just the first step, and what could be a long road of appeals,” said Pat Brady, a former federal prosecutor and state GOP chairman who has not supported Trump.

“The courts tend to give deference to the president on national security issues and that’s what the appellate court looks like looks like it’s doing” in the Oregon case, Brady said.

Even if the lower court rulings stand, Trump also has the ability to invoke the two-century-old Insurrection Act to make military deployments on domestic soil that go far beyond the protection of federal assets and agents that were part of his original federalization of the National Guard.

“I’d do it if it was necessary. So far it hasn’t been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that.”

The Insurrection Act allows a president to deploy the military to “suppress rebellion” or “insurrection” when enforcing federal law becomes “impracticable.” It is an exception to the federal Posse Comitatus Act which prohibits the use of U.S. military assets from taking part in law enforcement actions on domestic soil.

Past Supreme Court rulings have given the president broad discretionary powers to decide if conditions have been met to invoke the Insurrection Act. But the nation’s highest court has left the door open for judicial review to determine if a president invoked the law “in bad faith” or in going beyond “a permitted range of honest judgment.” And the actions of the military, once invoked, are also subject to judicial review.

Invocation of the Insurrection Act would almost surely be contested in court by Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul, leading to another series of court battles.

“I think the governor and Kwame are doing this for all the right reasons,” said veteran Democratic political consultant Pete Giangreco. “So the question becomes, where, at what point, does the Illinois attorney general and the Illinois governor run out of legal cards? I think we’re rapidly getting to that place.”

With Pritzker a high-profile Trump critic as he seeks a third term as governor and also considers a potential 2028 bid for the White House, there are also questions how far a president who has vowed revenge against his political enemies will go.

Trump previously floated a suggestion that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson be “jailed,” something largely viewed as fanciful political rhetoric.

But the state could face consequences regarding attempts to cut federal grants and funds beyond the Trump administration’s recent move to freeze $2.1 billion in previously approved transit funding, largely dedicated to the effort to extend the CTA’s Red Line to the Far South Side, out of concerns over “race-based contracting” for the project.

“Trump is always going to double down. He is always going to try to win the fight,” Giangreco said. “He either backs down or he doubles down. And he’s been much more into the double down way lately.”

Brady said “pretty much everything Trump’s been doing recently as president, from the tariffs on, are all pushing the limits of what his authority is and that’s been a conservative strain of thought forever, that the executive needs to be stronger.”

“This is going to be a battle and there’s going to be consequences,” he said. “I think there’s big risk, but I understand exactly why they’re doing it as Democrats: You can’t sit back.”

The administration is offering $1,000 to people who leave voluntarily using the CBP Home app.","SEATTLE — Ramón Rodriguez Vazquez was a farmworker for 16 years in southeast Washington state, where he and his wife of 40 years raised four children and 10 grandchildren. The 62-year-old was a part of a tight-knit community and never committed a crime.

On Feb. 5, immigration officers who came to his house looking for someone else took him into custody. He was denied bond, despite letters of support from friends, family, his employer and a physician who said the family needed him.

He was sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, where his health rapidly declined in part because he was not always provided with his prescription medication for several medical conditions, including high blood pressure. Then there was the emotional toll of being unable to care for his family or sick granddaughter. Overwhelmed by it all, he finally gave up.

At an appearance with an immigration judge, he asked to leave without a formal deportation mark on his record. The judge granted his request and he moved back to Mexico, alone.

His case is an exemplar of the impact of the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to deport millions of migrants on an accelerated timetable, casting aside years of procedure and legal process in favor of expedient results.

Similar dramas are playing out at immigration courts across the country, accelerating since early July, when ICE began opposing bond for anyone detained regardless of their circumstances.

“He was the head of the house, everything - the one who took care of everything,” said Gloria Guizar, 58, Rodriguez’s wife. “Being separated from the family has been so hard. Even though our kids are grown, and we’ve got grandkids, everybody misses him.”

Leaving the country was unthinkable before he was held in a jail cell. The deportation process broke him.

It is impossible to know how many people left the U.S. voluntarily since President Donald Trump took office in January because many leave without telling authorities. But Trump and his allies are counting on “self-deportation,” the idea that life can be made unbearable enough to make people leave voluntarily.

The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, said judges granted “voluntary departure” in 15,241 cases in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, allowing them to leave without a formal deportation mark on their record or bar to re-entry. That compares with 8,663 voluntary departures for the previous fiscal year.

ICE said it carried out 319,980 deportations from Oct. 1, 2024 to Sept. 20. Customs and Border Protection declined to disclose its number and directed the question to the Department of Homeland Security.

Secretary Kristi Noem said in August that 1.6 million people have left the country voluntarily or involuntarily since Trump took office. The department cited a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for immigration restrictions.

Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said 1.6 million is an over-inflated number that misuses the Census Bureau data.

The administration is offering $1,000 to people who leave voluntarily using the CBP Home app. For those who don’t, there is a looming threat of being sent to a third country like Eswatini, Rwanda, South Sudan or Uganda,.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the voluntary departures show that the administration’s strategy is working, and is keeping the country safe.

“Ramped-up immigration enforcement targeting the worst of the worst is removing more and more criminal illegal aliens off our streets every day and is sending a clear message to anyone else in this country illegally: Self-deport or we will arrest and deport you,” she said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.

A Colombian woman dropped her asylum claim at a June appearance in a Seattle immigration court, even though she was not in custody.

“Your lawyer says you no longer wish to proceed with your asylum application,” the judge said. “Has anyone offered you money to do this?” he asked. “No, sir,” she replied. Her request was granted.

Her U.S. citizen girlfriend of two years, Arleene Adrono, said she planned to leave the country as well.

“They treat her like a criminal. She’s not a criminal,” Adrono said. “I don’t want to live in a country that does this to people.”

At an immigration court inside the Tacoma detention center, where posters encourage migrants to leave voluntarily or be forcibly deported, a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala in August that he wanted to leave. The judge granted voluntary departure.

The judge asked another man if he wanted more time to find a lawyer and if he was afraid to return to Mexico. “I want to leave the country,” the man responded.

“The court finds you’ve given up all forms of relief,” Scala said. “You must comply with the government efforts to remove you.”

Ramón Rodriguez crossed the U.S. border in 2009. His eight siblings who are U.S. citizens lived in California, but he settled Washington state. Grandview, population 11,000, is an agricultural town that grows apples, cherries, wine grapes, asparagus and other fruit and vegetables.

Rodriguez began working for AG Management in 2014. His tax records show he made $13,406 that first year and by 2024, earned $46,599 and paid $4,447 in taxes.

“During his time with us, he has been an essential part of our team, demonstrating dedication, reliability, and a strong work ethic,” his boss wrote in a letter urging a judge to release him from custody. “His skills in harvesting, planting, irrigation, and equipment operation have contributed significantly to our operations, and his absence has been deeply felt.”

His granddaughter suffers from a heart problem, has undergone two surgeries and needs a third. Her mother doesn’t drive so Rodriguez transported the girl to Spokane for care. The child’s pediatrician wrote a letter to the immigration judge encouraging his release, saying without his help, the girl might not get the medical care she needs.

The judge denied his bond request in March. Rodriguez appealed and became the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit that sought to allow detained immigrants to request and receive bond.

On September 30, a federal judge ruled that denying bond hearings for migrants is unlawful. But Rodriguez won’t benefit from the ruling. He’s gone now and is unlikely to come back.

Led by Gregory Bovino, a particularly hardline Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sector chief from southern California, border patrol agents have become a daily presence in several major cities across the US.

Earlier this month in Chicago’s Southwest Side, a border patrol shot a woman multiple times amid protests against the Trump administration’s militarized immigration raids in the city.

This summer in Los Angeles, border agents on horseback swept through a public park downtown – riding alongside national guard troops and other agents in military vehicles. In southern California, videos of border patrol agents pinning down and beating 48-year-old landscaper ​​Narciso Barranco went viral.

Agents have also made arrests in California’s agricultural Central Valley and at New York immigration courthouses. They have set up immigration checkpoints in Washington DC.

Lawyers and human rights advocates say the agents, who are trained to block illegal entries, drug smugglers and human traffickers at the country’s borders, may be ill-suited to conduct civil immigration enforcement in urban communities.

“The border patrol is certainly quite cavalier, and has been very aggressive historically as it goes about its enforcement responsibilities,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University. They tend to do their work in rural places and isolated parts of the United States. And they generally are not trained in community interactions and policing.”

Until recently, the agency usually worked close to the southern US border – especially along the south-western border – though the department has long had the authority to conduct patrols more inland.

Under a 1946 statute, Border Patrol agents have the ability to conduct warrantless searches within a “reasonable distance” – or up to 100 miles – from any international boundaries. Those boundaries include international land borders as well as coastlines – so in effect, their range encapsulates most US major cities – including LA, New York and Washington DC. Chicago falls within this 100-mile zone, because the Great Lakes are considered a maritime boundary.

Nearly two-thirds of the US population lives within the zone.

Still, García Hernández said, until recently, it was highly uncommon to see border patrol agents stray far from the south-western border.

But now illegal border crossings are at a historic low, and the administration has deployed thousands of military personnel to the southern border, freeing up the Border Patrol, he said – ready and available as force multipliers in the administration’s deportation mission. The department currently has about 19,000 agents. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses the Border Patrol, is about 60,000 strong – making it the largest law enforcement agency in the country.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), meanwhile, has about 5,500 immigration enforcement officers, plus an additional 7,000 agents tasked with investigating cross-border criminal activities. Though the agency is making a massive push to hire 10,000 more agents, that process is expected to take some time.

It’s unclear exactly how many Border Patrol agents have joined up with Ice and other federal agents in raids targeting Chicago, Los Angeles and other big cities.

DHS did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s query.

As border agents stray away from their original mission, legal experts have raised concerns that they are bringing along with them a culture of combative enforcement. “CBP has a history of problematic treatment of people, in my opinion, perhaps worse than any other law enforcement agency,” said Deborah Anthony, a professor of legal studies at University of Illinois Springfield with an expertise in constitutional law and the legality of Border Patrol operations.

The Border Patrol has long had “more leeway” with the US constitution’s fourth amendment’s protections against random and arbitrary stops and searches, Anthony said. They are able to set up checkpoints and, in some cases, roving patrols, she said – but these authorities are limited by law.

Agents cannot pull people over without “reasonable suspicion” of an immigration violation, or search homes or vehicles without a warrant or probable cause.

In recent deployments, however, agents appear to be flouting these restrictions. Earlier this month, Border Patrol agents, along with other federal agents, conducted a military-style immigration raid of an apartment complex in Chicago. Video evidence showed agents indiscriminately bursting through front doors.

“All the evidence suggests there were egregious violations of rights, both in the treatment of people, in the lack of a warrant, in the breaking down of people’s doors, in what seems to be almost indiscriminate targeting of almost everyone in the building,” Anthony said.

Immigrant advocates have had limited success in opposing this type of indiscriminate enforcement. In a January operation that took place shortly before Trump took office, plainclothes border agents poured into California’s Central Valley region, conducting random stops along the highway. In response, the ACLU sued the Border Patrol on behalf of the United Farm Workers union – and a federal district court found that the operation violated the fourth amendment.

And in June a federal lawsuit from advocacy groups accused the Border Patrol, Ice and other agencies of violating rights by profiling street vendors, car-wash workers, day laborers and others, and making arrests without adequate cause – resulting in a temporary restriction against such enforcement in California and parts of the west coast.

But proving such fourth amendment violations can be a big burden on advocates, said Anthony. And Border Patrol has a long history of aggressive enforcement tactics.

“There’s evidence of everything from legal and constitutional violations to physical and sexual abuse and mistreatment, and very little recourse or accountability,” Anthony said. “Internal discipline within [the] Border Patrol is very problematic and that has been systematically the case for a long time now.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4393177562734795a7ba8e41914a5a7aabef8a5c/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2db8c1355a7c0bf17fc98c1f781a927b",N,,2025-10-12 11:57:20.110255

On it was chicken, normally the best food the Northwest ICE Processing Center has to offer, the Skagit Valley farmworker and labor organizer had been told. But on this day, the meat sat in a pool of blood. He inspected his own chicken and saw the same. He lifted the skin to take a closer look. “It was just raw,” he said.

“Everybody got mad and shouted that we weren’t going to eat this,” Juarez said. People returned their food to a cart. Close to 1 a.m., as he recalled, officers brought in sandwiches.

In March, the then-25-year-old had entered a world that, for many people, remains a mystery. The privately run detention center is one of the biggest such facilities nationwide, with 1,575 beds.

Advocates have for years called attention to conditions, collecting thousands of complaints from immigrants held there and submitting them to the state health department. Government agencies and human rights groups have written reports citing concerns. Immigrants locked up there have launched repeated hunger strikes, and some have tried to kill themselves. In 2018, one did.

But the low-lying gray building, surrounded by a chain-link fence, is rarely seen from the inside except by people who work there or are “detained.” Many people don’t even know what that word means, or how it differs from imprisonment. Even some who do would undoubtedly be surprised that one man has been held in ICE’s Tacoma facility for seven years.

More and more immigrants are learning about detention firsthand under President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort. A record number are being held, nearly 60,000 nationally, according to the government’s September figures.

At Trump’s request, Congress has allocated billions of dollars to expand immigrant detention.

Already, the Northwest detention center’s surging population is putting a strain on the facility, exacerbating long-standing complaints and generating new ones, according to interviews with people currently and formerly held there, court declarations and accounts from lawyers and advocates. Many, like Juarez, tell stories of undercooked food and meals arriving in the middle of the night.

They also cite erratic access to outdoor recreation, little to no provided toiletries like soap, unclean uniforms and stained underwear, and long waits for medical care and legal visits. The atmosphere, they said, is tense amid new policies that offer little chance of getting out beyond being deported. Sometimes, even those ready for that outcome can’t leave quickly.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees the facility and provides its medical care, and the GEO Group, the Florida-based corporation running it since 2005, declined interview requests.

“False narratives about ICE detention facilities undermine the hard work of our dedicated professionals,” a spokesperson for the federal agency said in a statement. “ICE facilities operate under strict standards, including accreditation requirements for medical care and staffing.”

A GEO spokesperson said the company provides an array of services, including “around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietitian-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs.”

Those familiar with ICE’s Tacoma facility say it does not have the harshest conditions. Some detention centers operate in remote locations far from attorneys, lawyers and outside observers, said Michelle Brané, formerly the immigration detention ombudsman for the Biden administration. “They’re really running in the shadows.”

On one occasion, an asylum-seeker asked to be transferred there because he heard it was one of the better detention centers.

“I would say that it is fairly typical,” Brané said of the Tacoma facility, its problems endemic to the unique system it is in.

From cold holding cell to tense unit

Juarez, who had no criminal record, arrived at ICE’s Tacoma facility the way many immigrants do: in handcuffs, ankle shackles and a chain around his waist.

He had been stopped by federal agents early that morning as he was driving his partner to work picking Skagit Valley tulips, and taken first to a small, unmarked building, he recalled recently. It was 9 or 10 at night when he reached Tacoma and was placed in a crowded holding cell with others waiting to be processed. He met construction workers in dirty clothes they hadn’t yet changed out of, a father and son, and residents of Seattle, Eastern Washington and Portland.

The hours dragged on. “It was really cold and we couldn’t really sleep,” he said. They tried, on the concrete floor, with no blankets.

He was called out around 4 or 5 in the morning, given a blue uniform that signifies low risk, and placed in a two-tier residential unit. Some units have cells where groups of people sleep, but his was a large open area with bunk beds, Juarez said. The unit also had tables and chairs, a microwave, sink and three TVs.

One TV was always set to English-language programming, one to Spanish-language. Juarez, who came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, speaks both languages, but some people spoke neither, having immigrated from Russia, Turkey, Egypt and elsewhere. What to watch was a source of contention.

“There was always a high risk of a fight breaking out over the smallest thing,” Juarez said.

Still, the well-regarded labor organizer, whose detainment generated community outrage, said he got along with most everyone. He would buy instant ramen soup and macaroni and cheese from the commissary and share with those who didn’t have money.

Sometimes, he helped immigrants who had lost their cases write requests to be deported as soon as possible so they could get out of detention. One he recalled as waiting at least two months.

Days after Juarez arrived, an officer came into his unit with a list of people to be deported right away. Juarez’s name was on it. “Pack your stuff, you’re going tonight,” he said he was told.

Years before, a judge had ordered Juarez removed after he didn’t appear at a court hearing. Juarez said notice of the hearing had gone to the wrong address and he didn’t know about the removal order until he was detained. His lawyer, Larkin VanDerhoef, quickly filed a court motion that stopped him from being deported that night.

Months ticked by. “I started having vision problems because the lights were on pretty much 24/7,” some of them anyway, he said. He went to the “sick call” area one day, where immigrants line up starting as early as 5 a.m. to see health care providers.

There weren’t enough providers to see many of them, Juarez said. He went back to his unit and didn’t try again.

In July, after a judge declined to release Juarez on bond, he opted for “voluntary departure” to Mexico. He lives there now, hoping to find a way to come back to the U.S.

“Stuck in quicksand”

A paradox defines the detention system. It is part of a civil system that’s supposed to be, as ICE says on its website, “non-punitive.” Yet, it operates like a jail or prison system, an Obama-era ICE official noted in a 2009 report.

The Trump administration, which consistently portrays detained immigrants as dangerous, apparently sees no contradiction.

To be sure, some detained immigrants have committed crimes, including entering the country illegally. But whatever punishment they receive in the criminal legal system is intended to be separate from detention, which ICE standards say exists “for no purpose other than to secure their presence both for immigration proceedings and their removal.”

An array of immigrants without formal legal status in the U.S. can be detained, including people who overstay visas (which is not a crime) and asylum-seekers who entered the country without breaking any laws. In some cases, lawful residents with criminal convictions have also been held by ICE.

At the Tacoma detention center, roughly 60% of those reported in September ICE records as being held were categorized as noncriminal.

Despite similarities, detention and criminal incarceration differ in key ways. Those confined to prison have a fixed sentence. Those detained do not.

“It could be three days. It could be three years,” said Brané, the former ombudsman.

Some might be whisked away using a fast-track removal process the Trump administration increasingly deploys. Others are held until a judge or administrative body issues a final ruling on whether they can stay in the U.S. Huge backlogs impede the immigration court and appeals system, adding to the uncertainty of how long detention stretches on.

“It’s like you’re stuck in quicksand,” said Javier Martinez.

Martinez is the man who has been held at the Tacoma detention center for seven years.

The 44-year-old has applied to stay in the U.S. based on what he says is a fear of torture should he be deported, in part for political reasons. His case is complicated, involving two countries he could be deported to, Costa Rica, where he was born, and Nicaragua, where he is a citizen.

While his case has gone through multiple levels of review, he has tried and failed to get bond through every legal avenue, including the U.S. Supreme Court. Once a lawful resident, Martinez’s biggest stumbling block has been two cocaine distribution convictions before ICE took him into custody.

He served prison time for those convictions, offering him a point of comparison. In prison, Martinez earned a GED, obtained a waste management certificate and took parenting classes.

Martinez has found no such activities in detention, designed for comparatively short stays. “Sometimes, I just sit there and I feel like a vegetable,” Martinez said. Even getting to walk around or play sports outside has been tough lately. “Sometimes we have yard and sometimes we don’t,” he said.

He attributes that, as well as irregular meal times that have him going to bed hungry rather than waiting for dinner, to insufficient staffing.

After a steep decline in population due to COVID and slowed immigration enforcement, the detention center’s population has roughly doubled since January, according to immigration lawyers who regularly visit and ICE figures provided to the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

Other detained immigrants said it’s patently clear the Tacoma facility is short-staffed. In a lawsuit on behalf of five immigrants held there for more than six months, plaintiff Jesus Bento Cardozo said in an April declaration that one officer frequently oversees two units. “The guard typically goes back and forth between two units and is sometimes gone for as long as 45 minutes or an hour. I worry that something bad could happen.”

As the only person in his unit to speak Konkani, an Indian language, Cardozo also said in his declaration: “I feel very isolated here.”

In Martinez’s particularly low periods, he has turned to a chaplain at the Tacoma facility.

“He’s a great guy,” Martinez said. “You can request to have a one-on-one with him, or a prayer session with him and he will come to the unit.” In a separate area, volunteers lead religious services.

But Martinez may have reached his limit on how much detention he can take. He is now considering an agreement to leave the U.S.

Detained while pregnant

In recent months, Martinez has noticed a new level of despair among those detained with him.

Until several years ago, many stood a decent chance of getting bond in Tacoma’s immigration court located within the detention center, but that changed as judges started automatically denying release to most immigrants who entered the country illegally. A U.S. District Court in September ruled the practice unlawful, and the federal government — which in July made the practice a nationwide policy — has indicated it will appeal.

In the past, ICE refrained from taking some people into custody for humanitarian reasons. A Biden-era policy, for instance, directed ICE officers to refrain from detaining pregnant, postpartum and nursing immigrants in most circumstances. ICE’s website notes the policy “is not reflective of current practice.”

Alejandra Gonza, executive director of a human rights legal group called Global Rights Advocacy, said she knows of three pregnant women who have been recently held at ICE’s Tacoma facility.

One, Anelys Garcés Infante, was taken there in July. A Venezuelan asylum-seeker living at the time in Oregon, Garcés Infante, 27, said she had been arrested on a shoplifting-related charge and ICE officers took her into custody as she left a sheriff’s office.

After advocates and members of Congress from Washington and Oregon pressed ICE to release Garcés Infante, the agency did so in early October, allowing her to continue her immigration court case while living in the community. Her lawyer, VanDerhoef, who also represented Juarez, said it’s the first grant of a procedure known as humanitarian parole he is aware of under the Trump administration.

Seattle midwife Amanda Heffernan visited Garcés Infante at the detention center and contributed to a release request supported by Seattle University’s International Human Rights Clinic and Global Rights Advocacy. “She walked in and I was like, oh my goodness, this person looks really thin and really sick,” Heffernan recalled in an interview.

Garcés Infante had been nauseous, throwing up and losing weight. Much of the problem, Garcés Infante said in a September call from the detention center, was the food. The extra sandwich she got because she is pregnant, bolognalike meat on white bread, was so unappetizing she didn’t eat it. The meals she got relied heavily on beans, which don’t agree with her stomach.

“I just don’t feel good here,” she said in Spanish.

She worried that her baby or babies — an early ultrasound indicated she may be carrying twins — would be malnourished.

She received prenatal vitamins and medical care in detention, and said the doctors there treated her well. The facility called an ambulance to take her to the hospital when she was experiencing severe pain, Garcés Infante said. The hospital gave her medication.

But in Heffernan’s opinion, Garcés Infante needed more specialized care, especially because of possible twins, than detention offers.

Where’s the oversight?

Inspections by Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman during previous administrations often haven’t fixed problems but they have cataloged some. Among those cited in reports on the Tacoma facility over the past two years: medical understaffing, inconsistent suicide-watch checks and preventive health screenings, and foods stored years past their “best-by” dates.

That oversight is now shrinking. The Trump administration largely defunded the detention ombudsman’s and Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which investigates complaints. A legal challenge is ongoing.

Washington state’s Department of Health, which has received 2,800 complaints since 2023, is attempting to step in. It is backed by recent state laws explicitly giving the agency authority to conduct inspections.

“I have been shocked by the complaints that we hear,” said Lauren Jenks, a department assistant secretary. One of her top concerns is the drinking water, which more than 100 complaints to her department describe as strange looking, smelling and tasting.

The department believes there’s something wrong with pipes inside the building, which it could help fix. But GEO and ICE have long prevented state health inspectors from coming in, which is being litigated in court. (The litigation also involves the state Department of Labor & Industries, which the detention center has allowed in to conduct workplace safety inspections but would likely do so more frequently under state legislation challenged by GEO.)",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10082025_ICE_tzr_115243.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-10-12 09:56:41.485090

“Texas National Guard can stay in Illinois but can’t activate, court says. Here’s what to know about the unit.” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.

Hundreds of Texas-based National Guards deployed this week to Illinois to boost federal authorities can stay there, but can’t be activated, a federal judge ruled Saturday.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the latest ruling states.

This comes after fierce pushback from local residents and Democratic leaders in both Texas and Illinois who have called the president’s decision to deploy the National Guard — with the blessing of Gov. Greg Abbott — unlawful. Two days ago, U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked the guard from being deployed, but the Trump administration appealed the decision, prompting Saturday’s ruling.

In a Fox News interview Monday night, Abbott said that the National Guard troops were being deployed to “safeguard” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The Trump administration over the last month has flooded Chicago with ICE agents who have been using increasingly aggressive methods to go after undocumented immigrants — drawing sharp protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants’ rights that in some instances has escalated to violent clashes on the streets.

Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Perry issued her ruling and order.

Around 200 members from different units of the Texas Guard are currently in Illinois, according to an update from the U.S. Northern Command. It also says that the troops were “mobilized for an initial period of 60 days and will be under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command.” After the initial ruling, the Department of Defense said the federalized National Guard troops “will remain in a federalized status,” though it declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.

Some troops were already at an immigration building in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when Perry heard arguments on Thursday. The building has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and agents.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in President Donald Trump’s “animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” she said.

Since the Chicago-area crackdown began about a month ago, ICE has apprehended more than 1,000 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. U.S. citizens and children have been caught up in raids and altercations between masked federal agents and locals in the nation’s third largest city.

“The president has the constitutional responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States, and those laws include the immigration laws,” Abbott told Sean Hannity. “The president has the authority to call up National Guard to assist in enforcing those laws, and that’s exactly what the president is doing and what Texas is doing — we’re assisting the president in that cause.”

The leveraging of soldiers to help Trump carry out his promised mass deportations of undocumented people echoes a vision the president laid out on the campaign trail, when he pitched an approach of using multiple levels of authority much like former President Dwight Eisenhower’s infamous immigration crackdown.

Here is what you need to know:

What is the Texas National Guard?

The Texas National Guard, made up of more than 20,000 soldiers, is overseen by the Texas Military Department. Guard members are often deployed in response to natural disasters, and in the past have helped rescue people stranded by floodwaters after a hurricane and delivered basic necessities to communities ravaged by storms.

The Military Department’s mission is to provide the president and the governor with “ready forces in support of state and federal authorities at home and abroad,” according to TMD.

The governor has the authority to deploy the Guard as its commander-in-chief. Additionally, a president can take control of troops to deploy them as the nation’s top executive sees fit.

Trump’s federalization of Texas’ troops was blessed by Abbott, who authorized the request.

When has the Texas National Guard been used for non-traditional deployments?

No mission has drawn as much attention to the Texas National Guard or been drenched in politics more than Operation Lone Star.

Abbott launched the border security mission in 2021 in response to what he characterized as the Biden administration’s “open border” immigration policies. The mission became a long-term domestic military deployment, as the governor surged thousands of troops to the 1,254 miles of border that Texas shares with Mexico.

While it was not the first time that military personnel had been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border, the deployment was unique due to the large number of troops quickly dispatched for an indefinite period of time. Also while soldiers in previous federal operations had provided logistical support roles, Texas tested the boundaries of how much immigration enforcement a state could undertake.

The Operation Lone Star deployment was initially defined by its messiness: Troops reported deplorable conditions for a mission that upended their lives.

It was also accompanied by scandal and questions of authority. Guard members were accused of spying on migrants, started shooting would-be border crossers with pepper ball irritants and helped block federal immigration authorities from parts of the border — dragging the Biden administration into court over a constitutional dispute as courts had long held that federal authorities have sole jurisdiction over the enforcement of immigration laws.

Earlier this year, Abbott directed the Guard to help the Trump administration with its immigration crackdown. The Guard is one of two statewide agencies that entered into an agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement which grants it limited authority to enforce immigration laws during regular duties.

In June, the governor deployed 5,000 soldiers across the state in anticipation of massive protests in the state’s largest cities against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Guard members can augment local police in certain circumstances — like during civil unrest — but federal law prohibits the use of troops as civilian law enforcement.

Is it legal for the Texas National Guard to be used for non-state purposes?

Under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the president is able to call upon the National Guard in the case of an invasion, a rebellion or the danger of one, or if the federal government cannot execute its laws “with the regular forces.”

On Sunday, the Texas governor said he “fully authorized” such a deployment.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott said in a post on X.

Trump’s attempts to federalize some blue states’ guards over their objections have, however, resulted in lawsuits.

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily barred the deployment of any state guards to Oregon. A three-judge panel — which includes two Trump nominees — from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then heard arguments on Thursday about the mobilization, but has yet to issue a ruling.

Illinois sued on Monday, saying that the federal government can still enforce its laws in the state and conditions have not been met to justify the mobilization. A federal judge then granted a partial temporary block on Thursday, but specific details were still unclear.

Ten Democratic U.S. representatives from Texas have called Trump’s deployment of national guards unlawful. They also said it set a bad precedent that could undermine Texas’ ability to resist deployment from other states in the future.

“If any other state deployed their National Guard to Texas without our consent, we would call that an invasion of Texas,” the lawmakers said in a Tuesday letter to Abbott.

Amid challenges against his use of the National Guard, Trump has also discussed invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 if necessary, which would allow the president to use the military for civilian law enforcement. But it can only be used under specific situations, such as when requested by a state or when “unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion … make it impracticable” to enforce federal laws.

The Insurrection Act was last invoked in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots following an aid request from California’s governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

What do we know about what the Texas National Guard is doing in Illinois?

Texas Guard members were sighted in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to The Chicago Tribune.

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X. “They are putting America first by ensuring that the federal government can safely enforce federal law.”

The following day, the U.S. Northern Command said in an update that troops were active in the greater Chicago area effective Wednesday. It says they are tasked with protecting ICE and other federal officers who are enforcing federal laws, as well as safeguarding federal properties. Troops may also “temporarily detain” individuals to stop them from interfering with federal officers, but they will not be performing arrests because “that is a law enforcement activity,” the command said.

Some Texas guards were then seen at the Broadview ICE facility, according to local media.

Federal statutes and ICE standards guarantee access to legal counsel in ICE detention centers.","ALBANY - Packed into small concrete cells inside U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Oswego station, detained immigrants were falling asleep standing up or lying on top of each other.

With up to 30 people crowded in a 10-square-foot cell, the station had become the first holding site for nearly 60 workers detained in a September factory raid in the western New York town of Cato - one high-profile example among rising numbers of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests across upstate New York.

Inside, there were no beds, no showers and no hot meals delivered. Under prior presidential administrations, migrants weren't held there long - usually a few hours. But now, at least one migrant was confined in that station for a week, according to his attorney.

And while detainees languished inside the station, their attorneys were running into bureaucratic dead-ends.

Border Patrol officials refused to confirm where the detainees were being held or to allow their attorneys inside the stations. The clients' locations also did not show up in the online detainee locator maintained by ICE. Attorney Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer drove to county jails and the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility hunting for them, unaware that they were still in Border Patrol custody.

It would be days before she and attorney Jose Perez would pin down their clients' whereabouts. At that point, they had already been moved to facilities in other states.

This experience - once unprecedented - is now becoming common in New York. At border and immigration offices around the state, small cells and conference rooms intended for short waits are now being used to detain immigrants for days, forcing them to sleep on concrete floors, on benches or in chairs in spaces jammed with dozens of people.

The attorneys described cramped, uncomfortable and unhygienic conditions in the facilities and say immigrants are often unable to call family members or to get legal advice while in there. Several attorneys also recounted being unable to confirm with federal agencies that their clients were in fact detained in the locations, sometimes for days.

""Almost no one knows what's happening inside there,"" said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University specializing in civil rights and immigration. ""Pretty much the only people who go into the … cells at the Border Patrol stations are either working for the Border Patrol or the people who are detained.""

While the number of migrants crossing the northern border has fallen dramatically this year, Border Patrol is increasingly confining migrants, including children, for extended periods in their New York stations - with around 40% staying for more than three days in June, the Times Union found. This is despite the agency's own standards advising it should generally hold migrants for no more than three days before transferring, releasing or sending them back to their country of origin.

At the same time, thousands of immigrants picked up by ICE have also experienced long waits in small holding cells at immigration courts and field offices in New York City, Buffalo, Albany, John F. Kennedy International Airport and on Long Island this year, the Times Union found. ICE had a longstanding policy of not detaining immigrants in temporary hold rooms for more than 12 hours but, in June, the federal agency issued a waiver to extend the permitted stay to three days, ""absent exceptional circumstances.""

At Federal Plaza immigration court in New York City, over 600 migrants were detained for more than three days in temporary hold rooms in the first seven months of this year, ICE data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the Times Union shows. In the overcrowded holding rooms, there were no beds, no showers, no confidential legal calls and two small meals per day, according to a lawsuit filed in August. One man in his 60s remained there for more than two months, data shows.

Meanwhile, in Buffalo, at least 180 immigrants were detained in a temporary ICE hold room in an office building this year. Forty percent of them were confined there for more than three days.

ICE said it permitted longer stays in temporary holding rooms to ""manage the surge responsibly while upholding detention standards,"" emphasizing that the move was both ""lawful and necessary.""

""The waiver is a temporary tool to ensure order, continuity, and compliance during extraordinary circumstances - not an abandonment of standards,"" said Jason Koontz, an ICE spokesman. ""ICE operates these hold rooms and holding facilities in strict accordance with its National Detention Standards (NDS) to ensure the safety, security, and humane treatment of individuals in custody. These facilities are designed for short-term processing, transfer, and repatriation, with clear limitations and oversight.""

Border Patrol officials did not respond to a request for comment.

Why the holds are happening

Long waits in temporary facilities can largely be attributed to the nationwide surge in ICE arrests amid President Donald J. Trump's deportation campaign - and a lack of adequate space for the ensuing detentions, according to ICE, immigration attorneys and academics.

Koontz characterized this heightened volume of arrests and detentions as a ""direct result of individuals choosing to break the law"" and an effort by ICE to ""restore integrity"" to the U.S. immigration system following the administration of former President Joseph L. Biden, whose policies had triggered an immigration crisis when millions of migrants flowed across U.S. borders.

Traditionally, Customs and Border Protection centers and ICE holding rooms were meant to hold detainees for initial short-term processing while agencies determined next steps: transfer to ICE facilities, release, or deportation.

But the volume of detainees has left ICE with less available space in its long-term detention centers - the majority and largest of which are concentrated along the U.S. southern border in states like Texas and Louisiana. New York, by contrast, has only one: the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia.

In New York, the issue is particularly acute. The Batavia center has been full or near capacity for many months. In other states, ICE has contracted with private prison companies and county jails to house detainees; while detentions in New York's county jails have also skyrocketed, private prisons are illegal in this state.

Koonz noted that state and local sanctuary policies have also limited ICE's ability to contract with authorities in those areas for detention services.

Some advocates believe the rise in long detentions in temporary facilities stems from a federal ""strategy"" of overpopulating detention facilities, even with people who may have open cases or qualify for hearings, to ""intimidate them into giving up their rights.""

""Even if people aren't (immediately) deportable, they are subjecting them to such harsh conditions that they're hoping that they will just choose to leave,"" said Jessica Maxwell, executive director of the Workers' Center of Central New York. ""It's a tactic.""

‘Bare bones' Border Patrol cells

The three-day time frame for Customs and Border Protection detention is a guideline, not a law or regulation. Across multiple presidential administrations, CBP has held migrants for extended periods - primarily along the southern border - with hundreds of children apparently held in custody for more than a week at times under the Biden administration, when crossings were especially high.

Nevertheless, detentions of this length used to be rare in New York. That's changing.

In June, the number of people detained by CBP for longer than three days included 74 migrants along the Buffalo border sector and 47 migrants along the Swanton sector, CBP data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the Times Union shows. Since 2013, Buffalo had typically seen between two or less such detentions, and Swanton fewer than 15. In both sectors, the June numbers amount to nearly 40% of people held longer than CBP's benchmark.

Exhibits filed by Customs and Border Protection in federal court recently also showed seven children detained by the agency for more than three days in June in the Buffalo and Swanton sectors, and 12 in July.

CBP has New York stations in Niagara Falls, Buffalo, Wellesley Island, Oswego, Rochester, Erie, Massena, Ogdensburg, Malone and Champlain, divided between these two sectors. The Swanton sector also includes Vermont.

{ ""__type"": ""devHubFreeformEmbed"", ""__id"": ""Datawrapper"", ""__fallbackImage"": ""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r5Jgd/mobile.png"", ""__data"": { ""datawrapper_id"": ""r5Jgd"" } } { ""__type"": ""devHubFreeformEmbed"", ""__id"": ""Datawrapper"", ""__fallbackImage"": ""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wudSe/mobile.png"", ""__data"": { ""datawrapper_id"": ""wudSe"" } }

Unhygienic and overcrowded conditions in CBP facilities have been well documented for years, and advocates familiar with recent detentions in western New York say those conditions are more severe than ever - ""unlivable,"" according to Claire Molholm, a staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union.

""There is no bedding. They are forced to sleep on a concrete bench basically,"" said Matthew Borowski, an attorney whose clients have been held at Border Patrol stations in Tonawanda and elsewhere. ""They get something like a peanut butter sandwich with chips, not real food. … It's small and bare bones.""

A nursing mother detained at the Wellesley Border Patrol station told Maxwell's team that nobody working on-site could speak Spanish to communicate with the detainees, so they asked her to translate for them. Without adequate medical care at the station, Border Patrol officers had to drive the woman to a hospital in Watertown, which is nearly 40 minutes away, because her breasts were engorging painfully due to separation from her baby, she told legal aides.

In contrast, long CBP detentions have declined in southern border sectors in Texas and California, where such detentions used to reach thousands per month, but recently have dipped to the low hundreds. But the data shows that other sectors along the northern border - Detroit, Michigan, Montana and Maine - saw swells akin to New York.

‘Like dogs' in ICE hold rooms

Immigrants arrested by ICE in New York have faced similar conditions in temporary holding rooms. Some are waiting five days or more in these spaces, data shows.

{ ""__type"": ""devHubFreeformEmbed"", ""__id"": ""Datawrapper"", ""__fallbackImage"": ""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nWaQ6/mobile.png"", ""__data"": { ""datawrapper_id"": ""nWaQ6"" } }

Children are among those subject to long stays in facilities not designed for overnight detention.

In June, 24 children were held in ICE's New York City holding room for more than three days, five kids in Buffalo and one in Albany, according to an exhibit the federal government filed last month in connection with a lawsuit challenging its detention policies that's pending in U.S. District Court. In July, 10 children experienced holds longer than three days in New York City, one in Albany and one in Buffalo.

In Buffalo, many immigrants have been detained in ICE's field office, located on the seventh floor of a modern office building that includes a hotel and retail shops.

Perez said before Trump's second term began in January, clients would wait there for three to four hours, but now it is three to four days.

""They are waiting in a conference room,"" he said. There are no beds, no showers and no calls permitted. ""For food, they just get some snacks, not proper food.""

Men, women and children are all confined together there, he said.

Nearby, at the 650-bed Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, the facility is so crowded that in September, roughly 75 to 100 detained men slept on gym mats and mattresses on the floor of the gymnasium, according to a man detained in Buffalo Federal Detention Facility. He asked not to be named due to his ongoing detention. The immigrants all share one toilet, he said. He surmised some might have been there for days or longer.

Justice for Migrant Families, a Buffalo-based organization which regularly works with immigrants in that area, had never heard of those conditions under prior administrations, said Executive Director Jennifer Connor.

At ICE's Malta office, near Albany, detained immigrants can access their phones, personal belongings and landline telephones while supervised by officers in the holding area, according to an attorney who visited the space but requested not to be named to protect their clients' cases. The space also contains three lockable, cell-like rooms with no furniture and just a toilet inside.

In New York City, ICE detains 50 to 90 people at a time in the four holding rooms located on the 10th floor of the Federal Plaza immigration building, according to the class action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of people detained there.

The detainees sleep on concrete floors, are fed small rations of food twice per day, are subject to extreme hot and cold temperatures and have been denied prescription medications, the lawsuit alleges. They must use a toilet in the holding room with no privacy, wear the same clothes and are denied items like soap, toothbrushes, menstrual products and the opportunity to bathe.

""Look how we are like dogs in here,"" said an immigrant detained by ICE in one of Federal Plaza hold rooms in a video he filmed there in July that was published by the New York Times.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which is representing the Department of Homeland Security in the lawsuit, wrote in August that people held in the rooms have access to medical care, hygiene products, can call attorneys on a landline phone and are issued a change of clothes upon request. People in custody are typically fed two meals per day, a filing confirmed.

The office wrote in August most individuals are transported to other facilities within three days, ""except in exceptional circumstances."" Data shows from January to late July, 14% of waits at that holding room were longer than three days.

In September, a judge issued a preliminary injunction to prevent ICE from overcrowding holding rooms and requiring them to provide bedding mats, hygiene materials, confidential calls to attorneys and space that is cleaned three times per day.

‘Legal black holes'

Temporary detention facilities pose several limitations for detainees in contrast to standard ICE centers, according to advocates. A major one is restricted access to legal counsel.

""At least there are some protocols,"" Maxwell said, regarding ICE centers and jails. ""It's clear how you make a phone call or when you get your phone access. None of that exists in these other places that are more makeshift and temporary.""

For one, it is much harder for the public to track individuals in CBP custody. Those detained for less than 48 hours do not appear in ICE's online detainee locator database, making it difficult for attorneys and family members to find them. Even after Kelley-Widmer's clients from Cato appeared in the locator, it only showed them as being in CBP custody, without information about where they were being held.

According to Albany-based immigration lawyer Matthew Geiling and New York Immigration Coalition Legal Director Rosanna Eugenio, the overlap in law enforcement agencies involved in immigration now - ICE, CBP, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Marshals Service, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and local police - often makes it difficult to even determine who has custody of a person.

Kelley-Widmer's experience is a common one, according to Eugenio, who said that CBP often refuses to confirm whether someone is in its custody.

""Essentially, that's just kidnapping,"" she said. ""When (we) don't know where the person is and you won't tell us, what is the recourse for that person's family member or their attorney or their community?""

Even when attorneys can locate their clients in detention, they are typically barred from meeting with them inside CBP stations - a longstanding practice that lawsuits have alleged is turning the facilities into ""legal black holes"" that leave detainees ""incommunicado"" with the outside world. That was the case for Kelley-Widmer and Perez.

Federal statutes and ICE standards guarantee access to legal counsel in ICE detention centers. CBP has argued, however, that these requirements do not apply to their detainees because of a federal regulation that excludes inspections at ports of entry from the right to legal counsel.

And once detainees are transferred to other states, attorneys like Kelley-Widmer are no longer able to represent them in certain matters because they are not licensed in those states.

She and her team at the Cornell University clinic are still working with one Cato client because they are co-counseling with a Texas attorney. For most detainees, however, the transfer effectively ends their legal representation, as they struggle to find new counsel - especially pro bono lawyers - in other states.

Many people in Chicago assumed the targets of this action would be limited to immigrants, some of whom were, according to Trump administration officials, engaged in criminal activity.
Extralegal detention and law enforcement terrorism are as native to Chicago as deep-dish pizza and ketchup-free hot dogs.
The tactics that the federal agents have used against the crowds have been so aggressive that another judge temporarily blocked the use of tear gas and pepper balls.","The fragrant steam rose from the plates of pasta like mist from a hot spring as the famished Venezuelan newcomers lined up to eat on a frozen Chicago November afternoon in 2023. Many arrived in shorts and flip-flops.

I had partnered with local restaurateur Eldridge Williams to help feed and clothe the group, who had been bused up to my hometown along with other “sanctuary cities” run by Democrats by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas as part of an inhumane political stunt. Chicagoans stepped up to aid these people in need.

It was a strain, as Mr. Abbott knew it would be. The newly elected mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, had to reallocate already tight resources to help. Much of the responsibility of providing for the Venezuelans ended up being shouldered by Chicago’s Black community: Shelters were placed in our neighborhoods, and services were diverted away from our most vulnerable.

The apparent chaos of these arrivals, hyped by the right-wing media, helped re-elect Donald Trump. And it led directly to what happened this past week, when the federal government began treating my city like enemy territory. Rappelling out of helicopters like in a scene from “Black Hawk Down,” federal agents raided an apartment building in the predominantly Black community of South Shore, knocking down doors, separating children from their zip-tied parents and detaining people barely clothed.

Many people in Chicago assumed the targets of this action would be limited to immigrants, some of whom were, according to Trump administration officials, engaged in criminal activity. But the effects rained down on Black citizens who were caught up in the raid, too. Some Black Chicagoans expressed indignation and disbelief at seeing us be brutalized by Mr. Trump’s deployments, with one young brother exclaiming as he watched federal agents appear to choke a Black man on the street, “Ya’ll supposed to be choking Mexicans.”

At its heart, his comment speaks to Mr. Trump’s success in dividing us from one another and our humanity: a nagging devil on the shoulder of struggling Americans barely scraping together the rent and telling them someone else is to blame. It also reflects the divisions within the African diaspora, where it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that—like my own father—many Black people are also immigrants, experiencing their own traumas at the sight of these cruelties.

I visited the apartment complex on 75th Street and South Shore Drive after the raid. A friend of mine who is a journalist, Maira Khwaja of the Invisible Institute, had been one of the first on the ground and warned me of the wreckage that had been left behind by the mayhem, but seeing it in person was shocking. Tension loomed in the air even days later. A child’s soiled pink unicorn toy seemed to cry out for help beneath a broken headboard and an uprooted mattress. My heart breaks for the lessons of worthlessness being taught to these children.

Conversations with the victims of ICE’s South Shore raid reveal a people divided. One man expressed love for his new Venezuelan neighbors, one of whom helped him fix his car. Others burn with contempt, like a hot coal in weathered hands. These are hands that all too often can’t find work and are perfectly primed for pointing the finger. “I don’t agree with how they did it, but they needed to get them out,” said one disgruntled neighborhood resident.

And I get it: Not long ago, I welcomed a friend home from prison with the help of Gov. JB Pritzker. I was hopeful he’d be eligible for subsidized housing through the state’s re-entry programs, only to find that many of the opportunities had been siphoned off to the Venezuelan immigrants, and nothing was available. A crisis of conservative design, this desperate scramble for scarce resources is a rife breeding ground for ethnic animosity.

The reality of the Black American experience is that being at the heel of a racially unjust society means that the oppression of anyone invariably affects us.

Extralegal detention and law enforcement terrorism are as native to Chicago as deep-dish pizza and ketchup-free hot dogs. This is the city of the disgraced detective Jon Burge, who, after leaving the military police, joined the Chicago Police Department and deployed what have been likened to military black sites to torture what has been estimated to be over 100 Black men in the 1970s to early ’90s, causing the city to pay out over $100 million in settlements. After Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014, protests erupted downtown over his death. Then, after George Floyd, as in other cities full of people fed up with police brutality, many of us took to the streets. Some protesters vandalized property in that heated moment.

The question now is: How will Chicago’s residents respond? The protests started small, but as the stakes of the federal incursion ramp up, with Mr. Trump ordering Department of Homeland Security agents in and attempting to deploy the National Guard as well (which has been blocked, for now, by the courts), the crowds have gotten bigger and the mood more defiant. The tactics that the federal agents have used against the crowds have been so aggressive that another judge temporarily blocked the use of tear gas and pepper balls. All of this could eventually provoke peaceful demonstrators into revolt, which would also turn Chicago into the “war zone” Mr. Trump and his administration keep saying our city is, as a justification for his sending in his forces in the first place.

In Season 7 of Showtime’s “The Chi,” a show on which I appear as the character Jamal, there’s a moment when he’s shot in an attack meant for someone else and he has to wrestle with how to respond. In my creative exploration for the role, I contemplated the enormous weight of forgiveness and restraint. I sat in silence with Jamal’s gnawing, burning urge for revenge. I thought of the damage and the destruction it would do to his family, to his younger sister, who was left abandoned during Jamal’s previous incarceration. And ultimately, for the greater good of himself, and his loved ones, my character decided against it.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12mensa-mkfh/12mensa-mkfh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 09:56:32.172199

Over 150 court cases have been filed as part of democracy litigation efforts against Trump’s administration, with several recent victories for opponents.
Meanwhile, Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and ICE agents has faced fierce resistance.
On the immigration front, ICE raids and National Guard deployments have sparked outrage and further litigation.
As the nation braces for the next wave of protests and legal battles, one thing is clear: the struggle for the soul of American democracy is far from over.","Donald Trump’s second term has been marked by a series of extraordinary and controversial moves that have left the nation’s democratic institutions under strain and sparked a groundswell of opposition across the country. In recent weeks, the former president has ramped up his use of executive power, targeting political adversaries, deploying federal forces to American cities, and facing a mounting wave of legal challenges and public protests. The events of early October 2025 encapsulate the high-stakes battle now raging between Trump’s administration and defenders of the rule of law.

According to Publisher's Roundup, Trump has increasingly relied on extraordinary powers—pressuring allies to prosecute perceived enemies and using the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to suppress peaceful demonstrations. These actions, the publication argues, are not signs of strength, but of deep insecurity and mounting weakness. “Trump’s abuse of power is a sign of his insecurity and weakness, and it is setting up massive, peaceful, lawful opposition,” the article contends.

The legal front has been especially active. Over 150 court cases have been filed as part of democracy litigation efforts against Trump’s administration, with several recent victories for opponents. As reported by The Atlantic, this wave of litigation has become “the anti-Trump strategy that’s actually working.” In particular, Trump’s push to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James on what critics call “unmerited charges” has drawn national attention. This follows the similarly controversial indictment of former FBI Director James Comey just a week earlier. Legal experts, including Richard Painter and Virginia Canter, have already filed multiple ethics complaints against the administration, and more may be on the way.

Meanwhile, Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and ICE agents has faced fierce resistance. In Chicago, at least three court orders have halted aspects of the administration’s activities in the city, as reported in early October 2025. Federal Judge Karin Immergut temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon, warning that the administration’s arguments “risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power—to the detriment of this nation,” according to Zeteo. When the Trump administration attempted to send hundreds of National Guard troops from California and Texas to Oregon and Chicago, Judge Immergut broadened her order, stating the effort was “in direct contravention” of her decision.

These legal setbacks have been accompanied by a collapse in Trump’s popularity. As Publisher's Roundup notes, “Trump is at historic lows in popularity at this early point in his term.” The American public, by and large, disapproves of the prosecution of Trump’s opponents, the aggressive use of federal forces, and the chaos that has come to define his administration. The electoral consequences have been dire for Trump’s party: Democrats have won or outperformed in 42 of 43 elections held in 2025, signaling a potential sea change in the political landscape.

Public protest has surged to levels not seen in decades. The No Kings protests, which first swept the nation in June 2025 in response to Trump’s military deployments in Los Angeles, are set for a second coast-to-coast iteration on October 18. With planned National Guard deployments in Portland and Chicago, and a recent deployment in Memphis, millions of Americans are expected to take to the streets. Political scientist Erica Chenoweth’s research suggests that when 3.5% of the population stands against a tyrannical regime, it cannot continue—a threshold that activists believe is within reach.

Press freedom has also come under intense pressure. Both independent and mainstream media have become more outspoken in their criticism of the administration. The New York Times ran a headline reading, “Letitia James Indicted After Trump’s Pressure Campaign,” signaling a break from its traditional neutrality. Meanwhile, journalists and civil society groups in Chicago have sued the Trump administration, alleging a “pattern of extreme brutality” by federal agents at protests, aimed at silencing both the press and civilians. A federal judge recently issued a 14-day order prohibiting federal agents from using physical force or arresting journalists in Chicago without probable cause, and restricting the use of riot control weapons.

Political leadership, particularly among Democrats, has become more unified in opposition to Trump’s authoritarian tactics. State attorneys general, governors, and national party leaders have coalesced to resist efforts to strip health care from millions and oppose government shutdowns. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have been credited with winning the messaging war during the ongoing government shutdown, making clear that Democratic votes would not be used to undermine essential services.

Yet, the administration’s aggressive posture persists. On social media, Trump has called for the removal and even jailing of political opponents, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. Pritzker fired back, calling Trump “unhinged,” “insecure,” and a “wannabe dictator,” and declared, “If you come for my people, you come through me. So come and get me.”

Trump’s foreign and domestic policy moves have also drawn scrutiny. Despite claiming credit for a ceasefire in Gaza and angling for a Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian committee passed him over in 2025—a development that set off a storm among his supporters. Meanwhile, the administration has conducted strikes on alleged drug boats in international waters, with legal experts warning that the Department of Justice’s classified opinions grant the president “such extraordinary powers that he alone can decide to prosecute a war far broader than what Congress authorized after the attacks on 9/11,” according to CNN.

On the immigration front, ICE raids and National Guard deployments have sparked outrage and further litigation. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson issued an executive order barring federal immigration agents from using city property, stating, “We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority.” Anti-ICE protests have erupted in Chicago, Portland, and other cities, as activists decry what they see as unconstitutional crackdowns on ordinary Americans.

Within the federal government, the Trump administration has initiated mass firings, with Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announcing that “Reduction in Force” notices have gone out, though it remains unclear which agencies are affected. The government shutdown has exposed further fault lines, as the administration considers withholding back pay from some furloughed federal workers—a move not seen since the 1960s.

Against this backdrop, the fate of American democracy hangs in the balance. While the damage wrought by Trump’s policies—both at home and abroad—is undeniable, the resilience of legal institutions, the press, political leaders, and ordinary citizens has become a defining feature of this tumultuous era. As the nation braces for the next wave of protests and legal battles, one thing is clear: the struggle for the soul of American democracy is far from over.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/LeVuIBso68J7lUCWRIV9OVeBc1k=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2Fcc342760-fe2e-4045-ae1a-85b5e5596075.jpeg,N,,2025-10-12 11:57:33.089743

But after approaching Illinois State Police officers standing outside the facility, the group’s communion request was rebuffed.

The processing facility has been at the center of ongoing demonstrations in recent weeks. About 11 a.m., protesters marched down Lexington Street toward the center, praying and singing.

Illinois State Police Lt. Col. Jason Bradley called the facility with the religious leaders’ request to give communion. Bradley said ICE denied the request.

Bradley said no reason was given for the denial.

ICE didn’t immediately return a request for comment on why the request was denied.

About 1,000 members of Chicago-area parishes and of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership were part of the delegation.

When the leaders announced to the group that ICE had declined the request, people started yelling “Shame! Shame!”

The group had communion among themselves in the parking lot and street before dispersing to either walk home or board yellow school buses the organizers had rented to take people home.

The Rev. Larry Dowling, one of the priests holding the communion elements, said, “We’re just very disappointed because we simply wanted to bring the love of God and the presence of the Eucharist to these prisoners, which we had been allowed to do before all this stuff happened. So they’re basically rejecting us bringing the presence of Christ and the love of God.”

A spokesperson for the coalition pointed to the 2008 Access to Religious Ministry Act, which allows religious workers “reasonable access” to jails and people in immigration detention facilities to meet with those who wish to “consult about their spiritual needs.”

“ICE has completely shut down and [is] not allowing any ministers inside to provide communion and religious support for many weeks now,” said spokesperson Sarah Rand of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership. Rand was unsure whether any attempts by other groups had been successful.

Chuck Fitzsimmons led the singing during the procession along Lexington Street to the ICE facility.

“In one sense [the music] keeps up your spirits, but also it focuses us on the message that we are here as one, brothers and sisters all,” he said.

He said he was sad to not be able to share communion with the detainees. “However, these are the times and these are the morals, and I think we were prepared to be denied,” he said.

On Saturday, crews put up barricades in front of the fence that a judge ordered removed by Tuesday per state police orders, according to a crew person on site.

U.S. District Judge LaShonda A. Hunt issued a temporary restraining order Thursday ordering the removal of the fence outside the processing facility to be taken down immediately.

The fence, erected in September, was still up as of Saturday afternoon. Officials have until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday to take it down.

Before the clergy arrived, dozens of protesters had already gathered at Harvard Street and 25th Avenue.

About 30 minutes ahead of Broadview’s 6 p.m. protest curfew, some protesters went onto 25th Avenue to heckle a vehicle full of federal agents. Police then declared an unlawful assembly and pushed protesters down the street. State and sheriff’s confirmed 15 arrests throughout the day. Protesters arrested earlier Saturday face charges including destruction of government property, aggravated battery to a police officer, mob action and resisting or obstructing an officer.

About 7 p.m. Illinois State Police retreated and protesters cleared the roadway as Illinois Department of Transportation made small adjustments to the barriers around the designated free speech zones along 25th Avenue and demonstrators largely dispersed.

The ICE facility is the site of ongoing and often tense demonstrations, with agents deploying chemical irritants and rubber pellets, since President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively ramped up a deportation campaign in the Chicago area last month under the name “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Since then, protesters have arrived at the facility in the early morning hours, sometimes as early as 5 a.m. and have clashed with federal authorities into the late night hours.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d21b62f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7712x4402+0+371/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2Fa8%2F6fb987c244eb9fa51696a552be7f%2Fbroadview-101225-035.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 12:57:42.188328

Over the last decade, the front line of civil rights activism has been the struggle for police accountability — for a more humane and equitable system of public safety.
He is also the editor of the book “A Worthy Tradition: Freedom of Speech in America,” written by his father Harry Kalven Jr.","Where is the line between “democracy” and “fascism”? Since President Donald Trump’s return to power nine months ago, that question has been posed again and again in response to the latest affront to human dignity, common sense and/or constitutional norms committed by his administration.

Arguably, however, this is the wrong question in that it assumes there is some precise threshold beyond which we cease to be free. Those who have experienced fascist takeovers elsewhere warn that if we insist on a definitive answer to that question, we will only belatedly realize that the walls have closed in around us. The danger is that we will drift — disoriented, unmoored, bewildered — into the iron cage of tyranny.

While there may be no red line from which to take our bearings, recent events have pulled back the curtain on the nature and trajectory of the Trump regime’s fascist project. In their haste to exploit the murder of Charlie Kirk, Trump and senior members of his team have revealed their contempt for fundamental First Amendment principles. The president has ruminated about the possibility of making it a crime to criticize him. Multiple voices in the administration have demanded punishment for anyone who speaks of Kirk in less than reverential terms. Calling for a crusade against the forces of “evil” and “wickedness,” Trump’s chief of staff Stephen Miller has conjured a vast left-wing “domestic terror network.” Vice President JD Vance has said it is exemplified by the Nation magazine and the Open Society Institute founded by George Soros.

(Full disclosure: I am a Nation contributor and have been an Open Society fellow. So if you are curious about the face of terrorism, according to the administration, I’m your guy.)

The “us versus them” logic of fascism is voracious. We have seen the category of “the enemy within” rapidly expand from MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gang members to the majority of the population that dissents from the MAGA-certified state ideology.

What has been revealed in recent weeks is ugly but deeply familiar. We have seen it before, and we have seen effective resistance to it. What is critical at this juncture is to be clear about the nature of the threat. Even with a supine Congress and compliant Supreme Court, it is unlikely the administration could effectively repeal the First Amendment by turning seditious libel (criticism of the government) and blasphemy into crimes. Rather, it has adopted a transparent strategy of seeking to provoke civil disorder in order to justify crushing dissent.

Sixty years ago, my father Harry Kalven Jr., a constitutional scholar, coined the term “heckler’s veto” to describe a situation in which those hostile to a speaker’s message seek to suppress it by threatening disorder. If the police restore order by silencing the speaker, they give the heckler a veto over public discussion. Censorship is thus achieved by a circuitous process.

The context in which my father developed the heckler’s veto concept was the Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960s, when those engaged in nonviolent protests against segregation in the South were often met by hostile crowds. Local authorities would then use the threat of disorder as a rationale for suppressing the protests.

On several occasions during that era, the federal government, over the objections of Southern governors, deployed federal troops to protect those exercising their constitutional rights. Among the photographs that illuminate that moment, one is especially telling: the image of 6-year-old Ruby Bridges entering a previously all-white elementary school, accompanied by U.S. marshals, while hostile white people jeer and heckle.

Today, the federal government is the heckler. Its military interventions in Chicago and in other targeted cities do not seek to maintain order and protect the constitutional rights of the vulnerable. Rather, at the direction of the heckler-in-chief, they are designed to provoke disorder that can then be seized upon as a rationale for declaring a state of emergency and suppressing dissent.

This theater of cruelty — masked federal agents terrorizing migrant families and brazenly attacking protesters and journalists — is not a matter of misconduct by the officers involved. On the contrary, they are delivering the message the administration intends to send.

In this respect, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement television commercial seeking to recruit local officers that has recently been airing in Chicago is revealing. “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city safe. But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free,” the ad declares. “Join ICE, and help us catch the worst of the worst.” The subtext is clear: Join us and be relieved of constitutional constraints and the nuisance of accountability. Enjoy impunity.

Over the last decade, the front line of civil rights activism has been the struggle for police accountability — for a more humane and equitable system of public safety. Similarly, declaring Chicago a sanctuary city is an expression of care for and solidarity with our neighbors. These civic aspirations are now under siege. In contrast to the federal interventions of the 1960s in support of those working to desegregate the Jim Crow South, we now confront a white supremacist regime seeking to undo the limited but real achievements of pluralism and tolerance.

While there is reason to hope that legal challenges to federal intervention and to ICE practices will ultimately prevail, it is important to recognize that we confront a rogue regime that has contempt for the rule of law and is in the process of building a massive paramilitary force answerable only to the president.

The terms of engagement are thus daunting. They are also clear. It is up to us all — elected officials, civil society, the press — to defend First Amendment freedoms by exercising them in the place where we live. Challenges abound: for protesters, to maintain nonviolent discipline; for public officials, to hold their ground in the face of economic retaliation; for police and military, to honor their oath to uphold the Constitution when given clearly unconstitutional orders; and for the press, to remain agile and work together to bear witness to events on the ground.

In meeting the moment, we can take heart from historian Hannah Arendt’s distinction between violence and power, which she saw as opposites. Power arises when people act together for a common purpose, as Chicagoans have been doing across the city by confronting ICE, providing legal and material aid to those targeted by the federal dragnet, and building networks for sharing information. Seen in isolation, these efforts may be small-scale and intensely local, but in the aggregate, they are building capacity for civil resistance. Violence, by contrast, is purely instrumental. It can destroy power but not create it. It is an expression of impotence. Only people acting in concert can generate power.

The great Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who was well acquainted with sectarian violence, said it best: “What looks the strongest has outlived its term. The future lies with what’s affirmed from under.”

The short-order cook always let someone know if he was running late, even by just five minutes. Earlier that morning, Villegas Gonzalez, 38, had been fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, shortly after dropping his children off at a school and daycare in the suburb of Franklin Park.

The agents were attempting to arrest him as part of a massive immigration sweep launched by US President Donald Trump. Villegas Gonzalez was the Chicago crackdown's first casualty.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said, after the 12 September incident, that Villegas Gonzalez was ""a criminal illegal alien"" with ""a history of reckless driving"", who steered his car at agents, causing one to fear for his life and fire his weapon, killing Villegas Gonzalez.

DHS told Reuters on Friday (local time) that it would conduct its own investigation into the incident, after the first agency that responded had finished its review.

Both Franklin Park police and the FBI responded to the shooting incident, but it wasn't clear which agency was investigating.

The FBI declined to comment, citing a lack of staff to respond to media inquiries, due to the government shutdown.

Franklin Park police did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

A reserved boy from Irimbo

Reuters interviews with family and coworkers, and a review of public records, present a more nuanced picture of a man who left his quiet village years ago for economic opportunity and worked long hours to support his children.

A man who had become sober after heavy drinking, resulting in liver disease, and who had become one woman's steadfast partner.

""He was so soft-spoken,"" said Ashley Alekna, manager of the diner, describing him as a kind, dependable presence during his 11-hour shifts in a kitchen full of boisterous personalities, making food for the crowds that spilled in from the community college across the street.

Villegas Gonzalez made a similar impression on partner Blanca Mora, when they were growing up in Irimbo, a small town in Michoacán, Mexico.

Mora said they were in their early teens, when they started greeting each other around town, meeting to chat on the corner near her grandparents' house.

People often leave Irimbo for opportunities beyond the tiny town, including Villegas Gonzalez's older brother, Jorge.

Jorge, who first went to the US in 1998, remembers his little brother watching him walk away.

""He was a kid,"" said Jorge. ""He hid, so I wouldn't see him crying.""

Father of two

In 2007, Silverio followed his brother north, part of a wave of more than 348,000 Mexican emigrants to the US that year, US Census data showed, as President Felipe Calderon's violent war against drug cartels deepened.

Villegas Gonzalez found employment in the restaurant kitchens, where - according to recent National Restaurant Association data - 46 percent of the nation's chefs and 31 percent of its cooks are foreign-born.

He met a woman and they had two sons. Jorge Villegas Gonzalez said his younger brother often struggled to cover the bills.

Between 2011-19, Villegas Gonzalez was cited for a handful of traffic offences, one for driving more than 48kmh over the speed limit.

He was also ticketed for driving an uninsured vehicle and having a broken taillight. He had no criminal record.

His abuse of alcohol during those years led to a diagnosis of liver disease, he told Alekna later. A doctor told him that, if he kept drinking, it would kill him.

He had been sober for more than a year when he died, co-workers and Mora said.

Mora and Villegas Gonzalez fell out of touch, when he moved to the US, but she eventually moved there too, looking for her mother, who had left Mexico to better support her three children years before.

She never found her mother, but she found love with the reserved boy from home. She visited him when he was sick and later the two became a couple. Villegas Gonzalez, his two sons, Mora and her 13-year-old daughter eventually all lived together in Franklin Park.

A family in Franklin Park

Mora said Villegas Gonzalez took his sons to the library three times a week, played with Lego and banned phones at the dinner table, so the newly blended family could focus on each other.

He began to open up to his co-workers, said Alekna, cracking little jokes throughout the day. When his younger son celebrated his birthday, they helped him bake a Minecraft video game-themed cake with green icing.

The morning he was killed, Villegas Gonzalez dropped his older son off at Passow Elementary School in Franklin Park and then his younger son at Small World Learning Center, just around the corner. Minutes later, surveillance video from a nail salon showed ICE agents pulling him over, each leaning into his front car windows.

Villegas Gonzalez backed up and tried to drive away, as the agent on the passenger side chased on foot. The agent on the driver's side was not visible, as Villegas Gonzalez drove forward.

In separate surveillance footage from another nearby business, what sounds like two gunshots can be heard around the same time. Police records and bodycam footage indicated that Villegas Gonzalez quickly crashed into a parked delivery truck.

A few hours later, Jorge Villegas Gonzalez was driving a minibus through the streets of Irimbo when he got the call that his brother was dead.

Villegas Gonzalez's two boys were taken to foster care, Mora said.

The guard troops in Memphis remain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.
Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.
“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois.
And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.","The national guard troops Donald Trump sent to Illinois can remain in the state and under federal control but can’t be deployed, an appeals court ruled on Saturday.

The appeals court granted a pause in the case until it can hear further arguments.

The decision to prevent the troops from protecting federal property or going on patrol comes after federal judge April Perry ruled on Thursday to temporarily block the national guard deployment for at least two weeks, finding no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois as Trump continues his immigration crackdown in major cities across the US.

On Friday, Democratic US senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth said they had visited an immigration enforcement building near Chicago but were barred from going inside.

The senators stopped by the facility in suburban Broadview on Friday, requesting a tour of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility and to deliver supplies to protesters who have been demonstrating at the site for weeks.

Their visit coincides with a ruling that the fencing installed at the site must be taken down. A federal judge late Thursday ordered Ice to remove an 8ft-tall (2.4 meters) fence outside the Broadview facility after the Village of Broadview said it illegally blocks a public street.

Both senators spoke to the local NBC News affiliate while there and have pushed for answers and called for oversight into the conditions inside the facility.

“We just want to go in and look at the facility and see what the conditions are and they would not let us in. It is shameful,” Duckworth said.

“They’ve refused to tell us this information,” Durbin stated. “I’ve done this job for a few years now, I’ve never had this stonewalling by any presidential administration.”

“What are you afraid of?” Duckworth said to reporters, referring to the government. “You don’t hide, you don’t run away when you’re proud of what you’re doing.”

The senators said they have congressional oversight authority.

“Something is going on in there they don’t want us to see,” Durbin said. “I don’t know what it is.”

To the south, in Tennessee, at least nine armed guard members began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, a Memphis landmark, about a mile (1.6km) from historic Beale Street and FedExForum, where the NBA’s Grizzlies play.

They also were at a nearby tourist welcome center along the Mississippi River. Wearing guard fatigues and protective vests labeled “military police”, the troops were escorted by a local police officer and posed for photos with visitors.

Trump has sent or discussed sending troops to other cities as well, including Baltimore; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The federal government says the troops support immigration agents and protect federal property.

The guard troops in Memphis remain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.

By contrast, Trump has attempted to deploy national guard troops – including some from Texas and California – in Portland and Chicago after taking control of them himself, over objections from state and local leaders who say such interference violates their sovereignty and federal law. Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.

The US district judge April Perry in Chicago said the Trump administration had violated the 10th amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th amendment, which assures due process and equal protection, when he ordered national guard troops to that city.

In a written order Friday explaining her rationale, Perry noted the nation’s long aversion to having military involvement in domestic policing.

“Not even the Founding Father most ardently in favor of a strong federal government” – referring to Alexander Hamilton – “believed that one state’s militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” Perry wrote.

“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.

An earlier court battle in Oregon delayed a similar troop deployment to Portland. The 9th US circuit court of appeals heard arguments in that case Thursday.

Lt Cmdr Teresa Meadows, a spokesperson for US northern command, said the troops sent to Portland and Chicago are “not conducting any operational activities at this time”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3369c14ac045b44fc198005afcd52efd994da41f/483_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ae0103029435ab57fff1cde4f9139fb",N,,2025-10-12 02:56:40.876057

Demonstrators gathered near 25th Avenue and Harvard Street, where they called out federal agents and the Trump administration's immigration enforcement campaign called ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

Alexis Garcia, a Bolingbrook resident who was among the crowd, said she was feeling a wave of emotions.

“Sad and anger, just feeling hopeless at the same time, but hopeful. It’s just a lot of emotions,” she said. “Being Mexican right now, it's just a sensitive time for us.”

She brought her dad to Broadview for the first time.

“I share how I feel with my peers, with my family and educate him with what’s happening because he deserves to know, just like the whole world deserves to know what’s really happening,” she said.

As the sun began to set, Illinois State Police tried to disperse the crowd, enforcing an executive order signed by the village's mayor to limit protesting hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

“We’re agitated by this restriction, by the way,” said Dr. Alli Muhammad, national leader of the Revolutionary Black Panther Party. “We feel that the mayor of Broadview, she considers herself an ally, but we’re not comfortable with this 9 to 6 curfew, so we’re going to present this cease and desist to remove the curfew.”

Earlier in the day, religious leaders marched from St. Eulalia Catholic Church in Maywood to the processing facility during a eucharistic procession.

Clergy members arrived, praying for the people detained and even attempted to serve communion to those inside but they were denied access.

U.S. Senator Dick Durbin joined faith-based leaders and community members for a service at the church before the procession.

“I am here as an elected representative with this organization and these people to tell them what is going on. The fear and hatred is giving rise—this is not America,” he said. “We’re better than that, this is not what Chicago is all about and shouldn’t be—we’re a great city and a great nation, and we will stand up to them.”

The decision partially upheld a lower court ruling that blocked the deployment of troops in the Chicago area, which said it was ""likely to lead to civil unrest"" and ""only add fuel to the fire"".

Trump has previously sent the National Guard to other Democratic-led cities, such as Los Angeles, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon.

He has argued troops were needed to crack down on illegal immigration and crime, but local officials have filed lawsuits accusing him of exceeding his legal authority.

Chicago has been a particular flashpoint since the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz in September to detain and deport undocumented migrants.

Trump's September deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon is still being challenged in the courts.

Last week, it was blocked by Oregon District Judge Karin Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term in the White House.

She wrote that the administration's justification for the deployment ""was simply untethered to the facts"".

”Now this new ruling seeks to stop us from protecting our ICE Broadview facility, the detainees being processed in it, and our law enforcement officers,” McLaughlin said in an emailed statement.

“There are so many words we could use here, but it is volatile.
Broadview residents are scared as ICE facility becomes a battleground for Trump immigration blitz “Our understanding is that a Greyhound bus can fit through that gate,” said attorney Thomas Walsh of the U.S. attorney’s office’s civil litigation division.","A federal judge has ruled that a controversial security fence constructed around the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Broadview is violating the west suburb’s right to access its own land and ordered its removal.

In a ruling Thursday night, U.S. District Judge LaShonda Hunt said it was clear from the government’s own arguments that “there is no plan to take the fence down and that ‘Operation Midway Blitz‘ currently has no end in sight.”

In addition, the judge said, ICE acting Director Todd Lyons wrote in a letter to the village that the agency has an issue with “unlawful assemblies” of protesters and there “will be no change in our operational posture” until the demonstrations stop.

“In other words, the (defendants’) current operations are indefinite and the protests — which Acting Director Lyons seemingly considers to fall into the category of ‘unlawful activities’ — will undoubtedly continue,” Hunt wrote in her opinion. “Under these circumstances, the court concludes that because the persistent protests are a direct response to the defendants’ ongoing operations, there is no reason to believe that they will end and that the fence will be voluntarily removed any time soon.”

The fence must be removed by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, the judge ordered.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a written statement the ruling was “a decisive win for public safety.”

“The judge’s decision confirms that the illegal fence constructed by ICE is not only a clear defiance of Broadview’s ordinance but an unacceptable and escalating risk to our Beach Street businesses, their customers, and our first responders,” Thompson wrote. “The law of probability dictates that the danger increases daily. The court has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge’s order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, decried “activist judges” and local leaders she says are attempting to stop lawful immigration enforcement.

”Now this new ruling seeks to stop us from protecting our ICE Broadview facility, the detainees being processed in it, and our law enforcement officers,” McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. “It is shameful that this is coming less than one week after the attack by domestic terrorists who rammed their cars into our DHS officers’ vehicles.”

The fence, she said, was extended only after “rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.”

The village of Broadview last week filed a motion for a restraining order requiring the removal of the 8-foot-tall fence, which was constructed around the temporary holding facility on Beach Street that has seen daily protests and federal agents using tear gas and other weapons on crowds.

During arguments in the lawsuit Tuesday, Hunt began by warning both sides she didn’t want to get caught up in the politics of the moment.

“It is very charged, it is very challenging,” Hunt said. “There are so many words we could use here, but it is volatile. But those issues are not before me.”

Attorneys for Broadview argued that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, constructed the fence “in the middle of the night without notice,” and that it not only physically deprives the village of its right to control its own land, but constitutes a public safety hazard by blocking emergency service personnel and vehicles from reaching several commercial and industrial properties located on the other side.

Lawyers for the government, meanwhile, said the village still has access to the area through a key-card gate on another street, and that complaints that the gate was too small for fire trucks did not hold water.

Broadview residents are scared as ICE facility becomes a battleground for Trump immigration blitz

“Our understanding is that a Greyhound bus can fit through that gate,” said attorney Thomas Walsh of the U.S. attorney’s office’s civil litigation division.

Walsh said the government had “no other option” than to put up the fence because protesters were gathering day after day and accosting law enforcement outside the facility, inciting violence and slashing tires of ICE vehicles pulling in and out of a secure lot.

“This went on for weeks,” Walsh said. “If the fence comes down, it is very foreseeable that the same kind of violence is going to occur.”

That filing also hinted at the possibility of additional dismissals if the closure in Washington continues.

The Trump administration said it had targeted more than 1,400 employees at the Treasury Department, and nearly 1,200 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, where notices started to reach some workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by late Friday.

The administration also proceeded with layoffs at the Commerce Department, the Education Department, the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to the court filing, which indicated that the cuts at many of those agencies would range into the hundreds.

By seeking to oust civil servants during a shutdown, Mr. Trump risked a costly escalation in a fiscal stalemate that has no end in sight. Speaking in the Oval Office on Friday, the president blamed Democrats, as he estimated that “a lot” of workers would be affected and asserted the layoffs would be “Democrat-oriented.”

The 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals did, however, grant a temporary stay on a portion of U.S. District Judge April Perry’s order involving the federalization of the National Guard within Illinois.
“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the court order said.
“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.
“I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.” Gov.","A federal appeals court in Chicago on Saturday denied the Trump administration’s request for an emergency stay of a district judge’s order barring the president from deploying National Guard troops in the city and state.

The 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals did, however, grant a temporary stay on a portion of U.S. District Judge April Perry’s order involving the federalization of the National Guard within Illinois.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the court order said.

The ruling keeps in effect Perry’s granting of a temporary restraining order Thursday halting President Donald Trump’s plan to send federalized National Guard troops into the Chicago area to act as a security force during the administration’s controversial immigration enforcement action known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The Department of Justice argued in a filing Friday night that Perry’s order “improperly impinges on the Commander in Chief’s supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the field, and endangers federal personnel and property.”

The 20-page motion asked the higher court to freeze Perry’s order while an appeal is pending, saying the National Guard should be allowed to “protect federal personnel and property” while the litigation continues to play out.

In a response on Saturday, attorneys for Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said Perry was correct in halting Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional plan to dispatch federalized troops to Chicago with no clearly defined scope of the mission, its duration, or any “provable factual underpinning.”

It was clear, the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued, that “absent an injunction, the federal government could and would use the troops consistent with the unbounded scope of the federalization orders — that is, to assist any federal agency on any federal mission that is occurring anywhere in Illinois.”

The dueling motions were a clear indication that the legal battle over Trump’s National Guard plans is far from over.

Perry on Thursday blocked Trump from deploying National Guard troops to the city and state, saying she had no faith in the government’s claims of out-of-control violence and that it was federal agents who started it by aggressively targeting protesters with tear gas and militaristic tactics.

Trump has claimed ongoing violence and clashes between protesters and immigration agents in Chicago and other U.S. cities justified sending federalized troops onto the streets as security, even as local and state officials accused the president of manufacturing a crisis to justify unnecessary — and unprecedented — force.

In her oral ruling from the bench, Perry, a Biden appointee, said National Guard troops are “not trained in de-escalation or other extremely important law enforcement functions that would help to quell these problems,” and that allowing troops to come into Chicago “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

The judge also said the Trump administration’s attempts to cast protesters as violent rebels “cannot be aligned” with the view of local officials. Perry said she had no faith in the declarations of federal officials submitted to the court due in large part of a growing body of evidence that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s views are “simply unreliable.”

Perry cited several assault cases that had been dismissed against protesters and other orders from federal judges in Chicago entered against DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.

Perry also said a rebellion is defined as “a deliberate organized resistance openly opposing the laws and government as a whole” by means of armed violence. “I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Gov. JB Pritzker cheered the ruling in a statement on social media, writing, ”Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law.”

A spokesperson for Trump, meanwhile, said the judge got it wrong.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an emailed statement. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

(AP) — The Trump administration is pushing again to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, and hasn’t given up on moving him to Eswatini or Ghana even though both have rejected the idea, an immigration official told a judge Friday.

Abrego Garcia has challenged efforts to re-deport him to a third country after the government admitted that a previous order prevents his deportation to his home country of El Salvador. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said recently that it plans to deport him to the southern African country of Eswatini.

WATCH: Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s attorney discusses his case amid new deportation effort

The case has come to represent the bitter partisan struggle over the President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration policy and mass deportation agenda.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland will decide whether Abrego Garcia should remain in custody or be released from immigration detention while his challenge moves forward. She ordered government officials to explain the steps they have taken to remove Abrego Garcia to another country.

An ICE official told the judge during a hearing Friday that the government was continuing to talk with officials in Eswatini about sending him there even though the country rejected the idea this week.

He said his understanding is that the administration also was still in discussions with Ghana. However, Ghana’s foreign minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, posted on social media Friday that the nation will not accept Abrego Garcia.

Abrego Garcia could be removed within 72 hours if the judge allows it and once the administration receives approval from a third country, said John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who helps oversee removals for ICE.

“We could quickly operationalize the removal,” Schultz said.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have charged that the Republican administration is trying to illegally use the immigration system to punish him after the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.

Meanwhile, attorneys in criminal court in Tennessee have made similar claims about retribution in the human smuggling charges brought against Abrego Garcia in June on the day he was returned to the U.S. from El Salvador. The Tennessee judge has concluded that Abrego Garcia’s prosecution may be an illegal retaliation after he successfully sued the Trump administration over his deportation.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was not charged at the time, and agents did not begin investigating the stop until earlier this year after his wife sued over his deportation.

At a Friday hearing in Nashville, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw said he will hear evidence on the motion to dismiss the charges on Nov. 3.

In addition, defense attorneys said they intend to file a motion asking that statements unrelated to the smuggling charges be removed from the indictment. Attorney Jenna Dabbs cited allegations that her client is a member of the MS-13 gang as an example of the extraneous accusations that are not relevant to the actual charges.

Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Abrego Garcia, repeatedly referring to him as a member of MS-13, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

Witnesses said agents came in two waves at the Transportation Network Provider – or TNP – Alpha lot on Friday; once in the morning and again in the afternoon. The TNP lot is a designated area for rideshare drivers to park and wait for clients at the airport.

Video obtained by CBS News Chicago showed agents interrogating and detaining drivers.

One Uber driver from Guatemala said he was eating lunch when agents walked up to him and asked him if he was a U.S. citizen. The driver said he was nervous but rebuffed the agents' request.

""You know, I cannot help you, please let me eat my food,"" the driver said he told the agents.

The agents walked away, the man said, but other people were detained and taken away.

Another driver, Jack, recounted what happened and described the scene as chaotic.

""Just grabbing people, checking IDs. They arrested like, what I seen, a bunch of people. They had vans and stuff like that,"" he said.

CBS News Chicago reached out to the Department of Homeland Security asking about the incident but has not yet heard back.

Consulate urges Chicago Marathon runners from Mexico to take precautions

Many people arriving at O'Hare this week are coming for Sunday's Chicago Marathon.

Of the 50,000 runners participating in the race, 3,000 are from Mexico – the largest contingent of runners from outside the U.S.

The Mexican Consulate in Chicago is among many organizations hosting a cheer zone along the marathon route.

""This year it feels different,"" said Reyna Torres Medivil, the Consul General of Mexico in Chicago.

The agency said it has received calls and emails from runners and their family and friends voicing concerns about ICE enforcement while they're in Chicago. The agency is telling people visiting from Mexico to have copies of documentation on their person.

""We have been advising them that they should carry a photograph of their passports in their telephones, but also perhaps a photocopy in your pocket. It's better to be safe,"" Torres Medivil said.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/11/f9e97f2b-7196-484b-8a9a-f2b6ce06df74/thumbnail/1200x630/baa67cf4526a4c1e9eb3ffbcb34067dd/screenshot-2025-10-10-213814.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 17:57:37.317826

The U.N.'s warnings come amid a broader ideological clash.
""Our actions are consistent with U.S. law and the will of the American people, who demand secure borders and a lawful immigration system,"" Pigott said.","Recent actions by the Trump administration, including deep cuts to international aid and a sweeping immigration crackdown, have drawn sharp criticism from United Nations officials, who warn the U.S. may be violating international law.

Filippo Grandi, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, voiced his concerns this week over the U.S. policy of deporting migrants and asylum seekers to countries where they could face harm. He said the administration's approach is inconsistent with international legal principles designed to protect refugees.

""I am worried that the current debate, in Europe for example. and some current deportation practices, such as in the United States, address real challenges in manners not consistent with international law,"" Grandi said on Oct. 7, as reported by The Associated Press.

Grandi also criticized what he described as a growing disregard for international law among developed nations and emphasized that poorer countries continue to carry most of the global refugee burden. Speaking at the opening of UNHCR's executive committee, he urged world leaders not to use politics or nationalism as an excuse to dismantle long-standing protections for displaced people.

""Pressures to reform asylum are not made in good faith, but represent yet another attack on international solidarity, at the time when many countries continue to welcome refugees,"" Grandi said.

Grandi's warning comes as the U.N. refugee agency itself faces major setbacks. As a result of sharp U.S. funding cuts under the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" passed in July, the UNHCR was forced to eliminate nearly 5,000 jobs this year — almost a quarter of its global workforce.

""This was certainly not an easy year for any of us,"" Grandi said.

A pattern of criticism from U.N. officials

This isn't the first time the Trump administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from U.N. officials. In May, Volker Türk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, raised alarms over the scale and conditions of U.S. deportations.

Türk said his office had received reports from lawyers and families alleging serious human rights violations, including lack of due process, arbitrary detention, and deportations that exposed individuals to torture or other irreparable harm.

""This situation raises serious concerns regarding a wide array of rights that are fundamental to both U.S. and international law,"" Türk said.

The U.N.'s warnings come amid a broader ideological clash. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, President Trump delivered a speech denouncing the U.N.'s ""globalist migration agenda,"" and called on countries to close their borders and expel foreigners.

""It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders,"" Trump said, according to The Guardian. ""You have to end it now. Your countries are going to hell.""

The administration also claimed the global asylum system has been abused and needs to be overhauled.

In response to the criticism, U.S. State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott defended the administration's stance, framing Trump's remarks as a rejection of international pressure.

""Our actions are consistent with U.S. law and the will of the American people, who demand secure borders and a lawful immigration system,"" Pigott said. He added that Trump's U.N. speech was ""a call to action against the destructive policies promoting mass and illegal migration that globalist bureaucrats have pushed for years.""",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/583820/us-president-donald-trump-speaks-united-nations.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 17:57:24.840431
