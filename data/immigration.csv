The order comes in a case, brought by a taxpayer advocacy group, that challenged an I.R.S. decision to provide migrants’ addresses, as included on their tax returns, to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Federal law tightly controls the use of taxpayer information, and several top I.R.S. officials quit this spring over concerns that giving tax records to ICE on a large scale could be illegal.

Still, officials from the two agencies worked for months to create a process for ICE officials to access addresses on record with the I.R.S. In June, ICE asked the I.R.S. for information on roughly 1.3 million people, and in August, the I.R.S. turned over the last known addresses of roughly 47,000 people, according to court documents.

Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, nominated by former President Bill Clinton, said on Friday that the I.R.S. plan to share information with ICE was too broad. She said that federal law only allows for the I.R.S. to share tax information with other government officials who are directly involved in an ongoing investigation. The I.R.S. sent the thousands of addresses to a single ICE official, who Judge Kollar-Kotelly said could not have been personally conducting so many investigations.

“Plaintiffs have shown that the I.R.S.’s disclosure of confidential taxpayer address information to ICE was contrary to law,” Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote.

The judge paused the existing data-sharing agreement between I.R.S. and ICE and said she would need to review any other attempts to share taxpayer information. Previously, she had ordered the I.R.S. to disclose any other ICE requests for tax records.

The I.R.S. has long encouraged undocumented migrants to file a tax return, and many tax lawyers and immigration activists had trusted the agency would not use tax information to deport people. In a report, the Yale Budget Lab estimates that in 2023, unauthorized immigrant workers paid $66 billion in federal taxes, with roughly $43 billion of that taking the form of the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/21/multimedia/21dc-irsmigrants-vpgq/21dc-irsmigrants-vpgq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 02:56:33.521275

DHS Used Customs Investigations Authority to Demand Social Media Account Information Totally Unrelated to Enforcing Trade Laws

Text of the Letter (PDF)

Washington, D.C. – Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to stop using a trade enforcement law to demand social media account information in investigations totally unrelated to trade.

DHS demanded Meta reveal the owner of an Instagram account that criticized Trump administration immigration policies, citing federal customs summons authority. The order is being challenged by the account owner, represented by the ACLU.

“DHS apparently is trying to expose an individual’s identity in order to chill criticism of the Trump Administration’s immigration policies. That is a profound misuse of the limited customs authority granted” under the law, Wyden wrote.

In 2017, the first Trump administration attempted to use customs summons authority to unmask the owner of a Twitter account that was critical of federal immigration policy. DHS later rescinded its request amid widespread criticism. The DHS Office of Inspector General ultimately determined the request likely exceeded the agency’s legal authority.

Prison teachers and medical staff are being forced to step in as corrections officers on a regular basis.
“I have never seen it like this in all my 25 years,” an officer in Texas told ProPublica.
“This is, from what I can remember, the biggest exodus of younger staff, staff who are not retirement-eligible,” she said.
While ICE agents and corrections officers continued bringing home paychecks, thousands of prison teachers, plumbers and nurses did not.","After years of struggling to find enough workers for some of the nation’s toughest lockups, the Federal Bureau of Prisons is facing a new challenge: Corrections officers are jumping ship for more lucrative jobs at Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This is one of the unintended consequences of the Trump administration’s focus on mass deportations. For months, ICE has been on a recruiting blitz, offering $50,000 starting bonuses and tuition reimbursement at an agency that has long offered better pay than the federal prison system. For many corrections officers, it’s been an easy sell.

Workers at detention centers and maximum-security prisons from Florida to Minnesota to California counted off the number of co-workers who’d left for ICE or were in the process of doing so. Six at one lockup in Texas, eight at another. More than a dozen at one California facility, and over four dozen at a larger one. After retirements and other attrition, by the start of November the agency had lost at least 1,400 more staff this year than it had hired, according to internal prison data shared with ProPublica.

“We’re broken and we’re being poached by ICE,” one official with the prison workers union told ProPublica. “It’s unbelievable. People are leaving in droves.”

The exodus comes amid shortages of critical supplies, from food to personal hygiene items, and threatens to make the already grim conditions in federal prisons even worse. Fewer corrections officers means more lockdowns, less programming and fewer health care services for inmates, along with more risks to staff and more grueling hours of mandatory overtime. Prison teachers and medical staff are being forced to step in as corrections officers on a regular basis.

And at some facilities, staff said the agency had even stopped providing basic hygiene items for officers, such as paper towels, soap and toilet paper.

“I have never seen it like this in all my 25 years,” an officer in Texas told ProPublica. “You have to literally go around carrying your own roll of toilet paper. No paper towels, you have to bring your own stuff. No soap. I even ordered little sheets that you put in an envelope and it turns to soap because there wasn’t any soap.”

The prisons bureau did not answer a series of emailed questions. In a video posted Wednesday afternoon, Deputy Director Josh Smith said that the agency was “left in shambles by the previous administration” and would take years to repair. Staffing levels, he said, were “catastrophic,” which, along with crumbling infrastructure and corruption, had made the prisons less safe.

Smith said that he and Director William Marshall III had been empowered by the Trump administration to “confront these challenges head-on.” “Transparency and accountability are the cornerstones of our mission to make the BOP great again, and we’re going to expose the truth and hold those responsible accountable.”

ICE, meanwhile, responded to a request for comment by forwarding a press release that failed to answer specific questions but noted that the agency had made more than 18,000 total tentative job offers as of mid-September.

The BOP has long faced challenges, from sex abuse scandals and contraband problems to crumbling infrastructure and poor medical care. It has repeatedly been deemed the worst federal workplace by one analysis of annual employee surveys, and in 2023 union officials said that some 40% of corrections officer jobs sat vacant.

That dearth of officers helped land the prison system on a government list of high-risk agencies with serious vulnerabilities and attracted the eye of oversight officials, who blamed chronic understaffing for contributing to at least 30 prisoner deaths.

The bureau tried tackling the problem with a long-term hiring push that included signing bonuses, retention pay and a fast-tracked hiring process. By the start of the year, that effort seemed to be working.

Kathleen Toomey, then the bureau’s associate deputy director, told members of Congress in February that the agency had just enjoyed its most successful hiring spree in a decade, increasing its ranks by more than 1,200 in 2024.

“Higher staffing levels make institutions safer,” she told a House appropriations subcommittee.

But the costly efforts to reel in more staff strained a stagnant budget that was already stretched thin. Toomey told Congress the bureau had not seen a funding increase since 2023, even as it absorbed millions in pay raises and retention incentives. As inflation and personnel costs rose, the bureau was forced to cut its operating budgets by 20%, Toomey said.

And despite some improvement, the staffing problems persisted. In her February testimony, Toomey acknowledged there were still at least 4,000 vacant positions, leaving the agency with so few officers that prison teachers, nurses and electricians were regularly being ordered to abandon their normal duties and fill in as corrections officers.

Then ICE rolled out its recruiting drive.

“At first it seemed like it was going to be no big deal, and then over the last week or so we already lost five, and then we have another 10 to 15 in various stages of waiting for a start date,” an employee at one low-security facility told ProPublica in October. “For us that’s almost 20% of our custody staff.”

He, like most of the prison workers and union officials who spoke to ProPublica, asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation — a concern that has grown since the agency canceled the union’s contract in September following an executive order. Now union leaders say they’ve been warned that without their union protections, they could be punished for speaking to the media.

After the contract’s cancellation, many of the current staff who had originally spoken on the record asked to have their names withheld. Those who still agreed to be identified asked ProPublica to note that their interviews took place before the agency revoked the union agreement.

Earlier this year, Brandy Moore White, national president of the prison workers union, said it’s not unprecedented to see a string of prison staffers leaving the agency, often in response to changes that significantly impact their working conditions. Prior government shutdowns, changes in leadership and the pandemic all drove away workers — but usually, she said, people leaving the agency en masse tended to be near the end of their careers. Now, that’s not the case.

“This is, from what I can remember, the biggest exodus of younger staff, staff who are not retirement-eligible,” she said. “And that’s super concerning to me.”

ICE’s expansion has even thrown a wrench into BOP’s usual training program for rookies. Normally, new officers have to take a three-week Introduction to Correctional Techniques course at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers in Georgia within their first 60 days on the job, according to the prisons bureau’s website. In August, FLETC announced that it would focus only on “surge-related training,” pausing programs for other law enforcement agencies until at least early 2026, according to an internal email obtained by ProPublica. Afterward, FLETC said in a press release that it was “exploring temporary solutions” to “meet the needs of all partner agencies,” though it’s not clear whether any of those solutions have since been implemented. The centers did not respond to emailed requests for comment.

At the same time, the effects of the budget crunch were starting to show. In recent months, more than 40 staff and prisoners at facilities across the country have reported cutbacks even more severe than the usual prison scarcities.

In September, Moore White told ProPublica some prisons had fallen behind on utility and trash bills. At one point, she said, the prison complex in Oakdale, Louisiana, was days away from running out of food for inmates before the union — worried that hungry prisoners would be more apt to riot — intervened, nudging agency higher-ups to address the problem, an account confirmed by two other prison workers. (Officials at the prison complex declined to comment.) Elsewhere, staff and prisoners reported shortages — no eggs in a California facility and no beef in a Texas lockup where staff said they were doling out smaller portions at mealtimes.

Earlier this year, a defense lawyer complained that the Los Angeles detention center ran out of pens for prisoners in solitary confinement, where people without phone or e-messaging privileges rely on snail mail to contact the outside world. One of his clients was “rationing his ink to write letters to his family,” the attorney said. The center didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Personal hygiene supplies have been running low, too. Several prisoners said their facilities had become stingier than usual with toilet paper, and women incarcerated in Carswell in Texas reported a shortage of tampons. “I was told to use my socks,” one said. The facility did not answer questions from ProPublica about conditions there.

Fewer staff has meant in some cases that inmates have lost access to care. At the prison complex in Victorville, California, staff lodged written complaints accusing the warden of skimping on the number of officers assigned to inmate hospital visits in order to cut back on overtime. (The complex did not respond to a request for comment.) In some instances, the complaints alleged, that left so few officers at the hospital that ailing inmates missed the procedures that had landed them there in the first place.

Chyann Bratcher, a prisoner at Carswell, a medical lockup in Texas, said she missed an appointment for rectal surgery — something she’d been waiting on for two years — because there weren’t enough staff to take her there. She was able to have the procedure almost two months later, after another cancellation.

Staffers say several facilities have started scheduling recurring “blackout” days, when officers are banned from working overtime in an effort to save money. Instead, prison officials turn to a practice known as “augmentation,” where they direct teachers, plumbers and medical staff to fill in as corrections officers.

“That’s why I left,” said Tom Kamm, who retired in September from the federal prison in Pekin, Illinois, after 29 years with the bureau. “My job was to try to settle EEO complaints, so if somebody alleged discrimination against the agency it was my job to look into it and try to resolve it.”

When he found out earlier this year that he would soon be required to work two shifts per week as a corrections officer, he decided to retire instead.

“I hadn’t been an officer in a housing unit since like 2001 — it had been like 24 years,” he said. “I had really no clue how to do that anymore.”

Augmentation isn’t new, but staff and prisoners at some facilities say it’s being used more often than it once was. It also means fewer medical staff available to address inmates’ needs. “Today we had a Physical Therapist as a unit officer so all of his PT appointments would have been cancelled,” Brian Casper, an inmate at the federal medical prison in Missouri, wrote in an email earlier this year. “Yesterday one of the other units had the head of Radiology for the unit officer so there would have been one less person doing x-rays and CT scans.” The prison didn’t respond to emailed questions.

When the government shutdown hit in October, it only made the situation worse, exacerbating the shortages and increasing the allure of leaving the bureau. While ICE agents and corrections officers continued bringing home paychecks, thousands of prison teachers, plumbers and nurses did not.

The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the domestic policy megabill that Trump signed into law on July 4, could offer some financial support for the agency’s staffing woes, as it will route another $5 billion to the prisons bureau over four years — $3 billion of which is specifically earmarked to improve retention, hiring and training. Yet exactly what the effects of that cash infusion will look like remains to be seen: Though the funding bill passed more than four months ago, in November the bureau declined to answer questions about when it will receive the money or how it will be spent.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bop-ice-diptych.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-11-22 01:56:46.036768

The framework has raised concerns because it would allow ultra-wealthy applicants to purchase visas typically reserved for top-tier, high-skilled workers. “If those visas are being used by people who simply have the money to pay…, I don’t think that’s a positive for the country.

Trump, who last week announced he was withdrawing his support of Greene, appeared to celebrate her resignation. “I think it’s great news for the country. It’s great,” he told an ABC News reporter.

When asked if Greene had informed him, Trump said: “Nah, it doesn’t matter, you know, but I think it’s great. I think she should be happy.”

Greene had said last week she was the subject of “a hotbed of threats” after Trump withdrew his support for and endorsement of her.

Greene reiterated those threats in her statement, saying she had faced “never-ending personal attacks, death threats, lawfare, ridiculous slander and lies about me, that most people could never withstand even for a day”.

Texas congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat, posted on social media: “I’m going to be honest … I didn’t see this coming but the threats that come with being on the opposite side of Trump ARE REAL!”

The move sent shockwaves through US politics. The Republican political strategist Shermichael Singleton called it “a big shocker”.

“Maybe she’s looking at future plans,” Singleton told CNN.

Greene may have an ally in Democratic congressman Ro Khanna, who worked with her to pass the bill to release the files related to the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein.

“MTG is likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate,” Khanna told NBC News. “Her stances on Epstein, on regulating AI, and anti-war are more in touch with MAGA voters than JD Vance.”

Some observers couldn’t help but point out the strange turn of events – a one-time Trump ally resigning hours after an Oval Office meeting in which Trump heaped praise on Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City whom he had called a “100% Communist Lunatic”.

“Trump glazed Mamdani so hard Marjorie Taylor Greene resigned from Congress,” Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic National Committee vice chair, wrote on X.

Shawn Harris, a Georgia Democrat running for Congress in Greene’s solidly Republican district, sought to rally supporters in response to the announcement.

“As you’ve likely heard, Marjorie Taylor Greene has announced her resignation effective January 5, 2026,” Harris said in a post on social media on Friday. “Get ready Georgia! Teachers, farmers, veterans, EVERYONE, I need your support.”

The plaintiffs had argued that by sharing taxpayer data with ICE, immigrants were disincentivized to pay taxes, fearing harassment or deportation.
“The privacy laws enacted in the post-Watergate era exist to prevent abuses of power like this and yet leaders in the IRS and ICE launched this effort.
Paying your taxes does not forfeit your right to privacy.” The decision Friday expanded a September ruling from Kollar-Kotelly that ordered the IRS to provide the court and plaintiffs with 24 hours notice when sharing massive amounts of taxpayer data with ICE.
Court documents released last month revealed an ICE request for nearly 1.3 million taxpayer records.","The IRS can no longer share taxpayer addresses with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a federal judge ruled Friday that that element of the data-sharing pact between the agencies is likely unlawful.

In a 94-page decision, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia found that the IRS’s agreement to provide ICE with requested taxpayer addresses violated the Administrative Procedure Act on how agencies propose and enact regulations.

The judge also ruled that IRS’s implementation of the policy was “arbitrary and capricious,” writing that the tax agency failed to adequately explain why it deviated from its previous policy of “strict confidentiality.”

The plaintiffs in the case — the Center for Taxpayer Rights, Main Street Alliance, the National Federation of Federal Employees and the Communications Workers of America — maintained from the start that the IRS’s disclosure of taxpayer data to ICE without their consent was a violation of privacy requirements in federal tax code.

Judge Kollar-Kotelly agreed with that assertion, writing in her opinion that the IRS’s “unlawful conduct” made it likely that the plaintiffs and their members would “suffer irreparable harm.” She pointed specifically to a “significant decline in interest and engagement” with the Center for Taxpayer Rights, whose pro-bono tax services have long been utilized by taxpaying immigrants.

Without those customers, the judge noted, the low-income tax clinic’s federal funding could be in jeopardy. The plaintiffs had argued that by sharing taxpayer data with ICE, immigrants were disincentivized to pay taxes, fearing harassment or deportation. The judge backed plaintiffs’ claim that immigrants “face an imminent risk that the confidential address information they have provided to the IRS will be impermissibly used by ICE for civil immigration enforcement.”

Regarding the broader data-sharing deal between the IRS and ICE, Judge Kollar-Kotelly said that plaintiffs’ APA claim “should not be dismissed,” but she couldn’t issue similar relief given that the APA “affords a meaningful and adequate basis for judicial review” of the data policy and there has been a “failure to state a claim.”

Democracy Forward, which represents the plaintiffs and filed the emergency motion to halt the IRS’s data-sharing pact with ICE, applauded the ruling. Skye Perryman, president and CEO of the nonprofit legal services group, said in a statement that the case was all about “holding the administration accountable and protecting the privacy of millions of Americans.”

“This is an important win for millions of people in America whose information has been threatened by the Trump-Vance administration, and represents the first injunction against this unlawful data sharing,” Perryman said. “The privacy laws enacted in the post-Watergate era exist to prevent abuses of power like this and yet leaders in the IRS and ICE launched this effort. Paying your taxes does not forfeit your right to privacy.”

Missouri Republicans have already employed a sprawling array of tactics to block the referendum.
Hanaway herself filed a federal lawsuit claiming Missouri voters cannot legally overturn congressional maps at all.
And a GOP-aligned out-of-state PAC has also been caught offering cash bonuses to poach canvassers and disrupt the referendum campaign.","In a stunning escalation over the Missouri GOP’s gerrymander, Attorney General Catherine Hanaway (R) publicly announced she has referred the state’s grassroots referendum campaign to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), claiming without evidence that canvassers are “employing illegal aliens” to collect signatures to overturn the mid-decade redraw.

“Out-of-state signature collectors are reportedly employing illegal aliens in their efforts to undermine the will of the people’s elected representatives. We’ve launched an investigation into Advanced Micro Targeting,” Hanaway posted on X Thursday evening. “If anyone is creating an environment for exploitation and human trafficking to thrive, we will hold them accountable. We have referred this matter to ICE.”

Hanaway offered no evidence to support any of the allegations in her post, and did not immediately respond to Democracy Docket’s request for comment. Her office has not released documents or reports substanting her claim that the canvassing firm — Advanced Micro Targeting, which is legally contracted to gather signatures for the People Not Politicians (PNP) referendum — employs undocumented workers.

Hanaway’s posts echo key talking points from national Republican operatives attempting to derail direct democracy by casting ordinary petition circulators as nefarious outsiders. But her decision to add federal immigration enforcement — and the language of “human trafficking” — marks a dramatic and potentially dangerous turn.

Missouri Sen. Minority Leader Doug Beck (D) has already filed a misconduct complaint against Hanaway for a separate action — naming the entire Missouri General Assembly as plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit attempting to block the referendum, without legislative authorization.

Beck argues she violated ethical rules by misrepresenting her client and usurping the legislature’s power.

The timing is not subtle. PNP is in the final stretch of collecting signatures for a veto referendum that would suspend House Bill 1 — the mid-decade GOP redraw designed to lock in a 7–1 Republican congressional map — and put it before voters in 2026.

“Just the latest example of desperate politicians seeking to silence the voices of Missourians. It is outrageous and dangerous,” PNP director Richard von Glahn told Democracy Docket Friday. “We’re not backing down. We will defend First Amendment rights. We will qualify this referendum.”

The campaign has already pulled in more than 200,000 signatures, well above the required threshold, despite rolling GOP obstruction efforts.

Missouri Republicans have already employed a sprawling array of tactics to block the referendum. Secretary of State Denny Hoskins (R) threw out tens of thousands of signatures as “premature” and imposed a misleading ballot summary that is now the subject of a separate lawsuit.

Hanaway herself filed a federal lawsuit claiming Missouri voters cannot legally overturn congressional maps at all.

And a GOP-aligned out-of-state PAC has also been caught offering cash bonuses to poach canvassers and disrupt the referendum campaign. They have also been accused of launching a defamatory smear against the referendum canvassing firm.

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

But how many migrants would be affected by Trump's announcement that he wants to end temporary protective status could be very small. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Congress created the program granting Temporary Protective Status in 1990. It was meant to prevent deportations of people to countries suffering from natural disasters, civil strife or other dangerous conditions.

The designation can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary and is granted in 18-month increments.

The president announced his decision on his social media site, suggesting that Minnesota was “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”

“Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from,” Trump wrote. “It’s OVER!”

The president wrote on his Truth Social platform that he was ""terminating effective immediately, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS Program) for Somalis in Minnesota.""

Mr. Trump said, without providing evidence, that ""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State.""

He also accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, without proof, of overseeing a state that had become a ""hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.""

""Send them back to where they came from,"" he said. ""It's OVER!""

In response, Walz said in a social media post on X, ""It's not surprising that the President has chosen to broadly target an entire community. This is what he does to change the subject.""

The president did not provide further details on the move.

TPS is a federal program that allows migrants from unstable countries to live and work legally in the U.S.

Somalia's TPS designation runs through March 17, 2026, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency that is part of the Department of Homeland Security. As of March 31, there are 705 Somali immigrants in the U.S. approved for TPS, according to Congress.gov. Minnesota also has the largest Somali population in the U.S., the Associated Press reports.

CBS News has reached out to DHS and Walz for comment.

The Trump administration has also moved to end TPS protections for Afghan, Venezuelan, Syrian and South Sudanese nationals. Those actions have faced significant legal challenges.

Republican Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, who represents Cold Spring, said in a written statement that she's ""glad"" that Mr. Trump recognizes the ""seriousness of the fraud problem"" in the state.

""The unfortunate reality is that far too many individuals who were welcomed into this country have abused the trust and support that was extended to them, and Minnesota taxpayers have suffered billions of dollars in consequences as a result,"" Demuth said, without providing evidence.

Jaylani Hussein, president of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations decried the move Friday, saying in a statement that the group was ""deeply disappointed that the administration has chosen to end the Somali TPS program in Minnesota, a legal lifeline for families who have built their lives here for decades.""

""This is not just a bureaucratic change; it is a political attack on the Somali and Muslim community driven by Islamophobic and hateful rhetoric,"" Hussein said.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today released the following statement after a white powdery substance was discovered in envelopes sent to two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, including the facility in Dallas, Texas where the September terror attack took place, as well as a bomb threat in August.

On Friday morning, an ICE officer at the Dallas facility opened an envelope addressed to “Dallas Field Office,” containing a white powdery substance. Out of precaution, a hazardous materials (hazmat) team was called to the facility. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) and Dallas Fire Department also responded. Following a shelter in place and inspection, the facility is returning to normal operations. A second envelope was also discovered at the ICE offices in Irving, Texas.

“On Friday morning, an ICE officer discovered a white powdery substance in an envelope addressed to the Dallas ICE facility. A second envelope with white powder was also found at the Irving ICE office. ICE staff called a hazmat team to investigate. There is no threat to the public and the matter is under investigation,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This incident comes after the deadly terrorist attack in September and a bomb threat in August at the Dallas facility. Our ICE officers are facing a 1000% increase in assaults and an 8000% increase in death threats against them as they remove dangerous criminals from our communities. We call on politicians and activists to tone down their rhetoric before a law enforcement officer is killed.”

Every day, America’s brave ICE officers put their lives on the line to defend our homeland and keep Americans safe. In August, ICE responded to an incident at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City involving a white powder which was also found in ICE offices. Law enforcement has also seen an unprecedented surge in vehicle rammings against federal law enforcement.

Secretary Kristi Noem has been clear: Anyone who lays a hand on law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

His arguments came in response to a preliminary injunction handed down in August from San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria. Chhabria’s order temporarily blocked Medicaid data from being shared for immigration enforcement but said the injunction would be lifted 14 days after the agencies completed a “reasoned decisionmaking process.”

California’s legal team, however, countered that the agencies’ notices appeared inadequate. “My initial impression is they aren’t what the court ordered in terms of a reasoned decision-making practice,” California Deputy Attorney General Anna Rich said during the hearing held by videoconference.

Chhabria encouraged the federal government to delay resuming data sharing until “after the holidays, just to make everyone’s life easier.” Gerardi said he’d take the suggestion back to Trump administration officials for consideration.

The Trump administration has struggled to defend its seizures of government data to meet the president’s goals for mass deportations. A federal judge on Friday in a separate case temporarily barred the Internal Revenue Service from sharing tax information with immigration officials.

CMS has already shared Medicaid data from California and a handful of other blue states with ICE. The agencies have been prohibited from using the information for immigration enforcement since Chhabria’s August ruling.

HHS has insisted the transfer is “supported by lawful interagency data sharing” and is “focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse” of Medicaid benefits. California Attorney General Rob Bonta and other Democratic attorneys general challenging the data transfer argue it’s an illegal move designed to foster “a culture of fear” that discourages undocumented immigrants from accessing health care.

The CMS notice is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 25. The existing preliminary injunction blocking information sharing will remain in place for 14 days after the formal publication.

Her break with him was a notable fissure in his grip over the Republican Party, particularly his most ardent base.
Such a special election would include party primaries and a general election to fill out the remainder of her term through January 2027.
When Trump was out of power between his first and second terms, Greene was often a surrogate for his views and divisive style in Washington.","Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a once-loyal supporter of President Trump who has become a critic, said Friday that she is resigning from Congress in January.

Greene, in a more than 10-minute video posted online explaining her decision, said she didn’t want her congressional district “to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for,” she said.

Greene’s resignation followed a public fallout with Trump in recent months, as the congresswoman criticized him for his stance on files related to Jeffrey Epstein, along with foreign policy and healthcare.

Trump branded her a “traitor” and “wacky” and said he might endorse a primary challenger against her when she ran for reelection next year.

Greene said her last day would be Jan. 5.

The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Friday night.

Greene was one of the most vocal and visible supporters of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” politics, and she embraced some of his abrasive and divisive political style.

Her break with him was a notable fissure in his grip over the Republican Party, particularly his most ardent base. But her decision to step down in the face of his opposition put her on the same track as many of the more moderate establishment Republicans before her who went crosswise with Trump.

The congresswoman, who recorded the video announcing her resignation while sitting in her living room wearing a cross necklace and with a Christmas tree and a peace lily plant behind her, said, “My life is filled with happiness, and my true convictions remain unchanged, because my self-worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.”

A crack in the MAGA movement

Greene had been closely tied to the Republican president since she launched her political career five years ago.

In her video Friday, she underscored her longtime loyalty to Trump except on a few issues, and said it was “unfair and wrong” that he attacked her for disagreeing.

“Loyalty should be a two-way street, and we should be able to vote our conscience and represent our district’s interest, because our job title is literally ‘representative,’ ” she said.

Greene swept to office at the forefront of Trump’s MAGA movement and swiftly became a lightning rod on Capitol Hill for her often confrontational, beyond-mainstream views, including advocating conspiracy theories and other falsehoods. In her video Friday, she said she had “always been despised in Washington, D.C., and just never fit in.”

As she embraced QAnon conspiracies and appeared with white supremacists, Greene was opposed by party leaders but welcomed by Trump. He called her “a real WINNER!”

Yet over time she proved a deft legislator, having aligned herself with then-GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who would go on to become House speaker. She was a trusted voice on the right flank until McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) was ousted in 2023.

Though there has been an onslaught of lawmakers from both parties heading for the exits ahead of next fall’s midterm elections, as the House struggles through an often chaotic session, Greene’s announced retirement will ripple throughout the ranks — and raise questions about her next moves.

Greene was first elected to the House in 2020. She initially planned to run in a competitive district in northern Atlanta’s suburbs, but relocated to the much more conservative 14th District in Georgia’s northwestern corner.

The opening in her seat means Republican Gov. Brian Kemp will have to set a special election date within 10 days of Greene’s resignation. Such a special election would include party primaries and a general election to fill out the remainder of her term through January 2027. Those elections could take place before the party primaries in May for the next two-year term.

Conspiracy theory-minded

Even before her election, Greene showed a penchant for harsh rhetoric and conspiracy theories, suggesting a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was a coordinated attack to spur support for new gun restrictions. In 2018, she endorsed the idea that the U.S. government perpetrated the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and mused that a “so-called” plane had hit the Pentagon.

Greene argued in 2019 that Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), both Muslim women, weren’t “official” members of Congress because they used Qurans rather than Bibles in their swearing-in ceremonies.

She was once a QAnon advocate, aligning herself with an online network that believes a global cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibals, including U.S. government leaders, operates a child sex trafficking ring. She eventually distanced herself, saying she got “sucked into some of the things I had seen on the internet.”

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, she drew backlash and apologized for comparing the wearing of safety masks to the horrors of the Holocaust.

She also drew ridicule and condemnation after a conspiracy theory she speculated about on Facebook in 2018, in which she suggested a California wildfire may have been caused by “lasers or blue beams of light” controlled by a left-wing cabal tied to a prominent Jewish family.

When Trump was out of power between his first and second terms, Greene was often a surrogate for his views and divisive style in Washington.

As then-President Biden delivered his State of the Union address in 2022, Greene stood up and began chanting, “Build the wall,” referring to the U.S.-Mexico border wall that Trump began in his first term.

Last year, when Biden gave his last State of the Union address, Greene again drew attention as she confronted him over border security and the killing of a nursing student from Georgia, Laken Riley, by an immigrant in the country illegally.

Greene, wearing a red MAGA hat and a T-shirt about Riley, handed the president a button that said, “Say Her Name.” The congresswoman then shouted that at the president midway through his speech.

But this year, her first serving with Trump in the White House, cracks began to appear slowly in her steadfast support — before it broke wide open.

Greene’s discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn’t run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff, while attacking GOP donors and consultants who expressed concerns she couldn’t win.

Greene’s restlessness only intensified in July, when she announced she wouldn’t run for Georgia governor, either.

She was also frustrated with the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill, which worked in lockstep with the president.

Greene said in her video that “the legislature has been mostly sidelined” since Republicans took unified control of Washington in January and her bills “just sit collecting dust.”

Messages left with House Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) office were not immediately returned.

“That’s how it is for most members of Congress’ bills,” she said. “The speaker never brings them to the floor for a vote.”

Republicans will probably lose the midterm elections next year, Greene said, and then she’d “be expected to defend the president against impeachment after he hatefully dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me.”

“It’s all so absurd and completely unserious,” she said. “I refuse to be a battered wife hoping it all goes away and gets better.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b2358b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2662x1398+0+189/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2F72%2F3d6a8a4b4ce6a2ac0511794103f0%2F203f5b6436a642c797ea8bf36d5ab510.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 22:56:26.224081

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda — President Donald Trump 's birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump's appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration's broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings, while they allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration's emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. Trump's order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution's 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges' use of nationwide injunctions.

While the Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions, it did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.

But every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump's order violates or most likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The administration is appealing two cases.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco ruled in July that a group of states that sued over the order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others.

Also in July, a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the citizenship order in a class-action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.

The American Civil Liberties Union, leading the legal team in the New Hampshire case, urged the court to reject the appeal because the administration's ""arguments are so flimsy,"" ACLU lawyer Cody Wofsy said. ""But if the court decides to hear the case, we're more than ready to take Trump on and win.""

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be39b81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F96%2Fd7458e5e45a88d8ddedc195b01ab%2Fimmigration-birthright-citizenship-25325081999485.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 02:56:46.147857

Duffy announced the possible withholding of funds on Thursday, alleging that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) had found multiple instances of Pennsylvania’s Department of Transportation issuing licenses with expiration dates beyond an immigrant’s authorized stay in the U.S. or failing to secure “proof of lawful presence” before issuing licenses.

“Under President Trump, this Department is taking every measure to ensure dangerous foreign drivers aren’t illegally operating 40-ton vehicles on American roads,” Duffy said in a Transportation Department (DOT) press release.

“Joe Biden allowed tens of millions of illegals to pour into our country through open borders, including a suspected terrorist who Pennsylvania then allowed to get behind the wheel of a semitruck,” he said. “I will continue to fight to get these dangerous drivers off our roads to protect American families and support our national security.”

A survey of 691 health care workers across 30 states who work with immigrant populations, conducted from March to August 2025, spotlights the preventable health impacts for both immigrant and U.S. citizen patients.

The survey finds:

84 percent of surveyed health care workers report significant or moderate decreases in patient visits since January 2025 executive orders on immigration.

26 percent of clinicians report that immigration enforcement has directly affected patient care.

Seven percent reported Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) presence inside of their health care facilities.

Providers report that services affected include preventive services (43 percent), chronic disease management (36 percent), and mental health care (28 percent).

Cited patient concerns affecting health access included fear of deportation (49 percent) and family separation (39 percent).

27 percent of surveyed health care workers identified fear of benefit enrollment or renewal as a primary barrier preventing patients from accessing care or maintaining coverage.

While the broad and chilling disruption to health care access affects immigrant populations of all ages, health care workers consistently report that children – including U.S. citizens – face particularly acute health impacts.

“We are witnessing the creation of a generation with preventable trauma, delayed diagnoses, foregone treatments, and compromised development,” said Katherine Peeler, MD, pediatrician and PHR’s medical advisor. “What we are documenting is systemic, orchestrated harm to immigrants, and therefore their children – harm that is entirely preventable. Parents are making impossible choices: declining surgery for their children, delaying emergency care, and refusing specialty referrals because they have calculated that the risks of deportation or family separation exceed the medical necessity.”

“Our clinical network is sounding the alarm: fear is keeping migrant and immigrant children from critical care to stay safe and healthy,” said Laszlo Madaras, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer for Migrant Clinicians Network. “Health care is a human right. When fear blocks care for some, it harms all of us.”

Survey responses also reveal five ways how children’s access to health care is being impeded by Trump administration immigration enforcement actions:

1. Children forced to navigate health care alone due to deportation fears

Surveyed health care providers report parents are deliberately avoiding hospital settings out of fear of detention.

One Illinois physician reported: “Some children presenting without their parents to the emergency department.” Another physician from Illinois noted: “Children coming to ED by themselves as parents await outside.”

This practice creates cascading problems, as medical histories cannot be obtained from those most familiar with the child’s health, informed consent becomes impossible, children may become distrustful of the medical system if they do not understand the care they are receiving, and follow-up care coordination collapses.

2. Children’s trauma from parents’ detention and threat of family separation

Health care providers report that children as young as six years old are presenting with anxiety, with fear of family separation identified as the primary stressor. One Oregon community health worker observed: “We have minors constantly crying during their well-child checks expressing their fear for themselves and their families.”

A Massachusetts physician described: “Parents of our pediatric patients [have been] detained by ICE, which has led to a great deal of emotional distress in the remaining adult and their children.”

Surveyed health care providers attribute this psychological distress directly to immigration enforcement policies and their chilling effects.

3. Reduced use of outdoor spaces due to fear raises physical health concerns

Providers report observing a concerning pattern: children with restricted physical activity, social isolation, and abnormal weight gain trajectories. The outdoor play essential for healthy child development is being reduced by parents who perceive it as too risky due to the threat of immigration enforcement.

One physician in Massachusetts described: “I have pediatric patients that are flagging in the obese range for weight and when we talk about playing in parks and getting other forms of exercise the parents note that they are not leaving their apartments for fear of encountering ICE. Their children suffer the double trauma of fear of family separation and immigration enforcement as well as lacking a safe place to play and exercise and other healthy outlets for children.”

4. Delayed diagnoses and late-stage disease presentations among children

Health care providers in the survey report children presenting at later disease stages with preventable complications and delayed diagnoses.

Parents are making what providers describe as impossible choices: seeking care only when legally mandated (such as for school enrollment forms) or only when illness severity becomes life-threatening. Routine immunizations, developmental screenings, and preventive interventions are being sacrificed to this risk calculation.

A California physician reported: “I have had multiple parents decline visits with specialists, including delaying surgery, because of the fear of immigration enforcement in the destination city or on the way there.”

5. The safety net as a trap — new threats of surveillance

The pediatric safety net, including Medicaid coverage and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment, is increasingly being avoided because it is perceived as a trap rather than protection, even when U.S. citizen children are eligible for public benefits. Some parents are making the calculated decision that the risk of engaging with these systems outweighs the benefits of coverage.

One community health worker in North Carolina expressed: “We are increasingly alarmed that the children of immigrants may soon lose access to vital programs like SNAP and Medicaid, not because they are ineligible, but because their parents are being targeted and surveilled when attempting to complete these applications on their behalf.”

Many families are actively avoiding benefit renewal. One Oregon community health worker reported: “Families are scared to renew their Medicaid.”

These harms extend beyond mixed-status families. U.S. citizen children are losing health care coverage due to parents’ fear of deportation and surveillance. As one North Carolina community health worker said: “Patients and families are experiencing increasingly severe persecution which is exacerbating or contributing to all of their health problems and making management of chronic conditions and prevention of disease extremely difficult. This actually affects the citizens and non-citizens, negatively impacting the health of the whole community.”

“In light of these mounting health harms, the Trump administration should end actions that directly or indirectly curtail access to critical health care services for children and families,” said Dr. Peeler of PHR. “This includes codifying the ‘Sensitive Locations’ policy and ceasing all immigration enforcement at health care facilities. The administration should also end ICE data-sharing with Medicaid and align broader U.S. immigration policies and practices with international human rights standards.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northcentralpa.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/46/246ae269-467e-42e9-9a8d-89bdd5a73dd8/691df103be6f3.image.png?crop=1000%2C525%2C0%2C27,N,,2025-11-21 20:57:23.257415

He’s streaming a session to his 4.6 million subscribers of GTA 5 RP, a Grand Theft Auto 5 mod that allows people to role-play with other players. “Really wanna show you guys some real-life scenarios,” he says, offering a little background on his character, a man headed to his job while on a work visa.

His character doesn’t get far before an SUV swings onto the sidewalk in front of him; masked ICE agents spill out of the vehicle. “Stop right there,” one of the uniformed players says. It isn’t long before SteveTheGamer55 is surrounded by agents. He hands over his ID while bystander players yell at the agents and demand his release. “Why are you harassing people?” one says, before the worker is finally let go. Later in SteveTheGamer55’s play session, he stands in front of a large iron gate reminiscent of those in ICE detention centers seen in cities like Chicago. More in-game ICE agents have gathered. He records from his phone. Just in front of him, a player in a red suit demands to see a warrant for his client.

The “special event” held on November 20, where players took on different roles that reflect real-life ICE raids, was the first initiative by New Save Collective, a baker’s dozen of gamers with backgrounds in activism and organizing, whose goal is to educate gamers and teach people about their rights when dealing with ICE in real-world situations. On November 21, at 7:30 pm ET, gamers will gather in Epic’s massively popular battle royale, Fortnite, to hold a closed scavenger hunt that will serve as a more casual educational opportunity. The group is working with several immigration advocacy groups, as well as collaborating with content creators, to spread their message online.

Online gaming spaces have long appealed to the right as a place to push conservative or even extremist ideologies. The US military has been open about its attempts to use games as a recruitment tool, and immigration authorities are no different. In October, the Department of Homeland Security posted an image aping marketing for the Halo series. “Finishing this fight,” the agency’s official account tweeted—a reference to Halo 3’s tagline—alongside an image with the text “Destroy the Flood” slapped over a blurry depiction of the game’s supersoldiers; the Flood are Halo’s alien antagonists. DHS has also riffed off of Pokémon’s “gotta catch ’em all” tagline, going as far as to post a video of ICE agents destroying property and arresting people, interspersed with the show’s opening.

A spokesperson previously told The Hill that the DHS “will reach people where they are with content they can relate to and understand, whether that be Halo, Pokémon, The Lord of The Rings, or any other medium.” But where movements like Gamergate peddled in harassment, hatred, and exclusion, New Save Collective’s goal is to foster a community that is kind, authentic, and oriented towards doing good.

“Most of us are immigrants, or children of immigrants, or children of refugees,” says one organizer who goes by PitaBreadFace online. (The organizer requested WIRED not use his name out of safety concerns.) “We're here at this stage in the political climate to cultivate some belonging, but also move people towards a shared purpose that everyone seems pretty hungry for.”

PitaBreadFace says that he started digital organizing in gaming spaces in an effort to bring people together through their shared love of video games. “The right has built some pretty strong institutions within gaming that have co-opted and weaponized the social features of gaming for bad,” he says, pointing to Gamergate. “The actual demographic and culture of gaming is changing, but we haven't built as many institutions as the right or those toxic forces.”

Games that serve as platforms are becoming popular places for kids and adults alike to gather in protest. On Roblox, players have held both pro-Palestine rallies and anti-ICE demonstrations. For New Save Collective, games like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto offer a similarly useful place to carry out their events. “Some of the folks who play GTA role-play are [police] officers in real life or are lawyers in real life,” says Anosh Polticoal, who also requested to only be referred to by screen name for safety.

“For a [gaming] stream that's educating the public in a world where many people may not have seen an interaction with ICE yet, it’s a way to get folks to know or get used to what that might look like,” the organizer says. “What their rights are as bystanders, as citizens, as noncitizens, as folks who are documented, undocumented. It felt like a really great way to see all that play out for an audience.”

Friday’s Fortnite event offers a chance for gamers across multiple platforms to learn about community building and how to speak up about xenophobia online. In order to play through the scavenger hunt, players will first have to be onboarded to the server; organizers say they’ve already dealt with people claiming to be ICE agents spreading misinformation and pro-ICE propaganda in their online communities.

Games like Halo or first-person shooters already have built-in messaging around “protect the homeland,” Anosh Polticoal says. “I think [ICE] have seen that as an opportunity to reach an audience that is already engaged in what they may feel is similar work. We want to make sure that our message is showing up in those same places—maybe you are not an immigrant, but someone in your life, in your community definitely is.”

New Save Collective is working with another organization, Define American, which focuses on shifting the portrayal of immigrants in media. Shauna Siggelkow, vice president of programs for the group, says the focus on games is part of that effort. “In order for politics to change around immigration, we first need to change the public discourse,” Siggelkow says. “Not just immigrants, but citizens, whatever your status is—it's really important that we all understand our rights and practice those rights when we're confronted by ICE.”

New Save Collective plans to continue holding future events and organizing gamers. The fight for these communities online is far from over. “Gaming wasn't kind of a random genre that we chose,” says Siggelkow. “We've been tracking anti-immigrant myths and disinformation digitally for years. We really grounded this campaign in a lot of data and research. This really is a space that is critical for immigration narrative.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/6920a060c597ca958cb5bdaf/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Fortnite-Players-Fighting-Ice-Culture-shutterstock_1444806506.jpg",N,,2025-11-21 20:57:39.896332

Their crime? Recording a video that reminded members of the military that they are not supposed to obey illegal orders.

“SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” Mr. Trump wrote in one post. He shared a different post, written by another person, that said: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”

The video that enraged the president had been put out online two days ago by six Democratic lawmakers, all of whom had served in either the military or intelligence community themselves.

One was Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who served in the Navy and is a former astronaut. “Our laws are clear,” he said in the video. “You can refuse illegal orders.”

Another participant was Representative Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, who also served in the Navy. “You must refuse illegal orders,” he said in the video.

The Democratic lawmakers’ message did not focus on a specific order or scenario, but Trump administration officials have said the lawmakers were encouraging the military to rebel against its commander in chief. As a standard part of their training, members of the military are told that they should refuse to carry out illegal orders. At a briefing for reporters, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said “no” when asked if the president wants to execute members of Congress.

She added: “If this were Republican members of Congress who were encouraging members of the military and members of our United States government to defy orders from the president and from the chain of command, this entire room would be up in arms. But instead it is the other way around, and I think that’s quite telling.”

The video was organized by Senator Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a former C.I.A. analyst who served in Iraq.

Mr. Trump has flexed his power over the military during his second term and his attempts to politicize the armed forces have become more overt. He gave a nakedly political address to military leaders and has sent troops into cities around the country. All of which surely contributed to why the Democrats made their video.

And Ms. Slotkin told The New York Times earlier this week that she’d been hearing from active-duty troops concerned about the legality of strikes that targeted people accused of drug-smuggling by the Trump administration.

Mr. Trump’s series of posts about the video on Thursday accused Ms. Slotkin and her fellow Democrats of traitorous conduct. One of his posts carried his signature sign-off which usually indicates he was the actual author of the post as opposed to an aide. It read: “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT.”

Mr. Trump’s posts appeared at a moment when he is beset by challenges on many sides. His administration is aflame over the Jeffrey Epstein saga; he is contending with a revolt from some of the most loyal members of his party and portions of his political base; and his poll numbers have dipped considerably.

His posts instantly triggered an uproar in Washington.

The six Democrats who produced the video put out a joint statement which read, in part: “What’s most telling is that the president considers it punishable by death for us to restate the law. Our service members should know that we have their backs as they fulfill their oath to the Constitution and obligation to follow only lawful orders. It is not only the right thing to do, but also our duty.”

Asked about the president’s post that the Democratic lawmakers had committed a crime punishable by death, the Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, said: “I don’t agree with that.”

Mr. Thune also criticized the Democrats who made the video. “Obviously everybody has a First Amendment right,” he said. “What they did was ill advised,” he added, “unnecessary” and “provocative.”

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, condemned the president’s threats from the floor of the Senate and called on members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to do the same.

“Let’s be crystal clear, the president of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials,” Mr. Schumer said. “This is an outright threat, and it’s deadly serious.”

He added: “Every time Donald Trump posts things like this, he makes political violence more likely. None of us should tolerate this kind of behavior.”

Mr. Trump’s posts about imprisonment and death by hanging were difficult to square with his recent calls to lower the temperature of political rhetoric in this country. After the conservative activist and Trump ally Charlie Kirk was murdered in September, Mr. Trump asked in an Oval Office address for “all Americans to commit themselves to the American values for which Charlie Kirk lived and died — the values of free speech, citizenship, the rule of law and the patriotic devotion and love of God.”

Mr. Trump said then that it was “long past time for all Americans and the media to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree.”

That spirit of free speech and the rule of law was hard to detect in president’s posts and messages he decided to repost Tuesday. He shared one that said, “Indict all of them.”

“Traitors,” said another.

The Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro — whose home was firebombed on Passover this year — criticized the president on social media.

“He is actively encouraging political violence once again, ratcheting up the real risk of danger to our elected leaders and deepening the divides in our country,” Mr. Shapiro wrote. “The sycophants and enablers the President surrounds himself with are quick to condemn language like this when it suits their political purposes — but in moments like this, they remain silent.”

The Democrats’ video had already been the object of much indignation among conservatives before the president weighed in. The White House policy czar Stephen Miller had shared the video the day it was published, writing: “Democrat lawmakers are now openly calling for insurrection.”

SPRINGFIELD — The Illinois Accountability Commission is continuing to ramp up even as the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago region winds down, at least for now.

Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday announced the appointment of two new commissioners and additional staff to the independent commission he created via executive order last month. It is tasked with producing a public record of alleged abuses perpetrated by federal agents during “Operation Midway Blitz.” It will also examine the impact of such conduct on Illinois residents and communities and offer recommendations for accountability and reform.

Pritzker appointed attorney Jimmy Arce, a former federal prosecutor who was involved in the Justice Department’s civil rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department; and Ric Estrada, the CEO of Metropolitan Family Services, which is one the state’s largest human services organizations. Eight commissioners have now been appointed.

“Since I signed the executive order, with guidance from the commissioners, the Illinois Department of Human Rights has been diligently working to set the foundation for this truly ground-breaking work to bring accountability for the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement actions,” Pritzker said. “The appointments of Jimmy and Ric to the Commission round out this incredible team of public servants committed to demanding answers and the ongoing pursuit of justice for the people of Illinois.”

Staff Also Hired

The commission has also hired Hina Mahood, a former deputy chief of staff at the Department of Human Services who most recently was director of Illinois initiatives for the JB & MK Pritzker Family Foundation, as its executive director.

The commission has also hired two attorneys with plans to hire more support staff in the coming weeks, the governor’s office said.

Pritzker announced the commission’s formation at the height of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement blitz, which the Department of Homeland Security claims — as of last month — resulted in the arrests of more than 3,300 people.

But it also led to violent clashes between federal agents and protesters, often outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview but also during enforcement operations in Chicago neighborhoods. Agents, including U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, often used riot control weapons like tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds.

While DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Capitol News Illinois that the operation is “ongoing,” there is evidence that it quickly wound down last week, with Bovino leaving Chicago for North Carolina and taking many of his agents with him.

And Trump administration lawyers told a federal judge earlier this week that only four detainees were being held in the Broadview facility, a stunning decline from testimony earlier this month of former detainees who described holding rooms stuffed with hundreds of people.

However, the reprieve may be short-lived. The Chicago Sun-Times reported last week that as many as 1,000 agents could hit the streets in March — four times the amount in town over the past two months.

Commission Ramping Up

The commission will ramp up its operations during the expected lull period.

Commissioners and staff have started outreach efforts, explored community partnerships and are conducting a “landscape analysis” of information already in the public domain to examine the impact of related and ongoing litigation, according to the governor’s office.

But it’s still a work in progress. Pritzker notably encouraged people to document interactions with federal agents by taking videos with their phones. But on the commission’s website, there was still no method to submit such evidence directly to the commission as of Thursday afternoon. Instead, people are encouraged to contact a hotline operated by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, an outside group.

“The commission will provide updates to the public if there are other avenues to share information,” the website states.

Beyond that, the website lists information about the commissioners and executive staff, the language of the executive order that created it, links to news releases about it and links directing people to legal help and information about their rights when interacting with law enforcement.

Pritzker’s executive order also explicitly calls for the commission to hold public hearings to document the conduct of federal officials. But no information is yet available about when those will be held or how members of the public can participate.

The commission has been tasked with providing an initial report on its findings and recommendations to Pritzker no later than Jan. 31. A final report will be issued no later than April 30, 2026.

The commission’s website can be found at ilac.illinois.gov.

On Friday, they called for unity in standing up for relatives, neighbors and coworkers allegedly being “indiscriminately” targeted by federal immigration authorities. And they called on local governments to not participate in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, which they say is not their job.

“Border communities for many years experienced what we are seeing now in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and now, in North Carolina. Immigration authorities are basically harassing communities,” said Oscar Chacon, strategy adviser for Alianza Americas.

Chacon praised the response not just of advocates but also of community members in taking to the streets to demand accountability amid a surge of federal agents in cities led by minorities or with large minority populations.

“In Chicago, the life of Mexican and Latin American communities is being deeply disrupted by these actions,” he said at an online conference titled “The Border Becomes the Nation: Understanding the Spread of Militarization from the Border to U.S. Cities.” “It’s not so much if you’re an immigrant or foreigner, but whether federal authorities don’t think you belong here because of how you look.”

The Trump administration insists Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids as necessary to combat transnational criminal organizations and to uphold U.S. immigration law. Republican lawmakers including in Texas have said people who come into the United States illegally have committed a crime. Thousands of foreign nationals are prosecuted for immigration violations in U.S. federal courts and some get jail time.

But advocates say 70 percent of migrants detained by the Trump administration don’t have a criminal record and that some U.S. citizens have been detained for unknown reasons during raids of afterwards.

“They are going to places where they think they can get the numbers they need” in terms of apprehensions, said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA) of Los Angeles.

She said advocates in targeted cities have rapid response protocols in place to ensure the protection of civil rights and to identify who was taken and where. Others have declared “ICE Free Zones” in workplaces, schools and other sensitive locations.

Some are calling on employers to follow the law when it comes to hiring but not overreach by questioning validity of documents or venting suspicions about a person’s status.

“They want to create a nationwide registry, expand expedited removal and 287(g) agreements. Local governments don’t have to participate or put it in their budgets because it’s not under their jurisdiction,” said Herbert Meisner, integrated campaigns coordinator for Service Employees International Union, which has complained the immigration raids are disrupting workplaces nationwide.

Fernando Garcia, executive director of Border Network for Human Rights, said unity and resistance are best practices to ensure the protection of civil rights.

“El Paso historically has been a city that welcomes refugees and where communities are coming together,” he said. “It also a city with a historic resistance for decades.”

Garcia opined El Paso hasn’t seen the widespread immigration raids that Los Angeles and Chicago are witnessing because its faith-based, civil rights, business and political leadership are united in culture and purpose.

“Businesses recognize we are a binationally interdependent economy here in El Paso and Juarez, and they fight for that identity,” he said. “Communities are very organized with the capacity to resist every action” they deem as detrimental or unjust.",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/GettyImages-2218772631.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-21 20:57:27.386733

A comprehensive immigration reform that provides hardworking illegal immigrants with an ultimate path to citizenship should not be regarded as rewarding criminal behavior.","Overview & Contribution:

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele calls himself the “world’s coolest dictator,” which may be an apt title given his social media savviness, backwards baseball caps, and concerted efforts to undermine democracy. While Bukele has enjoyed widespread popularity for his success in crushing El Salvador’s gangs, this has come at a high cost. Thousands of innocent Salvadorans have been imprisoned without due process as Salvadoran streets become ever more militarized. The “Bukele model” has been emulated by a number of Latin American leaders with authoritarian ambitions, which will likely complicate international efforts to isolate the Salvadoran government. Can Bukele continue to consolidate his personal power and popular support?

In “Does the Bukele Model Have a Future?” Beatriz Magaloni and Alberto Díaz-Cayeros argue that the Salvadoran state’s apparent strength sits atop an extremely fragile foundation: Bukele’s crime policy has successfully improved physical security for some while failing to deliver social and economic gains for El Salvador’s increasingly vulnerable citizenry. As the country’s economic situation worsens, Bukele’s support will decline, likely increasing his reliance on repression. The article is informed by original interview data, which illustrates how dire the situation for ordinary Salvadorans has become both inside and outside of the country’s notorious prisons.

The reader comes away somewhat optimistic that Bukele’s authoritarianism cannot remain popular indefinitely. And although El Salvador has largely evaded international pressure, this could change, for example, after the United States’ 2028 elections. At the same time, domestic efforts to push back against Bukele and his anti-democratic legacy will surely be difficult. The authors predict that Bukele will alternate between moments of popularity, episodes of repression, and external challenges.

The Bukele Model and Its Pitfalls:

Bukele is perhaps best known for his war on crime, which followed his unsuccessful attempts to negotiate with and make concessions to gang leaders. Although Bukele took office at a time when homicide rates had declined considerably, crime has sharply declined during his tenure. Yet El Salvador now enjoys the world’s highest incarceration rate by more than double the next highest country. Bukele has consolidated significant executive power, firing Supreme Court justices and pressuring his opponents via armed military and police incursions into the legislature.

The authors conducted interviews with formerly incarcerated Salvadoreans to better understand how the Bukele model has been experienced both inside and outside of prison. Interviewees report that ordinary people are incentivized to provide information (whether true or false) that leads to arrests because of the cash rewards offered. As the country’s economy worsens, these practices have led to a mushrooming of innocent arrests. Although international observers have tended to focus on human rights abuses in El Salvador’s CECOT prison, the conditions in more peripheral prisons are even more harrowing. As the authors report,

Upon entry, detainees are frequently subjected to a violent initiation ritual involving beatings by multiple prison guards…leav[ing] many prisoners with severe physical injuries…once confined…basic human needs such as rest, sanitation, breathable air, food, and water were denied. Some people…reported guards throwing tear gas into their cells and banging repeatedly on cell bars throughout the night…[they] described cells as so overcrowded that they were often forced to sleep in rotations: one half lying on the floors, with their neighbors’ feet pressed against their faces, while the remainder stood waiting for their turn.

A worrying consequence of Bukele’s rise is the diffusion and emulation of his “model” across the hemisphere. For example, Honduras and Ecuador have implemented states of emergency and deployed the military against domestic gangs, citing Bukele as inspiration. Javier Milei’s cabinet has used Bukele’s alleged success as a justification for undermining judicial autonomy in Argentina. Even Costa Rica — one of Latin America’s most stable democracies — built a CECOT-inspired prison and has witnessed growing support for strongman rule as it faces its highest homicide rates on record.

Possible Scenarios:

The authors identify three routes that might characterize El Salvador’s politics in the coming years, none of which are mutually exclusive. A first scenario would involve support for Bukele continuing or increasing. However, given El Salvador’s economic situation, this situation is very unlikely. In places like Singapore and Kuwait, autocrats have enjoyed steady popularity because they have been able to deliver economic prosperity. Yet Bukele lacks foreign investment and world-class infrastructure, as in Singapore, and it lacks the Gulf oil monies that have been showered on Kuwaiti citizens to buy their acquiescence.

A second scenario, which the authors see as more likely, is that Bukele’s popularity declines, leading him to default to more repression and authoritarianism. This parallels Venezuela under Nicholas Maduro, where the collapse of oil prices — which had previously boosted Hugo Chávez’s popularity — coincided with growing corruption and economic precarity. As the country experienced hyperinflation, Maduro clamped down on his opponents and the media while rigging elections.

There is a widespread perception of a strong link between immigrants and crime. It is common to hear those who oppose immigration argue that the first act illegal immigrants commit on U.S. soil is to break the law-that is, our immigration laws-and that they are ipso facto criminals who will continue to disregard U.S. laws once in the country. Those making this argument are generally steadfastly opposed to any immigration reform that will provide the 10 million to 12 million illegals already in the country any path to citizenship, on the grounds that such an ""amnesty"" would reward law-breaking.

The association of immigrants with crime is strengthened by the weekly barrage of news about drug and gang violence in Mexico as the government of Mexican President Felipe Calderón seeks to crack down on that country's powerful drug mafias. And long before the Mexican drug war, Americans were threatened by Colombian cartels, Salvadoran street gangs, and other criminal groups from Latin America. Moreover, it is perfectly true that the simple fact of being an illegal immigrant induces one to break further laws: One is reluctant to buy mandated auto insurance, pay taxes, or register businesses for fear of deportation.

There is indeed a huge problem of crime originating in Latin America and spilling into the United States. This is almost wholly driven by the enormous demand for drugs from the U.S. There are many things we can and should do to mitigate this problem, but it will persist as long as that demand remains high.

But the problem of gangs and drug violence should not be confounded with the behavior of the vast majority of illegal immigrants to the U.S., who by and large are seeking the same thing that every immigrant to America has wanted since the time of the Mayflower: to better their condition and that of their families. They are not criminals in the sense of people who make a living by breaking the law. They would be happy to live legally, but they come from societies in which legal rules were never quite extended to them. They are therefore better described as ""informal"" rather than ""illegal.""

Understanding this distinction requires knowing something about the social order in Latin America or, for that matter, in many other developing countries. These societies are often characterized by sharp class distinctions between a relatively small, well-educated elite and a much broader and poorer population.

The rule of law exists in places like Mexico, Colombia and El Salvador; the problem is that access to the legal system tends to be a privilege of the well-to-do. The vast majority of illegal immigrants to the U.S. come from poor rural areas, or shantytowns in large cities, where the state-in the form of courts, government agencies and the like-is often absent. Registering a small business, or seeking help from the police, or negotiating a contract requires money, time and political influence that the poor do not possess. In many Latin American countries, as much as 70%-80% of the population lives and works in the informal sector.

The lack of legal access does not make everyone in these regions criminals. It simply means that they get by as best they can through informal institutions they themselves create. The Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto has written extensively about the lack of formal property rights, not just in his own country but throughout the developing world. The poor do not hold legal title to their homes, despite having lived in them for years, because of the insuperable barriers the system throws up to formal registration. So they squat in their homes, constantly insecure and unable to use their property as collateral.

The poor are entrepreneurial and form businesses like restaurants and bus companies, but they are unlicensed and don't conform to official safety rules. They and everyone else would be much better off if they could be brought into the formal legal system, but it is a dysfunctional political system that prevents that from happening.

What illegal immigrants to the U.S. have done is to recreate the informal system within our borders. The Americans who hire them are often complicit in this system by not providing benefits or helping them avoid taxes through cash payments. The gardeners and maids and busboys who participate in this game, along with their employers, are indeed breaking the law. But they are in a very different category from the tattooed Salvatrucha gang member who lives by extortion and drug-dealing.

A comprehensive immigration reform that provides hardworking illegal immigrants with an ultimate path to citizenship should not be regarded as rewarding criminal behavior. It should be seen as an effort to move people from a dangerous informal system to one characterized by a modern rule of law.

We need, of course, to control much better the total number of people coming into the country, which can ultimately be done only through stronger enforcement of employment rules. If we can better distinguish between illegal and informal in our political discourse, then we can begin to concentrate our resources on going after those in the immigrant population who are genuinely dangerous criminals.",https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/themes/custom/stanford_fsi/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-21 20:57:33.536714

Agents suspected the vehicle was involved in human smuggling and initiated a vehicle stop. Gonzalez-Gomez first attempted to flee in the car and then later attempted to flee on foot into active highway traffic before he was ultimately apprehended. After apprehending Gonzalez-Gomez, agents removed ten passengers, including two unaccompanied minors, from the vehicle. None of the passengers were wearing seatbelts. Immigration checks confirmed that Gonzalez-Gomez and eight of the passengers are citizens of Mexico and two of the passengers are citizens of Guatemala, all unlawfully present in the United States.

The ruling is a significant victory for immigrant-rights group and liberal activists who are trying to resist the mass deportations that President Donald Trump has made a top priority for the first year of his second term.

The Trump administration can appeal the decision, and it has a decent track record this year of overturning lower-court losses. A separate federal judge in a related case previously declined to block the data-sharing deal between Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Court records indicate that the IRS has provided ICE with information about 47,000 potentially undocumented taxpayers so far as part of the controversial data-sharing deal, a fraction of what the Trump administration requested. The Department of Homeland Security has said it wants this information to find people who came to the US illegally and have already been ordered by a judge to leave the country.

The IRS rebuffed, and ultimately rejected, attempts to get information on millions of suspected undocumented immigrants with existing deportation orders. These disagreements created months of tension between IRS leadership and the White House, leading to the resignation and ouster of multiple IRS commissioners this year including Billy Long, a Trump loyalist.

CNN has reached out to the IRS and Treasury Department for comment.

District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in her 94-page ruling Friday that the data-sharing program was unlawful for several reasons, including because it violated legal requirements to keep sensitive taxpayer information private except for very strict exceptions, regardless of their immigration status.

“Plaintiffs have shown that the IRS’s disclosure of confidential taxpayer address information to ICE was contrary to law because it did not comply with certain requirements in (the) Internal Revenue Code,” wrote Kollar-Kotelly, a Bill Clinton appointee.

An order blocking the program was necessary because undocumented taxpayers were suffering irreparable harm, she said.

The judge rejected many of the Justice Department’s arguments for why the program was legal, concluding, among other things, that certain assertions were not credible. For instance, DOJ officials claimed that one single ICE agent was personally overseeing tens of thousands of investigations that might lead to criminal prosecutions and deportations.

“The Court finds it unlikely that a single individual could be ‘personally and directly engaged’ in approximately 47,000 criminal matters, let alone 1.28 million of them, as ICE represented to the IRS,” Kollar-Kotelly wrote.

This case was brought by the Center for Taxpayer Rights, a nonpartisan nonprofit that said the policy was hurting its clients at a low-income clinic, including undocumented immigrants. Millions of undocumented immigrants pay taxes each year — for decades, they have been encouraged to register with the IRS and pay what they owe, with assurances that their private information would stay confidential except for extremely rare cases.

Other anti-Trump groups involved in the lawsuit praised the ruling.

“This is an important win for millions of people in America whose information has been threatened by the Trump-Vance administration… the privacy laws enacted in the post-Watergate era exist to prevent abuses of power like this and yet leaders in the IRS and ICE launched this effort,” Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-02-20t180531z-963080443-rc2hycask8jh-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-irs.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-21 18:58:29.879696

California’s statute, Education Code Section 68130.5, treats non-state residents unfairly by allowing qualifying immigrants to receive in-state college tuition rates, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) claimed in its lawsuit. The law states that immigrants who are in the country illegally can’t pay out-of-state tuition rates if they meet educational requirements.

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.

“This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week — we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.”

The California Community Colleges system, one of the case’s defendants, said in a statement that the law in question has been in place for many years and was implemented in accordance with long-standing legal guidance. The DOJ claimed that federal law contradicts the state’s statute, however. Section 1623 of U.S. Code's Title 8 states that an immigrant who is in the U.S. illegally is ineligible for in-state college benefits unless U.S. citizens are eligible for them.

“Federal law prohibits aliens illegally present in the United States from receiving in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state U.S. citizens ... There are no exceptions,” the DOJ wrote in its complaint. “Yet California Education Code ... extends eligibility for in-state tuition benefits at state postsecondary educational institutions, including resident tuition, scholarships, and subsidized loans, to illegal aliens, while requiring U.S. citizens from other states to pay higher tuition rates.”

A spokesperson for Gov. Newsom, who, along with state Attorney General Rob Bonta and the University of California and California State University systems, is also a defendant, said that the DOJ has filed three “meritless, politically motivated lawsuits against California.""

“Good luck, Trump. We’ll see you in court,” the spokesperson added.

An official in the governor’s office noted that California’s “approach” to tuition “applies to all residents, regardless of where they were born.” U.S. citizens and non-citizens receive the same tuition benefits if they meet the criteria, the official explained.

Reyna Lopez, executive director of Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, the farmworker union based in Woodburn, said the declaration was a good step for the community, businesses and organizations. She described the past month as one of terror and trauma.

The resolution declares a local state of emergency ""due to the economic and humanitarian crisis"" and authorizes the Woodburn City Administrator to direct $30,000 toward mitigating the impacts of ICE actions.

It also requests emergency assistance from the state, including relief for affected families and small businesses, expanded access to food, housing, and mental health services, support for local providers responding to increased demand, and coordination with agencies to ensure compliance with the state's sanctuary laws.

The resolution also calls on Oregon's congressional delegation to publicly denounce ""all unconstitutional actions"" and demand immediate oversight and transparency from federal immigration enforcement agencies.

“I want people to understand that it’s not just undocumented farmworkers that are being impacted, but American citizens. Citizens who are afraid to do business and go to work out of fear of being targeted by federal agents because of the color of their skin alone,” added City Councilor Mark Wilk. “Not only does racial profiling set our country back decades, it undermines the legitimacy of all law enforcement as well as our local economy. The erosion of civil liberties affects everyone.”

Woodburn City Council President Sharon Schaub said the impact breaks her heart.

""It is imperative that we treat people with dignity and respect and honor the civil rights of all people,"" Schaub said. ""We cannot overlook these core American values in our own community.”

Lopez said the community wants to see their local governments step up and do what they can to help mitigate harm.

""This is really going to provide people some peace of mind that their city government is listening, they're watching, and they're going to do something to support families in this difficult time,"" she said.

The California State University system is the nation's largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students.","The Trump administration has sued California for providing in-state college tuition, scholarships, and state-funded financial aid to students who aren't legally in the United States.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, alleges the practice harms U.S. citizens and encourages illegal immigration. Among the defendants are the state, top state officials, and the state's two public university systems, the University of California and California State.

President Donald Trump's administration has filed similar lawsuits against policies in other states, including Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Kentucky and Texas. Half the country now has similar laws to California's.

In June, after the administration sued, Texas ended its decades-old law. And Florida last year scrapped its law that allowed in-state tuition for high school graduates who weren't in the country legally.

Supporters of the state tuition breaks argue that they don't violate federal law if they provide the same rates to U.S. citizens in the same circumstances — meaning they are residents of the state and graduates of one of its high schools. The California Dream Act also allows such students to apply for state-funded financial aid.

Many of the students were brought to the U.S. by their parents when they were children, and supporters of the laws say they are as much a part of their communities as U.S. citizens.

It is the latest action by Trump's administration since he issued executive orders in February directing federal agencies to stop public benefits from going to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and to challenge state and local policies seen as favoring those immigrants over some citizens. The lawsuit argues that the Republican president's orders enforce federal immigration laws.

""California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,"" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. ""This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week — we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.""

The Justice Department also recently sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters, and over California's new laws banning federal agents from wearing masks and requiring them to have identification while conducting operations in the state.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office said in a statement: ""The DOJ has now filed three meritless, politically motivated lawsuits against California in a single week. Good luck, Trump. We'll see you in court.""

The University of California defended its decades-old in-state tuition policy.

""While we will, of course, comply with the law as determined by the courts, we believe our policies and practices are consistent with current legal standards,"" it said in a statement.

The lawsuit comes weeks after the California Supreme Court let stand a lower-court ruling that the University of California's policy barring students without legal status in the U.S. from campus jobs is discriminatory and must be reconsidered.

University system officials had warned that the decision would put them in a precarious position as they negotiate with the Trump administration after the withdrawal of federal research funds.

The UC is dealing with federal grant suspensions and a White House demand that it pay a $1 billion fine over allegations including antisemitism and the illegal consideration of race in admitting students to its Los Angeles campus.

The California State University system is the nation's largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students. More than a quarter of undergraduates are first-generation college students, according to the university system.

Trump’s obsession with public charge is horribly consistent with his vision to remake the U.S. into a country where only the white and wealthy belong and can get ahead.” Read the full statement here.","After the longest government shutdown in United States history, many people have become aware of just how necessary public benefits like SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) and others are to our communities. With the lowest hiring rates since 2009 and other economic pressures mounting, many of us are closer to relying on public benefits than we think. But this summer, Congress passed a law that will take away access to health care, SNAP, and other essential services for many people with specific immigration statuses. Now, a new action by the Trump administration goes one step further, scaring people out of trying to access programs they remain eligible for.

On November 19, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security published a proposed change in regulation that would alter the impact of “public charge.” This is a long-standing concept in the immigration system, but the Trump administration wants to ignore the system’s focus on family unification to favor wealthy and white immigrants. Here’s what the government is doing now. For someone who might apply for a green card in the future, this is especially applicable.

What is public charge?

Since the 19th century, immigration laws have included a restriction for people who would become primarily dependent on the government for day-to-day living. Historically, however, only people who have used or may need certain types of government assistance (such as cash assistance or long-term institutionalization, like in a medical facility) could be found ineligible for a visa or a green card, because they may become a “public charge.”

This is the way the “public charge” test has been narrowly defined and has not included the use of SNAP or other non-cash public benefits and social safety-net programs, or emergency support services.

What are the current public charge rules?

As the law stands now, people applying for green cards must have a clear understanding of which benefits do and do not apply to them. This can offer them clarity and peace of mind in getting the support they need to protect their families and thrive in their communities. With clear information, they can more confidently adjust their status to get a green card, knowing it will not jeopardize their ability to remain in the United States with their loved ones, the careers they’ve developed, the friendships they’ve made, and the neighborhoods they’ve contributed to.

Although the regulation was finalized in 2022, it follows decades of precedent that have survived various political headwinds, proving that it’s a clear interpretation of the law as written and it is effective at providing guidance for immigration officials.

What could change under the new proposed rule?

Right now, the Trump administration’s proposal is to get rid of the rule altogether, with no replacement, meaning there won’t be any clear guidance on what benefits will count toward public charge, and how they will be applied. If that proposal is finalized, immigration officers may be directed to “use their discretion,” a recipe for arbitrary and discriminatory application of the law.

It creates inconsistency and inequity while upending the long-settled definition of “public charge,” reaching beyond even the first Trump administration’s proposed changes in 2019, which were resoundingly rejected by the courts. As a result, people may avoid health care and nutrition services they are eligible for, which lays the groundwork for public health crises and skyrocketing public health costs, among other negative outcomes.

Why does this matter?

According to NILC president Kica Matos, this is “another attack designed to sow fear and confusion in immigrant communities. Trump’s obsession with public charge is horribly consistent with his vision to remake the U.S. into a country where only the white and wealthy belong and can get ahead.” Read the full statement here.

While those applying for a visa or green card will experience the most immediate effects, all Americans should be concerned about the vision of evaluating a person’s wealth to determine their value. Given the Trump administration’s drawn-out fight to keep SNAP benefits from those who qualify, it’s clear that the government’s focus is not on sustaining American livelihoods, but on leveraging poverty and assumptions about race, national origin, and economic status for political gain.

How can I comment on this change?

You have until December 19, 2025, to let the government know you oppose getting rid of the 2022 guidance. The government has to consider any comments it receives, but it does not have to make changes in response.

You can also share this information widely with your family, friends, and community members. Let them know about this proposed change, how it affects them and their loved ones, and what they can do to be proactive and assert their voice.

I was eight years old when I first learned the word “migrant”. It was August 2008, when the war between Russia and Georgia left thousands of people displaced, homeless and uncertain about the future. I remember asking my mother where our relatives had gone, and she gently said, “They migrated to rebuild their lives.”

At that time, migration seemed to me like a word connected with hardships, but as I grew older, life showed me a new meaning of that word – one defined by resilience, courage, and hope.

Years later, at the age of 19, I became a migrant myself. I moved from Georgia to Hungary after being awarded a scholarship to pursue my studies. It was one of the most exciting yet intimidating moments of my life. I still remember the silence of my first evenings – coming back to an empty room, speaking to my loved ones only through a phone screen. But I did not allow hardships to define my journey. Instead, I turned them into motivation. I learned the language, immersed myself in local traditions, and opened my mind to new perspectives.

Through my everyday interactions, I realized that migration was often misunderstood. I saw how easily stereotypes could shape perceptions and create distance. That understanding inspired me to become a bridge between cultures. I had the honour of serving as the Young Ambassador of Georgia to Hungary. It was a role that allowed me to connect Georgian and Hungarian youth, to share our cultures, and to show that migration can unite people rather than divide them. Many of those I met through this initiative were also migrants – students, dreamers, and professionals, each with a story of courage and perseverance.

Those experiences deepened my belief that migration, when managed with dignity and understanding, is one of humanity’s greatest strengths. It connects people, spreads ideas, and builds the foundation for a more inclusive and compassionate world.

That belief guided me toward the next chapter of my journey as I joined IOM. When the war in Ukraine broke out, I became part of the IOM Hungary team as a Senior Human Resources Associate. My work focuses on supporting both the Ukraine emergency response and inclusion and integration projects. Having experienced war during my own childhood, I felt a deep personal connection to the Ukrainian people forced to leave their homes. I understood, on a human level, what it means to lose a sense of normalcy overnight and what it takes to rebuild it.

At IOM, I have witnessed the true impact of well-governed migration. I have seen families find safety and dignity, children return to school, and individuals rediscover hope. Each success story reminds me why our mission matters. Every day, I am proud to contribute to this work, knowing that behind every document, every placement, and every decision, there are real lives being changed.

My journey has taught me that migration is not merely a movement of people – it’s a movement of potential. When managed responsibly, it drives development, innovation, and shared growth. Migrants are not defined by where they come from, but by the courage it takes to move forward. They bring skills, knowledge, and cultural richness that benefit both their countries of origin and destination. As someone who has lived both sides of this story – a migrant and a professional working for migrants – I see how much stronger societies become when diversity is embraced.

Today, when I reflect on my path, I see migration not as an act of leaving, but as an act of finding one’s place in the world while contributing to a greater good.

My story began with hearing about people who had to move to find safety. It continues with the privilege of helping others rebuild their lives with dignity and hope. Migration shaped who I am. It gave me empathy, resilience, and a purpose: to make sure that no one’s journey is defined by loss but by possibility. I strive every day to help build a world where every migrant is seen, supported, and celebrated.",https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl2616/files/styles/social_media/public/banner/tamuna-japharidze_.jpg?h=acc8b323&itok=NzZaHM03,N,,2025-11-21 18:58:15.688109

Further, the number of deaths this year exceeds every year on record since reporting began in 2018, including Fiscal Year 2020, when deaths spiked in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic” wrote the representatives.

They continued, “ICE appears to have repeatedly failed to comply with internal standards, and these failures have contributed to deaths in custody. For example, over the last decade, ICE has delayed or provided substandard medical care, neglected to provide proper medication, and falsified medical records. ICE has also failed to notify next of kin following the death of a detainee “timely, accurately, appropriately, and with sufficient detail” despite being required to by ICE Directive 11003.6 and PBNDS.

“These are not just numbers on a website, but real people—with families, jobs, and hopes and dreams—each of whom died in ICE custody.

For more than a decade, Rep. Chu has repeatedly visited and called for the closure of the Adelanto ICE facility in San Bernardino County because of its long, alarming record of abuse, medical neglect, and human rights violations that have led to preventable deaths.

Here, we summarize some of the most important recent developments in immigration policy on the federal, legal, state, and local levels.

Federal

DHS Proposes Reinstatement of Public Charge Rule

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has introduced a proposed rule that would reinstate and expand the “public charge” policy of the first Trump administration, rolling back protections from the 2022 Biden administration rule. If finalized, the measure would allow immigration officers to deny green cards and other legal status to applicants who have used, or may use, public benefits such as SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, housing assistance, and state-funded social programs, even for short periods or limited amounts. Advocacy organizations and health policy experts warn the proposal is intentionally vague, designed to create confusion and deter lawfully present immigrants from accessing critical health and nutrition programs they qualify for under federal law.

Unlike prior rules, the new DHS plan lacks clear guidance for adjudicators and instead grants officers wide discretion to deem applicants “likely” to become a public charge based on past or potential benefit use, as well as on the use of benefits by household members. DHS suggests that one of the benefits of the rule would be “a reduction in the number of aliens dependent on public benefit programs” and notes that it will result in reduced federal and state payments for individuals who no longer enroll in such programs, including U.S. citizens in mixed status households. Advocates highlight evidence that similar changes led to a dramatic chilling effect during the pandemic, with immigrant families, including U.S. citizen children, skipping medical care, nutrition assistance, or housing support out of fear for their immigration status. The agency is accepting public comments, and the Biden-era public charge rule remains in effect until any new regulation is finalized.

Administration Considers Green Card Restrictions for Travel Ban Countries

The Trump administration is reportedly weighing new policy changes to deny green cards to immigrants from countries covered by the president’s June 2025 travel ban. The proposed guidance would treat nationality from a travel ban country as a “significant negative factor” in green card adjudications, further compounding the widespread visa and entry restrictions that have already impacted millions of people. The list of fully and partially banned countries currently includes Afghanistan, Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Haiti, Myanmar, Chad, and others under either a total or partial visa suspension.

Past green card denials were largely based on admissibility grounds such as criminal history, health, or use of certain public benefits. Under the draft policy, consular officers and immigration officials could deny applicants solely for being from a travel ban country, even absent individual disqualifying factors. Immigrant rights groups have signaled plans to challenge any new restrictions in court. Advocates have raised particular alarm about the impact of the proposed green card restrictions on Afghans. Many of the tens of thousands of Afghans evacuated after the 2021 fall of Kabul are living in the United States under temporary humanitarian parole or other short-term protections, with no pathway to permanent residency. The administration’s new policy would potentially bar even those already present in the U.S. from securing lawful permanent residence, separating families, and undermining commitments made to American allies.

Border Patrol Operations Planned for New York City and New Orleans

Federal officials have announced plans for ramped-up immigration enforcement in New York City and New Orleans, with major operations slated to begin in December in response to what the administration calls “public safety threats” and sanctuary city policies. According to Tom Homan, the White House’s border czar, enforcement teams are already active in New York and additional agents are preparing to conduct widespread raids at courthouses, transit hubs, and immigrant neighborhoods. In New Orleans, up to 250 Border Patrol agents are expected to deploy for a two-month campaign, while local advocates and officials brace for a sharp increase in arrests targeting individuals with prior removal orders, asylum lapses, and minor immigration violations.

Meanwhile, Charlotte, North Carolina has experienced days of uncertainty and disruption stemming from the “Charlotte’s Web” enforcement operation led by Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino. Local authorities initially declared the operation over, but the Department of Homeland Security quickly contradicted those statements, asserting the crackdown is “not ending anytime soon” and confirming that immigration enforcement remains active in Charlotte and Raleigh. Over five days, federal actions resulted in more than 370 arrests and citywide impacts, with businesses shuttered, construction sites left empty, and nearly 30,000 students absent from local schools.

Survey Shows Decline in New International Student Enrollment

New survey data show that U.S. colleges and universities saw a 17% decline in new international student enrollment this fall, the largest non-pandemic drop in more than a decade. While total international student headcount fell by 1%, first-year international students saw pronounced decreases, hitting public universities hardest. Graduate programs, which typically rely heavily on international students for tuition and research contributions, reported a 12% drop in new enrollments, intensifying financial pressures for campuses dependent on international revenue streams.

Analysts and university leaders attribute the contraction to recent federal visa and travel policies, ongoing administrative review delays, and a sense that the U.S. is less welcoming to prospective international students. The economic consequences are significant, with estimates of more than $1.1 billion in lost revenue and up to 23,000 fewer jobs supported by international enrollment across the country. Many institutions are urging prompt federal action to address visa backlogs and to protect student and graduate work programs, warning that continued declines could undermine educational, economic, and diplomatic interests long term.

Priority Visa Interviews Announced for Foreign World Cup Ticket Holders

On November 17, the Trump Administration and FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced a new visa system for ticket holders to 2026 World Cup games in the United States. The system entitled the “FIFA Pass,” allows ticket holders to receive priority interview times to obtain a U.S. visa to attend a World Cup game. The partnership between the U.S. Department of State, the White House’s FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force (established in March 2025 via executive order) and FIFA will see the hiring of an additional 400 consular officers to process visas. Infantino stated that between five and ten million people from over 200 countries will be traveling to attend the games. The Trump administration has reiterated their commitment to the success of the games while also prioritizing maintaining a firm stance on security. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that having a ticket does not guarantee a U.S. Visa and only allows for an expedited process to getting a visa appointment, while the vetting process remains the same.

Federal Judge Blocks Termination of Temporary Protected Status for Syrians

On November 19, a federal judge in New York blocked the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Syrians, granting an emergency reprieve for more than 6,100 TPS holders just days before their protections were set to expire. The court’s order followed legal challenges from advocacy groups who argued that ending TPS for Syrians would violate federal law and expose individuals to grave harm due to ongoing conflict in Syria. The judge cited the severe risks and devastating repercussions of terminating protections, noting that hundreds of families, students, doctors, and other professionals would lose lawful status and face possible deportation.

The ruling temporarily halts the Trump administration’s efforts to end TPS for Syrian nationals, preserving their ability to live and work legally in the United States while litigation continues. Advocates welcomed the decision as a lifeline for community members and a check against an abrupt policy change that would have forced people to return to a country still affected by war and instability. In October, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the administration to move forward with ending TPS for approximately 600,000 Venezuelan migrants, exposing them to the risk of losing their protections. Meanwhile, federal courts are still weighing legal challenges to the termination of TPS for nationals of Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua.

Judge Dismisses DOJ Challenge to New York Courthouse Protections Law

A federal judge has dismissed the Department of Justice’s lawsuit challenging New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, which restricts federal immigration agents from making civil arrests at state courthouses without a judge-signed criminal warrant. The court concluded that New York acted within its authority to regulate courthouse safety and access, and that the state’s law does not conflict with federal immigration enforcement powers. Advocates and state officials argued that courthouse arrests deter witnesses and victims from participating in legal proceedings, undermining justice and due process.

Prior to 2025, federal guidance limited immigration enforcement in “sensitive locations” such as schools, medical facilities, courthouses, and other sites providing essential services. This long-standing policy was first established in 2011 and eventually expanded under the previous administration, aiming to ensure immigrants could safely access critical services without fear of enforcement actions. On the first day of the new Trump administration, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded these protections and encouraged enforcement wherever agents deemed necessary, including courthouses. The policy shift led to heightened fears and avoidance of essential services among immigrant communities, with reports of decreased school attendance and increased missed medical appointments.

Appeals Court Pauses Chicago Ruling Limiting Federal Agents’ Use of Force

A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a order issued by a Chicago district judge that restricted federal immigration agents’ use of force in the Chicago area. The judge’s ruling on November 6 mandated agents to provide clear warnings before deploying tear gas, pepper balls, and other riot control weapons, prohibited the use of force against peaceful protesters and journalists, and required agents to wear clear identification and body cameras. The judge also required federal agencies to provide detailed records of use-of-force incidents in connection with recent protests and enforcement operations.

The appeals panel, responding to an emergency request from the Trump administration, found the judge’s order “overbroad,” stating that such detailed restrictions resembled federal regulation and encroached upon executive authority over law enforcement. The court’s stay is only temporary, noting that the district judge had assembled robust factual findings suggesting the need for a more tailored injunction, and warning parties not to “overread” the suspension as a final decision. The case remains pending as the judges weigh whether narrower limits on federal agents’ use of force in Chicago are required under First and Fourth Amendment claims raised by the plaintiffs.

Pablo Orozco-Vasquez, also a Mexican national, was arrested near Webb after being previously deported for the fifth time in April.
Orozco-Vasquez has been convicted of two DWI charges, along with reckless driving, improper entry and illegal re-entry.
These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S.","SAN ANTONIO – United States Attorney Justin R. Simmons for the Western District of Texas announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 233 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from Nov. 14 to Nov. 20. Charges were brought against individuals with multiple prior removals, DWI convictions, kidnapping convictions, and at least two with prior convictions for sex crimes, including child sex crimes.

Salvadoran national Elmer Alexander Ramirez Cerna was charged with illegal re-entry in Austin. Ramirez Cerna was found in the Williamson County Jail on Nov. 4. He was convicted of sexual assault of a child in 2017 and removed from the U.S. to El Salvador in April 2019.

In Del Rio, USBP agents arrested Honduran national Noel Jose Funez-Antunez. Funez-Antunez was previously deported twice, most recently in June 2024 after he was convicted of sexual assault in Houston and sentenced to two years of confinement. Funez-Antunez was also convicted in 2010 for kidnapping.

Honduran nationals Marcos Joel Contreras-Max and Edwin Javier Chinchilla-Lopez were arrested during a multi-agency operation conducted in San Antonio on Nov. 16. Databases revealed that both individuals were in the United States illegally and had previously been removed from the U.S. to Honduras. The two defendants are each charged with one count of illegal re-entry. If convicted, they face up to two years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine.

In El Paso, Mexican national Miriam Lizeth Gutierrez-Montanez was arrested and charged with human smuggling after she allegedly attempted to enter the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry with two minors in her vehicle. A criminal complaint alleges that the Customs and Border Protection officer received a system-generated alert that Gutierrez-Montanez was a possible child smuggler. Further inspection allegedly revealed that the minors were found to be Mexican citizens and not in possession of any legal documents to enter or be present in the U.S.

A U.S. citizen was also arrested and charged with human smuggling in El Paso. U.S. Border Patrol agents allegedly tracked Luis Ramon Carmona to the Cielo Vista Mall after he had picked up seven illegal aliens near the U.S./Mexico border. All eight individuals were placed under arrest and transported to the Clint Border Patrol Station for further processing. A criminal complaint alleges that Carmona was being paid $500 per illegal alien and that he had participated in the same smuggling scheme once before.

Mexican national Agustin Cano-Quintero was charged with illegal re-entry after he was found in the Travis County Jail. Cano-Quintero has been convicted three times for driving while intoxicated and has also been previously convicted for improper entry by an alien as well as illegal re-entry.

On Tuesday, USBP agents arrested Mexican national Amado Tovar-Tovar, who has three DWI convictions and, in August 2024, was removed from the U.S. to Mexico for the fourth time.

Pablo Orozco-Vasquez, also a Mexican national, was arrested near Webb after being previously deported for the fifth time in April. Orozco-Vasquez has been convicted of two DWI charges, along with reckless driving, improper entry and illegal re-entry.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including ICE, U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

Woessner said local church leaders are concerned but in a holding pattern, waiting to see if a larger news outlet might confirm the story.
""We didn't want to panic,"" he said, adding that church leaders are preparing for the worst, in case the story turns out to be true.
Everett said churches have been worried about potential raids ever since the Trump administration ended the restriction on raids at sensitive locations.
But, by now, they've seen news reports of immigration enforcement outside churches and cases where immigration authorities don't appear to respect someone's documents.","On Tuesday (Nov. 18), the pastor of an 80-person Latino Pentecostal church got a concerning WhatsApp audio message. The message, allegedly created by an unidentified pastor, circulating among Atlanta-area evangelical faith leaders, claimed massive immigration raids would occur there on Thursday and Friday.

Soon, church members were sending him messages asking what they should do about the potential raids. By that evening at their teaching and prayer service, he had to address the rumor with his congregation.

""Stay calm,"" he told them in Spanish, but ""take care of yourselves. Don't go out if you don't need to go out.""

The pastor, who requested anonymity to protect his congregation, said he'd evaluate the situation on Thursday and make a decision about whether to cancel that day's service three hours before its scheduled start.

By Thursday afternoon, he decided to go on with his service, having seen a video from Luis Estrada, a Telemundo Atlanta anchor, saying the viral message was unreliable because of lack of evidence. The anchor noted the Trump administration's pattern of targeting Democratic-led states, which if consistent, would exclude Georgia. But other pastors canceled their services, and Estrada said in the video he received over 100 messages asking about the mysterious audio.

Faith leaders in other parts of the country were also worried this week, after a local news site in Massachusetts published a story warning of potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on churches over the upcoming holidays went viral. The story was shared through social media channels and messaging apps before leaders could sort out whether the reports were true or not.

ICE and other Department of Homeland Security officials have yet to raid a church building. But immigration agents have arrested immigrants on or near church property in at least a dozen instances so far this year, after the Trump administration rescinded an internal government policy discouraging raids on sensitive places like houses of worship. And fear of further escalation remains at the forefront in the minds of many worshippers at immigrant-heavy and Spanish-speaking churches, where attendance is down in many congregations. Viral stories like the one from New England only magnify those concerns, faith leaders say. Published on a local news website called This Week in Worcester, the story cites unnamed Department of Justice sources in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York who claimed that DHS plans to raid Spanish-language churches and other houses of worship over the holidays.

The story also cited an unnamed Hispanic pastor who said government agents had already been to his church to ask about the names and addresses of church members, as well as several pastors who said they received advertisements for the CBP Home app, which DHS uses to encourage people to self-deport. It said evangelical leaders such as the Rev. Clint Pressley, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, were briefed on the plan.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the report of church raids in a statement to RNS.

""Stop with the smears,"" the statement read. ""ICE does not raid churches — regardless of if it is Holiday season or not. This is just another false narrative to try and demonize our brave ICE law enforcement who are facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them and a 8000% increase in death threats.""

However, McLaughlin did not rule out a raid on a church, saying in the statement, ""If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a church, or a child sex offender was working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety.""

Southern Baptist leaders said they have had no discussion with the DHS about any raids on churches.

""Neither the SBC President nor the Executive Committee has participated in briefings or been in any discussions with governmental officials about these immigration enforcement operations,"" Brandon Porter, the SBC Executive Committee's vice president for communications, told RNS in an email.

Pressley, who is pastor of Hickory Grove Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, told RNS he'd had no contact with DHS.

""It's completely fabricated. All false,"" Pressley told RNS in a text.

Pressley said that if he had been asked about raids on churches, he would have opposed them.

""Law and order should prevail and can prevail without raiding churches,"" he said.

Even so, the Rev. Dave Woessner, an Episcopal priest who lives in Worcester and works for the Massachusetts Council of Churches, said the article caught local church leaders by surprise. The website in question generally covers local news and is not known for investigative journalism. At first, the story caused alarm as it began to spread through social media.

Woessner said local church leaders are concerned but in a holding pattern, waiting to see if a larger news outlet might confirm the story.

""We didn't want to panic,"" he said, adding that church leaders are preparing for the worst, in case the story turns out to be true.

John Keough, a 43-year-old local reporter, media consultant and former staffer for the Baptist Churches of New England, stood by his reporting in an interview with RNS, saying he wrote the story to warn churches. He said the issue is personal to him: A Hispanic congregation had taken him in when he got out of prison after being convicted on charges related to a home invasion in his 20s. It helped him reintegrate into society, and he said he still has close ties to local Spanish-speaking churches. He got to know some DOJ officials while reporting on an investigation into the Worcester Police Department.

Keough said one of those officials, a fellow Christian, told him about the possible raids, and that led him to look into the story. He'd already been concerned about ICE activity in Worcester, especially after a 16-year-old girl was arrested in May.

""That doesn't line up for me with America,"" he said.

Keough said he'd already seen that Spanish-speaking worshippers were staying away from churches out of fear of ICE, and he feared things could get worse. Then, he heard that ICE had conducted an immigration enforcement action on the grounds of a church in Charlotte last weekend, which pushed him to publish the story.

""I hope the administration will back off on the plan a little bit and maybe think twice,"" he said. ""Maybe we shouldn't be doing this in America.""

DOJ officials in Massachusetts and Rhode Island did not respond to a request for comment.

The Rev. Laura Everett, executive director of the Massachusetts Council of Churches, has been fielding calls and emails from pastors and other church leaders who read the story and are worried about possible raids. She and other staffers have been trying to sort out whether the stories about raids are true and helping churches prepare to protect parishioners.

""At a minimum, what we need to be doing is ensuring the safety of all of God's people,"" she said.

Everett said churches have been worried about potential raids ever since the Trump administration ended the restriction on raids at sensitive locations. The Massachusetts Council of Churches is one of a number of religious groups suing the Trump administration over the policy change. The latest rumors have only made things worse, she said.

In Atlanta, the Pentecostal pastor said most of his congregation has some type of legal documents, but even for them, ""the fear comes because of the separation of their families, children, wives, husbands."" With the whispers of massive raids, the ""uncertainty of what will happen, will they come? Will they not come?"" looms large, he said

Church members felt reassured early on in Trump's second term that immigration enforcement would target criminals, and the pastor encouraged members to pay any fines and get right with the law. But, by now, they've seen news reports of immigration enforcement outside churches and cases where immigration authorities don't appear to respect someone's documents.

The congregation has drastically rolled back its street evangelization ministry for fear of being out in public too long. Yet despite lingering anxiety, the pastor said he did not want to cancel Thursday worship if it was not necessary.

As of Thursday, increased immigration enforcement activity had not been reported in Atlanta, and the pastor said he hadn't seen anything notable.

""The Bible demands that we pray for people in positions of authority, and our only desire is to serve God freely without any fear,"" the pastor said.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-11/webRNS-ICE-Immigration1.jpg?h=ada05aa9&itok=S0N09QTn,N,,2025-11-21 15:57:50.968356

The California State University system is the nation’s largest and among its most diverse, with more than 460,000 students.","SAN DIEGO — The Trump administration has sued California for providing in-state college tuition, scholarships, and state-funded financial aid to students who do not have legal status to be in the United States.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, alleges the practice harms U.S. citizens and encourages illegal immigration. Among the defendants are the state, top state officials and the state's two public university systems, the University of California and California State.

President Donald Trump's administration has filed similar lawsuits against policies in other states, including Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Kentucky and Texas. Half the country now has similar laws to California's.

In June, after the administration sued, Texas ended its decades-old law. And Florida last year scrapped its law that allowed in-state tuition for high school graduates who weren't in the country legally.

Supporters of the state tuition breaks argue that they don’t violate federal law if they provide the same rates to U.S. citizens in the same circumstances — meaning they are residents of the state and graduates of one of its high schools. The California Dream Act also allows such students to apply for state-funded financial aid.

Many of the students were brought to the U.S. by their parents when they were children, and supporters of the laws say they are as much a part of their communities as U.S. citizens.

It is the latest action by Trump's administration since he issued executive orders in February directing federal agencies to stop public benefits from going to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and to challenge state and local policies seen as favoring those immigrants over some citizens. The lawsuit argues that the Republican president’s orders enforce federal immigration laws.

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week — we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.”

The Justice Department also sued to block new congressional district boundaries approved by California voters last week, and over California’s new laws banning federal agents from wearing masks and requiring them to have identification while conducting operations in the state.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Trump administration has sued California for providing in-state college tuition, scholarships, and state-funded financial aid to students who do not have legal status to be in the United States.

Kennedy, Jr. refused to meet their legal obligation to consult with Congress on the Administration’s refugee admissions plan — sending deputies to stage a charade consultation instead:

“51 days after the legal deadline, the Trump Administration today came to Capitol Hill in response to our monthslong demands that they follow the law and consult with Congress on their refugee admissions plan.

“It is outrageous that Secretaries Noem, Rubio, and Kennedy were too cowardly to come before us and explain their shocking decision to abandon nearly 130,000 vetted, approved refugees facing persecution and violence abroad. Instead, they sent their deputies, in brazen violation of the law which explicitly requires a consultation by ‘Cabinet-level representatives of the President.’

“The Trump Secretaries ignored their legal obligations to face us because their policy is indefensible.

It is impossible to justify a policy that abandons America’s historic commitment to offering safe harbor to the persecuted. Trump’s team has slashed refugee admissions to the lowest level in our nation’s history and reserved the bulk of the few remaining slots for white South African Afrikaners. They didn’t show up because their betrayal is unspeakable.

“The U.S. Refugee Resettlement program has always been a bipartisan matter of pride for our country, and a critically important tool in our toolbox for achieving multiple goals that are critically important to American interests. The destruction of the program will hurt our humanitarian and diplomacy efforts for decades to come.

“After months of evasion, diversion, and invoking the Republican shutdown as an alibi, the Administration thought they’d pacify us with more disrespect for the law. They were sorely mistaken.

“The Secretaries couldn’t be bothered to come to Congress today, but they should at least learn the route: they’ll be spending plenty of time here when Democrats retake the gavel.”

“It’s a promise we made and it’s a promise we need to keep.” While not a guarantee, military service offers an expedited pathway to citizenship.

Jojo Sweatt, the national organizing director of Common Defense, called for the federal government to bring back deported veterans, saying that their military service makes the government responsible for them.","Just a week after a Purple Heart recipient was deported from an immigration detention center in Florence, veterans and advocates gathered at the Arizona Capitol to condemn the removal of immigrant service members under President Donald Trump.

Michelle Byrd, who spent two decades in the U.S. Air Force and was deployed six times, criticized the deportations of veterans as disrespectful.

“That’s just the ultimate slap in the face, and we should be ashamed of ourselves for letting it happen,” she said. “They defended this country. They raised their hand and they swore to uphold the Constitution, and then they come home and we say, ‘Oh, thanks for your service, get out.’ It’s wrong.”

In an effort to deliver on Trump’s mass deportation promise, immigration enforcement activity has surged, and noncitizen service members, who were previously afforded limited protections from detainment and removal, have been caught in the crosshairs.

The deportation of veterans has been an ongoing issue, though a spotlight on an increase of removals by the Trump administration has prompted vocal criticism. In 2021, Biden issued an executive order that resulted in the creation of the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, which worked to prioritize the return of deported veterans and their families.

Signing up to join the military doesn’t require citizenship, just lawful permanent residency. During Joe Biden’s presidency, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were directed to take a person’s military record into consideration before arresting them. But under Trump, that guidance was replaced in April with a memo emphasizing that, while it would still be considered, military service alone doesn’t “automatically exempt aliens from the consequences of violating U.S. immigration laws.”

It’s unclear how many foreign-born veterans have been deported since Trump took office. Some estimates project as many as 10,000 were expelled from the country between January and June, according to a letter sent to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by Democratic members of Congress.

At least two Iraq war veterans have been deported from Arizona. Marlon Parris, who was born in Trinidad but lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years, was arrested outside his Laveen home two days after Trump’s inauguration, despite previous assurances from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security that his nonviolent drug charge from 2011 wouldn’t result in his removal. He has since been deported to Mexico. And last week, José Barco, a Purple Heart recipient who was born in Venezuela to Cuban exiles, was deported to Mexico following 10 months in detention.

Advocates argue that immigrants who have served in the military should be exempted from deportation. Mike Olivas, a Vietnam war veteran who drove to the Capitol from Tucson, highlighted the sacrifice of military service as proof that immigrants who sign up for it deserve more.

“They should be at a different level,” he said. “I mean, they fought for their country. They did more than a lot of people did.”

Chris Hill, an organizing fellow with the progressive veterans group Common Defense, added that the government needs to improve its naturalization processes for military members. He noted that the current process puts too much of the burden on military members themselves, and he’s heard about several cases when a person’s citizenship application was waylaid by a deployment order that made them miss critical court appointments.

“We need to codify a practice within the Department of Defense that, if you’re an immigrant and you served your tour of service, that it’s incumbent on the Department of Defense to ensure that you go through that process and you become a citizen while you’re on active duty,” he said. “It’s a promise we made and it’s a promise we need to keep.”

While not a guarantee, military service offers an expedited pathway to citizenship. But the rate of naturalization lags far behind the share of veterans who are immigrants. In 2022, an estimated 16.2 million veterans were born in another country. That same year, only 10,690 military-based naturalizations were approved.

The rate of naturalization is further complicated by the heightened risk of criminal conviction among veterans. To be eligible for naturalization through military service, a person must demonstrate “good moral character” for at least five years before applying. One-third of veterans report being arrested, compared to just one-fifth of non-veterans, due in part to post-traumatic stress disorders, traumatic brain injuries or substance abuse. Barco, whose 2006 naturalization application was lost before it could get approved while he was on active duty, was convicted of two counts of attempted first-degree murder and one count of menacing when he fired a handgun into a crowd of teenagers in Colorado two years later, just months after being discharged because of a worsening traumatic brain injury.

Hill argued that a criminal record shouldn’t be the sole determinant of when a foreign-born veteran should be expelled from the country.

“These are soldiers who deployed in very stressful situations, oftentimes were injured, oftentimes have traumatic brain injuries, oftentimes have PTSD and other symptoms,” he said. “To think that they can come back and make mistakes and pay their time, and then get deported? And get deported to a country they don’t know? It’s a tragedy, and it’s not a one-size-fits-all.”

Barcos was sentenced to 52 years in prison when one of the bullets he fired struck 19-year-old Ginny Clemens, who was pregnant. He was ultimately released on Jan. 21 — the day after Trump became president for the second time — after serving 15 years. ICE agents detained him minutes after he walked out.

Jojo Sweatt, the national organizing director of Common Defense, called for the federal government to bring back deported veterans, saying that their military service makes the government responsible for them.

“We need to repatriate any veteran who has already been exiled and sent away, because they served this country,” she said. “No matter what their flaws are, or who they are as a human being, they are American because they swore that oath, they defended this country, and whatever happened to them after that service and spending time in war, it’s up to our country to take care of them.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-79/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/no-veteran-deportations-1024x6831763686665.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=3QreHcLi,N,,2025-11-21 18:58:25.660905

Latest on Litigation

Doe v. Noem is a case challenging the mass termination of the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) parole processes and thehalting of adjudications of immigration applications for parolees who entered on CHNV and other parole programs including Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) and family reunification parole.

Here’s where we are:

Despite the ruling of Judge Talwani in the District Court, class members who arrived on parole are facing hold ups in the processing of their applications. As the plaintiffs write in a November 5 motion for expedited discovery in the case:

“As time is running out for many, the fear of removal is also real. The stakes simply could not be higher for those who remain in legal limbo while the clock is ticking…[T]here is a pressing need to ensure that Defendants have made good faith efforts in fact to resume processing of applications in the ordinary course.”

On November 10, the plaintiffs also filed a new motion for partial summary judgement on the issue of DHS’s mass termination of the paroles of people who arrived on CHNV. The plaintiffs write:

“The administrative record in this case exposes a stark truth: Secretary Noem’s mass truncation of CHNV parole was not a reasoned policy decision but an exercise in predetermined conclusion-reaching…the Secretary’s administrative record terminating parole grants for hundreds of thousands of people contains literally nothing—not a single document—evaluating whether the crises [in their countries of origin] persist…Nothing in the administrative record grapples with the fact that allowing parolees to seek humanitarian relief or other immigration benefits was an explicit purpose of the processes… that at least half of parolees (212,542 as of March 9) had pending applications for such relief….the administrative record has no information about how many parolees had U.S. citizen children enrolled in schools, how many had employment contracts or leases extending through their parole periods….There is likewise nothing in the administrative record about the impact on third parties who might have relied on the parolees.”

CHIRLA v. Noem is a case challenging the administration’s placement of people who entered through parole into expedited removal, a fast-track deportation process.

Here’s where we are:

On September 12, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the government’s request to stay the district court’s order blocking three directives from the Trump administration authorizing expedited removal of individuals who were paroled into the United States at a port of entry. But, since mid October, the Trump administration has claimed authority to apply expedited removal to people previously paroled at ports of entry pursuant to regulations deeming them “arriving aliens.” (8 C.F.R. §§ 1.2 and 235.3(b)(1)(i)), a position it explained in a November 17 brief to the First Circuit.

***If you learn of DHS invoking this authority in cases of people who were previously paroled into the U.S. at a port of entry, please report them to JAC, which is continuing to challenge the use of expedited removal against parolees.

Sileiri Doe et. al. v. DHS et. al. is a new class action lawsuit filed on August 11 challenging mass termination of parole and revocation of work authorization of people who waited for CBP One appointments and entered through land border ports of entry.

Here’s where we are:

On October 16, the plaintiffs filed their motion for summary judgement asking the court to vacate DHS’s decision to terminate en masse the parole of people who entered with CBP One appointments and vacate DHS revocations of employment authorizations based on the unlawful parole terminations. On November 6, the government responded that DHS was not required to provide individualized reasons for termination and that the termination emails sent to parolees was adequate notice.

Latest on Enforcement Policies

As indicated in the Doe v. Noem litigation, the Trump administration is finding numerous ways to slow the processing and reject applications for people who arrived on parole. One recent policy may require USCIS to “consider country-specific factors” within the countries listed in the ongoing travel bans as “significant negative factors” counting against people applying for immigration statuses that require a discretionary analysis. This would affect people who came on parole from countries subject to travel bans such as Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela, and Afghanistan. This means that since Afghanistan, according to the travel ban, “lacks a competent or cooperative central authority for issuing passports or civil documents” and Haiti “lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information,” USCIS could deny green cards to individual Afghans and Haitians who came on parole.

Even as it continues to arrest people who arrived on parole in its enforcement sweeps, the Trump administration has also begun to publish regulations that limit the ability of those who arrived on parole to work. It has issued a regulation eliminating the 540 day extension on work authorization for those who filed to renew their work permits. It has also issued a regulation precluding people who arrived on parole, among many other immigration statuses, from eligibility for commercial driver’s licenses, though this rule has been stayed temporarily by litigation and states should continue to issue licenses while litigation proceeds.

If you or people you know are affected by these rules, please submit comments to the federal register about their harmful impact. Here are template comments about the revocation of the 540 day extension (comments due December 1) and for the commercial driver’s licenses (comments due November 28).

The administration will soon publish proposed regulations limiting the eligibility of asylum seekers and parolees for work permits. We will keep you updated about these regulations and how to oppose them through comments and take actions.

Earlier this month, Congress passed a continuing resolution (CR) to reopen the government, extending FY 2025 funding levels through January 30 and barring agencies from projects not funded in the previous fiscal year. There is very limited time left in the session for committees of jurisdiction over immigration to advance meaningful oversight or legislative work.

On November 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Border Security and Immigration Subcommittee convened a hearing, “ICE Under Fire: The Radical Left’s Crusade Against Immigration Enforcement.” Witnesses fielded member questions on recent ICE operations in Chicago, and Senator Alex Padilla walked out in protest. Speakers at a shadow hearing convened by House Democrats attested to the harm inflicted during Operation Midway Blitz and highlighted efforts to show solidarity and support for community-members from rapid responders, faith leaders, and court action.

READ FULL REPORT

The appeals court temporarily blocked Ellis' order earlier this week, while an appeal by the Trump administration is considered.

The report pointed to an incident outside the Broadview processing center on Sept. 19, where pepper balls and tear gas were deployed to a crowd. Judge Ellis said she did not find the defendant's evidence and witnesses credible.

The report also noted that in one instance, an agent asked ChatGPT to create their use of force reports based off a brief sentence and several images.

The court says this ""further undermines the credibility and may explain the inaccuracy of these reports when viewed in the light of body worn camera footage.""

DHS issued a statement late Friday afternoon, calling the 7th Circuit Appellate ruling a win for law enforcement across America, while also responding to Ellis' written opinion.

They said in part, ""Judge Ellis' thoughts on 20th century poetry and Chief Bovino's conduct in the order are noted. They don't change the reality of the situation on the ground and at the appeals level.

The move by U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to target Pennsylvania follows similar action against California. Both states are run by Democratic governors who have criticized President Donald Trump’s administration and who are viewed as potential top-shelf contenders to be the party’s 2028 presidential nominee.

Duffy has made it a priority to scrutinize how the licenses are issued since August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. That incident thrust the issue into the public’s consciousness.

It’s unclear how many people would be affected in Pennsylvania. A letter from the Republican administration to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro cited an audit that found two out of 150 people whose licenses exceeded their lawful presence in the country.

The Trump administration is calling on Pennsylvania to pause the issuance of new, renewed and transferred commercial driver’s licenses and permits, as well as conduct an audit to identify those licenses whose expirations exceed the driver’s lawful stay in the U.S.

It is also asking the state to void noncompliant licenses and remove those drivers from the road.

The governors of California and Pennsylvania — Gavin Newsom and Shapiro — are tough critics of Trump, and both have been repeated targets of Trump’s administration.

Shapiro’s administration has said the state transportation department ceased issuing commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens after the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration published a regulation in late September that would severely limit which immigrants can get one.

A federal court has put the rule on hold for now, but Shapiro’s administration said its transportation department still hasn’t resumed issuing what are called “non-domiciled CDLs.”

The state transportation department said this week that whenever non-citizen applicants apply for a CDL in Pennsylvania, the agency reviews the necessary immigration and naturalization documents and verifies their lawful presence by checking the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s database.

But Shapiro this week suggested that DHS was falling short by failing to properly maintain that database, which states use to check an immigrant’s legal status before issuing a driver’s license to a noncitizen.

His comments came after DHS said it had arrested an Uzbek national with a commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania. The man, who had a work authorization granted in 2024, was wanted in his home country for belonging to a terrorist organization, the department said.

But Shapiro said the state transportation department checked the federal database over the summer before issuing a CDL to the man, and he was authorized to get one. The state rechecked the database this week, and it still listed him as qualified to get a CDL, Shapiro said.

“They clearly are not minding the shop, and they’ve gotta get better, because every single state in the country relies on this database when making a determination as to who qualifies for a CDL. We relied on the feds before issuing this one,” Shapiro said.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.lockhaven.com/images/2016/10/18200525/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 17:59:04.209278

Later on, many who were motivated by the issue gathered at CCB Plaza in downtown Durham for an upbeat gathering with traditional dancing and drumming. Students from J.D. Clement Early College, Southern High School and Durham School of the Arts were in attendance.

Students and other invested community members wanted to stand in solidarity, including high school senior Heavenlie Williams.

""Most people come to America to escape horrible things in their country or to build better lives for their families,"" said Williams, who organized a protest at Southern High on Thursday. ""I feel like this situation is a really big thing...who are we to deny people of good futures?""

Jeanell’s sister was granted British citizenship under the Windrush Scheme in 2018, and her two brothers were granted ILR under the Windrush Scheme before being naturalised in 2019.
In November 2024, the High Court ruled in favour of the Home Office, but Jeanell took her case to the Court of Appeal.
Judges said the Home Office had failed to exercise discretion in Jeanell’s case and the decision will now go back to the Home Office to reconsider.
""Today’s judgment rightly recognises that the Home Office should have considered exercising discretion under the Windrush Scheme.","It is the first successful case related to Windrush to be brought at the Court of Appeal.

In a judgment handed down today, the Court of Appeal ruled the Home Office was wrong when it failed to consider exercising its discretion to grant Jeanell's application, even though she did not squarely meet the criteria for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) under the Windrush scheme.

The Home Office and High Court denied Jeanell ILR because she had not fulfilled the requirement to be continuously resident in the UK.

Jeanell had been unable to fulfil the continuous residency criteria because her father’s Windrush ILR status was not confirmed in time to make it possible for her to apply to stay legally in the UK.

Jeanell arrived in the UK in August 2000 when she was aged 17 but had to leave the country when her student visa expired in 2002.

Her father, Cletus Hippolyte, who had arrived in 1956 as part of the Windrush Generation, was only granted proof of his ILR a year later in 2003.

Jeanell's applications to return to the UK, made in February 2006 and 2008, were then refused.

Jeanell lived in St Lucia with frequent family visits to the UK, until August 2020, and has since been continuously in the UK. Cletus was granted British citizenship in 2018 and had Windrush status. Jeanell’s sister was granted British citizenship under the Windrush Scheme in 2018, and her two brothers were granted ILR under the Windrush Scheme before being naturalised in 2019. Her father disappeared following a visit to St Lucia in 2019 and is now sadly presumed to be dead.

The Court of Appeal accepted that the purpose of the continuous residence requirement in the Windrush policy is to show strong and subsisting ties to the UK.

Jeanell’s case was that she could show her close ties to the UK in other ways, such as her history of extensive visits to the UK, her children being born in the UK and her eldest child attending school in the UK and given this, she fell within the ‘spirit’ of the Windrush Scheme, even if she did not strictly fall within the exact terms of the continuous residency requirement.

However the Home Office never considered this.

In November 2024, the High Court ruled in favour of the Home Office, but Jeanell took her case to the Court of Appeal.

Her legal team argued that as the Home Office failed to consider whether to exercise discretion in her circumstances, the decision should now go back to the Home Office to reconsider.

Today, the Court of Appeal ruled the High Court had erred in law and agreed with Jeanell’s legal team. Judges said the Home Office had failed to exercise discretion in Jeanell’s case and the decision will now go back to the Home Office to reconsider.

In its judgment, the Court of Appeal said:

“It is important that the general discretion which Parliament has conferred on the [Home Office] should be capable of being exercised in a holistic way, having regard to all the circumstances of an individual application.”

Freya Danby, solicitor at Leigh Day said:

“I am delighted that Jeanell’s appeal has succeeded. Throughout this process, she has shown remarkable courage and resilience, continuing her fight for indefinite leave to remain despite numerous setbacks.

""Today’s judgment rightly recognises that the Home Office should have considered exercising discretion under the Windrush Scheme. While Jeanell did not strictly meet the scheme’s criteria, her circumstances fall within its spirit. I hope this decision encourages greater flexibility for others in similar situations.

""This case could have a significant impact on other cases where people don't squarely meet the rules. The Home Office may have to update its guidance in light of the judgment.""

Jeanell Hippolyte said:

“I’m delighted by the Court’s decision and I am so grateful that the right outcome has happened. I feel that justice has been served. I am grateful for the chance to have my voice heard and to my legal team, Freya Danby, Jacqueline McKenzie, Chris Butler KC and Grace Brown, for all of their help and support throughout.""

In a statement released through a spokesperson, Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Suttell responded directly to the day’s events.
“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” Suttell said.
“We know we can do the same again.” In the chief justice’s public statement, Suttell said he cannot require judges to pivot entirely to virtual hearings at this time.
“The need to balance constitutional considerations, the public’s right of access, and the integrity of testimonial and evidentiary processes do not allow for a fully virtual court system,” he said.","As federal ICE agents continue to make arrests outside local courthouses, Rhode Island’s highest-ranking judge issued a rare press release on Thursday announcing that the state court system needs to “focus on ways to enhance access to virtual hearings and to educate the public as to how to request such hearings.”

The statement arrived at the end of a chaotic Thursday, during which court officials said ICE agents mistakenly detained a high school intern working in the Providence County Superior Court.

Those agents wound up face to face with protesters, who had gathered for a pre-scheduled rally to call on court officials to expand virtual hearing access. During the confrontation, a masked ICE agent stepped out of an unmarked vehicle to aim a taser at protesters before driving away.

“ICE is coming to court houses to pick people up because they know they have to come to court, right?” Providence City Council President Rachel Miller, who spoke at the rally, said in an interview. “And so by letting people engage the legal system in a virtual way, it eliminates that danger.”

Maya Lehrer, an organizer with the recently formed Rhode Island Deportation Defense Network, which hosted the rally, said the group began stationing volunteers outside local courthouses in September, and documenting frequent instances where ICE detained people on their way in or out.

On Thursday, though, ICE agents appeared to cross a line that drew a stern response from the state court system. In a statement released through a spokesperson, Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice Paul Suttell responded directly to the day’s events.

“This egregious incident underscores both the community’s and the judiciary’s concerns about how ICE is conducting its operations in Rhode Island,” Suttell said. “Given this climate, the judiciary understands the call to implement remote hearings in Providence County, and beyond.”

The Deportation Defense Network had issued a public demand earlier in the week for Suttell to “remove the legal red tape and require judges to offer virtual hearings, trials, and conferences, except in extraordinary circumstances.”

“This could instantly cut off a major source of ICE detentions in Rhode Island and allow immigrant community members to access the legal system without fear,” the network’s statement said.

Under current court policy, the network said that virtual court hearings can be requested, but few community members know how to access them, and the process requires a lawyer or legal advocate to effectively navigate.

“We did go fully virtual to protect families during Covid,” Miller said. “We know we can do the same again.”

In the chief justice’s public statement, Suttell said he cannot require judges to pivot entirely to virtual hearings at this time.

“The need to balance constitutional considerations, the public’s right of access, and the integrity of testimonial and evidentiary processes do not allow for a fully virtual court system,” he said. “What occurred today, however, reinforces the Judiciary’s need to focus on ways to enhance access to virtual hearings and to educate the public as to how to request such hearings.”

A court spokesperson, Alexandra Kriss, said the intern detained by ICE was released after agents confirmed they had the wrong person.

“If not for the intervention of a Superior Court judge who insisted that ICE had wrongfully identified his intern as their target,” Kriss said, “this young person would have been taken into ICE custody.”",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ri-remote-court-1-1000x750.jpeg,N,,2025-11-21 16:57:49.348596

At the time, these students could qualify for in-state tuition and financial aid under the 2001 Texas Dream Act.

However, a June federal court order blocked Texas from enforcing this law. Now, undocumented students must provide evidence of lawful presence to qualify for these benefits, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

To comply, the board adopted new rules, which went into effect on Nov. 13, that allow universities to verify student immigration status with a federal agency, which may pose privacy risks, said Garibay, a senior strategist and consultant at the Intercultural Development Research Association, a nonprofit that helps students from underserved communities access public education.

The rules require non-citizen students applying for in-state tuition to submit a residency questionnaire and an affidavit affirming lawful presence. Federal immigration law does not define “lawful presence” — only “unlawful presence,” which refers to any time when a person is present in the country without being admitted or paroled, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Several public interest groups were concerned about the lack of a definition for “lawful presence” after the board proposed the rules in August. In response, the board stated that institutions should consult their own legal counsel to “determine the status(es) that may be considered lawfully present.”

“The lawfully present standard is required by federal law,” a board spokesperson wrote in a statement. “Our discretion in the matter is limited.”

The board does not have authority to determine what lawful presence is, but it could clarify how it interprets current provisions of immigration law, said Danny Woodward, an attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project.

“Schools are going to probably … be treating students differently because they’re using different definitions of lawful presence,” Woodward said.

The adopted rules now allow schools to verify evidence of lawful presence using Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, a federal program administered by USCIS. The system helps government agencies confirm the immigration status of people applying for public benefits.

In Texas, eight state agencies are authorized to use SAVE, according to USCIS. However, no Texas university currently uses the system to independently verify lawful presence. Typically, schools do not need independent access to SAVE and instead use it in conjunction with another government agency, like the Department of Education, when administering federal student aid.

“USCIS welcomes the opportunity to work with universities in Texas or other states to ensure that only eligible aliens are receiving taxpayer funded benefits such as in-state tuition,” a USCIS spokesperson wrote in an email.

UT is considering the feasibility of using SAVE to confirm lawful presence.

To use SAVE, an agency must enter a formal agreement with USCIS, according to a sample contract. However, Garibay said she is concerned that sharing student information with the agency could lead to violations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which protects students’ identifiable information, such as citizenship status or social security number.

“From our perspective, colleges and universities need to continue to protect students’ information,” Garibay said. “Our universities and colleges should not be the arm of USCIS.”",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-2-25_Capitol_Makenna-Morgan-12.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 13:57:22.230881

‘I consider America my home’ Kuyateh said she’s safe for now in an undisclosed location in Sierra Leone.","A Maryland family is trying to get their loved one back after she was deported from the U.S. to a country they say she had no ties to. Video that’s made international news showed her being dragged by people her family believes worked for Ghana’s government.

The videos obtained by the News4 I-Team are raising questions from her family about how people are treated after they are deported from the U.S. to countries other than their countries of origin.

As part of the Trump administration’s third-country deportation program, dozens of deportees have been sent from the U.S. to Africa since this summer, NBC News reported.

Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a 58-year-old mother and grandmother, moved to the D.C. area 30 years ago as she fled Sierra Leone’s civil war, said Mohamed Alghali, her son. He owns a home in Bowie with his mom, who he called his best friend.

“I felt defeated. Felt like I failed my mom,” he said.

Alghali was born in the U.S. and his family put down roots in the D.C. area. His grandparents joined them and became citizens. Kuyateh’s attorney says she was a nurse with a work permit but never became a citizen.

‘My heart just broke’

Alghali was required to check in every year with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement.

Her check-in this July was different.

“They called her to the back. They said, ‘Yeah, Rabbiatu, you have a order of removal. So, we're, you know, yeah, we're detaining you,” her son said.

“I mean, my heart just broke,” he said.

Alghali was optimistic he would see his mother again. But he wouldn’t see her face-to-face. After several days at Maryland ICE’s temporary holding area, she was moved to an ICE facility in Louisiana, where she was held for months, her attorney said.

“I don't think anyone expected her to be detained, just because nothing had changed with her circumstances,” attorney Hannah Bridges said.

Kuyateh’s attorney said Kuyateh was still in Louisiana in September when a judge granted an order saying she could not be sent back to Sierra Leone, where she said her client had been tortured.

Bridges said the U.S. immediately began exploring other countries to send her to, which the attorney tried to fight in court with requests for hearings.

“Those requests went unacknowledged,” Bridges said.

Kuyateh’s civil rights have been violated, her attorney said.

“She should have been given notice and an opportunity to seek protection from removal to a third country, and the government had multiple opportunities to do this,” Bridges said.

Rabbiatu Kuyateh says she was flown to Ghana in shackles

Earlier this month, Kuyateh was flown from the U.S. to Ghana, a country she said she had never been to.

Alghali called his mother while the I-Team was with him. She said as she was flown from the U.S. to Ghana, her wrists and ankles were shackled for the entire 10-hour flight. Some had it even worse, she said.

“There was another guy on the floor. That guy, they chained from the head. Down to the feet,” Kuyateh said. “They said if you don't cooperate with us, that's how we're going to tie you.”

Kuyateh told the I-Team she and other deportees were sent to a hotel in Ghana. She said she was there for six days before video captured her being dragged.

A bus arrived to take Kuyateh to Sierra Leone – though a U.S. judge had ordered that she could not be sent there. She told News4 she resisted.

“That’s when they dragged me. So, they bumped the back of my head,” Kuyateh said.

The I-Team obtained multiple videos of the dragging, which were sent to her family and provided to News4.

Kuyateh said she believes the people on video in green uniforms worked for Ghana's government.

Photos show some of the injuries Kuyateh said she sustained from being dragged.

The video went viral overseas, and several media outlets in West Africa reported that the Sierra Leone High Commission, which is like its embassy in Ghana, said it’s aware of what happened and will investigate.

News4 asked the Ministry of the Interior for Ghana about this. They acknowledged our email but did not answer our questions. We received no response from Sierra Leone officials.

NBC Washington asked the Ministry of the Interior for Ghana about this. They acknowledged our email but did not answer our questions. We received no response from Sierra Leone officials.

‘I consider America my home’

Kuyateh said she’s safe for now in an undisclosed location in Sierra Leone. But she wants to be with her family.

“I consider America my home. It's like, I built relationships there,” she said.

In the home she owns in Bowie, her family asked what her future would hold and if she would ever return. The I-Team asked her son if she felt that the U.S. had failed his mom.

“Yes, one hundred percent. I felt like they’ve been failing her,” Alghali said.

The I-Team reached out to ICE in Maryland for comment several days ago. They asked that we share our videos of Kuyateh being dragged, which we did. They still have not responded to our questions about her case.

In September, the U.S. Department of Justice argued in federal court that it had no power to control how another country treats deportees. It said that Ghana had pledged to the U.S. that it wouldn't send deportees back to their home countries.

The United Nations human rights office has called on Ghana to stop deporting people from the U.S. to their home countries if U.S. courts have said it’s dangerous for them to return.

Kuyateh was the primary caregiver for her mother and father. She told the I-Team she’s worried about who will take care of them now. When she was detained in the U.S., she thought she was being released to head back to Maryland when she was forced to board the flight to Ghana.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling.
The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.
“Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”","The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda — President Donald Trump ’s birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump’s appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration’s broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings, while they allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. Trump’s order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions.

While the Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions, it did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.

But every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or most likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The administration is appealing two cases.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco ruled in July that a group of states that sued over the order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others.

Also in July, a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the citizenship order in a class-action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.

The American Civil Liberties Union, leading the legal team in the New Hampshire case, urged the court to reject the appeal because the administration’s “arguments are so flimsy,” ACLU lawyer Cody Wofsy said. “But if the court decides to hear the case, we’re more than ready to take Trump on and win.”

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in urging the high court’s review. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”",https://valawyersweekly.com/files/2021/10/VLW-digital-product-mockup-for-Facebook.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 17:59:21.035978

The government has issued about 420,000 H-2A visas for agricultural workers every year since 2023, which amounts to about half of the 812,000 agricultural worker jobs.
Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000).

At the same time, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in recent months appears to be refraining from conducting agricultural workplace raids, even as it scours Democratic-led cities for immigrants who are in the country illegally.

“We really haven’t seen agriculture targeted with worksite enforcement efforts, and early this year we did,” said Julia Gelatt, associate director of U.S. immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.

The shifts come as many Americans are concerned about the rising cost of food, creating political problems for a president who campaigned on lowering them. Last week, the administration also announced it would lift tariffs on some foreign food products, including bananas, beef, coffee and tomatoes.

Trump migrant deportations could threaten states’ agricultural economies

To ease labor shortages on farms and ranches, the administration last month made changes to the federal H-2A visa program, which allows employers to hire foreign workers for temporary agricultural jobs when there aren’t enough U.S.-born workers available. Under the new rule, the Department of Homeland Security will approve H-2A visas more quickly.

“Our immigration system has been broken for decades, and we finally have a President who is enforcing the law and prioritizing fixing programs farmers and ranchers rely on to produce the safest and most productive food supply in the world,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in an email to Stateline.

But the move to increase the supply of foreign agricultural workers conflicts with a July statement by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins that “the promise to America, to ensure that we have a 100% American workforce, stands.”

Rollins also said the administration was committed to the mass deportation of immigrants who are here illegally, but that it would be “strategic so as not to compromise our food supply.” Ultimately, she said, the solution would be increased automation of agricultural jobs.

The government has issued about 420,000 H-2A visas for agricultural workers every year since 2023, which amounts to about half of the 812,000 agricultural worker jobs. They are concentrated in states that grow fruits and vegetables as opposed to grains, which are increasingly planted and harvested using machines. The government expects an additional 119,000 visas to be issued under the new rule.

Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000).

Lower wages

The new H-2A rule also includes new hourly wage guidelines that vary by state but are lower than previous wages, and allows employers to charge workers for housing that used to be free. In North Carolina, for instance, the new rate is $11.09 for unskilled workers compared with $16.16 last year. In California, the rate is $13.45 for unskilled workers compared with $19.97 last year, though minimum wage laws in California and some other states would apply to those jobs, according to a Cornell University analysis.

ICE has a new courthouse tactic: Get immigrants’ cases tossed, then arrest them outside

In North Carolina, farmers are looking forward to lower labor costs, said Lee Wicker, deputy director of the North Carolina Growers Association, a trade association that brought 11,000 guest workers to the state through the H-2A guest worker program last year.

“If you think farmers are making more money in these conditions, you’re wrong. They’re going broke,” Wicker said. Workers will take a pay cut under new guidelines and will have to pay for housing, but that may help farmers stave off bankruptcy, he said.

“I’m not saying the workers are going to be happy about this, but I think they’ll come back. Wages have gone down before and they kept coming,” he added.

Jeffrey Dorfman, an agricultural and resource economics professor at North Carolina State University, said the changes will be a boon to the state’s farmers.

“The move to lower the H-2A wages by the Trump administration will be very well received by growers in North Carolina and will save farmers tens of millions of dollars statewide,” Dorfman said. “For many farmers, it will turn money-losing crops into money-making crops, if prices stay about where they are now.”

Unionized California farmworkers are opposed to the pay cuts and loss of free housing in the new guest worker visa plan, said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesperson for the United Farm Workers, which represents about 10,000 workers in California.

The union sued the administration over ICE raids in the fields earlier this year, but recently “it’s been pretty quiet,” he said.

“For us it’s been really a one-two punch,” De Loera-Brust said. “First came the raids, which hurt workers, and now in order to appease business interests, they make all these concessions on wages and the guest workers program.”

Fewer raids

The administration quickly walked back a June directive to avoid raids on the agriculture and hospitality industries. Nevertheless, ICE raids on those employers have been more infrequent in the months since.

In June, ICE raided a dairy farm in New Mexico and a meatpacking plant in Nebraska. Since then, the agency has raided only a handful of food and agriculture employers, such as a July raid on a California marijuana grower and an Arizona restaurant chain, and a September raid to arrest Wisconsin dairy workers.

For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

Earlier this month, ICE agents descended on an onion farm in Northern California, arresting four immigrants on charges of illegally selling farmworker visas.

Even as ICE ramps up its activity in North Carolina cities such as Charlotte and Raleigh, Wicker, of the growers trade group, said farms in the state have not been targeted.

Gelatt, of the Migration Policy Institute, said that’s been true of farms and ranches in many states since June.

“In past administrations we’ve seen a very quiet de-emphasis of immigration enforcement at farms. You don’t need to make an announcement. You don’t need to fight in the courts,” Gelatt said. “It is possible just to direct enforcement activities away from farms. It’ll be hard to know if that’s happened now, but I would not be surprised.”

While farmworkers in California are seeing some relief from raids, life is still uneasy for them, De Loera-Brust said.

“Overall, they have clearly slowed down [raids] in ag areas, but that’s not policy. They could resume at any time. People are living with uncertainty,” he said.

The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California, is the latest action by the Trump administration against California. It is the third lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against the state in a week, Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.

“Federal law prohibits aliens illegally present in the United States from receiving in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state U.S. citizens,” the government said in the complaint. “There are no exceptions.”

The complaint refers to California’s exemption from out-of-state rates for applicants, including students living in the country illegally, who have graduated from the state’s high schools or meet education requirements at other institutions in the state. It asks the court to declare this rule unconstitutional and invalid, and to bar the defendants from enforcing it.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California; Rob Bonta, the state’s attorney general; the University of California system; and California Community Colleges are listed among the defendants.

Rachel Zaentz, a University of California spokesperson, said it followed state and federal laws regarding eligibility for in-state tuition, financial aid and scholarships.

“While we will, of course, comply with the law as determined by the courts, we believe our policies and practices are consistent with current legal standards,” she said.

The rules targeted by the complaint affect thousands of students lacking permanent legal status in California’s colleges and universities. The California Community Colleges system, with 116 campuses, is one of the largest in the country. Like the University of California system, it says it does not discriminate on the basis of an applicant’s immigration status.

California is not the first state to be targeted by the Trump administration over tuition benefits for students living in the country illegally. The Justice Department has filed similar suits against Illinois, Kentucky, Texas, Minnesota and Oklahoma. The department noted its actions followed Trump executive orders this year barring those not in the country legally from receiving taxpayer benefits or preferential treatment.

Washington, D.C. – Democracy Forward is taking the Trump-Vance administration to court to uncover raw footage connected to social media videos produced during raids perpetrated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in Chicago last month and information pertaining to training and operational guidance.

In a lawsuit filed against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE, Democracy Forward is asking a federal court to help shed light on the administration’s unconstitutional and unconscionable pursuit of its immigration agenda. The suit asks a federal court to order DHS and ICE to disclose the public documents, as required by law.

On September 30, 2025, at around 1 am local time, federal agents conducted a military-style raid on a Chicago apartment building—a deeply concerning operation in the Trump-Vance administration’s approach to immigration enforcement. As agents worked their way through the building, media outlets reported that they kicked down doors, detonated flash bang grenades, and zip tied sobbing children. Reportedly, nearly all residents in the building were detained as part of this immigration raid, including U.S. citizens. Members of Congress have expressed outrage over the conduct of this operation and have pressed DHS for information about the manner in which the raid was conducted. Subsequent reporting has revealed that many detained in the raid had no criminal records.

A few days after the raid, DHS published a video on its social media accounts valorizing the dangerous and unjustified action. The video uses numerous camera angles of the raid, indicating that it was a compilation of a substantial quantity of footage edited for public relations purposes.

“The administration cannot ignore the Constitution in their pursuit of social media clicks. The public deserves to see the full extent of the horror inflicted on American neighborhoods by the Trump-Vance administration’s unconstitutional and unlawful PR stunt,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “The government cannot legally hide the footage captured at the raid, nor can they cover up the public documents used in the raid’s preparation and execution. We are eager to argue this case in court.”

In the wake of the raid, Democracy Forward filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), asking for all documents relating to the planning and execution of the raid, as well as all of the raw footage – not just the selectively edited social media video – that was captured during the raid. The requests were not addressed within the legally required time for the government to respond, forcing Democracy Forward to move forward with this lawsuit to compel the disclosure of all documents and video footage.

The case is Democracy Forward Foundation v. DHS et al, and the legal team in this case includes Daniel McGrath, Amy Vickery, and Robin Thurston.

Sexual abuse can also be used to coerce incarcerated people into making a warden appear “productive” or “helpful” to external stakeholders.
On its website, the Federal Bureau of Prisons announced that former FCI Dublin Warden Wiley Z. Jenkins received the Army Community Partnership Award.
They argue reopening FCI Dublin under ICE would not prevent future harm — it would replicate it.","SAN FRANCISCO – Human rights activists are urging the federal government not to reopen Federal Correctional Institute (FCI) Dublin, California, as an ICE detention center, arguing the facility has a documented history of sexual violence and human rights violations, according to an ActionNow petition.

The Los Angeles Times reported that multiple officers, including former Warden Ray J. Garcia and prison chaplain Jesse Highhouse, were convicted of sexual abuse at the facility.

Now, the immigrant women who testified against them are being deported even though they qualify for U Visas, which provide a pathway to citizenship, according to KTVU. Human rights advocates worry that ICE will repeat the same abuses or retaliate against these immigrants with deportation, according to the ActionNow petition.

While no official announcements have been made, “BOP [Bureau of Prisons] Central Office staff, BOP Western Regional Staff and ICE representatives did a visual structural assessment on FCI Dublin,” American Federation of Government Employees Local 3584 President Edward Canales told KQED. “Basically, can the prison hold detainees as is, or [does it] need repairs.”

Not only have protests come from women who survived abuse at FCI Dublin, but Japanese Americans who lived through U.S. wartime incarceration have also joined in opposition, drawing parallels to xenophobic detention policies they vowed would “never happen again.” Research shows communities near ICE detention centers experience higher immigration arrest and deportation rates.

In addition, recidivism for staff-perpetrated prison sexual abuse is high. Susan Beaty of the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice told Truthout that transferring incarcerated women to another facility after FCI Dublin shut down did not protect them. “Sexual abuse, medical neglect and retaliation exists across the system,” she said. “It doesn’t solve the problems to move people who have already been through so much to other places — farther away from their families and their attorneys — where they’re going to be subjected to very similar kinds of harm.”

Sexual abuse has been documented in U.S. correctional systems since the nation’s founding. Prisons are structured around control, and sexual abuse functions as a tool of domination with roots connected to colonial and chattel slavery power systems.

Sexual abuse can also be used to coerce incarcerated people into making a warden appear “productive” or “helpful” to external stakeholders. When wardens are labeled “productive” without a formal rating system, they may receive financial bonuses.

On its website, the Federal Bureau of Prisons announced that former FCI Dublin Warden Wiley Z. Jenkins received the Army Community Partnership Award. FCI Dublin sits adjacent to the Parks Reserve Forces Training Area on a former air base and uses incarcerated workers to provide labor below minimum wage in exchange for job training. The maximum a federal prisoner can earn is $2 per hour.

Despite accessing what amounts to nearly free labor while the government spends approximately $80 billion annually on corrections and $1.2 trillion to operate government-run facilities, historian Alexander Lichtenstein and Michael Kroll wrote in a project of the American Friends Service Committee, “Prisons, filled with unemployed people of color from the inner cities, are being sold to economically depressed rural communities as a source of jobs for their growing numbers of unemployed — who are usually whites.”

Women are disproportionately targeted by economic conditions that lead to incarceration. The Prison Policy Initiative reported that “35% of women experienced homelessness, eviction, or struggled to make rent or mortgage payments as a result of bail, court fees and lost economic opportunities. Incarceration cost one-third of women their household’s primary source of income, and 43% were forced to work more hours, get a different job, or turn down an educational opportunity as a result.”

In The New Yorker, reporter Eric Markowitz explained that “the country’s historic incarceration boom has given rise to companies that provide services and products to government prisons. Many of these provide necessary equipment and services, of course, but some do so in rather unsavory ways.”

Markowitz pointed to the prison phone industry, which is dominated by a small number of private companies that make an estimated $1.2 billion annually from phone and video call fees. These calls can cost up to $30 for 40 minutes.

The prison health care provider Corizon Health earns $1.4 billion per year and has faced allegations including failing to hire registered nurses for intake evaluations and leaving terminally ill patients in soiled beds without food or water.

Commissary prices inside prisons can be five times higher than retail stores, resulting in approximately $1.6 billion in annual profit for the commissary industry.

Markowitz wrote that Peter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, told him, “I expect the government to waste money. But it’s totally different for the government to collude with a private company to make poor people lose money.”

With the U.S. economy benefiting from the detention system and wardens allegedly using sexual abuse to maintain obedience, advocates argue that the location of future ICE facilities is not the issue. They say the problem is the carceral structure itself.

Advocates warn systemic profit incentives, retaliation against survivors and staff transfers normalize abuse and create a culture of impunity. They argue reopening FCI Dublin under ICE would not prevent future harm — it would replicate it.

“Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda — President Donald Trump ’s birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump’s appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration’s broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings, while they allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. Trump’s order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions.

While the Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions, it did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.

But every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or most likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The administration is appealing two cases.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco ruled in July that a group of states that sued over the order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others.

Also in July, a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the citizenship order in a class-action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.

The American Civil Liberties Union, leading the legal team in the New Hampshire case, urged the court to reject the appeal because the administration’s “arguments are so flimsy,” ACLU lawyer Cody Wofsy said. “But if the court decides to hear the case, we’re more than ready to take Trump on and win.”

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in urging the high court’s review. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Immigration_Birthright_Citizenship_25325081999485-1568x1045.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 13:57:40.802495

The Path Ahead The MRA is meant to ensure that the power of the purse remains in Congress’s hands.","President Trump has co-opted Congress’s power of the purse by privately raising hundreds of billions of dollars from corporations and foreign governments outside the legally required appropriations process. In recent months, the administration has used corporate donations to start construction on a White House ballroom, accepted a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the Qatari royal family, and used $130 million in privately donated funds to pay service members during a government shutdown. Each of these arrangements channels private or foreign money into public functions without a congressional appropriation. They are violations, in letter or in spirit, of the Miscellaneous Receipts Act, a core fiscal statute that requires all money or property “received for the Government” to be deposited in the Treasury unless Congress says otherwise.

The Trump administration’s growing use of private donations and foreign financing to supplement congressional appropriations illustrates how easily the Miscellaneous Receipts Act and Congress’s power of the purse can be bypassed. These “shadow appropriations” empower the executive branch to direct money toward its own priorities without congressional authorization or oversight.

Unless Congress acts, the presidency will acquire a second, hidden budget: slush funds drawn from corporations and foreign governments with no external oversight. The power of the purse anchors Congress’s independence, keeping the legislature from becoming a spectator to executive power. Unless Congress reasserts control over federal spending, the balance the framers designed could collapse into a self-financing presidency.

The Legal Framework

The Constitution’s Appropriations Clause provides that “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” The Miscellaneous Receipts Act (MRA) gives that command practical force: “an official or agent of the Government receiving money for the Government from any source shall deposit the money in the Treasury.” In other words, the MRA applies when (1) a government official or agent receives funds and (2) those funds are for the government. Once deposited in the Treasury, the funds can be withdrawn only through an appropriation enacted by Congress.

Congress has carved out limited exceptions to the MRA by authorizing certain agencies to accept private gifts. These agencies have specific gift-acceptance statutes allowing them to accept money, services, or property from private donors without violating the MRA. Other agencies have no such authority at all. Where these statutes exist, their terms vary: some require ethics reviews, limit gifts to particular purposes, or bar donors from placing conditions on how their contributions are used. When a gift fits within a valid statutory authorization, the agency may keep it without breaching the MRA. But, unless the law also authorizes the agency to spend those funds, using them would violate the Anti-Deficiency Act, which forbids federal officials from obligating or spending money without an appropriation or other legal authority.

The MRA underpins a longstanding rule of appropriations law known as the anti-augmentation principle: an agency’s lawful funding equals, and cannot exceed, the funds Congress has appropriated. Any outside money or in-kind benefit used to expand an agency’s budget violates that rule. To prevent circumvention, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), and the courts have recognized the doctrine of constructive receipt, treating money or property as “received” when the government effectively controls their use, even if never directly taking possession. The doctrine ensures that agencies cannot evade the MRA simply by structuring transactions such that no federal official ever handles the money.

GAO and OLC have applied the constructive-receipt doctrine differently. OLC takes a narrower view, permitting third-party settlements so long as the government retains no control over the funds after the agreement is executed. GAO applies a broader, substance-focused standard that looks to the government’s practical influence or involvement in how the funds are used. It has historically viewed third-party payments as bypassing Congress’s control absent strong justification.

Officials who violate the MRA may be removed from office and required to forfeit any portion of the funds they hold or would otherwise be entitled to. Though the statute carries no criminal penalties, related laws prohibiting the misuse of government resources can still apply. Together, these safeguards uphold the MRA’s deeper purpose: preserving Congress’s power of the purse and ensuring that the executive spends only what the people’s representatives have approved.

Shadow Appropriations in Practice

Throughout 2025, the administration’s approach to the MRA has evolved from quiet workarounds to overt evasion, an experiment in ever more aggressive executive self-financing. It began in March, when several major law firms agreed to provide roughly $1 billion in pro bono legal services for causes chosen by the administration. Because the government retained post-settlement control over which organizations would receive those services, it constructively received the funds in violation of the MRA even under OLC’s narrower reading of the Act. The deals offered a blueprint for how the executive could pressure private actors to fund public priorities without an appropriation, a dangerous precedent I have analyzed separately.

By May, that blueprint was being put into practice. The Trump administration confirmed that it would accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One. The jet, worth roughly $400 million, may be the largest gift ever given to the United States by a foreign government. Now being modified for presidential travel, it will later be transferred to President Trump’s presidential library. Although the Justice Department approved the transfer, the administration has refused to release its legal rationale, which likely relies on the Defense Department’s gift-acceptance authorities. Whatever the justification, accepting a half-billion-dollar aircraft for use as Air Force One stretches the concept of a “gift” well beyond what Congress ever intended.

Two months later, in July, the same disregard reached the Justice Department. It entered a settlement requiring Brown University to pay $50 million to “state workforce development organizations,” rather than to the Treasury, and in November entered a similar settlement requiring Cornell University to invest $30 million in research projects that benefit U.S. farmers. Because the DOJ retained no post-settlement control over the funds, the agreements likely complied with OLC’s longstanding interpretation of the MRA. But they appear inconsistent with GAO’s broader approach to constructive receipt, as the payment neither compensated victims nor related to the underlying discrimination case. Moreover, they violated DOJ’s current settlements policy, contravening the Attorney General’s February 2025 directive not to use third-party payments to non-victims except in limited circumstances.

In July, the White House also announced plans for a 90,000-square-foot “Presidential Ballroom,” projected to cost roughly $300 million and to be funded entirely by private donors. Reporting identified multiple corporate pledges of more than $10 million each. President Trump later hosted the ballroom’s corporate donors at a White House reception, giving private financiers of a federal building access to the president at a taxpayer-funded event. Although he initially claimed the construction would not affect the East Wing, he subsequently demolished it. The administration has offered no legal theory for the donations but is likely relying on a gift statute for the Department of the Interior or the National Park Service. Like the Qatari jet, the project would stretch any such authority well past its intended scope, turning permission for routine donations into a vehicle for privately financing presidential construction.

By fall, what began as discrete gifts and settlements had expanded into a slush fund measured in the hundreds of billions. In exchange for partial tariff relief, Japan agreed to provide $550 billion in investment capital that President Trump would personally select. Because the administration determines which projects Japan must fund, the money is “received for the Government” under the MRA and must be deposited in the Treasury. Instead, it created a parallel, foreign-financed shadow budget under presidential control and outside Congress’s appropriations process. On November 14, South Korea struck a similar deal with the United States, committing $200 billion under essentially the same model. The following week, the Department of Energy’s chief of staff reportedly said in a conference speech that the Japanese funds may be used to buy and own as many as ten new nuclear reactors.

In October, the Trump administration announced that it intended to use a $130 million donation from billionaire Timothy Mellon to pay service members during the shutdown, but it has not disclosed whether any of the funds were actually spent. Using the donation for troop pay would violate the Anti-Deficiency Act, as the Department’s gift-acceptance statutes authorize it to receive such funds but not to spend them on salaries.

The Risks of Unchecked Violations

The MRA may seem like bureaucratic bookkeeping, but it embodies a deeper constitutional principle. The power of the purse is Congress’s ultimate check on executive power, ensuring a government of laws, not of men. As Madison wrote in Federalist 58, the “power over the purse” is the people’s “most complete and effectual weapon . . . for obtaining a redress of every grievance.”

History shows what happens when presidents raise and spend money outside Congress’s control. During the Iran-Contra affair, White House officials secretly sold weapons to Iran and used the proceeds—along with funds solicited from foreign governments—to support the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. The episode showed how executive self-financing—raising and spending money outside the appropriations process—undermines Congress’s control over public spending and allows presidents to act unilaterally on major policies.

When presidents can raise and spend money outside Congress, the constitutional balance between democratic accountability and executive authority threatens to give way. Once executive financing moves off budget, the damage radiates outward. Accountability erodes first, as presidents make unilateral decisions—even demolishing parts of the White House—without congressional consent. Transparency disappears next: appropriations are debated, recorded, and audited; donations and foreign transfers are often not. Then comes influence as companies or benefactors that finance presidential projects gain improper access and influence, blurring the line between public policy and private patronage. And when the money comes from abroad, leverage follows, embedding subtle obligations in the very assets meant to symbolize national sovereignty.

These constitutional breaches accumulate power in the presidency at the expense of Congress and, ultimately, the electorate. The MRA and other fiscal laws are how Congress restrains the executive, insisting that no president, however popular or powerful, may spend money without the people’s consent.

A Reform Agenda

To restore control over the public purse, Congress should begin by addressing the four recent executive actions that implicate the MRA.

(1) Qatari Jet: The Qatari jet could be auctioned off and the proceeds deposited in the Treasury, reaffirming that foreign governments may not endow the presidency directly.

(2) White House Ballroom: Congress could require the administration to disclose the size of each donation, provide transparent accounting of costs, and cap the total private budget or shift the project to taxpayer funding to mitigate conflicts. In essence, Congress should hold the project to at least the same standards of oversight and accountability that apply to any federally funded construction.

(3) Foreign Deals: For the Japan and South Korea deals, Congress should not allow any president to personally direct hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign-financed spending outside the appropriations process. At a minimum, it should either prohibit them from proceeding or else enact a statutory framework to bring them under transparent governance and appropriations control.

(4) Private Donation to Pay Troop Salaries: For the $130 million in privately donated troop pay, Congress should clarify that no gift authority permits substituting private funds for appropriated military pay and should require the Defense Department to unwind the transaction and restore compliance with the Anti-Deficiency Act. If that would violate the terms of the gift, the Department should return the funds to the donor or seek congressional authorization to do so.

These steps may face political resistance, but they show the scope of Congress’s authority to correct existing breaches. Even short of legislation, members of Congress can seek GAO opinions and request the ethics analyses and legal authorities the agencies relied upon. Over the longer term, Congress should strengthen the MRA’s enforcement mechanisms and narrow the exceptions the Trump administration has sought to exploit.

Congress Should Strengthen and Enforce the Miscellaneous Receipts Act

Congress should strengthen and enforce the Miscellaneous Receipts Act in several key ways:

1. Require Mandatory Reporting and Real Consequences for Violations

Congress should require agency heads to notify Congress and GAO of any MRA breach—mirroring the reporting obligations in the Anti-Deficiency Act—and to document corrective steps taken. To ensure compliance, Congress should attach meaningful penalties: civil or administrative sanctions for reckless conduct and criminal liability for knowing or willful violations, with a ten-year statute of limitations to preserve accountability across administrations.

Private entities should share responsibility as well. Corporations and executives who knowingly fund projects in violation of the MRA should face civil penalties proportionate to the amount contributed, deterring both improper government requests and improper private attempts to curry favor.

2. Modernize the Financial Oversight Infrastructure

Congress should integrate MRA oversight into the financial-integrity frameworks required under the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act and the Chief Financial Officers Act. Incorporating MRA compliance into these internal-control systems would ensure that agencies treat MRA risks with the same rigor as other financial-integrity obligations and would institutionalize early detection and correction of violations.

3. Create Standardized Limits on Agency Gift Authorities

As GAO recommended in 1980, Congress should establish uniform criteria for the solicitation, acceptance, and use of gift funds. Those criteria should include clear statutory definitions, a consistent ethics-review process, and limits on what agencies may accept and what conditions—if any—donors may impose. Gift authorities should be confined to small, mission-related support, not major capital projects or operational assets such as a presidential aircraft.

4. Impose Dollar Caps on All Gifts and Donations

Congress should impose annual dollar limits on gifts an agency may accept—both from any single donor and in the aggregate for the agency—to ensure that gifts remain supplementary and mission-related rather than a parallel funding stream for major projects. Large gifts should also trigger an inspector general review and a written report to Congress, preventing agencies from using gift authority to finance major initiatives outside the appropriations process.

5. Require Comprehensive Notice and Disclosure

Congress should mandate a comprehensive transparency regime for significant gifts, donations, and third-party settlements. For any transfer over a specified dollar threshold, agencies should be required to provide at least 45 days’ advance written notice to the appropriations and authorizing committees and to GAO. Each notice should include the source and value of the contribution, any conditions the donor attached, the ethics review, and the legal analysis supporting the agency’s claimed statutory authority. Agencies should also report basic information on each donation to GAO on a quarterly basis, creating a continuous audit trail.

6. Impose Additional Safeguards Against Influencing the White House

Agency gifts directed to the President or Vice President raise special concerns and warrant heightened standards and review. Reflecting this concern, the recently introduced Stop Ballroom Bribery Act would apply additional limitations in the context of the National Park Service’s gift authorities, which the administration likely relied on for donations to the White House ballroom. Congress should adopt a complementary, government-wide rule—applicable across all statutory gift authorities—requiring heightened ethics review for any gift intended for presidential or vice-presidential use or whose primary function is to support their facilities, activities, or operations.

7. Codify and Clarify Limits on Third-Party Payments

Executive agreements and settlements that direct a counterparty to pay a third party can allow the executive branch to influence the use of funds outside the appropriations process, creating risks under the MRA. GAO and the Justice Department have recognized these risks, and DOJ adopted safeguards under the Biden Administration to prevent third-party payments from drifting beyond legitimate statutory purposes.

Congress should codify those principles. First, it should make explicit that funds effectively controlled by the United States may fall under the MRA even if the government never touches the money. Second, Congress should bar agencies from retaining any control or direction over unappropriated funds once an agreement is executed. Third, Congress should establish uniform guardrails modeled on the Biden administration’s safeguards. For example, any payment must have a direct nexus to the statutory authority or violation at issue, and the government may not direct payments to specific recipients.

These requirements should apply across all agencies with enforcement, regulatory, or negotiation authority, not just DOJ. They would preserve legitimate uses of third-party payments—such as victim compensation or remedies tied to statutory violations—while preventing agencies from using such arrangements to finance priorities Congress has not approved. To ensure oversight, any agreement requiring payment to a non-victim third party should be reported to GAO on a quarterly basis.

The Path Ahead

The MRA is meant to ensure that the power of the purse remains in Congress’s hands. Yet, shadow appropriations are emerging in real time and risk becoming normalized. The question before Congress is whether public spending will remain governed by law or drift toward presidential discretion. The power of the purse will endure only if Congress insists on exercising it.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2223443087.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 10:58:03.202348

They won at the trial level, but the Supreme Court stayed that ruling on grounds that the case may have been brought in the wrong federal court.","On Nov. 14 the faculty and staff of the University of California won a significant victory over President Trump in his effort to fine UCLA $1.2 billion for resisting his efforts to bend the university to his ideological demands.

Finding that the plaintiffs submitted “overwhelming evidence” that Trump and his cabinet members pursued a campaign of cutting off government funding with the goal of “bringing universities to their knees and forcing them to change their ideological tune,” federal Judge Rita Lin of San Francisco blocked the fine and nearly $600 million in funding cuts. She ordered the money to start flowing again.

Lin’s ruling resembles those by other federal judges who blocked Trump’s funding cutoffs. Faculty and staff representatives, with the American Assn. of University Professors as the lead plaintiff, justly celebrated the UC injunction, even though it’s likely that the government will appeal.

But two entities with an interest in the case’s outcome have been silent: the state of California and UC itself. Neither joined the AAUP lawsuit, which was filed in September, and neither has commented since.

It’s not as though the state and the university are blind to the potential impact of Trump’s funding cutoff. When Trump’s demands and threats were made public in August, Gov. Newsom termed them “extortion” and threatened to sue. UC President James B. Milliken said the announced cuts would be a “death knell for innovative work that saves lives, grows our economy and fortifies our national security.”

Addressing the UC Board of Regents at its meeting Wednesday, Milliken stated that the university system still faces the loss of more than $1 billion in federal research funding, but didn’t mention the AAUP lawsuit.

UC reportedly has continued negotiations with the White House. A UC spokesperson wouldn’t comment on any such talks, even to confirm them. A spokesman for Gov. Newsom said he’s closely watching the numerous court cases challenging Trump’s funding threats, and “he’s pleased with the recent court rulings affirming that Trump’s assault on California’s world-class research institutions was reckless and illegal.”

Let’s keep in mind what’s at stake in this battle. The University of California is the premier public university system in the nation. It’s the second-largest employer in the state and one of the most important providers of healthcare. The productivity of its research is spectacular. Much of the universities’ work is supported by the government — $17 billion a year, including matching Medicaid and Medicare funding and student aid.

“We were hopeful that the UC system would defend itself legally,” says Veena Dubal, a law professor at UC Irvine and general counsel to the AAUP. After UCLA published the administration’s 27-page list of demands in August, she says, the AAUP decided it couldn’t wait any longer: “We couldn’t not sue, they were so outrageous.”

The demands included bans on diversity programs, public demonstrations across much of the campus and provisions for transgender students. UCLA also would be required to refuse admission to foreign students “likely to engage in anti-Western, anti-American, or antisemitic disruptions,” and to comply with Trump’s ban on “gender ideology” — that is, defining males and females as anything other than the sex they were assigned at birth.

The state and the UC system haven’t entirely avoided legal jousting with Trump. California led seven other states into federal court to challenge the Dept. of Education’s termination of $65 million in grants funding programs that included diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. They won at the trial level, but the Supreme Court stayed that ruling on grounds that the case may have been brought in the wrong federal court.

The regents also joined a lawsuit brought by the Assn. of American Universities and 13 other universities challenging the Dept. of Health and Human Services limit on reimbursements for overhead costs on government-funded research, which would cost universities billions of dollars. They won at the trial level, but the government appealed that ruling. The state also sued Trump or participated in lawsuits on other topics.

One can understand, even sympathize with, the reluctance of UC to pursue a courtroom fight over Trump’s demands. UC faces the same quandary as other institutions that have tried to reach accords with the administration.

Trump has almost unlimited tools at his discretion to harass his adversaries for years to come through endless “investigations” of purported statutory violations, among other things. Courtroom battles take time and money, resources that may never be recovered. Plus with a pro-Trump majority on the Supreme Court, ultimate victory is nothing like a certainty.

And while Trump’s term won’t last beyond January 2029, at which point his anti-university campaign might end, that may be cold comfort for institutions facing an immediate financial crisis.

“It may be hard for an educational institution to ride this out until 2029,” says Dan Schnur, a veteran political consultant on the faculty of UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies. “For an institution that budgets on an annual basis, three years is a long time, and for a student, it’s three-fourths of an undergraduate experience.”

That brings us to the case the UC faculty and staff made in court. It’s as clear and concise a description of the noxious campaign Trump has conducted against American higher education that one will find anywhere. It was accepted almost in its entirety by Judge Lin.

The administration consistently has portrayed the funding cutoffs as a response to what it claims to be pervasive antisemitism at UCLA and other targeted campuses. Yet as federal Judge Allison D. Burroughs of Boston found in September when she blocked Trump’s grant terminations against Harvard, it’s “difficult to conclude anything other than that [the government] used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities.”

Indeed, the UC plaintiffs show that the funding cutoffs were motivated purely by ideology, and flagrantly infringed on free speech rights. Just a week after Trump’s inauguration, the White House issued an order suspending all financial disbursements that involved “DEI, woke gender ideology, and the green new deal.” (“DEI” refers to programs aimed at diversity, equity and inclusion, a favored target of the right.)

The faculty lawsuit quotes Leo Terrell, an assistant attorney general for civil rights and a named defendant, telling Fox News, “The academic system in this country has been hijacked by the left, has been hijacked by the Marxists.” He said, “We’re gonna bankrupt these universities. We’re gonna take away every single dollar.” In an interview he said he had “targeted 10 schools. Columbia, Harvard, Michigan, UCLA, USC... We’re going to take away [their] funding.”

The lawsuit positions the administration’s campaign against UCLA against its similar attacks on funding at Columbia, Brown and Harvard. It also points to the folly of trying to settle with Trump out of court.

Columbia was among the first universities to settle with Trump — it agreed in March to a $221-million payment and to give the government extraordinary oversight of its hiring, pedagogical and social policies in order to free up $400 million in blocked funding and restore access to billions of dollars in current and future federal grants.

But the capitulation didn’t yield those results. Instead, Trump blocked a further $1.2 billion in funding until Columbia agreed to additional demands in July.

As Judge Lin described the government campaign against UCLA and other universities launched by the White House, it starts when “one or more ... agencies open civil rights investigations into a university.... Before the investigations are concluded, Funding Agencies cancel large amounts of federal funding.” Then the Justice Department offers to settle with the targets “in exchange for further burdening faculty, staff, and student speech.”

It’s theoretically possible that the Trump administration could make its funding cutoffs stick if it follows the procedures enshrined in law for terminating federal grants (and it may yet prevail in appeals to the Supreme Court).

The rules require government agencies to issue a notice of possible violation and attempt to negotiate a settlement and hold a hearing, then file a report with the House and Senate specifying “the circumstances and grounds for such action” and wait at least 30 days more before canceling any funding. The cancellations can apply only to the specific program deemed to be violating the law.

The goal of these safeguards, Lin observed, is to protect grant recipients from “‘vindictive’ or ‘punitive’” actions by the government. In these cases, the government followed none of the mandated procedures.

The administration‘s defense, in part, is that the funding cutoffs are entirely within its discretion and can’t be reviewed by a judge, assertions Lin specifically rejected. The administration also stated that the August demand letter to UCLA was merely an “opening settlement offer” in ongoing “confidential settlement negotiations” with the university.

Given the findings from federal judges that Trump has flouted the legal safeguards against abrupt and arbitrary grant cancellations in favor of illicit bullying, the question facing universities trying to negotiate their way out is: What is there to negotiate? The record so far indicates that no settlement will fully satisfy Trump or his anti-woke warriors; only judges can bring the campaign to a halt.

It’s certainly true that in the short run, Trump’s targets will suffer great pain. He knows well that they’re vulnerable to blunt force. “With every day that passes,” Lin observed, “UCLA continues to be denied the chance to win new grants, ratcheting up [the government’s] pressure campaign.”

In the long run, however, there are limits to how much an educational institution can concede.

One is tempted to recall what Michael Corleone said in “The Godfather Part II” when he was being bullied by the corrupt Sen. Pat Geary into paying a bribe: “My offer is this,” he said. “Nothing.”

It may not be so easy for even powerful universities to take such an uncompromising stand. But it may be necessary.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f9445cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5467x2870+0+387/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F30%2Fc53ffc51479997d7cffe333b97f7%2F1531023-me-ucla-file-images-01-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:57:20.105562

And on Nov. 13, she sued to overturn the new congressional district maps approved by voters with the passage of Prop. 50. That measure authorized state leaders to redraw congressional districts to favor Democrats, after Trump asked the state of Texas to redraw its maps to favor Republicans. The Texas effort was held up this week when a federal judge ruled that those maps were racially discriminatory.

“We will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law,” Bondi said in a news release late Thursday.

For its part, California has filed numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration, challenging the Republican on numerous issues including its decision to take over the state’s National Guard and deploy troops to Los Angeles amid protests over federal immigration sweeps.

California has offered in-state tuition, loans and other help to immigrant students who graduate from high school in California and meet certain criteria since 2011, when passage of the California Dream Act and other supports were signed into law by then-Gov. Jerry Brown.

Trump accused of calling for execution of Democratic lawmakers

Good morning and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with the news that Donald Trump has been accused of calling for the “execution” of elected Democratic lawmakers following his comments on social media.

The president said the group has engaged in “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH” and that they should be arrested after they posted a video in which they told active service members they should refuse illegal orders.

The video, released on Tuesday, features six Democratic lawmakers who have previously served in the military or in intelligence roles – senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, and representatives Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow.

“Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this constitution,” the lawmakers said in the 90-second video. “And right now, the threats to our constitution aren’t just coming from abroad, but from right here at home. Our laws are clear, you can refuse illegal orders, you can refuse illegal orders, you must refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution.”

That seemed to prompt a furious response from the US president. On Thursday morning, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “It’s called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.”

In another post, he wrote: “This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP??? President DJT.” In a third post, he added: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” He also reposted a statement that said: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!”

In response, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, condemned Trump’s remarks and posted on X: “Let’s be crystal clear: the President of the United States is calling for the execution of elected officials.”

He added: “This is an outright THREAT. Every Senator, every Representative, every American – regardless of party – should condemn this immediately and without qualification.”

Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, defended Trump’s claim that the Democrats had engaged in “sedition”, describing the video as “wildly inappropriate”, adding: “It is very dangerous, you have leading members of Congress telling troops to disobey orders, I think that’s unprecedented in American history.”

Following Trump’s statements on Thursday, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democratic whip Katherine Clark and Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar released a joint statement condemning the remarks.

“Political violence has no place in America,” they wrote. “Representatives Jason Crow, Chris DeLuzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan and Senators Mark Kelly and Elissa Slotkin all served our country with tremendous patriotism and distinction. We unequivocally condemn Donald Trump’s disgusting and dangerous death threats against members of Congress, and call on House Republicans to forcefully do the same.”

In other developments:

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said he will negotiate with Donald Trump on a US-backed peace plan that called on Kyiv to make painful concessions in order to end the Kremlin’s invasion of his country. Zelenskyy’s office on Thursday confirmed that he had received the draft peace plan, which was prepared by US and Russian officials, and that he would speak with Trump in the coming days about “existing diplomatic opportunities and the main points that are necessary for peace”.

The Trump administration on Thursday announced new oil and gas drilling off California’s and Florida’s coasts, setting the stage for a political showdown – including with Sunshine state Republicans who have largely opposed petroleum development in the Gulf of Mexico. This announcement comes as the US petroleum industry, despite contending with low crude prices, has been pushing for an entree to additional offshore drilling areas.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website has been changed to reflect the belief of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health and human services secretary, that there is a link between vaccines and autism, a view flatly contradicted by experts and scientifically validated studies. Public health and autism specialists roundly condemned the alteration to the CDC’s “vaccine safety” webpage, after it was changed to read: “The statement ‘Vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim.”

US district judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former president Joe Biden, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying national guard troops to enforce the law in Washington DC without approval from its mayor. Cobb paused her ruling until 11 December to allow the Trump administration to appeal.

The justice department is investigating how two Trump allies handled the investigation into whether California senator, Adam Schiff, committed mortgage fraud, according to a copy of a subpoena obtained by the Guardian and a person familiar with the matter. The office of the deputy attorney general Todd Blanche is overseeing the inquiry, which appears to have developed as an offshoot of the main case into Schiff – a notable development since the justice department is essentially investigating activities of two close allies of the president.

Trump has assembled least diverse US government this century, study shows

David Smith

Donald Trump has assembled the least diverse US government of the 21st century, filling the corridors of power with white men at the expense of women and people of colour, research shows.

Nine in 10 individuals confirmed by the Senate in the first 300 days of the second Trump administration were white, according to the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington.

The total percentage of women confirmed was just 16%, the lowest rate among the past four administrations, including during Trump’s first term (23%).

“For the Biden administration at the one-year point it was 50% male, 50% female, and right now in the Trump administration it’s 84% male, 16% female,” Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, director of the initiative on improving inter-branch relations and government, told the Guardian in an interview at Brookings on Wednesday.

“Probably that’s the starkest contrast. But even if you go all the way back to George W Bush in 2001, Trump’s confirmed nominees are whiter and less ethnically diverse and more male than his predecessors going back that far.”

Trump claims to have broad appeal, pointing to vocal groups such as Women for Trump and incremental gains among Latino and Black voters in last year’s presidential election. But his actions as president suggest that diversity as a hiring priority has been explicitly abandoned.

He has overwhelmingly favoured white men in his appointments while firing prominent African Americans such as Gen Charles Q Brown Jr, chair of the joint chiefs of staff, and Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress. He issued executive orders to curb diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the federal government and is seeking to purge “divisive, race-centered ideology” from Smithsonian Institution museums.

Schumer calls for extension of Obamacare tax credits as healthcare talks stall on Capitol Hill

As both chambers of Congress prepare to head into Thanksgiving recess, after the government returned to work following a record-breaking shutdown, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, is reminding lawmakers that there’s been little headway on discussions to extend the Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year. Democrats were promised a vote on the extension of these subsidies, after a faction of the caucus voted with Republicans to pass a funding bill that didn’t contain any healthcare provisions – arguably the focal point of their negotiations.

“Americans are now about to fall off a healthcare cliff, and Donald Trump doesn’t even have a concept of a plan to fix it,” Schumer said. “We must extend the ACA premium tax credits NOW to lower healthcare costs for the American people.”

On the Hill, there have been alternative proposals to Obamacare subsidies, with the chair of the Senate health committee, Bill Cassidy, suggesting that the credits could be replaced with pre-paid health savings accounts. Some health policy experts have pushed pack, saying that while these would help with out-of-pocket costs, it wouldn’t help those ACA enrollees who can’t afford insurance premiums to begin with.

The Trump administration on Thursday announced new oil and gas drilling off California’s and Florida’s coasts, setting the stage for a political showdown – including with Sunshine state Republicans who have largely opposed petroleum development in the Gulf of Mexico.

This announcement comes as the US petroleum industry, despite contending with low crude prices, has been pushing for an entree to additional offshore drilling areas. The industry’s move for increased access also marks an effort to increase jobs and US energy independence, according to the Associated Press.

The federal government has prohibited offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, which extends from Florida shores to portions of Alabama, since 1995. The ban stemmed from worries about potential oil spills.

While California does have some offshore oil development, there have not been new leases in federal waters for nearly 30 years, the AP said.

A proposed schedule for petroleum leasing in federal waters includes up to 34 auctions from 2026 to 2031; these auctions include up to six sales off California’s coastline, 21 off of Alaska’s coastline, and two in the Gulf of Mexico’s eastern portion, Politico said. The sales in Alaska would reportedly include a region that has never had oil drilling.

The move reflects Trump’s dogged efforts to roll back former president Joe Biden’s efforts against global heating. Trump has described climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, and launched a National Energy Dominance Council to boost domestic energy production, with an emphasis on fossil fuels, AP noted.

Trump has simultaneously thwarted renewable energy development including offshore windfarms. His administration has also axed billions in green energy grants, the AP said.

California’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, a Trump foe weighing a presidential run, rejected offshore drilling expansion, calling it “dead on arrival”.

Offshore oil development has faced bipartisan opposition in Florida, where unblemished beaches and sparkling waters underpin the state’s $131bn tourism industry.

The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda – president Donald Trump’s birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump’s appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions, AP reports. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration’s broad immigration crackdown.

Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s top security official denied on Friday he had agreed to a Trump administration peace plan, and European leaders hastily sought a response to a draft that endorses most of Russia’s key wartime demands.

Washington has presented Kyiv with a 28-point plan that would require Kyiv to give up additional territory, scale back the size of its military and forever abandon hope of joining the Nato western military alliance.

Ukraine’s European allies said they had not been consulted over the plan and scheduled an urgent phone call to discuss the situation. Britain and Germany said their leaders would take part. Zelenskyy’s office did not say whether he would join in.

US officials said the plan was drafted after consultations with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defense council, a close Zelenskyy ally who served as defence minister until July.

“This plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of president Zelenskyy’s administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to president Zelenskyy,” a senior US official said on Thursday.

But Umerov said on Friday he had not discussed the plan’s terms, much less approved them, according to a Reuters report.

The White House is preparing for possible turnover in the cabinet after president Donald Trump reaches the one-year mark of his term, potentially shaking up his otherwise stable team of secretaries, CNN reported on Friday, citing multiple people familiar with the discussions.

At least one agency that could see a leadership change is the Department of Homeland Security, CNN reported.

The Department of Energy, led by Chris Wright, a former Colorado fracking executive whose ties with the White House have reportedly frayed in recent months, may also be affected, the report added.

Trump to meet New York's Mamdani later today

President Donald Trump will meet with incoming New York mayor Zohran Mamdani on Friday, the first in-person talks between political opposites who have clashed over everything from immigration to economic policy.

A democratic socialist and little-known state lawmaker who won New York’s mayoral race earlier this month, Mamdani requested the sit-down with Trump to discuss cost-of-living issues and public safety, Reuters reports.

The Republican president has threatened to strip federal funding from the biggest US city, while the mayor-elect has regularly criticized a range of Trump’s policies, including plans to ramp up federal immigration enforcement efforts in New York, where four in ten people are foreign-born.

The 79-year-old president, a former New York resident, has labeled Mamdani, 34, as a “radical left lunatic,” a communist and “Jew hater,” without offering evidence for those assertions.

Mamdani, who will be sworn in as mayor on 1 January, said at a press conference on Thursday: “Being a New Yorker means that you’re prepared for all situations.”

Hanne Daguman was arrested Monday at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office downtown after acknowledging she had overstayed her visa. Her husband, Joshua Daguman, said the interview seemed to be going well before three ICE officers entered the room.

""We went to our interview, we got called in, an hour and a half of questions, and it seems like we were doing great,"" Joshua Daguman said. ""When my wife signed on the iPad that she had an overstay, three officers came in with like bulletproof vests, with their badges. She gives me a card, says, 'scan this', We're gonna arrest your wife for an overstay on her visa.""

The couple has been married for over a year. They got married in Mission Bay, an area where they frequently spend time with friends and family. Hanne Daguman originally came to the U.S. on a student visa, then completed her year of temporary employment authorization, but that status had expired, making her what's called a visa overstay.

Hanne Daguman is now being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Her husband expressed particular concern about her medical care, as she is a Type 1 diabetic.

""You need your glucose. They took out her glucose monitoring system, so she doesn't know if she's low or high,"" Joshua Daguman said.

CoreCivic, which operates the detention center, said it cannot comment on specific medical records but stated that it is committed to providing access to high-quality medical and mental health care for those in custody, including those with diabetes. The company said three nutritious meals are provided daily, including meals that support specialized diets.

ICE told ABC 10News Monday that they are committed to enforcing federal immigration laws and said individuals unlawfully present in the U.S., including those out of status in places like USCIS offices, may face arrest, detention, and removal.

What the judge said,Carolyn Komatsoulis,,,,,https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/northwest/idaho/article312985121.html,"In a flurry of nearly identical orders Wednesday, Idaho’s Senior U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ordered the release of 15 immigrants picked up during the Wilder raid.
The immigrants who were in the U.S. had due-process rights, regardless of their citizenship status, according to court filings.
Only two judges among over 100 have sided with the government in federal cases challenging its expansion of mandatory detention, Winmill said in court filings.
Of the 15 whose cases came before Winmill, many had no criminal history, according to the court filings.
For two of the immigrants, Winmill listed past convictions: one for misdemeanor disturbing the peace and one for driving without privileges.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested a mother of three U.S. citizens during the FBI and ICE raid at a Wilder racetrack, according to court filings.

The mother had lived in the U.S. for 21 years and had an active visa petition for permanent residence. A second arrested immigrant came to the U.S. last year and has a work permit and a pending asylum application, with a 2027 hearing on the docket.

They were both detained for a month in the Elmore County Detention Center after the Oct. 19 raid.

Now they’ve been released. In a flurry of nearly identical orders Wednesday, Idaho’s Senior U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill ordered the release of 15 immigrants picked up during the Wilder raid.

In the past, immigrants already in the U.S. whom ICE detained would have been entitled to an immigration court hearing, according to Oregon immigration lawyer Casey Parsons. In the hearing, the government would try to show if they were a flight risk or a danger and whether they should remain locked up. The immigrants who were in the U.S. had due-process rights, regardless of their citizenship status, according to court filings.

But as part of the Trump administration’s hardening attitude towards immigrants, his administration has been pushing for mandatory detention for all immigrants who entered the U.S. without permission, Winmill said in court filings.

Only two judges among over 100 have sided with the government in federal cases challenging its expansion of mandatory detention, Winmill said in court filings. He said the constitutional right of due process applies to everyone within the U.S., not just citizens.

“Dozens of district courts across the nation – with more each day – have rejected DHS’s expansion of … mandatory detention to noncitizens already residing here,” Winmill wrote in the 15 decisions, one for each detainee. DHS stands for the Department of Homeland Security. “This Court joins the overwhelming majority.”

Homeland Security says ‘activist judge’ frees ‘lawbreakers’

Winmill’s ruling drew condemnation from the Trump administration.

“Now, an activist judge is ordering lawbreakers to roam free,” a spokesperson for Homeland Security, which includes ICE, told the Idaho Statesman by email. “This is just yet another example of activist judges attempting to obstruct President Trump from delivering on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of illegal aliens.”

At the raid, hundreds of law enforcement officers disrupted the final horse race of the season, detaining and zip-tying attendees, including some children. Law enforcement arrested four people for alleged illegal gambling, with a fifth arrested the next day. Of those five, four have been released from detention.

ICE arrested 105 immigrants, although some were legally in the U.S. Human rights activists have criticized the raid, saying families were torn apart and the operation sparked fear in the community.

Of the 15 whose cases came before Winmill, many had no criminal history, according to the court filings. For two of the immigrants, Winmill listed past convictions: one for misdemeanor disturbing the peace and one for driving without privileges.

In every one of the 15 orders, Winmill said the government had shown no information that the immigrant was a danger or flight risk. Instead, he suggested ICE was bowing to President Donald Trump’s hardline tactics on immigration enforcement.

“Its only apparent interest in detaining Petitioner — which imposes additional fiscal and administrative burdens — is to fulfill an arrest quota of 3,000 immigration arrests per day set by the current administration,” Winmill wrote in multiple orders.

One of the immigrants picked up by agents at the Wilder FBI and ICE raid had been present in the U.S. for 35 years, according to court filings. He has two U.S. citizen children and a lawful permanent resident mother who suffered from an end-stage renal disease and who relied on her son, Winmill wrote.

His father had previously filed a visa petition for him in 1999 and he could yet become eligible for legal status, the judge wrote. It wasn’t clear from the order what happened, or didn’t, with the 1999 petition.

“This ruling is a major vindication of due process and the constitutional rights of people caught up in enforcement actions that sweep up more than just targeted suspects,” Parsons said in a news release. “The court recognized that detention without lawful justification violates fundamental liberties.”

The Homeland Security spokesperson said the administration would continue to “fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country.”

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration's broad immigration crackdown.
Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling.
The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.
“Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”","WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is to meet in private Friday with a high-profile issue on its agenda — President Donald Trump ’s birthright citizenship order declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens.

The justices could say as soon as Monday whether they will hear Trump’s appeal of lower court rulings that have uniformly struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the United States.

If the court steps in now, the case would be argued in the spring, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed on the first day of his second term in the White House, is part of his administration's broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th century Alien Enemies Act.

The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings, while they allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The justices also are weighing the administration's emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment.

Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. Trump's order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force.

In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions.

While the Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions, it did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class-action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order is constitutional.

But every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or most likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship.

The administration is appealing two cases.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco ruled in July that a group of states that sued over the order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others.

Also in July, a federal judge in New Hampshire blocked the citizenship order in a class-action lawsuit including all children who would be affected.

The American Civil Liberties Union, leading the legal team in the New Hampshire case, urged the court to reject the appeal because the administration's “arguments are so flimsy,"" ACLU lawyer Cody Wofsy said. ""But if the court decides to hear the case, we’re more than ready to take Trump on and win.”

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the 14th Amendment.

The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship.

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in urging the high court’s review. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/2c7437cc-1d90-4eee-942a-cc717d2c92e7/wirestory_83f70d58636219c0ff98c7d765ab2b4d_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-21 09:57:41.451310

Thus there could be challenges under the Human Rights Act – unless the legislation excludes those too – and claims before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
This is not the first time a government has sought to set legislative boundaries around the application of Article 8 in immigration cases.","Revoking the duty to support

The government proposes to replace the current duty to provide support to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute with a discretion to do so. This discretion will be limited in various ways – for example, support will not be available to those who deliberately make themselves destitute, or who “break the law.”

Any discretionary power conferred on a public body must be exercised rationally and in accordance with the law. Thus decisions not to grant support will in principle be subject to judicial review (or possibly some specific form of appeal if the legislation creates one). “The law” here includes (unless the new legislation excludes it) the Human Rights Act 1998, which requires courts and decision makers to give effect to the rights in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). There will thus be scope for legal challenges if claimants are denied support in circumstances which breach their Convention rights – for instance, where the effect is that they suffer hardship so extreme as to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment within Article 3 of the ECHR.

Article 3 is an absolute right – that is, it is not subject to balancing with other factors. So the right not to be tortured, or to suffer inhuman or degrading treatment, is not conditional on compliance with national law or other kinds of “good behaviour”. That aspect of the government’s proposals will therefore potentially be vulnerable to challenge.

Resuming removals to certain countries

The government has decided that refugee status should be temporary, and that individuals should be returned to their country of origin if there has been a regime change. That seems over-simplistic. The ECHR, the UN Refugee Convention and the international law principle of “non-refoulement” prevent a refugee from being removed to a territory where they would face serious harm or persecution.

Removal to a safe territory is permissible. But the mere fact that there has been a regime change in a previously unsafe country plainly does not automatically mean it is now safe. Compliance with the principle of “non-refoulement” will require case-by-case assessment of the situation in any particular country, and of the risks to any particular refugee.

Creating a new appeals body

The details here are thin. The government says the proposed new appeals body will be “independent” and “staffed by professionally trained adjudicators”. But it is not clear whether it will be a judicial body, that is, a court. The government’s document says that in Denmark decisions of the Refugee Appeals Board “are considered final and generally cannot be challenged in ordinary civil or administrative courts”, but does not say explicitly that it intends to replicate that model in the UK.

Decisions of public bodies (including lower tribunals) are generally subject to judicial supervision and review by the High Court. If the UK appeals body is not itself a court but an administrative body (however competently staffed), any attempt to oust judicial review of its decisions entirely will be highly controversial and viewed as undermining the rule of law. It is also likely to breach Article 6 of the ECHR, which confers a right “to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law” for the purposes of determining a person’s civil rights and obligations.

The same applies to the government’s proposal that certain claims which are “clearly without merit [will] move straight to removal without an appeal” if that means some categories of case will receive no judicial supervision at all. Thus there could be challenges under the Human Rights Act – unless the legislation excludes those too – and claims before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

Article 8 of the ECHR

The government is concerned that Article 8 of the ECHR (which provides a right to respect for family and private life) is used too often as a ground to block removals. Article 8 is a qualified right which can be limited on certain public interest grounds. The government proposes to legislate to narrow its scope in three ways:

To strengthen the public interest test which decision makers and courts must apply in determining whether removal would breach Article 8.

To set out a narrower definition of who counts as a family member for the purposes of Article 8, to include “normally” only “immediate family members”.

To limit how and when Article 8 claims can be made.

This is not the first time a government has sought to set legislative boundaries around the application of Article 8 in immigration cases. The Immigration Act 2014 set out public interest factors which must be taken into account in such cases – for example, that “the maintenance of effective immigration controls” and “the deportation of foreign criminals” are in the public interest; as well as factors that should be given “little weight” – for example private life or relationships established at a time when a person is in the UK unlawfully. It is not clear how the proposals in the first bullet above will add to the measures introduced by the 2014 Act.

In any case, the further the government goes in trying to limit Article 8 rights in national law, the more likely it is that the legislation or decisions under it will be challenged under the Human Rights Act. In particular it might be argued that the legislation goes beyond what is permissible under the ECHR, for example that the public policy justification for it does not fall within one the permitted factors set out in Article 8 (namely national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others).

The UK courts will be bound to apply the new legislation and have no power to set aside an Act of Parliament, but under section 4 of the Human Rights Act they could make a declaration that the legislation is incompatible with the ECHR, and claimants whose claims have failed in the domestic courts could take their cases to Strasbourg. The Strasbourg court typically allows states a “margin of appreciation” in determining where the balance between different public interest factors should be struck in giving effect to qualified rights.

That court already takes a fairly narrow approach to some aspects of Article 8, for example the definition of family members, and has upheld provisions of the UK law (pursuant to the 2014 Act mentioned above) stating that the public interest in deporting certain foreign criminals could be overridden only in exceptional cases.

However in that judgment the Strasbourg court observed:

“where the domestic courts do not carefully examine the facts, apply the relevant human rights standards consistently with the Convention and the Court’s case-law, and adequately balance the interests of the applicant against those of the general public, the Court remains empowered to give the final ruling on whether an expulsion measure is reconcilable with Article 8” .

So again the details of the proposed legislation will matter. The greater the restrictions it places on Article 8 rights, or on the ability of domestic courts to weigh the relevant factors, the greater the chance that the Strasbourg court will say it has gone too far.

Article 3 of the ECHR

The government is also concerned that the interpretation of Article 3 of the ECHR, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment, has expanded over time. It correctly notes that Article 3 is an absolute right and so cannot be balanced against other public interest considerations (and see above on the duty to provide support).

It seems therefore that the government does not propose to legislate to try and alter the interpretation of Article 3 in domestic law (which would indeed be very challenging). Instead, it is “working with key partner countries” on the definition of “inhuman or degrading treatment”. Presumably the aim is to agree an amendment to the text of Article 3 or at least some form of interpretative statement.

He argued that entering such agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would provide Kentucky police agencies with new federal resources and dollars.
However, Democrats on the committee voiced apprehension about requiring local agencies to partner with ICE.
“Our law enforcement agencies, I think they know their jurisdictions best.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously announced that law enforcement agencies participating in the 287(g) Program would be eligible for significant reimbursements starting in October.","A Northern Kentucky Republican is working on a bill that would require all Kentucky police agencies to enter federal agreements for immigration enforcement under a program that has rapidly expanded during the Trump administration.

Rep. TJ Roberts, of Burlington, presented the proposal during a Thursday meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Local Government. He argued that entering such agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would provide Kentucky police agencies with new federal resources and dollars.

However, Democrats on the committee voiced apprehension about requiring local agencies to partner with ICE.

“I think this really gets down to being a local control issue for me,” said Rep. Rachel Roarx, D-Louisville. “Our law enforcement agencies, I think they know their jurisdictions best. They know where their resources need to be allocated.”

Roberts later said that his bill would be “a way to ensure greater senses of community policing, of allowing it to be done and administered by the local level.”

Kentucky’s Republican-controlled General Assembly could consider the bill during the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January.

Roberts called the agreements an “incredible opportunity to provide more resources to our law enforcement community, to promote public safety and to align us with the priorities of the federal government.” He added that local police officers would be “deputized for limited immigration enforcement,” such as during traffic stops when they have “reasonable suspicion” to further investigate the driver’s or passengers’ citizenship or immigration status.

Roberts acknowledged that while some Kentucky law enforcement agencies have entered ICE agreements, he believes “we do not have that in the areas that we need it at.”

According to ICE’s website, 22 law enforcement agencies within Kentucky have an active 287(g) program to date. The agencies include mostly county sheriffs’ departments but also some local jails and a local police department. All of the agreements were signed this year.

Roarx questioned what Roberts meant by not having the agreements “in the areas that need it most.” Roberts said his home region of Northern Kentucky, which has major highways, should have such agreements. He added that “it’s needed everywhere in Kentucky” and not just in the counties with current programs.

“Once they complete that 40 hours of training that is all online, that is paid for by the federal government, these officers are deputized by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,” Roberts said. “And they can only engage in this limited enforcement while under the supervision of the federal authorities in order to ensure that there is oversight, that there is accountability.”

If approved, Roberts’ proposal would direct the Kentucky State Police and local law enforcement agencies to have a written agreement with ICE under Section 287(g) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. The program is often referred to as the 287(g) Program.

Under such agreements, ICE can delegate “the authority to perform specified immigration officer functions” to state and law enforcement officers, the federal agency’s website says.

ICE expanded the number of agreements by 641% after Republican President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. However, immigrants and their advocates have argued that these agreements can lead to racial profiling and lack oversight.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) previously announced that law enforcement agencies participating in the 287(g) Program would be eligible for significant reimbursements starting in October. An example of that is that ICE may reimburse an agency for “the annual salary and benefits of each eligible trained 287(g) officer, including overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer’s annual salary.”

Roberts argued the agreements would bring in significant dollars to Kentucky law enforcement agencies. He added that he had been working with legislative liaisons for DHS and ICE on the legislation and it was “one of their top priorities.”

Committee co-chair Rep. Patrick Flannery, R-Olive Hill, emphasized that he viewed the agreements as “an opportunity to potentially utilize resources from the federal government to implement those into our local communities that we serve.”

Democratic lawmakers took issue with the proposal. Rep. Sarah Stalker, of Louisville, said she had “a lot of concern” about deputizing officers for a new jurisdiction, particularly when news reports across the country have highlighted what many see as cruelty and abuse during arrests and mass raids.

“I feel like this would simply exacerbate an issue that is already on its own out of control,” Stalker said.

Before the meeting, advocacy group Kentucky Citizens for Democracy expressed concerns about Roberts’ proposal and encouraged lawmakers to reject the legislation.

“This proposal, which strips local governments of the ability to decide their own level of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, is fundamentally unacceptable,” the group said in a statement. “Our cities and counties know their communities best. Forcing them into mandatory cooperation with ICE, given its long history of egregious and cruel actions, violence, and overly aggressive tactics, will deepen fear, break trust, and push our immigrant neighbors further into the shadows.”

The man had apparently dropped off a child at Hoover Elementary School or a nearby preschool or childcare campus when he was spooked by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to Councilmember Carroll Fife.

The man drove off with agents in pursuit and soon allegedly crashed into a car parked near the intersection of 31st and West streets, just a few blocks away, Oakland police confirmed Thursday.

""So this high-speed chase in a residential neighborhood led to this grandfather, um, who was just deeply afraid, hitting a parked car, which totaled the car of a young mother, a pregnant young mother who now does not have access to a car,"" Fife said in a social media post.

""This type of activity could have led to not only a detention of a person who was just dropping a child off at school but also it could have led to serious injury or death,"" Fife said.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that ICE agents weren't targeting Hoover Elementary and didn't go on school grounds, but were in the area looking for a specific person with ""multiple arrests"" in California and Nevada.

The man agents were chasing fled on foot following the crash and remains at large, according to DHS officials.

Fife said several people who live in the area came out to help the man and the ICE agents eventually left the area.

""They didn't stay to address the harm that they caused in this neighborhood, they didn't take accountability,"" Fife said.

Both Fife and an OPD spokesperson said ICE didn't inform local police about their activities Wednesday.

""This is what happens when federal agencies operate with no oversight and no guardrails, no accountability,"" Fife said.

Administrators at Hoover Elementary and the nearby Harriet Tubman Preschool initiated their ""secure school protocol"" sometime between 9 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. following reports that ICE agents were in the area.

He was detained by ICE for 73 days, and now shares his experience.

Soliman has been in the U.S. since 2014 fleeing persecution from the Egyptian government, where Ayman was detained and tortured for his work as a journalist. In 2018 he was granted asylum in the U.S.

However, his asylum was revoked in June and he was asked to meet with ICE officials on July 9. At the check-in, Ayman was detained by ICE and sent to Butler County Jail in Hamilton, Ohio.

Although the Trump administration contends that ICE is focused on detaining and deporting hardened criminals, Ayman disagrees.

ICE releases Ohio hospital chaplain. Case for detention unclear

“I don’t think these are the worst of the worst. This is just a statement that they made to convince the American public that these people deserve to be deported and to cover their racist reasons behind the deportation.”

With increased ICE raids, many U.S. citizens also have been swept up and detained. You’ll hear from Washington, D.C., Bureau reporter Ariana Figueroa, who has reported about this development.

Prosecutors said Border Patrol agent Charles Exum shot Martinez in self-defense after she and Santos Ruiz allegedly rammed their cars into a federal vehicle on Oct. 4.
“After striking the agents’ vehicle, the defendants’ vehicles boxed in the agents’ vehicle, the complaint states,” prosecutors said in a statement when charges were announced last month.
Martinez’s case was a high-profile example cited by DHS that had led to federal charges.
At the time, the agency said Border Patrol officers had been “ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles.” A court hearing is set for Thursday afternoon.","Federal prosecutors moved Thursday to dismiss charges against Marimar Martinez, a woman who was shot by a Border Patrol agent multiple times after allegedly using her car to assault and impede federal law enforcement six weeks ago in Chicago.

Martinez and co-defendant Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz pleaded not guilty last month to Justice Department charges that they used “their vehicles to assault, impede, and interfere with the work of federal agents in Chicago.”

Andrew S. Boutros, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, filed court documents Thursday morning to dismiss the charges.

Prosecutors said Border Patrol agent Charles Exum shot Martinez in self-defense after she and Santos Ruiz allegedly rammed their cars into a federal vehicle on Oct. 4.

“After striking the agents’ vehicle, the defendants’ vehicles boxed in the agents’ vehicle, the complaint states,” prosecutors said in a statement when charges were announced last month. “The agent was unable to move his vehicle and exited the car, at which point he fired approximately five shots from his service weapon at Martinez, the complaint states.”

Martinez’s legal team had argued that it was federal agents who rammed her car with their vehicle and that the shooting was unjustified and an excessive use of force.

The motion to dismiss comes after it was revealed last week at a court hearing that the Customs and Border Protection agent who shot Martinez multiple times had bragged about it in messages to other officers.

According to Reuters, records presented at the hearing showed that in a group Signal chat with other agents, Exum wrote: “I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys.”

In a message to another recipient, Exum sent a news article about the event followed by the message: “Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Reuters reported.

Christopher Parente, an attorney for Martinez, asked the agent what he meant by those messages. According to records presented earlier this month at a hearing against her, Exum responded: “I’m a firearms instructor and I take pride in my shooting skills.”

The Department of Homeland Security referred questions about charges in the case Thursday to the Justice Department.

The agency also shared a statement with its description of the alleged incident involving Martinez and Santos Ruiz, saying, “Border Patrol law enforcement officers were ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles.”

The statement said Martinez “was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and has a history of doxing federal agents.”

The complaint against Martinez did not mention or include charges related to a firearm.

Parente has said in court and to Reuters that Martinez is a licensed gun owner with a permit for concealed carry in Illinois and that her firearm remained stored in her purse throughout the incident.

“This gun was never in her hand,” Parente said.

Parente and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the motion to dismiss.

DHS said this week that incidents in which civilians have allegedly used their cars to strike federal agents or their vehicles have greatly increased.

Martinez’s case was a high-profile example cited by DHS that had led to federal charges. At the time, the agency said Border Patrol officers had been “ambushed by domestic terrorists that rammed federal agents with their vehicles.”

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.
The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as “federal public benefits” within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.
NYU Tax Law Center Policy Director Brandon DeBot said in a statement that the Treasury’s reinterpretation of the law in order to craft a new rule for the tax credits “overrides such clear provisions of the tax code.” “Denying tax credits to immigrant families requires Congress to act explicitly,” DeBot said.
Targeting them in this roundabout way, that’s not a policy change that would’ve had majority support in Congress,” he said.","WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday it plans to reclassify certain refundable tax credits as “federal public benefits,"" which will bar some immigrant taxpayers from receiving them, even if they file and pay taxes and would otherwise qualify.

Tax experts say immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are most likely to be affected by the planned change. Foreign workers and student visa holders as well as some families with children who are U.S. citizens could also be affected, depending on how the rule is written, they say.

The Treasury Department’s announcement was the latest sign of how the Trump administration has been taking a “ whole of government ” approach when it comes to immigration enforcement and looking to departments across the federal government — not just Homeland Security — to come up with ways to help carry out the president’s hardline immigration agenda.

The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver’s Match Credit.

The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as “federal public benefits” within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. As a result, many immigrants with U.S. work authorization would no longer be able to receive these benefits.

According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are often not eligible for the same tax benefits as U.S. citizens, even though this group of people paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022.

For instance, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare health insurance, even though they contribute billions of dollars to the federal payroll taxes that fund these benefits.

Critics slammed the change as a way to target immigrants as part of Trump's broader policies.

“It’s a terrible and unfair idea to deny tax credits to people who have paid taxes and are eligible for them because of their immigration status,” said Daniel Costa, director of Immigration Law and Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute.

“Implementing this will require determining who has status and who doesn’t, which is another way that the Trump administration will expand its deportation dragnet.”

The final regulation is expected to apply beginning in tax year 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release that “we are enforcing the law and preventing illegal aliens from claiming tax benefits intended for American citizens.” Treasury sought a Justice Department reinterpretation of the law in order to craft the new rule, the agency said.

Carl Davis, research director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said since people without work authorization already don’t qualify for these refundable tax credits, “the folks who are really going to be impacted are people who are really trying to do the right thing, the people authorized to work and paying their taxes.”

He said he believed the administration was trying to make the lives of taxpaying immigrants more difficult.

NYU Tax Law Center Policy Director Brandon DeBot said in a statement that the Treasury’s reinterpretation of the law in order to craft a new rule for the tax credits “overrides such clear provisions of the tax code.”

“Denying tax credits to immigrant families requires Congress to act explicitly,” DeBot said.

Davis said there probably wouldn't be majority support for the move in Congress, which he said probably prompted the administration to act unilaterally on the issue instead.

“The American people are broadly sympathetic to the Dreamers and DACA recipients. Targeting them in this roundabout way, that’s not a policy change that would’ve had majority support in Congress,” he said.

North Carolina man sentenced after threatening to kill ICE agents

A North Carolina man threatened to kill Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and Charlotte officers if immigration enforcement actions did not stop.Johnathan Trent Thomas, 27, of Linwood, pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to making threats to murder federal officers to impede, intimidate, or interfere with the performance of their official duties, according to Russ Ferguson, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina.According to filed court documents and court proceedings, on May 14, a caller, later identified as Thomas, contacted the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) and threatened to kill ICE and officers.During a second telephone call with a CMPD officer, Thomas warned that he was coming to Charlotte with armor-piercing ammunition, night-vision devices, and body armor to kill law enforcement officers and threatened to “shoot them all” if he observed anyone making arrests. Thomas was referencing arrests made previously by ICE federal agents on Albemarle Road in Charlotte.Court documents show that Thomas stated that if a police officer pointed a gun at him, he was just going to open fire. He also said that he would “Swiss cheese” the officers if they were doing the same thing they did before, meaning making arrests. Thomas made additional threats to law enforcement, including that he had Tannerite (an explosive) all around his house if the police came, and referenced April 29, 2024, which is the date that four law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty in Charlotte, warning that he “could do a whole lot better than that.”Law enforcement executed a search warrant at Thomas’s residence, seizing three rifles, a handgun, and a variety of ammunition.According to court records, Thomas has an extensive history of threatening law enforcement, to include the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office and CMPD, and had previously followed CMPD officers in marked patrol cars while they were performing their official duties.Thomas pleaded guilty to one count of threatening to murder federal law enforcement officers, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Thomas remains in federal custody.A sentencing date has not been set.

Why it matters: Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said Thursday morning that federal officials told him ""Operation Charlotte's Web"" was over. But just hours later, U.S. Customs and Border Protection sent a contradictory message — prompting citywide confusion and uncertainty.

""The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon,"" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

A sheriff's office spokesperson told Axios they're standing by the statement because that's what they were told.

ABC News reported earlier this week that agents were supposed to move out on Friday, citing ""preliminary information from federal authorities.""

ICE, a separate agency from CBP, can also continue to have a presence and take people into custody in Charlotte, as it's been doing amid Trump's heightened arrest quota.

Catch up quick: In its latest update, DHS reported around 370 arrests in five days, though it's only released a sample of names.

CBP agents were also spotted this week in Raleigh and Durham.

A family in Franklin Park spent the afternoon fixing the front door which federal agents knocked down Thursday morning while executing an arrest warrant for a man in his 60s. The family says that man and his wife were both taken into DHS custody for allegedly living in the country illegally.

The granddaughter of those two people was in the house as federal agents rushed in.

""It was very scary because even with the speaker they kept repeating his name that they had a warrant for his arrest it was really terrifying,"" she said.

The woman says she was raised by her grandparents and often helped them with their jobs in the area.

The family says the man who was detained had already been deported about six years ago and then returned to the country, but his wife has been in the country for decades and allegedly has a workers permit in the U.S. They say they understand the realities of this immigration process, but are now figuring out how to move forward.

""It's gonna be hard because now we need to take care of them and his job and the house and everything so it's gonna be hard,"" said Jesus Cano, whose brother-in-law was detained.

Carla Espinoza and Samuel Cole were longtime immigration judges in Chicago. After President Donald Trump took office, Espinoza says she was fired without cause.

""I would say it takes about six months to a year to feel comfortable being a judge and adjudicating cases fairly and efficiently,"" she said.

Espinoza is now an immigration attorney. Cole is now Chief Immigration Litigation Counsel at ACLU of Illinois after choosing to retire early, fearing his ability to rule impartially was under attack.

""I saw at the beginning of this new administration that I would no longer be able to make independent decisions,"" Cole said.

Now that question of impartiality and due process has resurfaced again in their replacements. The Department of Defense just issued a legal opinion allowing any military attorney to become an immigration judge.

""Before this administration, you needed seven years of experience in immigration law or administrative law. We certainly respect their service to the nation, but they're not qualified to do these jobs,"" said Matthew Biggs, President of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, the union that represents immigration judges.

He said these temporary replacements now filling dozens of vacancies made by Trump administration firings may have no immigration law experience and only one or two weeks of training before they take the bench to rule on cases.

Espinoza is concerned immigrants before the court will be stripped of due process.

""To have one week or two weeks of training without prior knowledge in immigration law, to me, just seems absurd,"" she said.

Cole is echoing that fear. Both said they have seen the current administration pressure judges to rule in the government's favor.

And with temporary active military judges, Cole believes they could face retribution if they rule impartially.

In other words, although the new law reinforces the narrative that irregular migration constitutes a direct threat to national security, the evidence points to the contrary.
Therefore, the question is not whether Ecuador should reform its migration policy, but how to do so.
A similar approach would allow Ecuador to transform its current situation into an opportunity: moving from a reactive, control-focused policy to a strategy that combines security, integration, and sustainable development.
This dispersion has made it difficult to translate evidence into concrete decisions and align migration policy with national security and development priorities.","The President of Ecuador, Daniel Noboa, recently signed into law a reform of the Organic Law on Human Mobility (LOMH) that imposes stricter immigration controls and seeks to speed deportations. This measure represents a first step in responding to the country’s rising violence and restoring social cohesion. However, it should not be the end of the discussion on how to guarantee security and strengthen Ecuador's social fabric.

While the reform seeks to strengthen national security, it appears to have misidentified the causes of the violence affecting Ecuador. By focusing its attention on the immigrant population as one of the main sources of insecurity, the government may be diverting institutional resources and fueling a narrative that does not solve the country’s underlying problem.

Ecuador is experiencing a deep and sustained security crisis. The homicide rate rose from 13.7 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2021 to almost 43 per 100,000 in 2023, a sharp increase that has transformed daily life, altered communities' relationship with public spaces, and generated an urgent demand for state responses.

During the same period, the Venezuelan population in the country increased from 72,000 in 2018 to more than 440,000 today—now representing close to 2.5 percent of the national population.

It is not surprising that some have linked the two phenomena. But the fact that two events occur simultaneously does not imply that one causes the other. This distinction between correlation and causation is essential to ensure the promotion and implementation of effective public policies. The available evidence shows that violence in Ecuador is a response to the expansion of illicit economies, territorial disputes between criminal groups, and institutional fragmentation—not the arrival of migrants.

A recent study by economist Dany Bahar at the Center for Global Development (CGD) shows that in 2024, just 1.3 percent of all arrests in Ecuador were of Venezuelan nationals, about half their share of the total population. Between 2019 and 2025, the proportion of arrests among the Venezuelan population remained stable—between 1 percent and 1.5 percent—even as Ecuador’s violence and homicide rates tripled. Furthermore, when a Venezuelan migrant is apprehended, formal detention occurs in just 10 to 15 percent of cases, compared to 35 to 40 percent in the case of Ecuadorian nationals. These data show that linking migration with crime is not supported by reality.

More than 40 percent of court cases involving Venezuelans relate to property crimes, generally linked to subsistence economies and vulnerability resulting from irregular migration. Involvement of Venezuelan migrants in homicides, kidnappings, or organized crime is minimal and shows no upward trend. In other words, although the new law reinforces the narrative that irregular migration constitutes a direct threat to national security, the evidence points to the contrary.

The new provisions—which seek to accelerate deportations, require criminal background checks, and tighten residency requirements—could divert institutional capacities and resources that the state needs to address the real causes of violence.

Focusing the debate on immigration controls may exacerbate the exclusion of a population that already lives in precarious conditions, without full access to education, formal employment, or health services. This marginalization not only violates rights but also weakens social cohesion and deprives the country of the talent and productivity of thousands of newcomers.

This is where the Noboa administration has an opportunity: not to declare the task complete after the enactment of the LOMH, but to promote an integration agenda that contributes to the security and development of the country.

The Need for a Phase Two

For security measures to be sustainable over time, Ecuador will need to move toward a second phase of its migration policy, one focused on integration. This means recognizing that a large part of the migrant population will remain in the country and that their social and economic inclusion is essential for national stability. A key element of this second-stage agenda would be the implementation of a regularization program that allows for the full integration of Venezuelan immigrants—benefiting not only those who migrate, but Ecuadorian society overall.

To be clear, regularization does not eliminate crime. No policy does that on its own. But it reduces the social base on which organized crime thrives, and that is precisely an effective security measure. Therefore, the question is not whether Ecuador should reform its migration policy, but how to do so. Now that the LOMH reform has been approved, the implementation stage comes next. Implementation based on the mistaken premise that migration is a threat would end up acting on a correlation that does not reflect reality.

Externally, the reform of the Organic Law on Human Mobility reveals a paradox: while Ecuador seeks to strengthen its defense and intelligence cooperation with the United States, its migration narrative aligned with Washington's rhetoric of control is not in sync with the underlying interests that guide its hemispheric policy. Ecuador is providing fewer resources to support regularization, integration, and voluntary return. In practice, this leaves the country with limited tools to manage the downstream effects of U.S. policies, especially if the large-scale deportations pledged by the Trump administration materialize.

By narrowing its focus to control and enforcement, Ecuador adopts the language of Washington without becoming the strategic partner the United States actually needs. For the U.S. government, reliable allies in the region are those capable of receiving deportees and returnees, advancing regularization and integration efforts, and offering alternatives to irregular movement. Without investments in these capacities, Ecuador risks heightened pressure on already strained systems, rising anxiety in skeptical communities, and the potential for social tension—particularly in a context where security concerns already dominate the national debate. A more balanced approach to migration governance could not only help Ecuador mitigate these risks but also open doors to support from the United States and international donors for sustainable reintegration and even broader priorities such as security and conflict stabilization.

Furthermore, human mobility in Ecuador is not limited to entry. In recent years, more than half a million Ecuadorians have left the country, many following irregular routes northward, often in mixed households with Venezuelans or other nationalities. Rising deportations from the United States and Mexico could generate new waves of return and mixed transit that the country will need to manage urgently. An integration and reintegration agenda in Ecuador would not only be more consistent with Washington's interests but would respond to the country’s own migration governance needs.

Regional evidence shows that this approach can translate into greater security, stability, and development. In Colombia, between 2018 and 2022, large-scale regularization programs attracted international cooperation—mainly from the United States—and contributed to modernizing health, education, and rural productivity systems, strengthening sectors such as coffee production and horticulture. In Chile and Peru, labor integration policies and temporary permits for Venezuelan migrants helped reduce informality and social tension. A similar approach would allow Ecuador to transform its current situation into an opportunity: moving from a reactive, control-focused policy to a strategy that combines security, integration, and sustainable development.

For this reason, the human mobility agenda must become a catalyst for the National Development Plan, and its focus on productive transformation, territorial development, and the strengthening of social protection systems. A policy that combines integration, diaspora engagement, the retention and development of talent, and labor mobility can translate into a real productive boost. Integration—through regularization, a focus on reducing employment informality, and improved access to services—broadens the tax base, strengthens health and education systems, and stimulates investment and consumption. At the same time, links with the diaspora and the attraction of foreign talent expand capabilities and innovation, while remittances and labor mobility generate new flows of income and cooperation. Remittances alone now account for more than 6 percent of Ecuador’s GDP—more than traditional sectors such as bananas or cocoa—and their potential can be expanded if the country manages to connect this agenda with its vision of productive and territorial development.

Transforming the Migration Management Architecture

The current institutional architecture for migration management in Ecuador remains fragmented. Responsibilities are distributed among different ministries and levels of government without a clear coordination mechanism or common public messaging. This dispersion has made it difficult to translate evidence into concrete decisions and align migration policy with national security and development priorities.

Therefore, Ecuador should consider institutional adjustments that strengthen coordination at a strategic level—close to the presidency—to articulate efforts, unify discourse, and improve communication with the public, civil society, and the private sector. This is not a matter of taking away powers from existing institutions, but rather of organizing and strengthening their work under a single vision.

What comes next will be crucial. This second phase—which should go beyond the regulation and implementation of the new law and seek to move toward long-needed integration solutions—will determine whether Ecuador succeeds in turning a reactive reform into a modern and sustainable migration policy.

If anchored in evidence, dialogue, and a long-term vision, the new law can be a starting point for a model that sees migration not as a threat but as an opportunity. Its success will depend on political leadership, messaging clarity, and the support of the private sector and civil society, which can be key allies in achieving labor market integration and social cohesion.

A mobility policy that recognizes the economic and social contributions of those who migrate—as well as those who return—and the potential of the diaspora and the foreign talent that Ecuador can attract, can strengthen the social fabric, boost the economy, and contribute to the country's stability.

Martinez's attorney said federal prosecutors did the right thing by dropping the charges.
Parente said prosecutors' agreement to drop charges against Martinez is only the first step in getting her justice.
Meantime, federal prosecutors on Thursday also dismissed charges against 70-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran Dana Briggs, who was arrested in September during protests in Broadview.
He was accused of making contact with a federal agent while handing his cell phone to another protester as he was taken into custody for ignoring orders to clear the street.","Federal prosecutors on Thursday dropped charges against a woman who was shot by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent in Chicago's Brighton Park neighborhood last month.

At a brief hearing at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse, U.S. District Judge Georgia Alexakis dismissed the indictment against 30-year-old Marimar Martinez and her co-defendant, 21-year-old Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, granting federal prosecutors' motion to drop the case. The charges were dismissed with prejudice, meaning prosecutors cannot refile them in the future.

In a statement on the decision to dismiss the charges, U.S. Attorney's office spokesman Joseph Fitzpatrick said in a statement that federal prosecutors are ""constantly evaluating new facts and information relating to cases and investigations arising out of Operation Midway Blitz, the largest ever law enforcement surge in the Northern District of Illinois.""

""This continuous review process applies to all matters—whether charged or under investigation. It helps ensure that the interests of justice are served in each and every case, and that those cases that are charged are appropriately adjudicated through our federal court system,"" he added.

Federal prosecutors have said the pair were part of a group of vehicles that ""boxed in"" federal immigration agents near Kedzie Avenue and Pershing Road on Oct. 4, before Martinez and Ruiz allegedly rammed one agent's vehicle. The Justice Department has said agents got out and fired five shots at Martinez, who was still inside her car at the time.

Martinez's attorney said federal prosecutors did the right thing by dropping the charges.

""These agents were lying about what happened. Ms. Martinez never rammed anybody. These agents hit Ms. Martinez. These agents jumped out and shot Ms. Martinez, a U.S. citizen, whose only crime was warning her fellow community members that ICE was in the neighborhood,"" attorney Christopher Parente said. ""That is not a crime. She didn't deserve to be shot.""

Martinez thanked the judge, her attorneys, her family, and others for their support as she fought the charges against her.

""I'm just happy. I'm excited,"" she said.

Parente said prosecutors' agreement to drop charges against Martinez is only the first step in getting her justice. While he did not say what the next step would be, he said Martinez' vehicle is now part of an investigation with a separate U.S. Attorney's office – not involving Martinez herself – and he said he's confident the agent who shot her will ultimately be held responsible for wrongly shooting her.

""He's going to pay for those shots. They were not good shots. You will see, eventually, that that was a bad shoot. It was a violation of CBP's use of force policy, and he is going to pay for those shots, and he is not going to be as proud and as arrogant as he was when he testified in this courthouse a few weeks ago,"" Parente said.

In a court filing, her attorneys pointed to body camera video they said shows the agent turned his wheel and caused the crash before he jumped out of the car and started shooting.

That video has not been made public.

Parente also has rgued that crucial evidence was tampered with when federal authorities allowed the agent to drive his car back to Maine after the shooting, rather than holding it as evidence.

Meantime, federal prosecutors on Thursday also dismissed charges against 70-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran Dana Briggs, who was arrested in September during protests in Broadview.

A recent poll by conservative news outlet Carolina Journal found that Trump’s approval rating is falling in North Carolina.","Sen. Thom Tillis called for oversight of the use of the U.S. Border Patrol in Charlotte during a Senate hearing Thursday.

Border Patrol agents began appearing throughout Charlotte Saturday near places like grocery stores, schools and churches, rounding up Hispanic residents, often forcefully, and with little information about what happens next to the people detained.

The agents have since expanded throughout North Carolina, to other cities including Raleigh, Winston-Salem and Hickory.

“I want to make sure that Homeland Security can provide me with the definitive list of people who were detained, how long they were detained, whether or not they were released and, when property was damaged, whether or not they’ve been provided proper restitution,” Tillis said, in the hearing. “We’re the party of law and order, and I want to make sure that we’re also orderly in the process of enforcing it.”

Tillis’ staff said his office has formally asked for this information from the Department of Homeland Security.

Many of Tillis’ Republican colleagues have celebrated the Border Patrol’s presence in North Carolina as part of what it calls Operation Charlotte’s Web.

“I’m very proud of what these men and women are doing to keep our border secure and remove dangerous folks from our community and other communities around the country,” said Rep. Tim Moore, a Republican from Kings Mountain, in an interview on Queen City News.

Rep. Pat Harrigan, a Republican from Hickory, also lent his support to the Border Patrol in several interviews throughout the week.

“What I think that people do not realize is that sanctuary cities are not protecting immigrants,” Harrigan said in an interview with Real America’s Voice. “They are protecting criminals. That is a key distinction that we’ve got to understand, because when you partner these sanctuary cities with ultra-liberal policies that allow judges and magistrates to simply release people back out to the community, when they do not force consequences for criminal conduct, you end up having mayhem and chaos in your city, and we’ve got to get back over the hurdle and make Charlotte safe again.”

Last year, Charlotte had about 12 homicides per 100,000 people, compared to Washington’s 27.3 per 100,000 people, The Charlotte Observer previously reported.

But Charlotte drew national attention in September after video was publicly released of the August stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, by a man with 14 previous arrests, who was out of jail on bail on a charge of misusing the 911 system. He was native to the United States.

That led to calls from Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance, for Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to ask for help from the National Guard.

Last month, Tillis told Attorney General Pam Bondi that calling in the National Guard could mask “an abject failure” by state and local leaders and that he didn’t believe North Carolina needed the help.

“If I thought that I needed the president to deploy troops to keep North Carolina safe, I would have considered myself a failure as a state leader,” Tillis said, drawing from his experience as the state’s previous House speaker.

Why is Border Patrol in Charlotte? Tillis points to sheriff

Tillis lives in Huntersville, 20 minutes from Charlotte.

On Thursday, he said during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary that he believes Border Patrol is now in his state because Sheriff Garry McFadden used “sanctuary city policy.”

“There have been people released,” Tillis said. “There have been bad outcomes. So a part of the reason that we’re here is because of those bad decisions.”

Tillis didn’t get into further details, and was interrupted for unrelated votes when the committee reached a quorum as he spoke.

Sanctuary cities are banned under state law, and North Carolina lawmakers recently passed a bill that requires sheriffs to comply with requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

McFadden has argued for years that holding defendants at the request of ICE after they have posted bond and complied with court-ordered terms of release is unconstitutional.

Charlotte is considered, by the nonprofit Welcoming America, “a Certified Welcoming City.” This distinction means it’s known for policies and programs surrounding immigrant inclusion, The Charlotte Observer previously reported.

That doesn’t keep the sheriff from cooperating with ICE.

Despite that, Trump deemed it a sanctuary city.

Trump has benefited from the support of North Carolinians. The purple state has elected Trump to the White House in the past three elections, despite simultaneously electing Democratic governors. A recent poll by conservative news outlet Carolina Journal found that Trump’s approval rating is falling in North Carolina.

Tuition for out-of-state students at the University of California and the California State University is roughly three times as much as that for state residents.
The Justice Department says that the California laws that allow immigrants without legal status in-state tuition benefits are preempted by federal law and should be blocked.
The department lists California Governor Gavin Newsom, Attorney General Rob Bonta, the Regents of the University of California, the Board of Trustees of the California State University and the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges as defendants.
Additionally, the Justice Department is asking for a court order stopping California from enforcing its so-called “California Dream Act,” which affords scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants who don’t have legal authority to live in the country.","(CN) — The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday sued California over a state law provision that allows immigrant college students without permanent legal status to pay in-state tuition that isn’t available for out-of-state students.

Federal law, according to the Justice Department in its complaint filed in Sacramento, makes individuals who are unlawfully present in the U.S. ineligible for postsecondary education benefits based on state residency unless those same benefits are offered to all U.S. citizens, regardless of their state of residence.

“California is illegally discriminating against American students and families by offering exclusive tuition benefits for non-citizens,” U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. “This marks our third lawsuit against California in one week — we will continue bringing litigation against California until the state ceases its flagrant disregard for federal law.""

Tuition for out-of-state students at the University of California and the California State University is roughly three times as much as that for state residents. Both university systems, as well as California’s community colleges, allow that students who live in the state without legal immigration status can qualify as California residents if they meet certain criteria as stipulated by state law.

These students are also eligible for scholarships and subsidized loans that aren’t available to out-of-state U.S. citizens, according to the Justice Department.

The lawsuit adds to barrage of litigation between the Trump administration and the left-leaning state — including challenges to California’s policy of allowing transgender students to participate on female college and high-school sports teams and California’s recent redrawing of its electoral map to benefit Democrats, as well as lawsuits over federal funding cuts at universities that don’t adhere to the president’s political agenda.

The Justice Department says that the California laws that allow immigrants without legal status in-state tuition benefits are preempted by federal law and should be blocked. The department lists California Governor Gavin Newsom, Attorney General Rob Bonta, the Regents of the University of California, the Board of Trustees of the California State University and the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges as defendants.

Additionally, the Justice Department is asking for a court order stopping California from enforcing its so-called “California Dream Act,” which affords scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants who don’t have legal authority to live in the country.

The lawsuit is prompted by two of President Donald Trump’s executive orders that seek to ensure such immigrants aren’t obtaining taxpayer benefits or preferential treatment, the Justice Department said.

One of these executive orders that Trump signed Feb. 19, entitled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders,” requires that federal agencies ensure that no taxpayer-funded benefits go to “unqualified aliens.” The other, “Protecting American Communities From Criminal Aliens,” calls for an end to of state and local laws and policies that favor immigrants over U.S. citizens.

“These orders emphasize that federal and state governments must not grant greater benefits to individuals who are unlawfully present in the United States than to American citizens,” the Justice Department said in the complaint. ‘They also reflect Congress’s intent—expressed in multiple provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act — to reduce incentives for illegal immigration by limiting access to certain public benefits.""

Leandro Fossá, the pastor, on a cold late October Sunday afternoon.

The conversations here have changed in recent weeks. Where they once centered on baptisms, quinceañeras and parish parties, they now turn to immigration checks, missing relatives and how to prepare legal papers in case of deportation.

For many in this working-class suburb, the death of Silverio Villegas González marked a turning point. Villegas, an undocumented Mexican immigrant father of two, was fatally shot by Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents on Sept. 12 after a traffic stop that ended with his car pinned under a truck.

For people in Melrose Park's Mexican community, his death made real a fear that had already been spreading quietly.

'If we shut down, then people will have nowhere to go to meet the Lord and to find courage.'

—Scalabrinian Fr. Leandro Fossá

One of the women in the parish office on Oct. 26, who asked not to be named, was Villegas' girlfriend. In an interview with the National Catholic Reporter she said she met Villegas as a child in Michoacán and they found each other again years later in Chicago. ""We built a life together,"" she said. ""He worked; he took care of us. He was a good person.""

Recalling the morning she learned Villegas had been shot, she said: ""He didn't answer my call. I saw the videos on social media and I knew it was him. I still can't believe it.""

Her 13-year-old daughter, who sat beside her, said Villegas treated her as his own daughter. ""He always asked if we were OK, if we needed anything. When I graduate, I'll keep his promises.""

The days following Villegas' death, Our Lady of Mount Carmel parish hosted a novena prayer and a memorial Mass for him; Chicago Auxiliary Bishop José María Garcia-Maldonado presided.

Villegas' girlfriend said she no longer feels safe leaving home.

The women who spoke to NCR asked to remain anonymous to protect their identities and ensure confidentiality.

""I used to go to work or church safely. Now I'm afraid every time I go out,"" the girlfriend said. ""The parish has been helping us with food and prayers.""

Next to her was a parish volunteer, another undocumented woman who helps coordinate outreach and translation. She's been in the U.S. for about 30 years working different jobs and now spends much of her time connecting families to resources.

""This situation took me out of my comfort zone,"" she said. ""Before this, I was doing the things I liked to do and basically just working. This country gave me great opportunities, even if I've been undocumented.""

She helps lead ""Know Your Rights"" workshops, where immigrants learn how to respond if approached by immigration officers. ""I remind people they have the right to remain silent, to ask for a lawyer. Even if you're undocumented, you still have rights,"" she said.

Living in quiet vigilance

Another mother, also undocumented, said she came to the U.S. in 2004, 18, alone and pregnant, hoping for a life that felt steadier than the one she left in Mexico. In the 21 years since, she has worked wherever she could — a printing factory first, then cleaning apartments and houses, later babysitting. Church became her anchor. It was the place, she said, that helped her face the harder parts of her life.

Two years ago, she confronted another kind of fear when she reported that her stepfather's father had abused her daughter. The man was eventually deported.

Today, she said many neighbors no longer attend Mass or send their children to school. Even simple errands feel dangerous.

Her own family lives in a kind of quiet vigilance. Her husband is a legal resident, her daughters are citizens, but she is not. She is in the process of applying for a green card, a step that brings both hope and anxiety.

In late October, that fear became real. Two of her brothers were detained at a Home Depot while buying materials for work. ICE trucks boxed them in, she said, and agents ordered them out of their vehicle. Later, a stranger called her cousin to say he had found the truck still running in the parking lot. He turned it off, hid the keys, and waited until the family could collect it.

Her brothers were transferred to a detention center in Texas, she said. Since then, calls have been brief and uncertain. Their wives cry most days, she said. The children ask when their fathers will come home. She tries to keep her voice steady when she talks about them, but her words tighten.

""They are not criminals, only men who went to work that morning,"" she said, crying.

Her 20-year-old daughter was born in the U.S. and works at a clothing store. After work, she joins the parish's young adult group, a circle of first-generation Americans who gather to pray and talk about the most recent news.

The daughter knows that citizenship doesn't shield her from worry. Her family's future still feels uncertain, and each sighting of an ICE vehicle brings anxiety, she said.

""I haven't encountered ICE directly, but there was one day where on my way to work I saw them two lanes next to me,"" she said. ""My body felt heavy, it was like this weird feeling. Because I thought, if my mom was in my position right now what would've happened?""

""She could've gotten nervous and scared and then next thing you know ICE could get suspicious and pull her over.""

When her uncles were detained in October, she received the call before her shift. She went to work anyway, trying to focus on customers while her thoughts circled back to her family. Prayer became her only refuge, she said.

The only place that feels safe

When Fossá talks about his parish, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, he describes it as a community determined to resist fear. ""We decided from day one not to shut down any ministry, because we do not live in fear — we have faith,"" he told NCR.

""If we shut down, then people will have nowhere to go to meet the Lord and to find courage.""

That conviction has kept his parish alive and full, even as immigration raids and political tensions have reshaped the lives of the overwhelming majority of his parishioners. ""We have more people attending our ministries and we have weekends with even more people in church,"" he said.

""We have created opportunities for people to come to Holy Hour and pray for migrants and refugees, to pray for Donald Trump, to pray for ICE, to pray for reconciliation.""

""Some are coming to church because they feel that this is the only place where they could go and feel safe,"" Fossá said. ""We did not stop it, because they feel that here they could come and participate and they feel that ICE will not take their peace away.""

Beyond the liturgy, the parish's mission has taken on an urgent, concrete form. In recent weeks, the church hall has transformed into a hub of quiet resistance, where folding tables are stacked with legal papers instead of potluck dishes. Fossá said the parish recently assisted more than 300 families, working with lawyers and notaries to ensure their property and guardianship rights are protected.

The goal is vital: If a parent is detained by immigration authorities, their assets remain safe and they have a plan for who will care for their children. In a time when uncertainty shadows even daily routines, the parish has become one of the few places where families can prepare, pray and breathe freely.

This blend of prayer and protection captures the essence of the Scalabrinian mission, said Scalabrinian Fr. Giovanni Bizzotto, who is superior provincial of the order's Province of West North American and Central America.

Bizzotto, who oversees 19 parishes and migrant shelters in Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, said that USAID cuts have left humanitarian agencies ""without funds,"" forcing shelters in Central America to struggle as migrants are stranded and homeless. Yet despite what he called ""a pretty dark reality,"" he said that ""it is by doing good and behaving well that we have to overcome this evil situation.""

As the afternoon ended, the women at the parish gathered their belongings. The woman who lost her boyfriend thanked the priests quietly, and she and her daughter hugged both of them tight.

Outside, the bells of Mount Carmel signaled evening Mass. Despite the fear of leaving their homes, more than 2,000 people gradually packed the church and started singing.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-11/11.20.25%20Our%20Lady%20of%20Mount%20Carmel%20Pic%201.jpg?h=27f45369&itok=YdvEZ8ba,N,,2025-11-20 22:56:49.283659

The governor said the secretary and himself have put together a public safety package of about $200 million.
They spoke about staffing issues, mental health and drug addiction on the streets, and the need to provide mental health resources for officers and deputies who face daily stresses.
However, he is interested in finding a mental health program that can help officers who were at the scene of the shooting.
Wilmington Police Chief Ryan Zuidema said mental health is a “huge, huge issue,” and more needs to be invested in it.","Gov. Josh Stein criticized federal immigration enforcement tactics in the state.

Stein and law enforcement leaders discussed public safety challenges, including officer pay and retention.

Area police chiefs and sheriffs highlighted the need for more mental health resources for both the public and first responders.

In response to news that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees from the Raleigh area were taken to the New Hanover County jail, Governor Josh Stein criticized the federal government’s handling of the matter.

“People deserve to be safe, and keeping people safe is a top priority, and if there are bad people who are here illegally, they should be identified, held accountable and deported,” Stein said Nov. 20 during a news conference following a roundtable discussion with area law enforcement leaders at the University of North Carolina Wilmington. “But what has happened this past week in North Carolina has not been that. It’s been the folks with Border Patrol just sweeping through cities, picking up random people off of sidewalks, pulling people down from roofs, landscapers from lawns. They’re just going around and picking people up. That does not make our community safer.”

North Carolina has become the target of a federal crackdown on illegal immigration as federal agents recently went to Charlotte, Durham and Raleigh, drawing protests in the process. The Department of Homeland Security said it launched “Operation Charlotte’s Web” to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets,” USA TODAY reported.

The Democratic governor said, “Folks, Americans are scared to be out in the community for fear of Border Patrol bashing in their windows, which they have done to Americans.”

New Hanover County Sheriff Ed McMahon confirmed before the roundtable that ICE detainees had been brought to the county, but he could not say how many.

Stein said Border Patrol agents “just end up going where they go. They don’t really tell us where they’re going. But I’ve been in Charlotte a couple of times since they appeared there, and it created just widespread panic and fear and dislocation.”

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff was ""advised"" the nearly week-long operation in Charlotte concluded on Nov. 20, according to the Asheville Citizen Times. Federal agents arrested over 370 people, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told the Citizen Times on Nov. 20.

Stein, appearing with North Carolina Department of Public Safety Secretary Eddie Buffaloe, hosted a 53-minute roundtable discussion that included seven area law-enforcement representatives as part of a statewide series of such talks.

The governor said the secretary and himself have put together a public safety package of about $200 million.

“A lot of it has to go with paying state law enforcement more,” said Stein during the roundtable talk. “We have among the lowest paid highway patrol in the country. We have among the lowest paid correctional officers in the country, and we need to pay those folks, but we also need to help you all.”

Stein called the work law enforcement does “immensely challenging” and asked how their jobs could be made easier. They spoke about staffing issues, mental health and drug addiction on the streets, and the need to provide mental health resources for officers and deputies who face daily stresses.

Southport Police Chief Todd Coring, whose department dealt with a mass shooting on Sept. 27 that left three people dead and several others injured, said his city is recovering from that trauma. However, he is interested in finding a mental health program that can help officers who were at the scene of the shooting.

Wilmington Police Chief Ryan Zuidema said mental health is a “huge, huge issue,” and more needs to be invested in it. “We need to do a better job of taking care of our first responders,” he said.

Brunswick County Sheriff Brian Chism said most of the problems his office sees in the public on a daily basis are related to mental health issues or addiction.

Stein said mental health and addiction issues are “large and real.” He said, “This is an exceptionally stressful profession, and you have to carry a lot of society’s ills on your back.”

Stein told the media: “These folks work so hard to keep us safe. The most important job we have in government is public safety, and people deserve to be safe. They deserve to feel safe, and we’ve got to do everything we can to help that happen.”","https://www.starnewsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/20/NSTN/87383340007-stein-meeting-photo-1.jpg?crop=4031,2268,x0,y151&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-21 01:56:37.395106

Michelle Byrd, who spent two decades in the U.S. Air Force and was deployed six times, criticized the deportations of veterans as disrespectful.

“That’s just the ultimate slap in the face, and we should be ashamed of ourselves for letting it happen,” she said. “They defended this country. They raised their hand and they swore to uphold the Constitution, and then they come home and we say, ‘Oh, thanks for your service, get out.’ It’s wrong.”

In an effort to deliver on Trump’s mass deportation promise, immigration enforcement activity has surged, and noncitizen service members, who were previously afforded limited protections from detainment and removal, have been caught in the crosshairs.

The deportation of veterans has been an ongoing issue, though a spotlight on an increase of removals by the Trump administration has prompted vocal criticism. In 2021, Biden issued an executive order that resulted in the creation of the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, which worked to prioritize the return of deported veterans and their families.

Signing up to join the military doesn’t require citizenship, just lawful permanent residency. During Joe Biden’s presidency, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were directed to take a person’s military record into consideration before arresting them. But under Trump, that guidance was replaced in April with a memo emphasizing that, while it would still be considered, military service alone doesn’t “automatically exempt aliens from the consequences of violating U.S. immigration laws.”

It’s unclear how many foreign-born veterans have been deported since Trump took office. Some estimates project as many as 10,000 were expelled from the country between January and June, according to a letter sent to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by Democratic members of Congress.

At least two Iraq war veterans have been deported from Arizona. Marlon Parris, who was born in Trinidad but lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years, was arrested outside his Laveen home two days after Trump’s inauguration, despite previous assurances from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security that his nonviolent drug charge from 2011 wouldn’t result in his removal. He has since been deported to Mexico. And last week, José Barco, a Purple Heart recipient who was born in Venezuela to Cuban exiles, was deported to Mexico following 10 months in detention.

Advocates argue that immigrants who have served in the military should be exempted from deportation. Mike Olivas, a Vietnam war veteran who drove to the Capitol from Tucson, highlighted the sacrifice of military service as proof that immigrants who sign up for it deserve more.

“They should be at a different level,” he said. “I mean, they fought for their country. They did more than a lot of people did.”

Chris Hill, an organizing fellow with the progressive veterans group Common Defense, added that the government needs to improve its naturalization processes for military members. He noted that the current process puts too much of the burden on military members themselves, and he’s heard about several cases when a person’s citizenship application was waylaid by a deployment order that made them miss critical court appointments.

“We need to codify a practice within the Department of Defense that, if you’re an immigrant and you served your tour of service, that it’s incumbent on the Department of Defense to ensure that you go through that process and you become a citizen while you’re on active duty,” he said. “It’s a promise we made and it’s a promise we need to keep.”

While not a guarantee, military service offers an expedited pathway to citizenship. But the rate of naturalization lags far behind the share of veterans who are immigrants. In 2022, an estimated 16.2 million veterans were born in another country. That same year, only 10,690 military-based naturalizations were approved.

The rate of naturalization is further complicated by the heightened risk of criminal conviction among veterans. To be eligible for naturalization through military service, a person must demonstrate “good moral character” for at least five years before applying. One-third of veterans report being arrested, compared to just one-fifth of non-veterans, due in part to post-traumatic stress disorders, traumatic brain injuries or substance abuse. Barco, whose 2006 naturalization application was lost before it could get approved while he was on active duty, was convicted of two counts of attempted first-degree murder and one count of menacing when he fired a handgun into a crowd of teenagers in Colorado two years later, just months after being discharged because of a worsening traumatic brain injury.

Hill argued that a criminal record shouldn’t be the sole determinant of when a foreign-born veteran should be expelled from the country.

“These are soldiers who deployed in very stressful situations, oftentimes were injured, oftentimes have traumatic brain injuries, oftentimes have PTSD and other symptoms,” he said. “To think that they can come back and make mistakes and pay their time, and then get deported? And get deported to a country they don’t know? It’s a tragedy, and it’s not a one-size-fits-all.”

Barcos was sentenced to 52 years in prison when one of the bullets he fired struck 19-year-old Ginny Clemens, who was pregnant. He was ultimately released on Jan. 21 — the day after Trump became president for the second time — after serving 15 years. ICE agents detained him minutes after he walked out.

Jojo Sweatt, the national organizing director of Common Defense, called for the federal government to bring back deported veterans, saying that their military service makes the government responsible for them.

“We need to repatriate any veteran who has already been exiled and sent away, because they served this country,” she said. “No matter what their flaws are, or who they are as a human being, they are American because they swore that oath, they defended this country, and whatever happened to them after that service and spending time in war, it’s up to our country to take care of them.”",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/no-veteran-deportations-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 23:56:29.803792

A previous case kept control of the local police department with city leaders after Mr. Trump had tried to use emergency powers to seize command.","A federal judge in Washington temporarily blocked the Trump administration on Thursday from maintaining more than 2,000 members of the National Guard deployed to the city’s streets, finding the city was likely to succeed in arguing the deployment was illegal.

Judge Jia M. Cobb of Federal District Court, a Biden appointee, wrote in a 61-page opinion that the deployment, which began in August, appeared to be illegal for a variety of reasons, including limits on the president’s authority to assert total control over the local D.C. National Guard, as well as concerns over the city’s rights to self-governance.

Those concerns were compounded, she wrote, by the fact that more than 1,000 members of the force deployed to Washington are from other states, and that the Trump administration had taken steps to establish a semi-permanent command structure, with an eye to keeping troops in the city well into next year.

She paused her ruling for three weeks, to allow time for the administration to remove the troops, as well as to appeal her decision.

“At its core, Congress has given the District rights to govern itself,” Judge Cobb wrote. “Those rights are infringed upon when defendants approve, in excess of their statutory authority, the deployment of National Guard troops to the District.”

President Trump announced the deployment in Washington as part of an aggressive drive to ratchet up law enforcement in the city, directing heavily armed National Guardsmen to deploy to the city while integrating federal agents with local police officers to conduct sometimes routine police work. The troops have also played a role as armed backup for sharply stepped-up immigration and deportation operations around the city in what experts have described as a trial run in joint immigration operations.

Since the summer, small groups of armed National Guardsmen have been ubiquitous around the city, patrolling subway stops, tourist areas and nightlife districts. They have also been subject to mockery online after being observed guarding national monuments and relatively vacant areas or doing “beautification” work such as removing trash or sweeping plant debris.

Judge Cobb’s ruling followed several others around the country in which federal judges found that Mr. Trump’s deployment of troops to Chicago, Memphis and Portland, Ore., also most likely violated the law.

The Supreme Court is currently considering whether the president can deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to the Chicago area over the objections of state and local leaders. Whatever the justices decide in the Illinois case will most likely set the ground rules for Mr. Trump’s efforts to use state-based troops in other American cities as part of his aggressive immigration crackdown.

But it’s not clear if the court’s decision will have a similar impact in Washington, because of the unusual status of the District of Columbia, where federal authorities including the president have expanded powers. Mr. Trump has used that authority to bring in a force of National Guard troops contributed by at least 9 Republican states to serve as a semipermanent patrol in the city, and has announced plans to keep the force in place until at least the end of February.

“There is also the risk that this incursion may become permanent, or at least enduring, given the creation of a D.C.N.G. unit specifically established to conduct law enforcement in the District,” Judge Cobb wrote, referring to the D.C. National Guard.

She noted that under the Home Rule Act, the federal law granting the city limited self-government, Congress delegated considerable control over the city’s law enforcement to its local leaders. She described the president’s actions as “major intrusions into local governance.”

She wrote that the Trump administration “exceeded the bounds of their authority” with the deployment, and “acted contrary to law” by sending in the Guard to carry out “nonmilitary, crime-deterrence missions in the absence of a request from the city’s civil authorities.”

A White House spokeswoman said in an email that Mr. Trump enjoyed broad power to assume control over and command the members of the D.C. National Guard.

“This lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of D.C. residents — to undermine the president’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in D.C.,” said the spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson.

While Muriel E. Bowser, the city’s mayor, initially opposed the Trump administration’s efforts to wrest law enforcement control from her office, she has since softened her rhetoric, expressing openness to collaborating with the federal government to decrease crime in the city.

The lawsuit was brought by Brian Schwalb, Washington’s attorney general, who was elected separately from the mayor. He celebrated the ruling as a major breakthrough for the city after months of daily patrols by armed troops spread out across much of the city.

“From the beginning, we made clear that the U.S. military should not be policing American citizens on American soil,” he said in a statement. “Normalizing the use of military troops for domestic law enforcement sets a dangerous precedent, where the president can disregard states’ independence and deploy troops wherever and whenever he wants — with no check on his military power.”

The decision was a second win for Mr. Schwalb’s office.

For the complaint: https://www.eff.org/document/complaint-eff-v-doj-dhs-ice-tracking-apps","SAN FRANCISCO – The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) sued the departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) today to uncover information about the federal government demanding that tech companies remove apps that document immigration enforcement activities in communities throughout the country.

Tech platforms took down several such apps (including ICE Block, Red Dot, and DeICER) and webpages (including ICE Sighting-Chicagoland) following communications with federal officials this year, raising important questions about government coercion to restrict protected First Amendment activity.

""We're filing this lawsuit to find out just what the government told tech companies,"" said EFF Staff Attorney F. Mario Trujillo. ""Getting these records will be critical to determining whether federal officials crossed the line into unconstitutional coercion and censorship of protected speech.""

In October, Apple removed ICEBlock, an app that allows users to report Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in their area, from its App Store. Attorney General Pamela Bondi publicly took credit for the takedown, telling reporters, “We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store—and Apple did so.” In the days that followed, Apple removed several similar apps from the App Store. Google and Meta removed similar apps and webpages from platforms they own as well. Bondi vowed to “continue engaging tech companies” on the issue.

People have a protected First Amendment right to document and share information about law enforcement activities performed in public. If government officials coerce third parties into suppressing protected activity, this can be unconstitutional, as the government cannot do indirectly what it is barred from doing directly.

Last month, EFF submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the DOJ, DHS and its component agencies ICE and Customs and Border Protection. The requests sought records and communications about agency demands that technology companies remove apps and pages that document immigration enforcement activities. So far, none of the agencies have provided these records. EFF's FOIA lawsuit demands their release.

“Nothing in Christian teaching requires inflicting psychological harm on young people.","Seidel added that the Court has been “focusing only on the rights of the Christians bringing these cases while ignoring everyone else’s rights—like the kids being harmed.”

Professor John Culhane of Delaware Law School said the ruling could determine how states regulate mental health care nationwide.

“If the Court accepts the argument that this is ‘speech’ rather than professional conduct, it’s hard to see how any regulation of mental health practices carried out through talk could survive,” he said. “That would endanger the constitutionality of the entire practice of psychotherapy.”

Both scholars agree the Court’s reasoning could influence future decisions on other contested areas of youth health care, including gender-affirming treatments.

Jennifer C. Pizer, Senior Director of Strategic Initiatives at Lambda Legal, told Newsweek that Chiles v. Salazar is part of a broader legal campaign attempting to use the First Amendment “as a deregulatory weapon against the basic safeguards that protect patients.”

“Conversion therapy is not health care—it is a long-discredited practice rejected by every major medical association,” Pizer said.

“Framing this as a ‘speech’ case ignores the reality that licensed professionals have ethical duties. The First Amendment has never guaranteed a right to provide harmful or fraudulent treatment under the guise of counseling.”

Pizer added that a ruling for Chiles could “invite medical misinformation into clinical settings” by weakening the ability of states to enforce professional standards.

Reverend Fred Davie, a civil rights advocate, former vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and a leader at Union Theological Seminary, said the case highlights how religious language is increasingly invoked to justify practices that mainstream faith leaders reject.

“For far too long, some have twisted scripture to legitimize harmful practices against LGBTQ+ people, including conversion therapy,” Davie told Newsweek. “Nothing in Christian teaching requires inflicting psychological harm on young people. It is morally urgent that the Court recognize the difference between genuine religious expression and the misuse of religion as a tool to endanger children.”

Davie said faith communities nationwide “overwhelmingly repudiate” the idea that religion can excuse what medical experts deem unsafe.

What People Are Saying

Tara McKay, Director, LGBTQ+ Policy Lab at Vanderbilt said: “There are so many other things tied up into these cases that we kind of overlook because we’re focused very strongly on the topic area, which is conversion therapy and LGBTQ health … which I obviously think is phenomenally important, but the cases themselves are about so much more than this, and have so many more implications.”

Ana Builes, Appellate Counsel, Constitutional Accountability Center said: “Based on the overwhelming scientific and professional consensus that trying to change someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity can cause them serious harm … The First Amendment does not prohibit states from protecting its residents through this sort of regulation simply because the medical treatment that mental health professionals provide is done through speech.”

Jonathan Scruggs, Senior Counsel & VP of Litigation Strategy, ADF told Newsweek: “We hope the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on the side of free speech and allow counselors like Kaley to work with her clients without the government mandating goals it prefers.”

DHS dubbed the operation in Charlotte, which led to over 370 arrests, “Operation Charlotte’s Web.” Over more than five days, enforcement actions disrupted life across the city, resulting in business closures, children kept out of school, and widespread fear in the community.

At the helm of the operation was top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who, along with some of his federal agents, left Charlotte Thursday, according to a Homeland Security official, fueling confusion about the state of the operation.

Shortly after the sheriff’s statement was released, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “Wrong. Operation Charlotte’s Web isn’t ending anytime soon.”

CNN has reached out to DHS for clarification on the operation’s status. The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office says it stands by its statement.

Immigration enforcement will continue in the area, similar to what happened in Chicago after Bovino and his team departed, other law enforcement officials said.

Bovino and his agents are expected to launch an operation in New Orleans after the Thanksgiving holiday, as early as December 1, continuing the recent focus on city-specific immigration enforcement operations.

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said in a post following McFadden’s announcement that she is “relieved for our community,” and urged the city to “come together” as they move forward.

“We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community,” McFadden said in a statement Thursday. “As we move forward, I want the city of Charlotte to know, I will keep fighting for clarity, accountability, and trust.

Federal agents leave behind a city rocked by fear and confusion

In the few days that federal agents focused their immigration enforcement crackdown on North Carolina’s largest city, fear and confusion swept through the Charlotte community.

Charlotte teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN’s Gustavo Valdes she had been getting questions from students such as, “What is going to happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?” and “What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”

She described having only nine students show up on one day this week, as parents were afraid to send their children to school or, in some cases, parents with legal status drove the children of undocumented parents to class.

More than 30,000 students — about 20% of district enrollment — were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday as the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement mission in Charlotte continued, the district said, citing updated data from the beginning of the week.

“We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”

When a CNN crew in a black SUV was parked near a school this week, an official asked them to move their vehicle because it resembled a CBP vehicle and was frightening parents picking up their children.

One nonprofit estimates about half of the mom-and-pop businesses it works with have closed at some point during the immigration crackdown.

A family-run Colombian bakery, which has closed only once in its 28-year history, closed last week, with the family unsure of when it will reopen.

While some in the community are expressing relief that the operation may be over, others remain skeptical.

The Carolina Migrant Network, a nonprofit that provides legal services to people in removal proceedings, warned the community not to “let your guard down” as ICE is still operating in the area and other parts of the state.

“CBP might be leaving but ICE is still here!” the group said in an Instagram post.

Charlotte and Chicago could help New Orleans prepare

While the Charlotte operation appears to have concluded, an immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans is expected as early as December 1.

Some in Charlotte’s community adopted tactics they saw activists use in Chicago, such as watching for raids, blowing warning whistles, and carrying signs advising people of their rights. In Charlotte, some also stood outside the entrance of a local ICE processing facility to block federal agents, a method frequently seen at the Broadview ICE facility near Chicago.

Both cities quickly mobilized to train community members on how to respond if they saw an immigration raid or ICE presence.

Charlotte was a departure from what is typical in these operations, notably being much shorter — at less than a week — than the operation in Chicago, which started in early September.

The operation also took Charlotte by surprise, as President Donald Trump had not mentioned the city as a target. In contrast, while local and state officials in Chicago said federal officials hadn’t shared details about the operation or its timing, Trump frequently named Chicago as a target for a federal crime crackdown.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-11-17t185720z-2132695509-rc2gyhaod9ac-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-charlotte.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-20 20:58:13.631437

Ms Mahmood’s loosening of the obligations of the European Convention on Human Rights — or scrapping it, as Reform and the Tories demand — must not be a euphemism for the disregard of basic human rights.","DO ILLEGAL migrants have rights? The question is being raised in both Washington, DC, and Westminster. In the United States, threats to the rights of undocumented migrants have increased sharply with the intensified round-ups, often physically violent, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials (News, 14 November). In the UK, the reforms announced by the Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, have been described, even by her supporters, as “draconian” and the most significant tightening of immigration since the Second World War.

In the US, things have come to such a pass that those detained for deportation have even been denied access to the eucharist. Nuns, priests, and even a bishop carrying the Sacrament have been turned away at the door by ICE officials in Chicago, the home town of Pope Leo XIV, who has offered his strongest criticism yet of the Trump administration.

So grave is the crisis that the US Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued its first Special Message for 12 years on the subject. The treatment of immigrants has now replaced abortion at the top of the Bishops’ political agenda. They warn of a “climate of fear and anxiety”, of parents “who fear being detained when taking their children to school”, and of families who have “arbitrarily lost their legal status”. They issued an unprecedented video, in which each prelate reads a punchy line from their prepared message. Even bishops who previously supported Trump have become critical.

In the UK, Ms Mahmood declares that she is on a “moral mission” in announcing that incomers must reapply for refugee status every 30 months, and may be forced to return home once their countries are deemed safe — taking with them children born in Britain. Appeals will be curtailed. The definition of “inhumane and degrading treatment” will be narrowed. And there is much else. If liberals won’t enforce borders, she argues, fascists will, and more harshly.

But is her agenda any more moral than President Trump’s?

Trump defenders in the US persistently confuse human rights and civil rights. Civil rights spring from the “social contract”, which implies that those who pay taxes, follow the law, and share in the democratic community have privileges that outsiders do not. A welfare state cannot serve the world. Strong societies depend on shared norms, and unrestricted access to rights may erode them.

But human rights are different. They are not earned by joining a political community: they belong to everyone made in the image of God. All have the right to life, to freedom of religion and expression, to due process, to freedom from torture or degrading treatment. Citizens can vote for border control, but they cannot justify violating human rights. A state can detain, process, and deport — but it cannot extinguish fundamental rights.

This is the line that the American bishops are now trying to draw, and the line that the UK must take care not to blur. In reform of immigration laws and procedures, as the US bishops say, human dignity and national security must not be put in conflict. Ms Mahmood’s loosening of the obligations of the European Convention on Human Rights — or scrapping it, as Reform and the Tories demand — must not be a euphemism for the disregard of basic human rights. That would not be a moral mission, but a moral mistake.","https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/media/5704179/3d64nep.jpg?center=0.38461538461538464,0.50318471337579618&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134081222700000000",N,,2025-11-20 20:57:32.231862

“But [Jones] made a mistake and there is no order of removal,” Xinis interjected.
The Trump administration now contends that Costa Rica is no longer a viable destination, proposing instead a series of African countries.
For now, Abrego remains in immigration detention in Pennsylvania and an order Xinis issued earlier in the case blocks his deportation.
“If the government wants to moot it, it sounds like Mr. Abrego is still open to going to Costa Rica.”","In a detailed, 15-page order, Jones considered and credited Abrego’s assertion that he could be targeted in that country based on gang-related threats to his family’s pupusa business. The judge said it was too late for Abrego to get asylum, but granted him protection from being sent back to El Salvador. But Jones never explicitly ordered Abrego deported.

“There is no order of removal in the docket, in the record,” U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said Thursday near the beginning of the four-hour hearing. “You can’t fake it ‘til you make it. You got to have it. … You have to have the order. It’s got to be an order memorialized somewhere and I don’t have it.”

The formal deportation order is potentially crucial to Abrego’s fate because immigration judges typically specify which country immigrants will be deported to. That is a key point of contention in Abrego’s current predicament. Trump administration officials are seeking to send him to Liberia — a country he has no ties to — and Abrego’s lawyers are urging that he be sent to Costa Rica or allowed to remain in the U.S.

But Jones’ ruling doesn’t say where Abrego was to be sent, or even that he had to leave the U.S.

“It’s critically important,” Abrego lawyer Andrew Rossman told Xinis. “It would be an obvious due process violation to remove someone without a final order of removal. … I think the entire structure the government has built crumbles if there is no final order of removal.”

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign dismissed the missing order as a technicality and said the notion that Abrego was being ordered deported was implicit in Jones’ finding that he could not be sent to El Salvador.

“I think this represents, necessarily, the final order of removal,” Ensign said.

“But [Jones] made a mistake and there is no order of removal,” Xinis interjected.

“I think that is requiring more formality than the law requires,” Ensign replied.

A ruling that Abrego was never formally ordered deported could allow him to make a new asylum claim or take other steps to remain in the U.S. that aren’t open to someone under a deportation order.

The hearing Thursday also focused on where Abrego could be sent if he is deported. After Abrego was returned to the U.S. earlier this year and put in criminal proceedings in Tennessee on charges he drove migrants from Texas to the East Coast as part of an immigrant smuggling ring, Abrego’s lawyers and the government neared an agreement that he would be deported to Costa Rica.

However, that deal fell apart over Abrego’s unwillingness to plead guilty in the criminal case.

The Trump administration now contends that Costa Rica is no longer a viable destination, proposing instead a series of African countries. Immigration officials’ current plan is to send Abrego to Liberia, a nation in West Africa founded in the 1800s by people formerly enslaved in the U.S.

Xinis repeatedly prodded lawyers for the government Thursday to reconsider the possibility of sending Abrego to Costa Rica and made clear she understood why he was resisting the African nations.

“He’s been to CECOT and back,” the judge observed, referring to the notorious anti-terrorism prison Abrego was held in after his deportation from the U.S. She added that Abrego has “no cultural ties, no ties whatsoever” to Liberia. “He will be completely removed from everything and everyone he knows.”

Xinis heard from one witness Thursday about the state of Abrego’s deportation proceedings: John Cantu, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s acting assistant director for removal operations.

Cantu said a State Department attorney advised him that Costa Rica’s earlier willingness to take Abrego was “non-binding” and sending him there now would require “further negotiation and likely additional commitments by the United States.”

However, Cantu said he was unable to provide additional details about the issues with Costa Rica or the promises by Liberia because the sum total of his knowledge on those matters came from a five-minute video conference where State Department lawyer Carl Anderson read Cantu a prepared statement.

Cantu’s testimony irritated Xinis. She said she had no bone to pick with Cantu, but that his appearance continued a pattern of the administration failing to comply with her orders to produce witnesses knowledgeable about the efforts to find so-called third countries to take Abrego.

“This witness said nothing today,” the judge said later in the hearing. “Mr. Cantu knew nothing about anything. … Today was a zero, in my view.”

At least twice during the hearing, Xinis alluded to the fact that a request remains pending for contempt-of-court sanctions against the government for allegedly defying her orders earlier in the legal wrangling over what the courts concluded was his illegal deportation to El Salvador.

Abrego’s lawyers have argued that the administration’s current insistence on sending their client to Africa is an act of retaliation for embarrassment he caused President Donald Trump and other officials in that fight and his current unwillingness to plead guilty in the criminal case. Xinis didn’t go that far, but said she found it strange the government was unwilling to give her a detailed explanation of why Costa Rica appeared to be off the table.

“It’s so odd to me and that’s really being polite,” she said.

For now, Abrego remains in immigration detention in Pennsylvania and an order Xinis issued earlier in the case blocks his deportation. Even if she orders his release, he faces a trial beginning in January in Nashville in the criminal case.

Xinis warned both sides Thursday that it will take a while for her to rule and she made one more pitch to the administration to reach a deal with Abrego.

“It’s not going to be a quick decision,” Xinis warned. “If the government wants to moot it, it sounds like Mr. Abrego is still open to going to Costa Rica.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F69%2Fcb%2F03cc01e2431c899968b731570d73%2Fdeportation-error-abrego-garcia-69617.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 19:56:29.770134

Under the Trump administration, the human rights issue has been repurposed to fit his priorities in favor of economic dealmaking and an agenda he sees as appealing to his MAGA base. That has included a complete overhaul of the State Department’s human rights apparatus, which had long been the centerpiece of traditional U.S. promotion of democratic values.

A senior State Department official said that new instructions to U.S. officials on the report mandate they include “infringements on human rights in foreign countries,” including on arrests or official investigations over speech as well as the state subsidization of abortions or abortion drugs and the total estimated number of annual abortions.

Officials are also mandated to note the enforcement of diversity, equity and inclusion policies that “‘provide preferential treatment’ to workers on the basis of race, sex, or caste.”

“In recent years, new destructive ideologies have given safe harbor to human rights violations. The Trump administration will not allow these human rights violations, such as the mutilation of children, laws that infringe on free speech, and racially discriminatory employment practices, to go unchecked,” State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said.

For decades, the State Department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.

The change in guidelines comes after the administration this year scaled back the report, dramatically softening criticism of some countries that have been strong partners of the Republican president.

Instead, it sounded an alarm on the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa, with which Washington has clashed on a host of issues.

The Trump administration has moved away from the traditional U.S. promotion of democracy and human rights, seeing it as interference in another country’s affairs, even as it has criticized countries selectively.

One example is Europe, where Trump officials repeatedly weighed in on politics to denounce what they see as suppression of right-wing leaders, including in countries such as Romania, Germany, and France, and accused European authorities of censoring views such as criticism of immigration.

The predictive intelligence program has resulted in people being stopped, searched and in some cases arrested. A network of cameras scans and records vehicle license plate information, and an algorithm flags vehicles deemed suspicious based on where they came from, where they were going and which route they took. Federal agents in turn may then flag local law enforcement.

Suddenly, drivers find themselves pulled over — often for reasons cited such as speeding, failure to signal, the wrong window tint or even a dangling air freshener blocking the view. They are then aggressively questioned and searched, with no inkling that the roads they drove put them on law enforcement’s radar.

Once limited to policing the nation’s boundaries, the Border Patrol has built a surveillance system stretching into the country’s interior that can monitor ordinary Americans’ daily actions and connections for anomalies instead of simply targeting wanted suspects. Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.

The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.

This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.

The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.

This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America’s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.

The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.

The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers’ behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency’s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.

And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency’s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.

Border Patrol’s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are “governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.”

“For national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,” the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed “to operate anywhere in the United States,” the agency added.

While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol’s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that “large-scale surveillance technology that’s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time” might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.

Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America’s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.

“They are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know … engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,” Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP’s findings. “These surveillance systems do not make communities safer.”

‘We did everything right and had nothing to hide’

In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina’s low country.

Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles (161 kilometers) from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck’s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.

But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.

Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.

They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash — money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.

Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paquetería El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.

“We did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,” said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver’s name and get the trailer out of impound.

Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: “whisper,” “intel” or “wall” stops. Those stops are meant to conceal — or wall off — that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who’s traveling on America’s roads and predicting who is “suspicious,” according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.

In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff’s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.

Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.

At Border Patrol’s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff’s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.

“The beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there’s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,” said Joel Babb, the sheriff’s deputy who stopped Schott’s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.

According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott’s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott’s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.

Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff’s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.

The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles’ travel patterns — based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.

In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone’s driver’s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. “Need BP?,” responded a group member whose number was labeled “bp Intel.” “Yes sir,” the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.

Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens’ social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.

In Schott’s case, Babb testified that federal agents “actually watch travel patterns on the highway” through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: “I just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.”

After finding nothing in Schott’s car, Babb said “nine times out of 10, this is what happens,” a phrase Schott’s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff’s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.

The Bexar County sheriff’s office declined to comment due to pending litigation and referred all questions about the Schott case to the county’s district attorney. The district attorney did not respond to a request for comment.

The case is pending in federal court in Texas. Schott said in an interview with the AP: “I didn’t know it was illegal to drive in Texas.”

‘Patterns of life’ and license plates

Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation’s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.

Border Patrol’s parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers ”for a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,” the document states.

But that’s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major — and in some places permanent — fixture of the border region.

In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, “collects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist … in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.” Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.

Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls “patterns of life” of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining “abnormal” routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle’s plates as well as its driver’s face, the official said.

Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field — develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.

The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are “read” by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system’s algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system’s algorithm can flag an unusual “pattern of life” for human inspection.

The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to “Dallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta” before ending up south of San Antonio.

Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.

Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company “for now” had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.

Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol’s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.

Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP’s public records requests.

CBP’s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program’s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas “would permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.” Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.

One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp’s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.

Transformation of CBP into intelligence agency

The Border Patrol’s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.

CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.

Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.

A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.

In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol’s to prioritize border security.

“If we’re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, ‘Don’t come here,’” he said.

In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a “covert, mobile, License Plate Reader” to pipe data to Border Patrol’s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff’s department did not respond to a request for comment.

Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency’s surveillance network.

How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol’s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.

In Trump’s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration’s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.

The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.

“We took Alek’s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,” said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. ”What we found was something much larger — a system of mass surveillance that threatens people’s freedom of movement.”

AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite “suspicious” travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged “conducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns” as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.

In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase “subsequent to prior knowledge” when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.

Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.

Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don’t realize they’ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.

“I assume for every one person like me, who’s actually standing up, there’s a thousand people who just don’t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don’t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,” Schott said. “I think there’s thousands of people getting treated this way.”

“We have private plaintiffs suing a municipal entity under a state law, and then the municipal entity is challenging that state law as being unconstitutional under the Federal Equal Protection Clause.” This creates a threshold question: can a town challenge state law at all?
“Municipal entities are just creatures of the state,” Moneyhun notes.
Preparing for high-stakes oral argument When Moneyhun and Hatem joined the case, briefing at the Court of Appeals had concluded.
“There was a real synergy between our expertise in election law and their expertise in New York state law,” says Moneyhun.","Students from Harvard Law School’s Election Law Clinic traveled to Albany in October to see the culmination of months of preparation as their professor argued a case with statewide implications before the New York Court of Appeals. The case, Clarke v. Town of Newburgh, challenged the town’s at-large voting system under the New York Voting Rights Act (NYVRA)—but the constitutional validity of that state law itself hung in the balance.

Levi Moneyhun ’26 and Andy Hatem ’27 entered the case at the appellate stage, after a trial judge struck down the NYVRA as unconstitutional. As part of the Clinic’s representation of minority voters from Newburgh, New York, their preparation for oral argument and attendance at the proceeding offers a glimpse into the Clinic’s high-stakes litigation and nationwide impact.

What’s at stake in Newburgh

Clarke v. Town of Newburgh centers on a town where demographics and political representation tell two very different stories. Despite significant Black and Hispanic populations, the town board has remained uniformly white. The reason, according to the plaintiffs, lies in Newburgh’s at-large voting system.

“Right now, because the town board is elected at-large, you can have a demographic that makes up 25% of the population but will always be the minority in town counsel contests and end up with no representation whatsoever on the town board,” Hatem explains. In at-large elections, every board member is chosen by all voters across the entire town. Where voting patterns fall along racial lines and one group forms the majority, that majority can often end up electing every single representative, leaving minority voters underrepresented.

The consequences are concrete. “This is a town where, to our knowledge, despite a substantial Hispanic population, no Hispanic candidate has ever been elected on the town board,” Hatem says. The town employs few Spanish-speaking staff, creating barriers for Spanish-speaking residents. When the Ku Klux Klan marched nearby, the town’s response was muted. “The town of Newburgh did not take much action in response,” Hatem recounts. “When something like that happens, we certainly could hope to see a more forceful response by the town, because that really does implicate the interests of a lot of people who are residents and constituents, who deserve to have their voices heard and represented.”

The legal architecture of the case involves an uncommon twist. Private citizens sued the town under the New York Voting Rights Act—but instead of defending its voting system, the town attacked the state law itself as unconstitutional.

“This is a particularly interesting case because it really does involve the law of all three levels of government,” Moneyhun explains. “We have private plaintiffs suing a municipal entity under a state law, and then the municipal entity is challenging that state law as being unconstitutional under the Federal Equal Protection Clause.”

This creates a threshold question: can a town challenge state law at all? “Municipal entities are just creatures of the state,” Moneyhun notes. “They’re created by the state, and they can be dissolved by the state.” Under traditional doctrine, municipalities lack such power. The town claims the dilemma exception applies, but only if “complying with the statute would likely force the town to take unconstitutional action,” Moneyhun says.

This leads to the deeper question: will complying with the NYVRA force municipalities to violate the Equal Protection Clause? The trial court said yes, striking down the entire law. “By the logic of that ruling, you could say that any statute that aims to remedy racial discrimination is unconstitutional because it considers race,” Hatem says.

The Clinic’s position, according to Hatem, is that the reasoning is flawed: “We think, on the merits, that’s incorrect. We also think, because the town has not been ordered to implement any remedy, the town cannot challenge the statute.”

If the Court of Appeals agrees on the threshold issue, it could avoid the constitutional debate entirely. If it reaches the merits, its ruling will bind every municipality in New York.

Preparing for high-stakes oral argument

When Moneyhun and Hatem joined the case, briefing at the Court of Appeals had concluded. Their work focused entirely on preparing Professor Nick Stephanopoulos, Director of Strategy at the Clinic, for oral argument. Alongside partner counsel and outside attorneys, they explored every possible angle of the case to run through moot arguments with Stephanopoulos.

“One part of the questioning is getting as many perspectives as possible, so that any question that might come up at oral arguments has been asked already, ideally asked two or three different ways, maybe in a friendly way, maybe in a more skeptical way,” explains Hatem. “We really worked through those answers, so we have every answer prepared and thought through, and not developed on the fly.”

The complexity of the legal issues made this preparation essential, according to Moneyhun. “There are a lot of interlocking doctrines going on here,” he says. “It’s not just finding the answer, but finding a way that you can get to that answer very quickly in a way that will make sense to every judge on the panel.”

The Election Law Clinic worked alongside Abrams Fensterman, a New York law firm that filed the original case. The question of whether municipalities can challenge state laws came primarily from the firm’s local government practice. “There was a real synergy between our expertise in election law and their expertise in New York state law,” says Moneyhun.

Hatem found value in perspectives from practicing attorneys. “When you have co-counsel or partners who litigate these cases in New York every day, they help identify some very practical concerns,” he says. The four moot courts, he adds, “gave us four different looks at the same case, and I definitely learned something new from each one.”

Inside the Court of Appeals

The students sat through multiple oral arguments on the day their case was heard—theirs was the final case of the day, so the students had hours to soak up the experience of being in New York’s highest court.

“The New York Court of Appeals is a beautiful building,” Moneyhun says. “We got to hear oral arguments in several other cases that were being heard that day as well, which was interesting to see. Usually in law school, you’re only thinking about the legal issues that are in national news or that are coming up in your classes, but that represents a pretty small cross section of what’s ultimately going on in the country.”

Hatem notes the particular character of state-level appellate litigation. “At the state level, you have a lot of issues with very concrete impacts on people’s lives.” The challenge, he says, is “ultimately, trying to arrive at a resolution that applies the law correctly, makes sense, and is workable for the state, which needs to enforce all these laws in a practical way.”

Once Stephanopoulos began presenting the plaintiffs’ argument, the judges’ questioning validated the Clinic’s preparation. “It was really cool to see the judges on the New York Court of Appeals asking a lot of the same questions that we had been asking, to see them pressing on the same points that we had identified as the key areas of contention between us and the town of Newburgh,” recalls Moneyhun.

If the NYVRA survives this constitutional challenge, the case would return for trial to determine an appropriate remedy. It would be the first case where a remedy has been granted under the New York Voting Rights Act, “so it’s a bit of uncharted territory to see exactly how courts will decide which remedies to impose,” says Moneyhun.

He suggests potential remedies changing the town’s electoral structures: “Switching from an at-large districting system that systemically disenfranchises minority voters in a given municipality to a geographically districted system, or a proportional ranked choice voting system that allows them to have a say in governance that is proportional to their makeup in the community, would do a lot to advance their substantive interests.”

The lessons of experiential learning

Both students contrast clinical experience with traditional law school pedagogy. “The law school case method will tend to use specific cases as an instrument to get at one particular legal issue,” Moneyhun says. “But the thing about actual litigation is that it invariably raises dozens to hundreds of legal issues, and if you want to win, you need to actually understand every single one of those issues, and you need to explore every possible way you could lose to make sure that you don’t.”

The difference, he suggests, is both breadth and depth. “It requires a much more comprehensive understanding and a much deeper understanding than traditional law school coursework.”

Hatem, too, points to the messiness that precedes judicial resolution. “In these cases, rather than having the issues neatly packaged and summarized, in the way a judge has synthesized them for the ruling they ultimately reached, you see the messiness before the court decides exactly which way it’s going to rule and on what grounds it’s going to rule,” he says.

The goal is finding solutions that work for actual people that go beyond black and white, Hatem says: “People are three dimensional and have a lot of different concerns and interests, and especially once you get beyond a law school casebook, you have to take into account all those concerns and all those interests.”

“Seeing how some of the doctrines we learned play out in the real world helped me appreciate my other courses,” Hatem says, describing how “all these doctrines you learn at a very abstract level in the classroom suddenly becomes very real when you have a couple of parties at the Court of Appeals trying to resolve a matter years in the making.”

The case now awaits a decision, but the litigation may not end there. “Counsel for the town of Newburgh has indicated an intent to appeal an adverse decision up to the Supreme Court of the United States,” Moneyhun says. If that happens, he adds, “the Clinic will be involved in briefing the opposition to that petition for certiorari, and also involved in opposing a stay pending that petition.”

For now, the students have returned to Cambridge to continue a semester of voting rights work in the Clinic, having participated in litigation that could determine not just Newburgh’s electoral future, but the viability of voting rights enforcement across New York State.",https://hls.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Newburgh-1-768x1024.png,N,,2025-11-21 00:56:43.123924

The lawsuit was filed in a Massachusetts court on behalf of two immigrant women.

In February, the Department of Homeland Security announced that people in the country illegally could face “significant financial penalty” if they chose to stay.

Daily fines of $998, designed to encourage immigrants in the U.S. illegally to leave the country, have been imposed on more than 21,500 people who the lawyers said were trying to comply with immigration laws.

The fines are “grossly disproportionate to the gravity,” of any immigration violations, said the suit, calling them unconstitutional.

The lawsuit was filed in a Massachusetts court on behalf of two immigrant women. It seeks class-action status to represent people facing fines that lawyers say have totalled more than $6 billion since President Donald Trump returned to office early this year and launched an immigration crackdown.

“The people we serve are doing exactly what the law requires — pursuing legal relief through immigration courts and immigration agencies,” Hasan Shafiqullah, a supervising attorney with The Legal Aid Society, one of the groups handling the suit, said in a news release. “In return, the government is threatening to seize their wages, cars, even their homes.”

One of the two plaintiffs, a Florida woman identified in the complaint only as Nancy M. to shield her from retribution, had been ordered to leave the U.S., but also had what’s known as an “order of supervision” and was meeting annually with immigration authorities as she tried to become a legal permanent resident.

Instead, earlier this year she received a bill for roughly $1.8 million, a number apparently reached by totalling daily $998 fines for the past five years.

Starting soon after Trump was sworn in, the administration announced a series of efforts to encourage immigrants to leave the U.S.

In February, the Department of Homeland Security announced that people in the country illegally could face “significant financial penalty” if they chose to stay.

Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a February statement. “The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws -- we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce.”

Those people were arrested without warrants across the Chicago area and five neighboring states.

The lower court judge ruled those arrests violated a 2022 consent decree.

The consent decree required U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents to meet certain criteria when making warrantless arrests, including pre-determining whether there is probable cause to believe the person is in the country illegally, and whether they are also a flight risk.

But the Trump Administration argued that the order put the lives of Americans at risk.

The ruling had required the detainees be put on electronic monitoring after paying a bond by Friday.

This order now puts that on hold until a hearing on the matter next month.

Earlier this week, Judge Jeffrey Cummings denied a request by the government to delay the release.

Cummings found thousands of arrests may have violated the consent decree, agreeing with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and American Civil Liberties Union.

As a result of that finding, last week, Cummings ordered hundreds of people -- who do not present a ""high risk to public safety"" -- to be released from custody into electronic monitoring while the court is in the process of determining whether their arrests violated the agreement.

Four hundred forty two people were eligible for release Friday.

Attorneys representing the government have argued that Congress stripped federal courts of their authority to grant parole to large groups of immigrants in ICE custody, which they believe Judge Cummings is doing in this case.

The ACLU and National Immigrant Justice Center told the ABC7 Chicago I-Team while they're disappointed with this decision, the case is not over.

The 49-page ruling from U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee, a Trump appointee, concerns a deferred action program for ""young persons"" with Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) referred to as SIJS-DA. The SIJS classification was created in 1990 to provide ""immigration relief for foreign-born children living in the United States who have been abused, neglected, abandoned, or similarly mistreated by a parent"" and for whom a court found it was not in their best interest to return to their previous country.

In 2022, then-President Joe Biden's State Department announced there was a global backlog in EB-4 visas, the ""employment-based"" visa that allows for immigrants to live and work permanently in the U.S. In response to the backlog, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) created the deferred-action program for SIJS holders, which automatically considered those youths for deferred action protection, meaning that they wouldn't immediately be targeted for deportation.

The program offered an opportunity for youths to remain in the country, apply for employment authorization, and seek permanent resident status if an immigrant visa is ""immediately available"" at the time of filing.

In the spring, the Trump administration pulled back on granting deferred action approvals to SIJS youths, exposing them to possible deportation. In June, USCIS announced in a ""2025 Policy Alert"" that the program had been revoked.

As Komitee puts it, ""if no EB-4 visa is available when a person receives SIJS approval, that person cannot (yet) apply"" to receive permanent resident status. And as of this past March, more than 150,000 SIJS recipients were estimated to be in the backlog.

Nine SIJS recipients and two youth immigration advocacy organizations subsequently sued, alleging that the administration acted unlawfully because, among other things, it failed to provide proper notice of its actions under the Administrative Procedure Act, the federal statute that governs the behavior of administrative agencies.

""Plaintiffs present evidence that USCIS ceased automatically considering SIJS recipients for deferred action in April 2025, or two months before it promulgated the 2025 Policy Alert,"" Komitee writes. ""Again, the government has not challenged this evidence.""

""Thus, the government does not dispute that, for at least a two-month period, it did not follow its own internal procedures concerning deferred action for SIJS recipients,"" he adds. ""In other words, it does not dispute that it acted unlawfully.""

Komitee also found that the Trump administration wrongfully failed to consider the plaintiffs' ""reliance interest"" on the SIJS-DA program, noting that while ""SIJS-DA's questionable legality was likely reason enough for USCIS to seek to rescind the policy, the government is still required to consider the plaintiffs' reliance on that policy.

""While USCIS may ultimately conclude that 'reliance interests in benefits that it views as unlawful are entitled to no or diminished weight' it must still consider them,"" the judge writes. ""And it failed to consider reliance on SIJA-DA.""

The judge for the Eastern U.S. District of New York found that the undocumented immigrants who received SIJS status but were not considered for deferred action ""face a looming risk of deportation"" and two of them are ""already in removal proceedings.""

The Trump administration has argued, in part, that the immigrants do not have ""legally protected interest in obtaining"" deferred action and have ""fail[ed] to show that their removal or detention are imminent."" The administration maintains that it is up to its own discretion whether undocumented immigrants can remain in the country even if the program was reinstated.

Komitee found that these arguments ""miss the mark.""

""The loss of opportunity to pursue an immigration benefit is a cognizable injury in fact, even when the government retains ultimate discretion to deny that benefit,"" he wrote.

The judge largely ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, halting the rescission of the SIJS-DA program.

The group surveyed almost 700 health care workers in 30 states — including Arizona — about how their work with immigrant communities has changed since January. More than 80% reported significant or moderate decreases in patient visits, according to the survey.

“Just the knowledge and the visual of seeing how much immigration enforcement is going on across the country has led people to really second guess whether they should access health care, whether they should utilize SNAP benefits,” said Katie Peeler, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and the medical advisor with Physicians for Human Rights.

Peeler analyzed the data for the survey and said some clinicians also reported seeing immigrant patients seek out more telehealth and sometimes skip specialized medical treatments, like chemotherapy, for children.

“People were really fearful,” she said. “If they go to the visit, and ICE happens to be there, then there’s no chemotherapy at all, because they might go back to their home country where they don’t have access to those resources.”

Peeler said another physician’s patient was a mother and an undocumented immigrant, who was considering whether to forgo requesting a restraining order against her abusive ex-partner, because he’d threatened to call immigration authorities on her.

“Her attorney advised her to not place the restraining order. He said, ‘your fears are well-founded, if you place a restraining order, you may get that, but we can’t stop your ex-partner from calling ICE and you very well may be deported,’” she said. “That is a really, just unimaginable position to be in.”

But Graham added that any plan must be buoyed by strong U.S. military commitments to Ukraine and measures targeting Putin’s ability to fund the war.
Some lawmakers were left to learn the details of the 28-point peace plan largely from reporting in Axios, which broke the story, and the Financial Times, which followed up with details of the plan.
Other reported details of the plan include limits on Ukraine’s arsenal of weapons and limiting U.S. military assistance.
“The irony: exposed Zelensky team corruption makes peace in Ukraine much more likely,” Dmitriev posted Tuesday on X.","The Trump administration is renewing a push to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, with a reported 28-point peace plan that caught Kyiv’s supporters in Congress off guard and left at least one Republican warning against what appears to be a largely pro-Moscow proposal.

The plan was reportedly worked out by President Trump’s top envoy for peace negotiations, Steve Witkoff, and a top ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, and discussed with only a few top senior Ukrainian officials.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Russian state media that the ministry had not received any information from the U.S. through official channels related to agreements on Ukraine.

Likewise, Ukraine’s top supporters in Congress appeared to be in the dark.

“I don’t know what this 28-point plan is. I’m glad that we’re coming up with a plan,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a top Trump ally and hawkish supporter of Kyiv, said during an event Wednesday morning hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

But Graham added that any plan must be buoyed by strong U.S. military commitments to Ukraine and measures targeting Putin’s ability to fund the war.

Some lawmakers were left to learn the details of the 28-point peace plan largely from reporting in Axios, which broke the story, and the Financial Times, which followed up with details of the plan.

According to these reporters, the plan would have Ukraine give up full control of the eastern territory of the Donbas to Russia, even as Ukraine maintains control of about 12 percent of the territory with a heavily fortified front line, and requires Ukraine to cut the size of its armed forces by half.

“I just heard about it but have not seen any of the details,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) told reporters Wednesday.

“I have not been read in on the details of that,” said Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation.

Rep. Don Bacon, the outgoing Republican congressman from Nebraska, criticized the administration for reportedly negotiating with the Russians without the Ukrainians and appearing to pressure Kyiv.

“This sounds like 1938 Munich,” Bacon posted on social platform X, referring to the agreement that is largely criticized as appeasing Nazi Germany with territory at the time and emboldening Adolf Hitler to try to conquer Europe.

Other reported details of the plan include limits on Ukraine’s arsenal of weapons and limiting U.S. military assistance. The Financial Times also reported that the plan bars foreign troops from Ukrainian soil — essentially vetoing ideas for a European or international peacekeeping force to monitor any ceasefire, or potentially blocking Ukrainian partnerships with foreign militaries. Also, Kyiv would no longer receive Western long-range weapons that can strike deep into Russia.

The Financial Times continued that the plan says Russian should be recognized as an official state language in Ukraine and that it should grant official status to the local branch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Kyiv accuses the church of being an arm of the Kremlin’s propaganda, supporting the war in Ukraine.

Many of the points are nonstarters for Kyiv, which has agreed to Trump’s calls for a ceasefire on existing battle lines but rejected demands to cede territory, warning it would only open the rest of the country to future Russian aggression.

Russia is apparently hoping its military advances and a corruption scandal related to Ukraine’s energy sector weaken the negotiating position of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

“The irony: exposed Zelensky team corruption makes peace in Ukraine much more likely,” Dmitriev posted Tuesday on X.

The renewed push for a peace plan comes after Trump last month called off a second face-to-face summit with Putin set to be held in Budapest because he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio determined the Russian side was not yet serious about ending the war.

The plan’s reported details were met with concern among Ukraine’s staunch supporters in the U.S. and viewed as particularly cynical following a deadly strike by Russia on the Ukrainian city of Ternopil, killing at least 25 people, including three children.

“As Ukraine mourns innocent people murdered in their sleep by a russian terrorist missile, the media reports that the US Administration has shared with Ukraine a new, updated Capitulation Plan,” Olena Halushka, co-founder of the International Center for Ukrainian Victory, a coalition of Ukrainian civil society leaders and think tanks, posted on X.

“No pressure on russia, just Ukraine cutting its own hands and legs. What a disgrace.”

Mykola Murskyj, director of the Razom advocacy team, a U.S.-based nonprofit that advocates U.S. support for Ukraine, said in a statement, “Any durable peace requires a militarily strong Ukraine and firm guarantees that Russia will be unable to reignite its war in the future.”

“Americans around the country want to see Russia forced to end its war and return the Ukrainians it holds hostage, including tens of thousands of Ukrainian children. Nothing about Ukraine can be decided without Ukraine and its people,” he continued.

Meanwhile, Graham is hoping to seize on the peace plan to add momentum to his push to pass a bipartisan bill targeting countries that do business with Russia and aid its war coffers.

“No plan will work unless Putin and his allies believe that we’re serious about more military aid, more capability of Ukraine to hurt Russia militarily, and more economic ruin coming to those who prop up Putin’s war machine,” Graham said.

“When they believe those things then the 28-point plan will work.”

Trump seemed to give a green light last week for Congress to move ahead on Graham’s Russia sanctions bill, called the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025. It is co-sponsored by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) with a veto-proof majority of co-sponsors.

But the pathway to passage is still unclear. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has called for the House to take up the bill first, because the bill includes tariff measures, and to provide a vehicle for it to pass in the Senate.

“We want to get it done, yeah. Now, I think it’s probably a revenue measure, most likely originates in the House,” Thune told reporters Wednesday. “But as long as the White House is good with doing it, as you know, we’ve been ready to go on that for a long time. So hopefully the answer is yes, but we have a lot of stuff on the calendar.”

Operation “Swamp Sweep,” an expansive, monthslong immigration crackdown, is expected to launch in southeast Louisiana Dec. 1, but Democrat-run New Orleans is anticipating the arrival of as many as 250 federal troops as soon as Friday, all with the backing of the state’s Republican governor.

Governor Jeff Landry has sought to align New Orleans with federal immigration enforcement efforts through legislation and legal challenges, and the Border Patrol deployment is just the latest drive to ramp up that pressure. And with the New Orleans Police Department being released from a federal reform pact Wednesday, its officers have lost a legal mechanism that has long-shielded them from having to participate in immigration enforcement.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security operation will be led by Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has already overseen aggressive campaigns in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.

A gung-ho Republican governor

Landry, who has close ties to the nation’s top immigration officials, has made immigration enforcement a priority.

Louisiana does not share a border with another country, yet it has become one of the nation’s largest detention hubs for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with a capacity upward of 6,000 detainees. In September, the Bayou State opened the “Louisiana Lockup” inside a notorious state prison to hold immigrants whom federal officials consider dangerous.

The governor has also highlighted crimes in which the suspect’s immigration status is in question, such as the killing of a French Quarter tour guide by a group that included a Honduran man who entered the country illegally.

New Orleans’ deep-rooted immigrant communities

New Orleans’ Democratic leaders frequently butt heads with Landry and other state officials who accuse the city of lax law enforcement and have pushed for collaboration with the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, a Mexican-American immigrant, told The Associated Press there is “a lot of fear” in her city and that she is working to ensure those who could be targeted by federal agents know their rights.

“I’m very concerned about due process being violated, I’m very concerned about racial profiling,” Moreno said.

New Orleans is known for its rich blend of French, Spanish, African and Native American cultures. It is home to more than 10,000 ethnic Vietnamese who arrived after the Vietnam War. A city monument recognizes the thousands of Latino workers who helped rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. South Louisiana’s distinctive Cajun heritage emerged from French-speaking colonists exiled there in the 18th century.

In September, Landry requested a National Guard deployment to New Orleans, citing rising violent crime, even though city police say crime is down and its elected leaders say federal troops are unnecessary. Landry told Newsmax on Wednesday that the “Swamp Sweep” operation is focused on “taking dangerous criminals off the street.”

A Landry spokesperson declined to comment to the AP on Border Patrol operations.

Rachel Taber, an organizer with the New Orleans-based advocacy group Union Migrante, said the influx of federal agents would have far-reaching negative impacts.

“The same people pushing for this attack on immigrants benefit from immigrant labor and the exploitation of immigrants,” Taber said. “Who do they think is going to clean the hotels from Mardi Gras or clean up after their fancy Mardi Gras parade?”

Conflict over the city’s immigration policies

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell saying the city “engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement.” The city has been barred from receiving certain federal law enforcement grants, according to Jim Craft, executive director of the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement, which distributes federal funds. Cantrell did not respond to a request for comment.

Under Landry, the GOP-dominated Louisiana Legislature has targeted New Orleans’ immigration policies, including by passing a law threatening jail time for law enforcement officials who delay or ignore federal enforcement efforts. Another measure directs state agencies to verify, track and report anyone illegally in the U.S. who is receiving state services, and one more bans city policies that prohibit cooperation with federal immigration agencies.

“Their enforcement of laws is indiscriminate at best, corrupt at worst,” said Republican state Sen. Jay Morris, who was behind the law punishing obstruction of immigration enforcement. “Apparently we have to have a law to tell people not to break the law.”

Federal oversight of local law enforcement

The Orleans Parish Sheriff’s office and the New Orleans Police Department have been subject to longstanding federal oversight that barred them from engaging in immigration enforcement.

The police oversight ended Wednesday, leaving officers in an uncertain legal position if they receive conflicting directives from city and state leaders, according to the city’s Independent Police Monitor Stella Cziment.

Moreno, set to take office as mayor on Jan. 12, said the city’s police will follow state law, but that department policy viewed immigration enforcement as a civil matter outside its jurisdiction. New Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick said department policies barring immigration enforcement “are not in conflict” with state laws.

Kirkpatrick said she met with ICE officials this week and her department will work with federal agents to ensure public safety.

“Our support is to make sure they are not going to get hurt and that our community is not in danger,” she said.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, backed by the Department of Justice, has requested an end to federal oversight of the sheriff’s office, saying it impedes the state’s ability to enforce immigration law.

The sheriff’s office, which operates the city’s jail, has a policy under federal mandate to not hold people for ICE unless they have committed a serious crime. Court filings show the U.S. government says that since 2022, the jail has only complied with two of its 170 detainer requests. Sheriff-elect Michelle Woodfork told AP she will comply with state law if federal oversight ends.

Whatever the immigration judge meant, Xinis said: “This doesn’t look anything like [a removal order].
Once Abrego won the right to pre-trial release, the government offered Abrego a plea deal that would end in his deportation to Costa Rica.
Judge Xinis appeared taken aback by the revelation, and she ordered the unsealing of his declaration, which is not currently public.","The Trump administration’s fourth effort to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a faraway African nation hit a basic stumbling block on Thursday.

During an evidentiary hearing, a federal judge could not confirm that the government obtained a final order of removal.

“If your honor finds there’s no removal order, then there’s no basis for immigration detention whatsoever,” Abrego’s attorney Andrew Rossman said during a hearing on Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis grilled senior Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign on the matter. Ensign cited a document in the record, but Xinis told him that the file had no indication that it ordered Abrego’s removal.

“Not in so many words, your honor,” Ensign said.

“Not at all,” Xinis shot back.

Ensign said that an immigration judge “meant” to order Abrego’s removal.

Whatever the immigration judge meant, Xinis said: “This doesn’t look anything like [a removal order]. It’s not even close.”

The Supreme Court precedent of Zadvydas v. Davis bars indefinite immigration detention, generally imposing a 90-day limit after a final order of removal, subject to certain exceptions. It’s a key precedent Abrego’s lawyers argue for his release.

“Quite a journey”

In the words of one of Abrego’s lawyers in court, “It’s been quite a journey.”

This past March, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security hustled Abrego out of the country to a brutal terrorism prison in El Salvador, where a court order blocked his removal. After five court orders demanding his return, the government returned him to the United States for prosecution on allegations that he smuggled immigrants in 2022.

Once Abrego won the right to pre-trial release, the government offered Abrego a plea deal that would end in his deportation to Costa Rica. Prosecutors reneged on that offer once Abrego decided to defend himself at a trial. Immigration authorities put him in detention immediately following his release and have fought for months to avoid a trial entirely by deporting Abrego to a series of African countries: Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and finally, Liberia.

The first three countries publicly refused to accept Abrego, who has no ties to any of those nations.

Liberia, a country with a blotted human rights record, agreed to accept Abrego.

After his initial rejection of the plea officer, Abrego agreed to be deported to Costa Rica, which promised to respect Abrego’s human rights and not send him back to El Salvador.

The government has since refused to honor that request, insisting upon other countries where Abrego says that he fears persecution. Xinis confirmed that the option remains on the table.

“If the government wants to moot, Abrego is still willing to go to Costa Rica. Is that correct?” Xinis said.

“Yes, your honor,” Rossman agreed.

“This witness said nothing”

Early in the hearing, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official John Edward Cantu testified that a State Department lawyer wrote a paragraph of his declaration.

Cantu, the Acting Assistant Director for ICE’s Removal Division, added that he didn’t understand certain words the lawyer used.

Judge Xinis appeared taken aback by the revelation, and she ordered the unsealing of his declaration, which is not currently public.

Cantu had been called, in part, to attest that Costa Rica is no longer available as an option, but Xinis said that his actual testimony didn’t support that.

“This witness said nothing today,” Xinis said.

Ensign argued that Abrego’s willingness to accept Costa Rica shows that he has an order of removal.

“Not necessarily,” Xinis shot back. “It’s a concession because he’s been to [El Salvador terrorism prison] CECOT and back.”

“You’re dealt a hand and you play it the best you can,” the judge added later.

If she finds there is no final deportation order, Xinis said she believes: “We’re done.” Abrego’s lawyers have asked the judge to release their client from immigration custody or short of that relief, keep an injunction in place blocking his deportation until the government can meet the lawful requirements. Xinis said she now considers the record closed and will issue a ruling at a later time.

If Abrego avoids deportation, he will stand trial on Jan. 27, 2026.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sP_j!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74e2ac46-1218-47e6-a1a1-4a265b17238a_1750x1167.jpeg",N,,2025-11-20 19:56:47.567427

“It appears that U.S. Border Patrol has ceased its operations in Charlotte. I’m relieved for our community and the residents, businesses, and all those who were targeted and impacted by this intrusion,” she wrote on social media.

“As we move forward, it is essential that we come together — not as separate groups divided by recent events, but as one Charlotte community.”

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office also said federal officials had assured Sheriff Garry McFadden that they had concluded “Operation Charlotte’s Web” and that no further operations would occur on Thursday.

“It is important to clarify that while the ‘Charlotte’s Web’ operation has ended, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will continue to operate in Mecklenburg County as they always have,” a statement from the sheriff’s department said.

“ICE maintains full authority to detain, apprehend, and take into custody any undocumented immigrant in accordance with federal law.”

The operation began on November 15, when the administration of US President Donald Trump announced it was “surging resources” to Charlotte.

It justified the surge by accusing local officials of embracing “sanctuary” policies that allow undocumented people to “roam free on American streets”.

During an update on Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it had made more than 250 arrests as of Tuesday night.

Immigration efforts had also expanded to the state capital of Raleigh and surrounding areas during the operation.

But “Operation Charlotte’s Web” had faced fierce pushback from residents in Charlotte, the state’s largest city and a centre for tech businesses. More than 911,300 people call Charlotte home.

Hundreds of protesters, for example, gathered outside businesses like Manolo’s Bakery, which temporarily shut its doors to protect employees and customers from being targeted by the raids. Another protest took place outside a Home Depot where Border Patrol agents had gathered.

Students at East Mecklenburg High School, Northwest School of the Arts and other schools also staged a walkout in solidarity with the immigrant community.

Local media reported that school attendance on Monday dropped by nearly 15 percent, but it was unclear how many absences were due to protests, concern over immigration enforcement activity or seasonal trends like the flu.

The spike in immigration operations in the Charlotte area also raised concerns about human rights abuses, with locals recording scenes of car windows being smashed and individuals being tackled to the ground and bloodied.

As the surge of federal immigration operations winds down in Charlotte, a fresh wave of Border Patrol operations is expected in another southern city, New Orleans. That operation has been dubbed the “Swamp Sweep”.

Other Democratic-led cities have also faced heightened immigration enforcement operations, leading to widespread concerns about the tactics being used and whether human rights are being upheld.

Those cities include Los Angeles, Chicago, Memphis and Washington, DC.

“Lawmakers and law enforcement alike know that community-based organizations understand the root causes of violence in their neighborhoods better than anyone,” Murphy told The Trace.
COPS alone awarded $600 million to local law enforcement agencies in 2024 — 12 times the annual funding dedicated to CVIPI.
It’s unclear if the immigration enforcement requirements are legally enforceable, and they could ultimately be struck down in court.
“The CVIPI grant as it stands is not a community-friendly grant,” Sherrills said.","The Trump administration has reoriented a grant initiative originally meant to fund community-based violence prevention, using it instead to bolster local law enforcement and the president’s immigration crackdown.

The initiative, which closed its latest round of grant applications in early November, had helped expand non-law enforcement public safety strategies nationwide and supported communities dealing with the surge in gun violence during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But nonprofits and community organizations can no longer qualify. According to a Justice Department presentation on the grant process, the administration is now prioritizing local governments and giving special preference to applicants that “directly support law enforcement,” including “immigration law enforcement operations.”

‘A Wholesale Shift’

The grant initiative — the Community Based Violence Intervention and Prevention Initiative, known by the acronym CVIPI — began under the Biden administration. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the landmark gun safety law passed in 2022, provided $250 million in federal funding for the initiative, to be spent over five years. Since then, it has distributed nearly $200 million to nonprofits and local governments to invest in community-led safety efforts like street outreach, hospital-based interventions, and violence interrupters.

Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who was the lead Democratic negotiator on the law, warned that diverting the funds threatens progress in reducing violence in recent years. After spiking in 2020 and 2021, homicides have plummeted nationally. Last year, violent crime fell at a record pace, and the United States is on track to close out 2025 with its lowest homicide rate on record. “Lawmakers and law enforcement alike know that community-based organizations understand the root causes of violence in their neighborhoods better than anyone,” Murphy told The Trace. “Now, Trump is trying to undo all of that progress — and the result will be more lives needlessly lost to gun violence.”

Murphy accused the administration of subverting the will of Congress. “When we wrote the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we made it abundantly clear that these funds were meant for the community-based organizations that have proven to be most effective in reducing violence in their communities,” Murphy said. “This attempt by Donald Trump to go around Congress and violate established law is not only outrageous. It’s dangerous.”

Amy Solomon, a former assistant attorney general who oversaw CVIPI under Biden, said the changes also represent a departure from how the Justice Department interpreted Congress’s intent when launching the program. “It’s a wholesale shift,” Solomon said. “Instead of funding the nonprofits that are doing life-saving work on the ground, this excludes community organizations and even says that funds can be used for traditional law enforcement efforts, like hiring new officers or purchasing equipment. It’s not surprising, but it’s stark.”

Over the past decade, the federal government has spent billions on local law enforcement through a program named Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, and other grant initiatives. COPS alone awarded $600 million to local law enforcement agencies in 2024 — 12 times the annual funding dedicated to CVIPI.

For veterans of the violence prevention field, the Trump administration’s shift signals a return to the law enforcement-dominated strategies of the past. “What they have now in place is not CVIPI. It’s just another COPS program,” said Aqeela Sherrills, the executive director of the Community Based Public Safety Collective and a longtime anti-violence advocate. He said he views the administration’s dismantling of the program as political theater rather than a serious safety strategy. “To essentially undermine communities’ role in creating safety,” Sherrills said, “it’s blood on your hands.”

A Justice Department spokesperson said the grant changes were designed to provide law enforcement agencies with adequate resources to “employ a range of strategies” to reduce violence crime. “The Department of Justice is committed to directly supporting law enforcement and victims to further this Administration’s priorities and help improve public safety,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. “Using CVIPI funding, law enforcement will carry out comprehensive crime reduction strategies, actively collaborating with communities through sustained partnerships and engagement.”

It could be weeks before the grants are awarded.

Immigration Enforcement

The new CVIPI agreements appear to require cities and other grant recipients to comply with requests from the Department of Homeland Security. They must agree to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and hand over immigration status information on program participants or people police arrest.

Applicants are also required to certify compliance under penalty of perjury, according to the grant notice. That means local officials would ultimately be responsible if they use the funds to support local nonprofits — and could face criminal charges if those organizations are unwilling or unable to fully comply with the grant’s requirements.

Solomon said the mandates could make communities less safe by severing the fragile ties between residents and authorities. “They may well result in less witness cooperation, lower clearance rates, and higher exposure to violence for vulnerable groups such as survivors of domestic violence,” she said. The policy also ignores established research and data on crime and immigration. “The research is clear that undocumented immigrants have lower — not higher — offending rates than U.S. citizens,” Solomon said.

It’s unclear if the immigration enforcement requirements are legally enforceable, and they could ultimately be struck down in court. During the first Trump administration, judges blocked similar efforts to attach immigration conditions to grants.

This year, there are already legal battles over the Trump administration’s attempts to inject immigration into public safety and crime victims programs. In August, a coalition of attorneys general from 20 states and Washington, D.C., sued after the Justice Department attempted to add a similar immigration requirement to more than $1 billion in crime victim funds. As the lawsuit was pending, the department quietly awarded the funds without the immigration strings attached.

Regardless, major advocacy organizations like Sherrills’s collective are advising partners to stay away from the money entirely. “The CVIPI grant as it stands is not a community-friendly grant,” Sherrills said. “We advised our city partners, our state partners, and our local law enforcement agencies to not apply.”

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb concluded that President Donald Trump’s military takeover in Washington, D.C., violates the Constitution and illegally intrudes on local officials’ authority to direct law enforcement in the district. She put her order on hold for 21 days to allow for an appeal, however.

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to challenge the Guard deployments. He asked the judge to enjoin the White House from deploying Guard troops without the mayor’s consent.

In August, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring a crime emergency in Washington. Within a month, more than 2,300 National Guard troops from eight states and the district were patrolling the city under the command of the Secretary of the Army. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist in patrols.

It’s unclear how long the deployments will last, but attorneys from Schwalb’s office said Guard troops are likely to remain in the city through at least next summer.

“Our constitutional democracy will never be the same if these occupations are permitted to stand,” they wrote.

Government lawyers said Congress empowered the president to control the D.C. National Guard’s operation. They argued that Schwalb’s lawsuit is a frivolous “political stunt” threatening to undermine a successful campaign to reduce violent crime in the district.

“There is no sensible reason for an injunction unwinding this arrangement now, particularly since the District’s claims have no merit,” Justice Department attorneys wrote.

Trump’s Guard deployments have led to other court challenges. On Monday, a federal appeals court suspended an order blocking Trump from taking command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. In September, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration illegally sent Guard troops to the Los Angeles area after days of protests over immigration raids.

In Washington, the Trump administration deputized Guard troops to serve as special U.S. Marshal Service deputies. Schwalb’s office said out-of-state troops are impermissibly operating as a federal military police force in D.C., inflaming tensions with residents and diverting local police resources.

Josh Shapiro ‘s administration said the federal government didn’t identify a single commercial driver’s license issued to someone who wasn’t eligible.
The administration said approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner’s permit or commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania.
His comments came after DHS said it had arrested an Uzbek national with a commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania.
The government shutdown delayed reviews in other states, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards.","The Trump administration threatened Thursday to withhold nearly $75 million in funding if Pennsylvania does not immediately revoke what the administration claims are illegally issued commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants.

The move by U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to target Pennsylvania follows similar action against California. Both states are run by Democratic governors who have criticized President Donald Trump’s administration and who are viewed as potential top-shelf contenders to be the party’s 2028 presidential nominee.

Duffy has made it a priority to scrutinize how the licenses are issued since August, when a tractor-trailer driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. That incident thrust the issue into the public’s consciousness.

In a statement Thursday, DOT spokesperson Danna Almeida said all states were being reviewed.

It’s unclear how many people would be affected in Pennsylvania. In any case, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro ‘s administration said the federal government didn’t identify a single commercial driver’s license issued to someone who wasn’t eligible.

Still, a letter Thursday from the Republican administration to Shapiro cited an audit that found two out of 150 people whose licenses exceeded their lawful presence in the country.

In four cases it had reviewed, the federal government said Pennsylvania provided no evidence that it had required noncitizens to provide legitimate proof that they were legally in the country at the time they got the license.

The Trump administration called on Pennsylvania to stop issuing new, renewed and transferred commercial driver’s licenses and permits, as well as conduct an audit to identify those licenses whose expirations exceed the driver’s lawful stay in the U.S.

It is also asking the state to void noncompliant licenses and remove those drivers from the road. The administration said approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner’s permit or commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania.

The governors of California and Pennsylvania — Gavin Newsom and Shapiro — are tough critics of Trump, and both have been repeated targets of Trump’s administration.

Shapiro’s administration said the state transportation department ceased issuing commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens after the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration published a regulation in late September that would severely limit which immigrants can get one.

A federal court has put the rule on hold for now, but Shapiro’s administration said its transportation department still hasn’t resumed issuing what are called “non-domiciled CDLs.”

Pennsylvania’s transportation department said Thursday that it follows federal rules for verifying an immigrant applicant’s lawful presence in the country by checking the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s database.

But Shapiro this week suggested that DHS was falling short by failing to properly maintain that database, which states use to check an immigrant’s legal status before issuing a driver’s license to a noncitizen.

His comments came after DHS said it had arrested an Uzbek national with a commercial driver’s license issued by Pennsylvania. The man, who had a work authorization granted in 2024, was wanted in his home country for belonging to a terrorist organization, the department said.

But Shapiro said the state transportation department checked the federal database over the summer before issuing a CDL to the man, and he was authorized to get one. The state rechecked the database this week, and it still listed him as qualified to get a CDL, Shapiro said.

“They clearly are not minding the shop, and they’ve gotta get better, because every single state in the country relies on this database when making a determination as to who qualifies for a CDL. We relied on the feds before issuing this one,” Shapiro said.

California, which said it would revoke 17,000 licenses, is the only state the administration has acted against because it was the first one where an audit was completed. The government shutdown delayed reviews in other states, but the Transportation Department is urging all of them to tighten their standards. ___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey, and Levy from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday announced the appointment of two new commissioners and additional staff to the independent commission he created via executive order last month. It is tasked with producing a public record of alleged abuses perpetrated by federal agents during “Operation Midway Blitz.” It will also examine the impact of such conduct on Illinois residents and communities and offer recommendations for accountability and reform.

Pritzker appointed attorney Jimmy Arce, a former federal prosecutor who was involved in the Justice Department’s civil rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department; and Ric Estrada, the CEO of Metropolitan Family Services, which is one the state’s largest human services organizations. Eight commissioners have now been appointed.

“Since I signed the executive order, with guidance from the commissioners, the Illinois Department of Human Rights has been diligently working to set the foundation for this truly ground-breaking work to bring accountability for the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement actions,” Pritzker said. “The appointments of Jimmy and Ric to the Commission round out this incredible team of public servants committed to demanding answers and the ongoing pursuit of justice for the people of Illinois.”

Staff also hired

The commission has also hired Hina Mahood, a former deputy chief of staff at the Department of Human Services who most recently was director of Illinois initiatives for the JB & MK Pritzker Family Foundation, as its executive director.

The commission has also hired two attorneys with plans to hire more support staff in the coming weeks, the governor’s office said.

Pritzker announced the commission’s formation at the height of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement blitz, which the Department of Homeland Security claims — as of last month — resulted in the arrests of more than 3,300 people.

But it also led to violent clashes between federal agents and protesters, often outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview but also during enforcement operations in Chicago neighborhoods. Agents, including U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, often used riot control weapons like tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds.

While DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Capitol News Illinois that the operation is “ongoing,” there is evidence that it quickly wound down last week, with Bovino leaving Chicago for North Carolina and taking many of his agents with him.

And Trump administration lawyers told a federal judge earlier this week that only four detainees were being held in the Broadview facility, a stunning decline from testimony earlier this month of former detainees who described holding rooms stuffed with hundreds of people.

However, the reprieve may be short-lived. The Chicago Sun-Times reported last week that as many as 1,000 agents could hit the streets in March — four times the amount in town over the past two months.

Commission ramping up

The commission will ramp up its operations during the expected lull period.

Commissioners and staff have started outreach efforts, explored community partnerships and are conducting a “landscape analysis” of information already in the public domain to examine the impact of related and ongoing litigation, according to the governor’s office.

But it’s still a work in progress. Pritzker notably encouraged people to document interactions with federal agents by taking videos with their phones. But on the commission’s website, there was still no method to submit such evidence directly to the commission as of Thursday afternoon. Instead, people are encouraged to contact a hotline operated by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, an outside group.

“The commission will provide updates to the public if there are other avenues to share information,” the website states.

Beyond that, the website lists information about the commissioners and executive staff, the language of the executive order that created it, links to news releases about it and links directing people to legal help and information about their rights when interacting with law enforcement.

Pritzker’s executive order also explicitly calls for the commission to hold public hearings to document the conduct of federal officials. But no information is yet available about when those will be held or how members of the public can participate.

The commission has been tasked with providing an initial report on its findings and recommendations to Pritzker no later than Jan. 31.

Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.

Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They’ve also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.

The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, “ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.”

Arrests in Charlotte and the Raleigh area have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods — school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven’t returned after agents showed up at a Charlotte shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn’t target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican American born in Brownsville, Texas.

“We’re only open because I’m an American citizen, so it doesn’t bother me,” he said. “But of course, business is down. I have no customers.”

Just days after beginning the crackdown in North Carolina, Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive in New Orleans by the end of the week to start preparing for their next big operation in southeast Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to head the Louisiana sweep, has been on the ground in North Carolina this week, leading the operation there as well.

Louisiana Republicans voiced their support on Wednesday. The chair of the state party, Derek Babcock, said it shows a commitment from Trump and Republican Gov. Jeff Landry to “keeping our citizens safe.”

The head of the state’s American Civil Liberties Union chapter said they were compiling information to help people know their rights and coordinating with legal services and groups connected with the immigrant community.

“We urge those with privilege and the opportunity to risk it to stand up for their neighbors and friends,” said Alanah Odoms with the ACLU of Louisiana.

Gov. JB Pritzker on Thursday announced the appointment of two new commissioners and additional staff to the independent commission he created via executive order last month. It is tasked with producing a public record of alleged abuses perpetrated by federal agents during “Operation Midway Blitz.” It will also examine the impact of such conduct on Illinois residents and communities and offer recommendations for accountability and reform.

Pritzker appointed attorney Jimmy Arce, a former federal prosecutor who was involved in the Justice Department’s civil rights investigation of the Chicago Police Department; and Ric Estrada, the CEO of Metropolitan Family Services, which is one the state’s largest human services organizations. Eight commissioners have now been appointed.

“Since I signed the executive order, with guidance from the commissioners, the Illinois Department of Human Rights has been diligently working to set the foundation for this truly ground-breaking work to bring accountability for the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement actions,” Pritzker said. “The appointments of Jimmy and Ric to the Commission round out this incredible team of public servants committed to demanding answers and the ongoing pursuit of justice for the people of Illinois.”

Staff also hired

The commission has also hired Hina Mahood, a former deputy chief of staff at the Department of Human Services who most recently was director of Illinois initiatives for the JB & MK Pritzker Family Foundation, as its executive director.

The commission has also hired two attorneys with plans to hire more support staff in the coming weeks, the governor’s office said.

Pritzker announced the commission’s formation at the height of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement blitz, which the Department of Homeland Security claims — as of last month — resulted in the arrests of more than 3,300 people.

But it also led to violent clashes between federal agents and protesters, often outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview but also during enforcement operations in Chicago neighborhoods. Agents, including U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, often used riot control weapons like tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds.

While DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Capitol News Illinois that the operation is “ongoing,” there is evidence that it quickly wound down last week, with Bovino leaving Chicago for North Carolina and taking many of his agents with him.

And Trump administration lawyers told a federal judge earlier this week that only four detainees were being held in the Broadview facility, a stunning decline from testimony earlier this month of former detainees who described holding rooms stuffed with hundreds of people.

However, the reprieve may be short-lived. The Chicago Sun-Times reported last week that as many as 1,000 agents could hit the streets in March — four times the amount in town over the past two months.

Commission ramping up

The commission will ramp up its operations during the expected lull period.

Commissioners and staff have started outreach efforts, explored community partnerships and are conducting a “landscape analysis” of information already in the public domain to examine the impact of related and ongoing litigation, according to the governor’s office.

But it’s still a work in progress. Pritzker notably encouraged people to document interactions with federal agents by taking videos with their phones. But on the commission’s website, there was still no method to submit such evidence directly to the commission as of Thursday afternoon. Instead, people are encouraged to contact a hotline operated by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, an outside group.

“The commission will provide updates to the public if there are other avenues to share information,” the website states.

Beyond that, the website lists information about the commissioners and executive staff, the language of the executive order that created it, links to news releases about it and links directing people to legal help and information about their rights when interacting with law enforcement.

Pritzker’s executive order also explicitly calls for the commission to hold public hearings to document the conduct of federal officials. But no information is yet available about when those will be held or how members of the public can participate.

The commission has been tasked with providing an initial report on its findings and recommendations to Pritzker no later than Jan. 31. A final report will be issued no later than April 30, 2026.

Border Patrol is planning to target New Orleans next, though it's not clear when exactly the operation in Charlotte will end and the New Orleans operation will begin.

U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) announced federal agents had made 250 arrests as of Tuesday evening.

Federal agents have been spotted all over Charlotte this week, making arrests in all parts of the city.

There have been multiple incidents where Border Patrol reportedly apprehended U.S. citizens, including an encounter at the Eastway Crossing shopping center on Tuesday. Multiple witnesses said a man repeatedly insisted he was a U.S. citizen while being detained. Border Patrol also had a presence in the Raleigh area while in North Carolina.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The Israeli military yesterday killed at least 25 Palestinians in Gaza in a series of airstrikes, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The Israeli military said in a statement that several militants had opened fire on its forces near Khan Younis without causing injuries, to which they responded by “striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip.” Israel has killed more than 280 Palestinians since the ceasefire went into effect in October, the Gaza Health Ministry says. Aaron Boxerman reports for the New York Times.

Heavy rain and flooding in Gaza over recent days have resulted in around $4.5 million worth of damage, including 22,0000 tents, spoiled food and medicines, and damage to infrastructure, according to the Hamas-run Gaza government. Haseeb Alwazeer and Nidal Al-Mughrabi report for Reuters.

Israel yesterday asked the International Criminal Court to throw out an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and to disqualify Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan from pursuing the case. In the filing, Israel said Khan’s decision to seek the warrant for Netanyahu in May 2024 may have been an attempt to discourage Khan’s aide from pursuing sexual assault allegations against him or to defend himself later by portraying her allegations as an attempt to derail the investigation of Israel. Matthew Dalton reports for the Wall Street Journal.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

Israel’s expulsion of around 32,000 Palestinians from three refugee camps in the occupied West Bank in early 2025 amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to a report published by Human Rights Watch today. Howard Holler, Pesha Magid, Ammar Awad, Sinan Abu Mayzer, and Mohammad Torokman report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH – CEASEFIRE

The Israeli military yesterday carried out a series of airstrikes in southern Lebanon on what it said were Hezbollah infrastructure, including a weapons storage facility. Israel said that Hezbollah is working to reestablish itself and rebuild its capacity in southern Lebanon, without providing any evidence. Earlier yesterday, an Israeli airstrike on a car in the village of Tiri killed one person and wounded 11, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. Hussein Malla, Bassem Mroue, and Wafaa Shurafa report for AP News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

A U.S.-drafted 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine, negotiated with Russian but not Ukrainian involvement, would require Kyiv to surrender territory, significantly reduce the size of its army, and relinquish some types of weaponry, according to officials. The proposal reflects the Kremlin’s maximalist demands made throughout the war which Ukraine has long stated would amount to capitulation. Andrew E. Kramer and Maria Varenikova report for the New York Times.

EU foreign ministers said today that any plan to end the war in Ukraine must include Ukrainians and Europeans, following the announcement of a U.S. peace proposal. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said, “Ukrainians want peace – a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace… but peace cannot be a capitulation.” EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said, “What we as Europeans have always supported is a long-lasting and just peace, and we welcome efforts to achieve that. Of course, for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.” Andrew Gray, Lili Bayer, Inti Landauro, and Charlotte Van Campenhout report for Reuters.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

A military lawyer for the U.S. Southern Command, who serves as the senior judge advocate general (JAG), disagreed with the Trump administration’s position that the strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels are lawful, according to six sources. The JAG raised his concerns in August before the strikes began, arguing that the strikes against so-called “narco-terrorists” could amount to extrajudicial killings and therefore legally expose service members involved in the operations. His opinion was ultimately overruled by more senior government officials at the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, the sources said. Gordon Lubold, Courtney Kube, and Dan De Luce report for NBC News.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

President Trump yesterday signalled his intention to focus on the humanitarian crisis in Sudan, following his meetings with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, Trump said, “It was not on my charts to be involved in [Sudan]. I thought it was just something that was crazy and out of control. But I just see how important that is to you and to a lot of your friends in the room.” Trump later posted on social media, “Arab leaders from all over the World… have asked me to use the power and influence of the Presidency to bring an immediate halt to what is taking place in Sudan.” Gregory Svirnovskiy reports for POLITICO.

The EU is expected to impose sanctions on Deputy Commander of the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary Abdelrahim Dagalo, three European diplomats said yesterday. EU foreign ministers are set to approve the sanctions today in Brussels. The sanctions consist of a ban on travel to the EU and the seizure of any assets held there. John Irish, Julia Payne, and Andrew Gray report for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Myanmar’s military raided an online scam compound on Tuesday in the town of Shwe Kokko near the Thai border, detaining around 346 foreigners and confiscating nearly 10,000 mobile phones, according to a military spokesperson. AP News reports.

At COP30, a group of nations, including Sierra Leone, Sudan and Malawi, are urging a U.N. agreement to triple annual climate adaptation funding to $120 billion. Sara Schonhardt reports for POLITICO.

Iran yesterday released a Marshall-Islands-flagged tanker with all its 21 crew members, several days after Tehran seized the ship without explanation, according to the vessel’s manager. Cyprus-based Colombia Shipmanagement said the crew “are safe and in good spirits,” adding that “no allegations were made against the vessel, her crew and the vessel’s managers and owners.” Jon Gambrell reports for AP News.

Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has “suspend[ed] his departure” to the G20 summit in South Africa, following the abduction of 24 schoolgirls in Kebbi State and a gunman attack that killed two people in a church. It is unclear when Tinubo plans to travel or if he will attend the summit at all. Tunde Omolehin and Dyepkazak Shibayan report for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

The EU Commission yesterday unveiled its proposal for changes to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act. The package, known as the Digital Omnibus, would weaken data protection rules by delaying when regulations governing high-risk AI systems take effect and allowing companies to use personal data for AI training without prior consent. If approved, the changes will strip Europeans of data privacy protections that have long been the toughest in the world. Suzanne Smalley reports for The Record.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Trump administration may not level long-promised semiconductor tariffs any time soon, according to U.S. officials. Officials relayed this message to stakeholders in government and private industry, three sources said. A fourth source said the administration was taking a more cautious approach to avoid provoking China. The White House insists that the administration “remains committed to using every level of executive power to reshore the manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security,” adding that any sources suggesting otherwise “are simply Fake News.” Laurie Chen, Trevor Hunnicutt, and Jeffrey Dastin report for Reuters.

The Commerce Department announced yesterday that it has authorized the sale of up to 70,000 of Nvidia’s advanced AI chips to two companies based in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Robbie Whelan and Amrith Ramkumar report for the Wall Street Journal.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A federal judge yesterday questioned prosecutors in a hearing that was held to consider the issue of whether criminal charges brought against former FBI Director James Comey were an act of vindictive retribution by Trump. The Justice Department admitted that acting U.S. Attorney Lindsay Halligan had failed to show the revised indictment in Comey’s case to all of the grand jurors; only the foreperson formally approved the second charging document. Alan Feuer and Devlin Barrett report for the New York Times.

The Justice Department yesterday charged Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-FL) with stealing $5 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, further alleging that she used a substantial portion of the money to support her campaign for Congress in 2021. Aaron Pellish reports for POLITICO.

Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) said on Tuesday that he will ask the Supreme Court to review a lower court’s ruling striking down Texas’s new congressional map. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

U.S. Border Patrol is running a predictive-intelligence program that monitors millions of U.S. drivers nationwide in a secretive program to identify and detain people whose travel patterns it deems suspicious, an AP News investigation has found. Byron Tau and Garance Burke report.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump yesterday announced that he signed legislation calling on the Justice Department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days. The bill contains significant exceptions, including a provision protecting ongoing investigations, which could mean many documents would stay confidential. The DOJ may also withhold records that identify victims or include images of child sexual abuse, or are otherwise classified. Luke Broadwater reports for the New York Times.

The White House is preparing to issue an executive order as soon as Friday that enlists the power of the federal government to block states from regulating artificial intelligence, according to four sources and a leaked draft obtained by POLITICO. The draft document would launch several efforts to challenge state AI laws, including an “AI Litigation Task Force.” Brendan Bordelon and Christine Mui report.

Trump on Tuesday nominated Stuart Levenbach, a top aide to the Office of Management and Budget Director, Russell Vought, to be the permanent head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to congressional records. A CFPB spokesperson said the nomination was a technical maneuver intended to extend Vought’s ability to continue serving as the acting director of the agency without needing Senate confirmation. Michael Stratford reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal appeals court yesterday issued a stay on a lower-court judge’s preliminary injunction limiting how federal immigration agents could use force in Illinois. The panel described the restrictions imposed by the district court as “overbroad” and “too prescriptive.” However, the panel also cautioned against overreading their order, adding “our concerns about the substantial overbreadth of the district court’s injunction lead us to stay it pending appeal, which we will expedite. But we have not concluded that preliminary relief is precluded.” The panel left open the possibility that the findings of the lower court “may support entry of a more tailored and appropriate preliminary injunction that directly addresses the First and Fourth amendment claims raised by the plaintiffs.” Mitch Smith reports for the New York Times.

A federal judge yesterday blocked the Trump administration from ending temporary protected status and work permits for more than 6,100 Syrians while a legal challenge proceeds, ruling that the abrupt termination likely violated legal procedures and was potentially politically influenced. Daniel Wiessner reports for Reuters.

A federal judge said yesterday that he plans to move ahead with criminal contempt proceedings against Trump administration officials who authorized deportation flights to land in El Salvador in March even after the judge ordered them to turn the planes around. The judge said he can now proceed with the contempt proceedings after the appellate court lifted the hold on his case last week.

The operation that began over the weekend is the latest phase of Republican President Donald Trump’s aggressive mass deportation efforts that have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities — from Chicago to Los Angeles.

Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000.

Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October.

Smaller bursts of enforcement have popped up elsewhere.

The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday, spreading fear in at least one immigrant-heavy suburb.

Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said via the social platform X that “border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended” in the city. DHS did not announce a change to its presence and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond during what the government has dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web” was about double the total announced by DHS officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies “continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.”

Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.

Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They’ve also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.

The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, “ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.”

Arrests in Charlotte and the Raleigh area have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods — school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven’t returned after agents showed up at a Charlotte shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn’t target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican American born in Brownsville, Texas.

“We’re only open because I’m an American citizen, so it doesn’t bother me,” he said. “But of course, business is down. I have no customers.”

Just days after beginning the crackdown in North Carolina, Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive in New Orleans by the end of the week to start preparing for their next big operation in southeast Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to head the Louisiana sweep, has been on the ground in North Carolina this week, leading the operation there as well.

Louisiana Republicans voiced their support on Wednesday. The chair of the state party, Derek Babcock, said it shows a commitment from Trump and Republican Gov. Jeff Landry to “keeping our citizens safe.”

The head of the state’s American Civil Liberties Union chapter said they were compiling information to help people know their rights and coordinating with legal services and groups connected with the immigrant community.

Virginia Beach police said John W. Bennett, 54, and Mark B. Bennett, 59, were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit malicious wounding.

John Bennett is employed as an assistant principal at Kempsville High School. A spokesperson for Virginia Beach City Public Schools said he has worked for the division since 2009 and is currently on leave.

He was arrested in Virginia Beach at 10:47 a.m. Wednesday. On the same morning, Nov. 19, Mark Bennett was taken into custody at Norfolk International Airport at 9:42 a.m. with help from airport police.

According to a criminal complaint filed in Virginia Beach General District Court, an off-duty Norfolk police officer overheard the two brothers while dining inside a Pho restaurant on General Booth Boulevard on Nov. 15.

The officer reported hearing the men talk about ICE agents “kidnapping individuals” and said the conversation led him to believe the brothers “needed to do something about it.”

The complaint says the brothers discussed reuniting and that Mark Bennett said he planned to fly to Las Vegas to meet with “like-minded individuals” and return with “enforcement ideas and plans.”

Mark also allegedly said he had recently purchased an assault rifle because it could fire explosive rounds capable of penetrating body armor — and claimed he wanted to “go hunting.” Investigators wrote that John Bennett expressed support during the conversation and showed interest in joining the Las Vegas trip.

The off-duty officer told investigators that Mark Bennett disclosed he had purchased a plane ticket for Nov. 19. Detectives later confirmed the booking.

Following an arraignment on Thursday, both were granted bond.

“These allegations of violence against law enforcement, the very ones who protect and serve our communities, are incredibly alarming,” said VBPD Chief Paul W.

""The operation is not over and it is not ending anytime soon,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) will not participate in immigration enforcement actions with ICE. They will adhere to House Bill 218, releasing individuals in their custody to ICE within the required two-day period.

Sheriff McFadden emphasized, ""We will continue to build relationships, mend bridges, and listen to the voices of everyone in our community.

I will continue to protect this city and every single one of its citizens.""

Federal agents have arrested over 250 people during a North Carolina immigration crackdown centered around Charlotte, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday.

The operation, which began over the weekend, is part of Republican President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts, involving the deployment of military and immigration agents to Democratic-run cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles.

Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October. Smaller bursts of enforcement have popped up elsewhere.

The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday, spreading fear in at least one immigrant-heavy suburb.

Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said via the social platform X that ""border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended"" in the city. DHS did not announce a change to its presence and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond during what the government has dubbed ""Operation Charlotte's Web"" was about double the total announced by DHS officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies ""continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.""

Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.

Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.

The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, ""ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.""

Arrests in Charlotte and the Raleigh area have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods - school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven't returned after agents showed up at a Charlotte shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn't target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican American born in Brownsville, Texas.

""We're only open because I'm an American citizen, so it doesn't bother me,"" he said. ""But of course, business is down. I have no customers.""

Just days after beginning the crackdown in North Carolina, Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive in New Orleans by the end of the week to start preparing for their next big operation in southeast Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

The agricultural industry is feeling the strain from President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, and Republican lawmakers are certainly hearing about it back home.

What elected officials will do about farmers’ frustrations is much less clear — an indication that relief could be far away.

“Members are beginning to talk about it, but it doesn’t feel as though a particular solution is coming into focus yet, and clearly the White House is going to be the most important player in these conversations,” said Rep. Dusty Johnson, who sits on the House Agriculture Committee.

Ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in agricultural centers, from California to Wisconsin to New York, have increased pressure on members of Congress to provide fixes for farmers who say they are facing labor shortages.

In Wisconsin, for example, a 2023 University of Wisconsin study found that 70% of labor on the state’s dairy farms was done by undocumented workers. Many of those farmers have turned to existing temporary visas — like the H-2A visa, a seasonal agricultural visa — to staff their farms. The Trump administration moved to strip back labor protections for farmers hiring workers on the visa earlier this year, in an effort to streamline H-2A visas.

But those visas are inherently limited for year-round work, like at dairy farms.

The program is also associated with high costs and a slow-moving bureaucracy. Democrats and immigrant advocates said the administration’s move put workers at risk of abuse and exploitation. Approximately 17% of agricultural workers have an H-2A visa.

There are currently several proposed reforms floating around the Capitol.

A bipartisan bill introduced in May by Reps. Dan Newhouse and Zoe Lofgren proposes streamlining the H-2A visa process and providing visas for year-round agricultural employers.

Wisconsin Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden has proposed legislation that would allow undocumented farmworkers to gain legal employment status, as long as they haven’t committed a crime. Both immigrants and their employers would be required to acknowledge the worker’s status and pay a fine.

“We got to understand, at this point these people are our neighbors. Our kids go to school together, and they’re part of our communities,” Van Orden said. “I don’t want these people having to hide underneath a trailer when immigration shows up.”

Van Orden’s bill has no co-sponsors.

Lawmakers formed a task force in 2023 to consider possible reforms to the H-2A visa program and improve the industry’s reliable labor shortage.

The Republican-majority House Committee on Agriculture has readied a bill that largely follows task force recommendations — which include proposals to streamline administrative paperwork, expedite application review by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and change the wage system — to overhaul the H-2A program.

Committee chair Rep. Glenn Thompson said the bill is awaiting “technical assistance” from the Department of Labor. That final step had been delayed by shutdown furloughs, he said. The Department of Labor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“We’re very close to introducing a very strong, I’ll call it a tripartisan bill, because that includes Republicans, Democrats and individuals from the industry,” Thompson said.

The bill draft is expected to be ready for public review by early January.

Rep. Salud Carbajal, a Democrat on the agriculture committee, however, says he hasn’t heard from his Republican colleagues or the White House on the issue.

“There’s been no communication from my colleagues on the other side and from this administration,” he said.

Republicans say the White House is engaged on the issue. Thompson told NOTUS that he’s been in “frequent discussions” with the White House and the Department of Agriculture about immigrant farmworkers.

Rep. Doug LaMalfa, who also sits on the House Agriculture Committee, said the White House is “in the mood here to engage” on farmworker visas.

“A while back, the president acknowledged in a speech that we got to up the game on having more and simpler processes for having farm workers available. I know we feel that in California with our specialty crops,” LaMalfa said.

Trump in June suggested that farms would get a pass in the deportation crackdown — a statement that senior administration officials seemed to disagree with.

Immigration advocates haven’t been happy with the administration’s visa policy changes thus far.

Alexandra Sossa, the chief executive officer with the Farmworker and Landscaper Advocacy Project, said that her organization is “not in favor” of the H-2A visa program, which it associates with “human labor trafficking and labor exploitation.”

And now, with the ongoing immigration raids, she says, farmworkers who are brought to the country under the visa program fear deportation, and those who are considering coming under the program are apprehensive about doing so.

“We are talking about workers who wake up at 4 a.m. in the morning and start working at 5 a.m. and end working around 9 to 10 p.m., Monday to Sunday. So that’s not easy to find, and it’s a difficult job to do. The consequences on the economy are reflected when you go to the grocery store to buy food,” Sossa said.

Democrats, meanwhile, are calling for larger immigration reform to address the dangerous working conditions that the H-2A program has led to, while also giving a bigger pathway to work.

“When people are exploited, we’ve got to crack down on that,” Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat on the House Committee on Agriculture, said about the concerns regarding H-2A visas. “But I just think the climate that’s been created by this administration makes it difficult for some Republicans to even want to talk about the issue.”

“I hear from farmers all the time about concerns that their labor force will disappear, or that they can’t count on workers,” McGovern said.",https://i0.wp.com/wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/asse2Q1A0071-copy.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&quality=100&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-20 14:57:28.488466

In those offices, probation officers handle an average of at least 65 cases annually, according to TDOC data.
During that probation period, the probation department got a call from an ex-girlfriend and Williams’ mother saying that he was physically abusing them and threatening their lives.
Probation experts said this practice of stopping in-person probation supervision once a violation warrant has been issued is not uncommon.
In some states, probation officers are able to serve violation warrants and arrest probationers themselves.","Peebles asked the probation manager if Horton could be arrested when he came in for a court date the next day. Horton’s probation file shows the manager said she would try to help.

But Horton never showed up to court, according to his probation file, and Nashville police didn’t arrest him until it was too late.

Ten days after that call, probation and police records show, Horton waited for Peebles outside her apartment. Khloe told WPLN she remembers seeing Horton pointing a gun at her mom. She remembers throwing her arms around his legs and pleading with him, “no, no, no.” She remembers trying to call 911 while her mom, shot in both legs, lay in the street bleeding to death.

Horton is now awaiting trial on charges of killing Peebles. He and his lawyer declined to comment for this story. The case file is sealed and the public defender’s office declined to comment further on whether Horton has entered a plea.

Throughout the period when Peebles reported he was threatening and hurting her, Horton was released repeatedly into the community under the stipulation that probation officers would be actively supervising him. But in Tennessee, a state with one of the highest rates of women killed by men, WPLN and ProPublica found that a deadly blind spot in the probation supervision system emerges at a time when experts say domestic violence victims are particularly vulnerable.

When an offender under probation supervision violates the rules by being charged with a new crime or being found with a firearm, for example, a warrant may be issued for their arrest. When law enforcement serves that warrant, the offender can either end up behind bars or back out on probation while awaiting a court date.

But between the time a probation violation warrant is signed by a judge and when it is served, probation officers stop conducting any in-person supervision: For a high-risk offender, this means probation officers are no longer holding three in-person meetings per month; they also no longer conduct a monthly unannounced home visit to look for drugs and guns. That period of suspended face-to-face checks can stretch for months — in one instance, for more than 400 days.

In Horton’s case, he remained free, armed and dangerous for three months.

That pause of in-person supervision is spelled out in the Tennessee Department of Correction’s standards of supervision. Between 2019 and 2022, WPLN and ProPublica found at least six people, including Peebles, were shot to death during the gap in oversight. All were young Black mothers, ages 20 to 31. One victim was a cheerleading coach and a mom of two. Another woman was shot while her 2-year-old daughter lay on the bed nearby. In a third case, a mother of three was found in a creek days before Christmas with a purple domestic violence bracelet around her wrist. Their deaths left 12 children without their mothers.

TDOC declined to make any probation officials available for this story. In an emailed statement, Sarah Gallagher, a department spokesperson, said that “supervision remains active” for offenders who have warrants but “the objective changes.” Instead of ensuring offenders are abiding by the rules of probation, she said, officers help to bring that person into custody by sharing relevant case information with law enforcement. Gallagher confirmed there is no in-person supervision during that time.

This blind spot is one of the ways that the state failed to stop offenders from harming domestic violence victims. WPLN and ProPublica examined hundreds of fatal domestic violence shootings between 2007 and 2023 in Tennessee’s five most populous cities. The reporting, which expanded on our earlier investigations into Tennessee’s lax enforcement of gun prohibitions, found that among these fatal domestic violence shootings, at least 86 people — about 1 in every 4 — were allegedly killed by a suspect who was legally prohibited from having a firearm. Sixteen of those suspects were also on probation. In a Second Amendment-friendly state like Tennessee where laws make it easy for more people to carry firearms in more places, little can stop a person intent on getting a gun, even if they are legally barred from doing so. One backstop is the state’s probation officers, who are in close contact with violent, high-risk offenders and can search homes for prohibited weapons without a warrant if they have “reasonable suspicion,” TDOC said.

According to the department’s own documents, a probation officer’s mission is to ensure public safety. In cases where there is an open warrant, the department relies on law enforcement to prioritize the arrests of probation violators and on judges to incarcerate repeat violators instead of releasing them back into supervision and the community. The result: Some offenders like Horton return to the street.

“The system did her wrong,” Peebles’ mom, Karen Peebles, said. “If the police department had did their job, and the probation office had did theirs — I think it could have been prevented.”

“The Red Flags”

Peebles’s friends and family called her Chippie because she had a high, singsongy voice, like a chipmunk. She was loud, funny and always smiling. Almost every night, Peebles talked to her mom on the phone, and she never missed a Sunday dinner.

Her family said she started dating Horton around 2018, giving in after he had pursued her for years. She was hesitant, in part because of his criminal history. Horton had just started 10 years of supervised probation after he pleaded guilty to facilitation of second-degree murder in a robbery where a man was shot and killed.

“Even when she saw the red flags, she would just try anything in her power to try to make him better,” her cousin Princess Pinkston said. “She felt like she could save everybody.”

The probation department classified Horton as a high-risk violent probationer, which meant that every month his probation officer was required to see him face-to-face three times, conduct a home visit and check to make sure he hadn’t been arrested. This kind of supervision is more intensive and time-consuming than what low-risk offenders get.

In some probation departments across the country, probation officers are assigned either high-, medium- or low-risk offenders. Experts say this allows specialized teams to focus on intense monitoring of a smaller caseload of high-risk offenders, while lower-risk probationers are left to newer officers.

“It’s like the medical profession,” said Susan Rice, former president of the American Probation and Parole Association. “If you’re a specialist doctor and you do only the high-risk heart surgeries, you’re not going to have as many clients as a general practitioner who sees everybody that comes in with a runny nose.”

But in Tennessee, officers handle a mix of high-, medium- and low-risk offenders. And Tennessee’s probation offices do not have specialized domestic violence teams or training. A report from victim advocates more than a decade ago said these changes could save lives in the most dangerous cases. “This report should be viewed as a guide for where to begin changing policy,” the report reads, “and by doing so, ultimately reduce the occurrence of domestic violence homicides in Nashville-Davidson County.”

Rice said it is common practice nationwide to have mixed caseloads in probation departments. In an email, TDOC said the same, adding that all officers are “trained in areas like situational awareness and de-escalation techniques to identify warning signs and manage conflict.”

Most of the 16 alleged suspects who WPLN and ProPublica found were both prohibited from having a gun and under supervision by the probation department were deemed high or moderate risks by TDOC.

In addition, all 16 were under supervision in Memphis or Nashville, the state’s busiest offices. In those offices, probation officers handle an average of at least 65 cases annually, according to TDOC data.

Horton was assigned to the Nashville office, eventually coming under the supervision of probation officer Derrick Finch, who had been on the job a little more than a year at the time. Finch told WPLN that at one point he had more than 100 offenders in his caseload. Records show the department fired him in 2024 after seven years on the job for reporting that he conducted a home visit with an offender who was in custody at that time. Finch said he thought he had conducted the visit when he was entering his case notes at the end of the month.

“I got let go because I couldn’t keep up with the caseload anymore,” Finch explained in an interview with WPLN.

By early January of 2019, Horton had been on probation for about a year. His relationship with Peebles was fracturing and she was referring to him as her ex in court records. She joined her own family dinners less frequently, and when she did show up, her mom said, something was always off. She would wear long-sleeved shirts, even in the middle of sweltering Tennessee summers. Once she arrived on crutches, claiming she had fallen down the stairs. Another time she had a black eye, and told her family that a door had swung back and hit her.

Multiple studies have shown that the most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim is when they are trying to leave their abuser, often turning to the courts and law enforcement for protection.

But the case notes in Horton’s probation file seem to only scratch the surface of what her family suspected was happening behind closed doors. The case notes show Finch ticking through a standardized assessment of Horton’s progress, noting his body language, behavior and next steps. “Offender reported as directed.”

“Offender was calm, alert and oriented.”

“Offender seeking full-time employment at this time.”

“Offender advises he is in process of moving in with his mother.”

“Will advise offender next report date.”

Finch said the department wants officers to have a rapport with the offenders they are supervising, “but who’s got time for that? It’s very hard to do everything they want you to do, because there’s so much to do.”

He said when a “problem child” arose in his caseload, there was not much he could do about it.

“If this guy wants to change, we can help him,” Finch said of probationers. “But if he doesn’t — which unfortunately is the case with too many of them — what do you do?”

“A Slap on the Wrist”

In a court document, Peebles alleged that on Jan. 12, 2019, Horton went on Facebook Live and said he would kill her before he saw her with another man. He called her multiple times, she wrote, then showed up at her house, blocking her car with his. They started arguing. He punched her twice in the head. She ran to her car to escape and he chased her, she wrote. He tore the windshield wipers off of her car and used them to strike the glass as she cowered inside the locked vehicle. Horton fled when she called police.

What followed was a string of actions by probation officers, law enforcement and the courts that left Horton free and Peebles afraid.

The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department filed a domestic assault charge against Horton. MNPD arrested Horton and searched his home for weapons, according to probation records. He paid a bond to get out of jail while awaiting his court date.

According to TDOC policy, Horton’s arrest on suspicion of domestic assault required Finch to file a report and request a warrant for a probation violation.

That policy says that warrants for violations posing “an immediate and/or imminent threat to public safety” should be requested “as soon as possible.” Finch submitted a violation warrant to his supervisor and requested a judge sign it on Jan. 22, 2019, according to probation records.

Once a judge signed it, the warrant was sent to police, who arrested Horton two days later. But at a court hearing, Peebles failed to appear to testify on the assault charge and the case was dismissed. Her mom said that Peebles did not show up because she was afraid, and that Horton had threatened her if she pursued charges.

“The victim, more frequently than not, is the evidence,” Christina Johnson, a domestic violence prosecutor with the Nashville district attorney’s office, said. “If the evidence isn’t there, we have no choice, we can’t go forward.”

For this reason, the Nashville Office of Family Safety has called for the district attorney’s office to rely more on evidence such as 911 calls, body camera footage or forensic exams instead of just victim testimony.

Once the assault charge against Horton was dropped, the probation violation that was based on those charges was dismissed. Horton remained in the community under Finch’s supervision.

And it didn’t take long before the process started all over again.

On Jan. 28, 2019, Horton was arrested in nearby Marshall County. Law enforcement officers reported finding four bags of a white substance believed to be cocaine on him, as well as a stolen Glock 26 9 mm handgun.

Being arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with the intent to sell is a probation violation, as is being a felon in possession of firearms.

So, records show, Finch requested another probation violation warrant to bring Horton in front of a judge. Horton was arrested and released on bond the next day.

Despite Horton’s status as a high-risk offender, his multiple arrests in a month and his possession of a prohibited firearm, Judge Jennifer Smith returned Horton to probation supervision instead of incarcerating him. In a statement to WPLN, Smith said she cannot comment on previous decisions.

In at least two other domestic violence gun homicide cases in 2021 a probationer was caught with a gun prior to the shooting — even though they were prohibited from having a firearm because of a prior conviction and because they were on probation. As with Horton, judges did not revoke their probation for being found with a gun.

“There are people who are telling us over and over again with their actions that they have no desire to change,” said Becky Bullard, deputy director of programs at Nashville’s Office of Family Safety, about abusers on probation who continue to perpetuate harm. “And when someone is waving that flag to us to say, ‘Hey, I’m out here practicing all of these high-risk behaviors with someone I’m supposed to care about,’ that is someone raising their hand and telling us that they’re about to murder.”

Shari Bryant was a Nashville probation officer from 2020 to 2025, and she said she left the job to become an accountant. She said it was common for someone to continuously violate probation with few consequences. Even in these high-risk, violent cases.

In one of the case files TDOC provided in response to WPLN and ProPublica’s record requests, a Memphis offender named Torian Williams was sentenced to probation for aggravated assault and reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon. He was classified as a medium risk and charged while on probation for having two guns. He would go on to shoot and kill his 20-year-old girlfriend Demya Gordon in 2021. For that crime, he took a plea deal for a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and was released to probation again. During that probation period, the probation department got a call from an ex-girlfriend and Williams’ mother saying that he was physically abusing them and threatening their lives. Williams died in 2025.

“Obviously, they’re not learning their lessons, right? They just keep getting a slap on the wrist,” Bryant said. “They keep getting out and getting away with it.”

That revolving door allowed Horton to remain on probation and return to the street again.

“He Is Going to Kill Me”

Months before she was killed, Peebles was in the bedroom of her apartment when she heard a loud boom at the back door. It was a stormy summer night, July 13, 2019.

“I got up walked to the door seen Brandon with a gun,” she wrote in a court document. He pointed the gun at her, and she ran out of her apartment. A neighbor later told the court that she was awakened by gunshots that went through her roof, her walls and her mirror. The neighbor, peeking through the blinds, saw Horton running with a gun in his hand. A few moments later, she saw Peebles climbing down a tree.

When police arrived, they could not find Horton. Metro Nashville Police Department charged him with felon in possession of a weapon, aggravated assault and aggravated burglary. And, for the third time in less than a year, Finch requested a probation violation warrant for Horton’s arrest.

Then, as is spelled out in TDOC’s standards of supervision, Finch stopped supervising Horton in person until police could arrest him. In the past, police served the warrant in a matter of days. This time, it would take three months for the police to catch up with Horton. For those three months, all that was required of Finch was a once-a-month check for arrests in the computer system. Police would not arrest Horton until after he allegedly killed Peebles. He has been behind bars ever since.

Probation experts said this practice of stopping in-person probation supervision once a violation warrant has been issued is not uncommon.

“It’s kind of a messed-up process,” said Rice of the American Probation and Parole Association. “Do we really want that period of supervision to stop if they’re not incarcerated during that time?”

In the six cases of domestic violence homicide that occurred during this supervision gap, WPLN and ProPublica found the time between when a warrant was issued and when police made an arrest stretched from as few as nine days to as many as 425 days. In all six cases, the alleged offender was put on probation for a gun-related offense. In some states, probation officers are able to serve violation warrants and arrest probationers themselves. But in Tennessee, officers must contact law enforcement. TDOC said while probation officers cannot make arrests themselves, they work with local, state and federal law enforcement, sharing information such as “addresses, photographs, known associates, and other leads” to assist in locating the offender.

When asked why it took so long to serve warrants in cases like Horton’s, the Metro Nashville Police Department said that “wanted persons frequently change where they stay or leave town and they are often difficult to locate.” MNPD said it works closely with probation officers to serve offenders if they continue to come in for office visits or when they show up for their court dates.

MNPD said it has one documented attempt to serve Horton’s violation warrant between the time it was issued in July and Oct. 17, when Peebles was killed. That attempt was on Oct. 9. Police said no one answered the door at Horton’s address.

Peebles requested another protection order against Horton in October 2019. Obtained by WPLN and ProPublica. Highlighted by ProPublica.

“Detectives spend their days researching people with outstanding warrants so they can arrest them,” said Debra Fessenden, chief policy adviser with the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office, an agency that handles warrants for Memphis. “No one is ignoring the warrants.”

She said that not all intelligence leads to a timely arrest.

“It’s not unusual — because of resources, training and protocol — that law enforcement decides, ‘We’ll just serve this when we pull someone over’” for a traffic stop, said Julia Weber, a California-based expert who trains law enforcement and probation departments on dangerous domestic violence cases.

“What I tell communities is we have to recognize how dangerous a decision that is.”

In her final days, records show that Peebles was increasingly aware of how much danger she was in.

She had already called the probation department once for help getting Horton’s warrant served at his Marshall County court date. Days later, on Oct. 11, she called again to say that Horton had failed to appear in court “because he spoke to officer finch and was told that he would be taken into custody at that time on his warrant,” the probation file notes. The manager wrote that Peebles was upset and that Horton was threatening to hurt her.

In an interview with WPLN, Finch denied warning Horton.

“Everything that could have been done was done from our end,” Finch said. “Once that warrant is filed, there is nothing else that we can do.”

Six days after Peebles’ final call to the probation department, Horton allegedly shot and killed her outside of her apartment while her daughter, Khloe, struggled to call for help. Horton was arrested the next morning, and Smith, the judge who had allowed his release, later revoked his probation.

“Chippie should be here with her child, with her mom,” said Pinkston, Peebles’ cousin. “She had told you many times, ‘No, he’s serious. He is going to kill me.’ … Now it’s too late.”

Khloe is in high school now. For a long time after her mom died, Khloe said, she heard the gunshots in her sleep. She lives in her mom’s childhood bedroom to feel closer to her.

She’s starting to fully understand the ways the system did not protect her mom from Horton. But the 14-year-old says she has lived each day since her mom’s death struggling with a guilt she cannot shake.

“I always felt like her death was on me,” Khloe said, remembering how she had forgotten her phone in the kitchen that day, so they returned to the apartment to get it. “If we would never went back to that house … maybe she would have still been here.”

New York state Sen. Lea Webb (D) said she was “deeply troubled” by the cancellations.","SYRACUSE, N.Y. (WSYR) — The Trump administration will no longer allow New York county courts or state supreme court justices to preside over citizenship ceremonies and has canceled many swearings-in already scheduled upstate.

In recent days, Nexstar’s WSYR has learned of naturalization ceremonies being canceled by the federal government without explanation across several New York counties.

Matthew Tragesser, spokesperson for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), offered the following explanation to WSYR:

“USCIS is dedicated to ensuring that all aspects of the naturalization process comply with federal law. After reviewing the jurisdiction of certain New York county courts under the Immigration and Nationality Act, we have determined that these courts do not meet the statutory requirements to conduct naturalization ceremonies. As a result, USCIS will transition from judicial to administrative ceremonies to ensure compliance with the law. Aliens scheduled for ceremonies at these courts will be rescheduled, and their naturalization process will continue.”

Onondaga County Clerk Emily Bersani confirmed that the ceremony she had planned for Wednesday was canceled without specific reasoning. She hasn’t been informed about the status of ceremonies planned for 2026, including the annual New Americans Day event at the New York State Fair.

In general, a judge presides over New York ceremonies in a courthouse. USCIS conducts administrative ceremonies in regional offices.

It’s unclear what impact the change will have on naturalization ceremonies typically held in federal courtrooms, as is customary at the Federal Building in Downtown Syracuse.

The federal court’s Northern District of New York has multiple scheduled ceremonies still listed on its website. A spokesperson for the district said Wednesday the ceremonies were still being planned.

New York state Sen. Lea Webb (D) said she was “deeply troubled” by the cancellations.

“These milestones honor the commitment of families who have spent years legally navigating our immigration system to affirm their place in the country and state. The decision to halt or obstruct these events is unacceptable and undermines the process for citizenship and the values of fairness and opportunity for our communities,” Webb said. “We need the full restoration of naturalization ceremonies so that our state can continue to welcome new citizens with dignity and respect.”

State Sen. Chris Ryan (D) added that the move is “deeply concerning” and feels “unpatriotic.” In a lengthy response, Ryan said he had attended multiple naturalization ceremonies in 2025 in which he witnessed immigrants being “moved to tears” after earning their citizenship through hard work and while maneuvering the complex legal system.

“While maintaining secure borders is important, discouraging immigrants from becoming lawful U.S. citizens runs counter to our nation’s values,” Ryan said. “I strongly urge the USCIS and the Federal Administration to reconsider their decision and resume naturalization ceremonies in Upstate New York.”

New York Attorney General Letitia James, in a letter to USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, demanded answers regarding the cancellations, which she said were reported in Broome, Onondaga, Rockland, Schenectady, Tompkins, Washington and Westchester counties. She further noted that the move had raised alarm among both Democratic and Republican state officials.

One such Republican, Binghamton Mayor Jared Kraham, relayed his disappointment in a Facebook post, saying “the Trump administration’s handling of immigration matters continues to raise concerns.” He also called on the USCIS to restore and reschedule the canceled ceremonies.

“The individuals who were days away from taking their oath of citizenship deserve the chance to complete that journey,” Kraham wrote. “Any further delay means playing politics with people’s lives.”

SCOTUS Quick Hits

Former Justice Stephen Breyer is scheduled to speak to students at Suffolk University in Boston this morning. The event is closed to the public.

Tomorrow, the justices will take part in a private conference, where they will discuss cases and vote on petitions for review.

Mark your calendars: SCOTUSblog will be hosting a live blog during the oral argument in Trump v. Slaughter on Monday, Dec. 8. The live blog will begin at 9:30 a.m. EST.

Morning Reads

Opposition to tariffs is widespread but few Americans expect the Supreme Court to strike them down (Taylor Orth, YouGov) — A new survey from YouGov investigated how Americans view trade and the Supreme Court case on President Donald Trump’s signature tariffs. The survey showed that more Americans expect the court to “allow Trump’s tariffs to stand than expect it will strike them down (42% vs. 25%).” There was a partisan gap on this question, with 34% of Democrats saying that the court “probably will strike down Trump’s tariffs” compared to 18% of Republicans.

Appeals court panel rejects Trump’s ‘Big Lie’ defamation lawsuit against CNN (Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein, Politico) — On Tuesday, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit held that Trump’s defamation lawsuit against CNN cannot continue because CNN’s challenged behavior is protected by the First Amendment. Trump had been seeking to hold the network accountable for using the phrase “Big Lie,” which is “often associated with Adolf Hitler,” in coverage of his “false claims of fraud in the 2020 election,” according to Politico. “Trump could ask the full bench of the 11th Circuit to rehear the case or appeal to the Supreme Court. A spokesperson for Trump’s legal team signaled the president would appeal, saying he ‘will pursue this case against CNN to its just and deserved conclusion.'”

Trump administration prevails in appeal over tear gas tactics in Chicago (Diana Novak Jones, Reuters) — The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit on Tuesday “blocked a judge’s order that had restricted how ICE agents could use tear gas and other weapons on people protesting immigration crackdowns in Chicago,” according to Reuters. The pause is in effect at least until the court “more fully review[s]” the order, which, according to the Trump administration, led to impermissible micromanagement of federal law enforcement officers. This dispute over the activities of federal immigration agents is taking place as the Supreme Court considers whether Trump can deploy the National Guard to Chicago.

Texas judge temporarily blocks law requiring Ten Commandments in schools (Michelle Watson, CNN) — On Tuesday, a federal judge in Texas “issued a preliminary injunction requiring certain Texas public school districts to remove displays of the Ten Commandments,” holding that the displays violate the First Amendment’s establishment clause, according to CNN. “It is the latest victory in a series of legal challenges to laws requiring public schools to display the Ten Commandments” in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. “Legal experts have said it’s likely the cases will eventually reach the US Supreme Court.”

Just Announced: ‘Heroes of 1776’ by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch (Iyana Jones, Publishers Weekly) — Last week, Justice Neil Gorsuch announced that he’s working on a children’s book about the Declaration of Independence during an interview with Fox News. On Tuesday, Publishers Weekly shared more details about the project. “Heroes of 1776: The Story of the Declaration of Independence will cover many influential figures in the creation of the founding document, ranging from George Washington and Benjamin Franklin to lesser-known figures such as Caesar Rodney and Thomas Paine.” The book “will hit shelves on May 5, 2026.”

A Closer Look: Upcoming Petitions for Review

The justices will next consider petitions for review at a private conference on Friday. Several such cases can be found on our petitions page, which highlights particularly notable disputes awaiting the Supreme Court’s attention.

Here’s a closer look at three of the issues that will be in front of the justices tomorrow.

Birthright citizenship

Last term, the court weighed in on a case stemming from President Donald Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship without considering the merits of that order. Instead, the justices addressed the universal injunctions used to put the order on hold nationwide and held that federal district courts lacked the authority to issue such injunctions.

Now, the court has been asked to directly consider whether birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the Constitution. The Trump administration raised that issue in two nearly identical petitions filed at the end of September, contending that the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause “was adopted to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children—not to the children of temporary visitors or illegal aliens.”

The respondents in the cases, including families who claim they would be affected by the order and a group of states, have argued that the administration is misinterpreting the 14th Amendment and overlooking related federal laws and Supreme Court precedent. They’ve urged the court to deny review and, in that way, prevent the order from taking effect.

Voting Rights Act

Last month, the court heard a second round of oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais and considered whether intentionally creating majority-minority congressional districts to satisfy Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act violates the 14th or 15th Amendments. A majority of justices appeared ready to curtail Section 2, which outlaws discrimination in voting practices, by potentially making it harder to bring a Section 2 claim, as SCOTUSblog reported at the time.

On Friday, the justices will weigh several petitions for review raising the same or similar questions about Section 2 of the VRA as Callais. But unlike Callais, they ask whether Section 2 allows lawsuits by private plaintiffs.

In a brief opinion concurring in a 2021 decision on Arizona voting provisions, Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, noted that the court in several cases has assumed that private plaintiffs may bring such a suit, but has never decided this issue.

Parental rights

In Foote v. Ludlow School Committee, which was described by Amy in recent piece, the justices have been asked to consider parental rights in public schools by a Massachusetts couple who contend that school officials encouraged their middle-school-aged child to adopt a new gender identity without their knowledge or consent. Such actions violate the right of parents to direct their child’s upbringing and education, they said, as well as their right to make medical and mental health decisions for their child.

School officials have urged the court not to take up the case, stating that the teachers’ actions did not stem from formal guidance of the Ludlow School Committee. Rather, the court should wait to weigh in on parental rights in public schools until a dispute presents “actual school district policies” that can be addressed, they wrote.

When the court turned down a similar appeal last month, Justice Samuel Alito wrote a statement, joined by Thomas and Gorsuch, in which he acknowledged that denying review was the correct decision but described policies “that purposely interfere with parents’ access to critical information about their children’s gender identity choices and school personnel’s involvement in and influence on those choices” as of “great and growing national importance.”

Parental Rights

Last month, the Supreme Court turned down an appeal from a group of Colorado parents who argued that a school district interfered with their parental rights when it left them out of discussions about their children’s gender identity. On Friday, the justices will consider a similar request from a Massachusetts couple who contend that school officials not only socially transitioned their middle-school-aged child over their objections but also hid that fact from them.

If your child has a court case with child welfare authorities, ICE should keep you near that court.
If there is a detention center closer to your child or the child welfare court, you can ask ICE to move you there.
If a court or child welfare agency requires you to visit with your child, ICE policy says they must make that visitation possible.
Helping to set up calls or meetings with a case worker, if your child is in the child welfare system.","If ICE arrests you, ICE’s policy says the arresting officer should allow you to make arrangements for your child’s care. You can demand to call family or someone else you trust to come get your child and make plans for their care. ICE is supposed to wait until that person arrives and is not supposed to leave your child alone. If you cannot find someone to take care of your child or if the arresting officer thinks your child is being hurt or neglected, ICE policy says the officer must call child protective services. In that case, that agency will come to take custody of your child.

If ICE is arresting you, their policy says they should not take your child as well. That means ICE officers are not allowed to put your child in their car or take them away from a parent being arrested, unless they have a warrant to arrest the child too.

It is also important to know that:

You do not have to tell the immigration agent your child’s immigration status. You should only tell them who will take care of your child and ask to call that person. The person you choose to care for your child should have legal status or U.S. citizenship.

If the arresting officer has a warrant for your child or finds out your child does not have legal status, they may detain your child with you. You could be sent to a facility for adults and your child might be sent to a different facility for children, or you could be jailed together.

If you have a child who came to the U.S. alone and was later placed in your care by the government (a child considered an “unaccompanied child” or former “unaccompanied child”), ICE’s policy says the arresting officer must contact local authorities.

If your child is a U.S. citizen or has valid legal status, ICE is not supposed to arrest or detain them.

While you are in ICE detention, ICE’s policy says they should not transfer or move you away from your child. If your child has a court case with child welfare authorities, ICE should keep you near that court. If there is a detention center closer to your child or the child welfare court, you can ask ICE to move you there. The choice is up to ICE to approve or deny your request.

If you want to see your child while in detention, you have the right to have regular visits with your child. ICE’s policy says you have to make your request in writing. Do not let that stop you from asking to visit your child in person, but you might have to write it down or have someone help you write it down. Jail staff are supposed to help set up a visit within 30 days after you ask. In some jails, in-person visits are not allowed. If that happens, jail staff should help you have a video or telephone call with your child. You can also ask to be moved to a jail that allows in-person visits, but ICE does not promise they will approve that ask.

If a court or child welfare agency requires you to visit with your child, ICE policy says they must make that visitation possible.

Some jails have people called “custody and removal coordinators.” They are not the same as your ICE officer. Some jails may call them “social workers” even though that is not their official title. Their job is to help you make plans for someone else to care for your child while you are in ICE detention. They can also help you talk to a case worker in the child welfare system if you have a child in the court system and you need help making case plan requirements to get your child back. This help might include:

Helping to set up phone or video calls with lawyers.

Helping you ask for a visit from your consulate to apply for passports or other travel documents.

Helping to set up calls or meetings with a case worker, if your child is in the child welfare system.

Sharing information with your child’s caregiver about when you may be deported so that you can try to leave together.

It is also important to tell the custody and removal coordinator or any other staff in the detention facility if your parental status changes so they can make sure your parental rights are protected. For example, if you or your partner has a new baby born while you are in detention, or if one of your children enters the state child welfare system, it is important for the custody and removal coordinator to know

If you have a family or child welfare proceeding that is necessary to keep or get back custody of your child, you have the right to appear in-person for that hearing. You, the court, or the child welfare agency court must give ICE a written document that says you must participate in such proceedings. This document could be a court notice, a letter, or a court order.

If ICE says they can’t take you to court in person, they may set up another form of participation, like a telephone or video appearance. If there is a custody and removal coordinator in the jail you are being held in, they can also help set this up.

If ICE is going to deport you, you have the right to make decisions about what happens to your child. You can decide to have your child remain in the United States, whether they are a U.S. citizen or immigrant child, even if they do not have legal status. While it is your choice to have your child stay in the United States, ICE policy says the officer is required to have you put this decision in writing. If this is not done, then ICE officers must swear that this was what you told them was your choice. The custody and removal coordinator or other staff are supposed to help you make plans to leave your child with another caregiver, if that is your choice.

You can also decide that your child will leave the United States and come with you. This includes U.S. citizen and immigrant children. In some cases, ICE may give you time to buy flights so you can leave the country together. It may also be the case that a child follows you to your home country after your deportation. ICE is also supposed to allow you to talk with lawyers, consulates, and family members to help you make plans and sign important documents before you leave the country.

You can make a different choice for each of your children if that is what you think is best for them. The choice is yours about what happens to your children, no matter what ICE officers may tell you.

We know many immigrant parents may not have the time or money to hire a lawyer to speak up for them. If your ICE officer is ignoring your requests, or if the custody and removal coordinators are not helping you, you can try calling ICE’s Detention, Removals, and Information Line (DRIL) to make a complaint.

This hotline is free for people in ICE detention. The DRIL line has people who speak different languages and can talk with you, but you might have to wait on hold. Look for a flyer in your housing unit with the DRIL line number (it may be 9116# or 1-888-351-4024).",https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cropped-cropped-nilc-resource-social-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 11:58:03.110024

Foreword from the Home Secretary

The story of migration in Britain is the story of my family, and many others like us. My father came here in the early 1970s, and my mother a little less than a decade later. Both came to seek a better life, and they found one here in Britain. They became Brits themselves, and Brummies too.

They brought up four children just as proud to be a part of this country, and that great city, as them. This is not just my story. It is the story of many of my constituents in Birmingham Ladywood. It is the story of many millions more across this country.

I am a patriot. Mine is a love of this country: one that is forever changing, while something essential about it always endures. It is a patriotism that finds room for those who trace their roots back many generations, and those, like me, who do not.

But for some in our country today, this broad patriotism is narrowing. Divides are growing. The goal of building a greater Britain is giving way to the lure of a littler England.

Some will choose to scorn this analysis. They would rather we simply wished it away. But those who look like me do not have that luxury. Our lives – and the lives of our families – are more dangerous in a country that turns inwards. We have no choice but to ask: what is the cause of our division? And how might this country be united?

It is clear the pace and scale of migration in this country has not just been unprecedented but also destabilising. Between 2021 and 2024, we have seen net migration of an additional 2.6 million people. Around one in every 30 people in this country today arrived in these four years.

This extraordinary open border experiment was the legacy of the last Conservative government. The bar to entry was lowered significantly. This was most evident in the Health and Care visa. An attempt to fill between 6,000 and 40,000 jobs saw the arrival of 616,000 individuals from 2022 to 2024. Over half were not even arriving to work in that sector but were instead dependants of those who were. Fraud, as any constituency Member of Parliament can tell you, was rife.

The successful story of migration in Britain has always depended on two things. Firstly, that each wave of migrants becomes a part of our wider cultural life. And secondly, that they pay back to the country that has given them a home. This does not mean assimilation. We have built a multi-faith, multi-ethnic democracy that is pluralistic, grounded in tolerance towards difference. But it does demand contribution and integration.

To become a part of this country, permanently, is therefore not a right but a privilege – and one that must be earned. This government has already announced that we will lift the starting point at which most people can receive indefinite leave to remain to ten years. In this consultation, we set out the conditions by which settlement might then be earned.

Some of these conditions are required to qualify for settlement at any time. Today, settlement is near automatic. The only qualifications required are to have lived in this country for, in most cases, five years, and to have not received a prison sentence of over a year. Now, the qualifying bar will be set higher. Applicants must have a clean criminal record. They must speak English to a high standard. They must make a sustained and measurable economic contribution. Finally, they must have no debt in this country.

On top of that, we are consulting on a series of conditions that could either add to, or subtract from, the baseline 10-year qualifying period. An earlier settlement could be available to those who make an outsized contribution to our national life, such as high-talent, high taxpayers; those who have worked at a certain level of seniority in our public services; or those who have volunteered extensively in their local communities.

Separately, and not subject to consultation, settlement will be quicker for those who have a uniquely strong attachment to this country, including the spouses and dependants of British citizens and British Nationals (Overseas) (BN(O)s) from Hong Kong.

We propose that settlement is delayed for those who contribute less to our public life. This includes those who have claimed benefits payments. A long penalty would also be applied to those who have entered the country illegally – aiming to strongly discourage entering the country via these routes. This follows the announcement of a new, 20-year settlement path for refugees who remain on the new ""core protection"" support.

The consultation is open on some cohorts of special interest. This includes settlement rights for children, members of the armed forces, and victims of certain crimes.

As well as considering the responsibilities that are expected of those who seek a permanent life in this country, the consultation also raises the question of what rights are provided as a result. Specifically, it proposes that benefits should not be available to those who have settled status, and asks whether they should instead be reserved for those who have achieved British citizenship.

This consultation also addresses the specific question of low-skilled and low-wage migrants who arrived on the Health and Care visa. Migrants on lower wages who bring non-working dependants and children are likely to present significant fiscal costs to the UK. It is therefore right that we apply more stringent controls for this group before they qualify for settled status. Under our current rules, they will usually qualify for benefits payments and council housing five years after arrival. As the majority of this group began arriving from 2022 onwards, this is currently set to begin in 2027. We consult here on a separate baseline qualifying period, of 15 years, for this group.

Crucially, for these and every other group mentioned here, we propose to apply these changes to everyone in the country today who has not already received indefinite leave to remain. This would mean that those who are due to reach settlement in the coming months and years would be subject to the new requirements for earned settlement, as soon as our immigration rules have changed.

We will not, and would never, take away settled status from those who have already been granted it. These are people who have been in our country for years, even decades. They have families here. They have contributed to our society. Fairness is the most fundamental of British values. We made these people a promise when we gave them settlement. We welcomed them here permanently at that point, and we do not break our promises.

This document sets out how we will introduce a new model of settlement that is earned, not automatic. I invite all of those who have an interest in this matter to respond to this consultation with their views and recommendations.

Perhaps most importantly, I have set out here why we believe these changes are necessary. I love this country, which opened its arms to my parents around fifty years ago. But I am profoundly concerned by the division I see in it now, which is fuelled by a pace and scale of migration that is placing immense pressure on local communities.

For those who believe that migration is part of modern Britain's story, and must continue to be, we must prove that migration still works for this country. That means that those who come here must contribute, play their part, and enrich our national life. That is how we can retain our position as the greatest multi-ethnic, multi-faith democracy in the world.

Introduction

Settlement plays a vital role in fostering integration and cohesion, and this government is clear that these are not automatic entitlements but privileges that must be earned through meaningful contribution. This government proposes a revised framework, where individuals must demonstrate sustained compliance, economic activity, and alignment with British values.

This approach ensures that those granted settlement and citizenship are well-integrated, economically self-sufficient, and committed to the communities they join, thereby strengthening social cohesion and public confidence in the immigration system.

This paper sets out the details of a consultation on proposals to reform the current settlement rules in favour of an ""earned settlement"" model. This consultation is open to anyone who wishes to share their views, including individuals, organisations, and other stakeholders who may be affected by or have an interest in the proposed changes. It will run for 12 weeks. The consultation questionnaire can be found at Annex B of this paper.

A paper summarising the responses to this consultation, alongside economic and equality impact assessments, will be published in due course.

In line with the UK's obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement, settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) is out of scope for both this consultation and the planned reforms. Grants of settlement related to the Windrush Scheme are also out of scope for both this consultation and the planned reforms. There will be no changes implemented for either scheme in relation to the settlement reforms.

Individuals who already hold settled status are also out of scope of measures to reform the granting of settlement and, therefore, this consultation.

The issue of providing a clear pathway to settlement for children in care and care leavers is also out of scope of this consultation

Approach

Settlement grants are expected to significantly increase over the next 5 years, around 1.6 million people are forecast to settle between 2026 and 2030, with a peak in annual volumes of around 450,000 in 2028. This expected increase is driven by increased immigration in 2022–2024, especially of those on Health and Care visas.

For migrants to make a positive fiscal contribution, they must contribute more through taxation than they cost by using public services. The fiscal contribution of migrants varies across different migrant cohorts, influenced by factors such as employment rate, income level, age, and their propensity to use different types of public services.

The consultation will seek views on options to reduce the current forecast volumes and associated impact over the coming years. We are consulting on a number of options to achieve this, namely a) increasing the baseline qualifying period for settlement to 10 years b) increasing the qualifying period for settlement to 15 years for those in the Skilled worker route in a role below RQF level 6 (equivalent to a bachelor's degree), and c) implementing a No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) condition at Settlement. Following the consultation, the government will set out its preferred option, or combination of options, to achieve this.

Earned Settlement

'Earned settlement' is a principle that recognises the value of long-term contribution to the UK. Rather than granting settlement after a fixed period, this approach ensures that individuals demonstrate sustained commitment through work, community involvement, or other meaningful contributions before being granted permanent status. It aims to reward those who actively support the country's social and economic fabric, reinforcing fairness and public confidence in the immigration system.

The new model will increase the standard qualifying period for settlement to ten years. However, individuals will also have the opportunity to reduce this period based on their contributions to the UK economy and society.

It is proposed that the earned settlement system will be based on a 'time adjustment' model, built on four core pillars and designed to ensure that applicants make a meaningful contribution to UK society and meet clear, measurable standards. These four core pillars will be:

• Character – This reformed system will, as now, provide for the refusal of applications where core requirements relating to their character and conduct (including criminal record, compliance with immigration requirements and considerations pertaining to the public good) are met. It will be mandatory to meet such requirements, and there will be no ability to trade with other considerations to determine the qualifying period. We will conduct a root and branch review of the criminality thresholds that apply across all immigration routes. Our expectation is that you should not be able to settle with a criminal record. Revised thresholds will be set out in due course.

• Integration – The reformed system will ensure that applicants demonstrate meaningful engagement with British society.

• Contribution – The reformed system will reward individuals who have made a sustained and measurable economic contribution to the UK, on the principle that any accelerated path to settlement should be earned through active participation in the economy.

• Residence – The reformed system will recognise lawful, continuous residence in the UK. Individuals will not, however, normally qualify on the basis of residence alone.

The default qualifying period for settlement will be increased from the current 5 years to 10 years, with exceptions for certain groups or individuals.

In developing an earned settlement system, we will take full account of the appropriate pathways to settlement and citizenship for children either born in the UK or arriving here. This will include unaccompanied children and other vulnerable children or families. We will take account of their specific needs and vulnerabilities. We particularly welcome views on how the development of an earned settlement system should take account of children.

The current definition of settlement

Settlement in the UK is a prerequisite for becoming a British citizen and brings lifelong benefits. Settlement is also an important step in integrating and contributing to local communities and the wider country.

Settlement is defined as a person having no time limit on their stay in the UK and being ordinarily resident. Settlement is the right to live permanently in the UK without conditions in relation to accessing the labour market and public funds and so confers significant benefits. The holder can work, study and access public funds for which they qualify.

Settlement can only be revoked for reasons of criminality; deception or fraud in obtaining the status; or other significant non-conducive reasons. A person's settled status is invalidated if they are deported. Settled status may also lapse if the holder remains outside the UK for more than 2 years.

Settlement is a prerequisite to being eligible for naturalisation as a British citizen.

Of the almost 70 different routes within the Immigration Rules, approximately 40 lead to settlement. The routes to settlement fall under one of four broad categories:

• Work: for applicants who have completed a qualifying period on an unsponsored route (Innovator, Global Talent, Investor) or a sponsored work route (Skilled Worker/Minister of Religion/Sportsperson) or legacy unsponsored work routes (Representative of an Overseas Business/UK Ancestry and ECAA workers/business persons). Work routes leading to settlement generally allow for the worker to be accompanied or joined by their dependent partner and children.

• Family: for a family member of a person who is British, settled in the UK, is an EU citizen with pre-settled status under the EUSS or has limited leave as a refugee or as a person granted humanitarian protection. Family applicants may be accompanied or joined by their dependent partner and children and some other dependent relatives are allowed - for example, adult dependant relatives.

• Protection: currently for applicants who have completed a period of limited leave as a refugee or as a person granted humanitarian protection. These routes allow for the person to be accompanied or joined by dependent partners and children, and other family members in exceptional circumstances.

• Other: includes applicants on the family route who are victims of domestic violence or bereaved partners, those who qualify on the basis of their long residence or private life, discharged members of HM Forces, stateless persons, adopted children, and those granted discretionary leave, leave outside the rules.

How does the system operate now?

The core requirements for settlement include that the applicant must have spent a qualifying period, which is usually 5 years, with a visa on a route to settlement. There are some routes that allow immediate settlement, and some which offer a shorter qualifying period of 3 years. These routes are detailed in the section below.

To qualify for settlement the person must have demonstrated integration (showing knowledge of English language and life in the UK) and not breached immigration law or committed criminal offences. In some cases, there are also route-specific requirements.

There are also longer routes to settlement (typically ten years) for individuals who have not met the core requirements of standard settlement pathways, have breached immigration laws, or would otherwise be refused on suitability grounds, but whose cases involve human rights considerations.

Of the 70 immigration routes, not all lead to settlement, these routes include for example as a visitor, student, or temporary worker.

Latest evidence on settlement

Historical settlement applications

The number of grants of settlement, also known as indefinite leave to remain (ILR), in a given year is a function of a combination of factors, including previous years' immigration levels, changes in policy and operational priorities. [1] The number of people granted settlement peaked in 2010 at almost 250,000, but has remained below 200,000 in every subsequent year, averaging 111,000 per year from 2011 to 2024. [2] This document does not consider those granted settled or pre-settled status as part of the EUSS. [3]

The spike in settlement in 2010 was due to a large number of grants on a discretionary basis (82,295 grants in 2010), mainly under measures aimed at clearing the backlog of outstanding unresolved cases. [4] The fall in settlement grants from 2010 to 2016 was in part due to a 2012 policy change that increased the residence requirement for Family visas from 2 to 5 years, delaying some grants that would otherwise have been made earlier. [5]

Since 2017, settlement grants have been rising. In the year ending Q2 2025, there were 163,000 grants of settlement, up 18% from the previous year. [6] The overall rise in settlement grants since 2017 has been driven by a combination of factors. There has been a significant rise in entry clearance visas granted on most routes to settlement, excluding Covid impacted years. There has also been an increase in extensions of stay over the period on major routes to settlement. [7] Since 2017, settlement volumes from the Skilled Worker/Tier 2 route have risen considerably to levels comparable with the pre-2012 predecessor routes.

Figure 1: Settlement applications and grants, year ending 2004 to 2024 [8] (thousands)

[…]

The majority of people who went on to achieve settlement between 2021 and 2024 did so after initially coming to the UK on work routes (31% in 2024), family routes (30% in 2024), or to study (11% in 2024). [9] The number who came initially as Asylum claimants has fluctuated over the period, but has increased since 2021. [10] A significant proportion of those granted settlement since 2021 were dependants, typically the partners or children of those who came to work and study. Dependants made up 26% of total settlement grants between 2021 and 2024. [11]

[…]

Figure 2.2: Routes to settlement by prior category of leave, 2021 to 2024 [13] (thousands

[…]

Not all visa routes provide a direct route to settlement. For example, migrants entering on study routes will typically need to switch onto routes such as Work or Family before applying for settlement. Between 2021 and 2024, Study made up 13% of Settlement volumes by initial category of leave (i.e. the route on which migrants arrived in the UK), compared to just 1% by prior category of leave (i.e. the route migrants were on at the point they applied for settlement). [14] In 2024, 37% of settlement grants had Family as their category of leave prior to settlement, compared to 33% who were on Work routes. [15]

Future settlement forecast

In the next five years, settlement volumes are forecast to increase significantly, due to the unprecedented level of migration to the UK in recent years. Most of those forecast to settle arrived in the UK between 2021 and 2024, a period of record high net migration. [16]

While significant uncertainty exists over the future behaviour of potential applicants, the Home Office estimates that between 1.3 million and 2.2 million people will settle in the UK between 2026 and 2030 (central estimate 1.6m), peaking at between 359,000 and 620,000 in 2028 (central estimate 450,000).

Figure 3: Settlement Forecast - actuals (2017-2024) and forecast (2025-2030) [17] - thousands

[…]

These estimates are based on published Home Office data on migrant inflows to the UK through to 2024, and a set of assumptions on the propensity of these individuals to choose to settle in the UK. In essence, the central scenario assumes settlement behaviour in line with historical patterns, with a range modelled around it to reflect uncertainty in the propensity to settle.

Three factors underlie this increase in settlement, over and above historical patterns:

• First, the 154,000 people granted a Hong Kong BN(O) LTE or LTR visa in 2021 and 2022 will become eligible to settle in 2026 and 2027 [18]. The Home Office forecasts 92,000 additional settlement applications from this cohort in 2026 and 54,000 in 2027. [19]

• Second, the significant increase in people granted a Health and Care entry clearance visa, including a significant cohort working in the care sector, totalling 616,000 between 2022 and 2024 will become eligible for settlement between 2027 and 2029. [20] The Home Office estimates that the UK will see 384,000 additional settlement applications from this cohort over this period, with a peak at 210,000 in 2028.

• Finally, the number of granted Skilled Worker entry clearance visas also spiked between 2022 and 2024, totalling 344,000. [21] These visas will also become eligible for settlement between 2027 and 2029, and the Home Office estimates that this cohort will account for around 222,000 settlement applications over this period.

Skilled Worker main applicants, both on Health and Care visas and other routes, have brought increased numbers of dependants since 2021. A significant proportion of the cohort expected to be granted settlement from these routes will be dependants, many of them children. Greater numbers of dependants could lead to an increased likelihood of applying for settlement, pushing up settlement numbers further.

Characteristics of recent migrants on a path to settlement

There is uncertainty over the settlement behaviour of migrants based on individual characteristics beyond their initial visa category. However, as the makeup of migration has changed over the last five years, so will the characteristics of those claiming settlement over the next five years.

Changes in Work Migration

Between 2021 and 2024, there has been significant growth in lower-skilled migration on work routes, particularly on the Health and Care visa, which is estimated to make up nearly half (47%) of settlement grants in 2028.

The implementation of the Skilled Worker visa in December 2020, which replaced the previous Tier 2 visa, changed the skill composition of migrants coming to the UK under work routes. Under the Tier 2 system, eligibility was largely restricted to occupations at RQF Level 6 and above - typically graduate-level roles. [24] In contrast, the Skilled Worker route expanded eligibility to include RQF Level 3 to 5 roles, as well as removing previous numerical ceilings on admissions under the route, opening the door to medium and lower-skilled workers. In 2021, 13% of Skilled Worker main applicant visas issued were below RQF 6, rising to 53% in the year ending June 2024.

Changes to the Health and Care route also affected the skill mix. In February 2022, at the advice of the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), Senior Care and Care Workers were made eligible for the Health and Care route. [25] Around half of Health and Care entry clearance visas issued to main applicants in 2022 were issued to Senior Care and Care Workers, rising to over 70% in 2023. [26] This led to a sharp increase in visa grants for below RQF 6 roles; 75% of Skilled Work visas on the Health and Care route were issued to occupations below RQF Level 6 in 2023, up from 11% in 2021. [27]

Between 2021 and 2024, there was also a significant increase in the number of dependants being brought to the UK. Over 2016-2019 Tier 2 General visa holders brought 0.74 dependants per main applicant on average. [28] Over 2021 to 2024 Skilled Workers (including Health and Care) brought on average 1.14. [29] From 2022 to 2023 Health and Care visa holders brought significantly more dependants than other routes, 56% of visas issued to new entrants on the Health and Care visa were issued to dependants in this period compared to just 43% of Skilled Worker visas. [30] Research by the Migration Observatory indicates that main applicants who come with dependants are more likely to obtain settlement than those who come alone. [31]

The Home Office's settlement forecast, based on historical settlement behaviour, includes 462,000 individuals between 2026 and 2030 who arrived on the Health and Care route.

This represents a substantial new cohort, as there were no settlement grants from this route prior to 2025. Skilled Worker settlement volumes will also increase over this period; Home Office forecast that there will be 306,000 settlement grants from individuals who arrived on non-Health and Care Skilled Worker visas over the same period. This equates to 61,000 settlement grants per year, up from 39,000 settlement grants in 2024 for individuals who arrived on Worker visas. Given that most of the growth in entry clearance on these routes has been in lower skilled jobs, a large proportion of settlement grants to Skilled Workers from 2026 to 2030 will be to lower-skilled worker cohorts and their dependants.

Changes in Family Migration

Prior to April 2024, individuals sponsoring a Partner on the Family visa had to meet a minimum income requirement (MIR) of £18,600. This increased by 56% to £29,000 in April 2024. [32] This marked the first rise in the MIR since its introduction at £18,600 in 2012. The MIR declined significantly in real terms over this time due to inflation.

Based on historical settlement behaviour, the Home Office forecasts around 280,000 migrants could settle between 2026-2030 from Family and dependant routes. The majority of these will have arrived in the UK before the 2024 MIR increase.

Changes in Study Migration

The numbers of migrants arriving in the UK on the Study route increased substantially from 2021 to 2024 compared to previous years. From 2017 to 2019, an average of 238,000 student visas were issued per year under the previous Tier 4 – General Student route. [33] From 2021 to 2023, this increased to 532,000 per year. Student main applicants over this period brought significantly more dependants. [34] From 2017 to 2019, Students brought 0.06 dependants per main applicant on average, compared to 0.26 between 2021 and 2023. [35]

Evidence from the MAC suggests that a significant proportion of international students who arrived since 2021 are switching into roles below RQF 6. In their 2024 'Rapid Review of the Graduate Route', the MAC found that almost half (49%) of those who switched directly from the Student route into work routes switched into Senior Care worker and Care worker roles, while 20% of those who switched from the Graduate route also entered these occupations. [36]

Individuals who arrived on the Study route are estimated to form only a small proportion of those reaching settlement between 2026 and 2030, despite a significant increase in student numbers. Home Office forecasting based on historical behaviour estimates that there will be 105,000 settlement grants over this period. Based on historical behaviour settlement volumes from the Study route appear low. However, it is likely that the introduction of the Graduate route in 2021 and higher dependency ratio of recent cohorts will lead to a higher proportion of international students remaining in the UK and eventually reaching settlement, compared to previous cohorts.

Economic and fiscal impacts

The changes set out above suggest that a significant proportion of migrants settling from 2026 to 2030 will have lower skill levels than previous cohorts of migrants. The high number of dependants connected with this cohort further suggests that they are more likely to obtain settlement and remain in the UK in the long-term. [37]

Home Office analysis of internal management information shows that migrants working in below RQF 6 occupations typically have lower salaries than migrants working in occupations requiring higher skill levels. Internal data estimates that the median salary of migrants working in RQF 3-5 roles was around £12,000 lower than the overall route medians for Skilled Worker and Health and Care (excluding Care Work occupations) in 2024/25.

Home Office analysis [38] matching visas granted between April 2019 and March 2023 to PAYE data showed that median salaries for Senior Care and Care Workers were between £23,000 and £26,000 for financial year 2023/24. This is significantly below the median full-time salary in the UK - £37,000 as of April 2024. [39]

Figure 5: Median annual adjusted earnings for granted Sponsored Work entry clearance visas [40] , financial year 2023 to 2024

[…]

Note: Senior Care Worker and Care Worker dependants are assumed to have the same median salary as general Health and Care dependants.

For migrants to make a positive fiscal contribution, they must contribute more through taxation than they cost by using public services. The fiscal contribution of migrants varies across different migrant cohorts, influenced by factors such as employment rate, income level, age, and their propensity to use different types of public services. As well as fiscal contributions, migrants contribute to the UK in a number of other ways; many migrants work in important roles providing vital services, such as supporting the NHS.

Fiscal impacts can also vary by time spent in the country. Both benefits and costs can vary over time. In the longer-term, costs can increase as migrants get older, have children and can increase again when migrants achieve settlement and become eligible to receive benefits, including Universal Credit and access to the state pension. In June 2025, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) reported that 213,000 migrants with settlement were claiming Universal Credit. [41]

In September 2024, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated the cumulative fiscal impact of a representative migrant coming to the UK at the age of 25. [42] This analysis was undertaken for an ""average-wage"" migrant, earning the same as the UK average (assumed to be £38,200 using ASHE 2024 data), a ""high-wage"" migrant earning 30 per cent more (£49,700) and a ""low-wage"" migrant earning 50 per cent less (£19,100).

It found that some cohorts of migrants such as those on the Skilled Worker visa in RQF 6+ roles and on ""high-value"" routes such as the Global Talent routes are likely to approximate ""average-wage"" or ""high-wage"" migrants. Those in RQF 3-5 roles, such as Senior Care and Care Workers and their dependants, who have lower skill-levels and lower earnings are likely to make less of a contribution than ""average wage"" migrants though still likely above the ""low wage"" migrant category, who never make a net positive fiscal contribution in the long run.

Many Skilled Workers who arrive in the UK are older than 25 at time of arrival - for these cohorts, their cumulative fiscal impact will be lower in each period when compared to a migrant who arrives closer to 25 with the same salary.

Figure 6, below, only considers adult migrants; migrant households with children, who incur significantly higher levels of public spending in the short term, must earn substantially more to make a net positive fiscal contribution. From 2021 to 2024, 27% of all applications [43] for Health and Care visas were under 16. Over the same period 18% of all applications for other Skilled Worker visas were under 16.

Figure 6: OBR cumulative fiscal impact of representative migrants [44]

Further immigration rule changes

Due to recent rule changes the makeup of future cohorts of migrants to the UK will be different to the 2021 to 2024 cohort. In response to unprecedented levels of net migration, changes to the immigration rules came into effect from 2024 to restrict dependants for Senior Care and Care workers and on the Student route. [45] [46] The minimum salary threshold on the Skilled Worker visa was also raised to £38,700. [47]

Further rule changes introduced under the Spring 2025 Immigration White Paper have tightened requirements, with a view to reducing net migration levels. [48] The skills threshold on the Skilled Worker route (including Skilled Worker – Health and Care) has been restored to RQF 6+, closing the Senior Care and Care worker route to new entrants, along with increases to minimum salary thresholds and dependant restrictions for migrants accessing the route via the Immigration Shortage Occupation List or the Temporary Shortage List.

Key requirements of an earned settlement system

Our working assumption is that the system should operate on a 'time adjustment' model, meaning that the qualifying period will be adjustable upwards or downwards from a baseline qualifying period, depending on the individual circumstances of the case.

As set out in the Immigration White Paper, we will move to a system in which the baseline qualifying period for settlement for most migrants is increased from 5 years to 10 years.

As set out in the Restoring Order and Control: A Statement on the government's asylum and returns policy, we will introduce a starting point of a 20-year qualifying period of settlement for those recognised as refugees. Those who move from core protection onto the new core protection-work and study routes will be able to earn reductions. However, refugees will never be in a better position than those coming to the UK on recognised migration routes (such as workers), who are subject to the usual standard settlement qualifying period of 10 years.

Resettled refugees who have been granted protection and moved to the UK through official resettlement programmes are intended to start at 10 years, bringing them in line with other arrivals on planned migration routes. Individuals who arrive on these routes will have a quicker route to settlement than those who claim asylum in-country. This is justified on the basis that the caps for these routes will be devised to reflect local area capacity to absorb, so it is appropriate to grant them a shorter path to settlement.

The considerations informing the design will be based on four core pillars, designed to ensure that applicants make a meaningful contribution to UK society and meet clear, measurable standards. These four core pillars will be:

• Character – This reformed system will, as now, provide for the refusal of applications where core requirements relating to their character and conduct (for example, having a criminal conviction, non-compliance with immigration requirements and considerations pertaining to the public good). It will be mandatory to meet such requirements, and there will be no ability to trade with other considerations to determine the qualifying period. We will conduct a root and branch review of the criminality thresholds that apply across all immigration routes. Our expectation is that you should not be able to settle with a criminal record. Revised thresholds will be set out in due course.

• Integration – The reformed system will ensure that applicants demonstrate meaningful engagement with British society.

• Contribution – The reformed system will reward individuals who have made a sustained and measurable economic contribution to the UK, on the principle that any accelerated path to settlement should be earned through active participation in the economy.

• Residence – The reformed system will recognise lawful, continuous residence in the UK. Individuals will not, however, normally qualify on the basis of residence alone.

An outline of how the proposed earned settlement system would work is set out in the tables below. In these tables, criteria that applicants must meet to be considered, or that may increase or reduce the qualifying period for settlement, are linked to the four pillars set out above.

Eligibility for settlement: mandatory requirements

There will be minimum mandatory requirements that all applicants must meet in order to be granted settlement. These are set out in Table 1 below. We are not consulting on whether these should be included in the earned settlement model with the exception of ""contribution"", where we are consulting on the length of time the requirement to have an earned income should apply to.

Table 3: Considerations that will increase the baseline qualifying period. Note: only one of the listed considerations (i.e. the one that causes the largest increase) would be applied in the case of any single application. This will take precedence over any reduction to the baseline.

This consultation includes questions intended to seek respondents' views on the impacts of the proposed model. Further information on how the criteria are intended to work is set out below.

The tables above set out how the baseline qualifying period may be adjusted upwards or downwards. In order to meet the qualifying period requirement, the applicant will, as now, need to have spent the required period of time in the UK in a route, or routes, that leads to settlement. The Immigration Rules will specify which routes lead to settlement and which do not, and it is not intended that the position as to which routes fall into each category will change (Figure 1 above sets out those routes which currently lead to settlement).

A consequence of the proposed system is that there will no longer be a separate long residence route. The purpose of the existing long residence route will be superseded by arrangements in which the baseline qualifying period is adjustable for considerations relating to contribution and integration.

Contribution and Integration

Under these proposals, the qualifying period for settlement may be reduced where criteria relating to the applicant's contribution and integration are met.

In the case of integration, it is proposed that the applicant may qualify for a reduction in the qualifying period on the basis of working in the community or having proficiency in English that is higher (at C1 level or above) than the minimum level of proficiency (B2 level) required to qualify for settlement.

In the case of economic contribution, the government's view is that arrangements for settlement should reward those who are making the greatest contribution, and that earnings are the best means of objectively measuring economic contribution. This consultation therefore seeks views on linking earned reductions to earnings and specifically a proposal that applicants should attract a shorter qualifying period for settlement if they have, in the 3 years immediately prior to applying, earned a taxable annual income of above £50,270 (earning a reduction of 5 years) or £125,140 (earning a reduction of 7 years). These thresholds have been selected as they equate to the current thresholds for payment of Income Tax at the higher and additional rate respectively. (Note: it is not, however, the proposal that these income-related thresholds would track future changes to the tax system.)

These proposals would mean that the income threshold at which an applicant might earn an income-based reduction in the qualifying period for settlement is higher than the salary threshold that may apply to an overseas national initially seeking entry under the Skilled Worker route. The government's view is that it is reasonable to reserve a shorter pathway to settlement to those who achieve some progression in their earnings and economic contribution post-entry.

In addition, this consultation also seeks views on the proposal that that there should be a similarly shorter pathway to settlement for those who are working in vital public services, particularly where earnings are based on national pay scales and may not meet the proposed threshold for an income-based reduction in the qualifying period. This might include, for example, medical and teaching professionals working in public services. It is, however, envisaged that the above reduction in the qualifying period for public service roles would apply only to those working in skilled occupations (i.e. at RQF Level 6 or above).

This consultation also seeks views on how far contribution-based criteria for reducing the qualifying period should reward those who have demonstrated a commitment to contributing to their community through, for example, volunteering. This government recognises the vital role that volunteers have in communities throughout the country. They contribute to the very fabric of British life, and everyone who takes part should be celebrated for their efforts to deliver change.

Volunteering is any activity that involves spending time, unpaid, doing something that aims to benefit someone else (other than close friends or relatives), the community or the environment. Volunteering can be formal and organised by organisations or informal within communities. It should always be a free choice made by the person giving up their time. It often has benefits for both the wider community and the individual taking part.

Volunteering and employment are fundamentally different. There is no legal definition of what constitutes a volunteer or the act of volunteering in the UK, but there is for employment. Volunteers give their time without obligation and can stop volunteering when they choose to.

Specific routes of entry and residence (including those admitted as the partner, parent or child of a British citizen and have held that status for the duration of their qualifying period or as a holder of Hong Kong British National (Overseas) status) will attract a reduction in the qualifying period. These groups will therefore be able to settle after 5 years, as they can now, subject to the mandatory requirements.

Individuals on high-skilled routes make an important contribution to the economy through the skills they bring. In recognition of that, it is proposed that those with 3 years of continuous residence as a Global Talent worker or Innovator Founder will benefit from a reduction of up to 7 years. It is therefore expected that most individuals who hold either visa should continue to benefit from an accelerated route to settlement after 3 years, subject to the mandatory requirements. Furthermore, we are consulting on whether family members of this group should benefit from a 5-year reduction.

This means, however, that with the exception of the above categories, those routes (for example, the Skilled Worker route) that currently lead to settlement after 5 years continuous stay will cease to do so and will default to a qualifying period of 10 years, except where an earned reduction on the basis of contribution or integration applies.

Non-compliance and negative contributions

Under earned settlement, a person's pathway to settlement will also depend on their history of compliance with immigration laws. This may affect both their qualifying period for settlement and whether an application for settlement will be considered at all. The government believes it is right that those who do not comply with immigration laws should expect this to impact on their pathway to settlement and that, even where breaches do not have the consequence of resulting in outright refusal of an application, they should result in their qualifying period being extended.

In the case of those who overstay their leave, the Immigration Rules already provide that an application for permission to stay (including settlement) may be refused if the applicant has breached immigration laws by overstaying their leave. Under these proposals, it would additionally be the case that, where it was judged that an overstaying breach should not lead to outright refusal, it would nevertheless cause the qualifying period for settlement to be increased. We are consulting on whether this should be 5, 10, 15 or as high as 20 years.

It is proposed that an increase in the qualifying period should similarly apply where the applicant originally entered the UK illegally, or where the applicant originally entered as a visitor. This would mean, for example, that a person who entered the UK illegally could have a route to settlement as high as 30 years.

This consultation also seeks views on whether the qualifying period should be increased by five or ten years if the applicant has claimed public funds. It should be noted that recourse to public funds may constitute a breach of conditions and therefore result in outright refusal of an application on general grounds. The proposal here is that even where there has not been a breach of conditions (for example, where the Home Office waived an individual's no recourse to public funds condition), or there has been a breach but it does not warrant refusal of the application, it should nevertheless give rise to an increase in the required qualifying period.

Settlement and public funds

In reforming settlement arrangements, the government wishes to address the concern that increasing volumes of settlement grants are not subject to restrictions on access to public funds.

This might be addressed by increasing the pathway to settlement for groups less likely to make a net fiscal contribution over the long-term – for example workers in lower wage occupations. We are therefore consulting on whether a contribution-based approach should mean that the existing pathway for settlement is increased (beyond the standard baseline of 10 years) for those admitted to the UK specifically to work in occupations skilled below RQF Level 6. This might involve increasing the baseline qualifying period to 15 years where the worker has been sponsored for a role skilled below RQF Level 6 (for example, under the Skilled Worker and Health and Care routes).

The consultation seeks views on whether the law should be changed so that it would be possible to make settlement subject to a ""no recourse to public funds"" condition. The government believes that the development of an earned settlement system should include a reassessment of the benefits accruing to settlement and where the accrual of those benefits might in future sit in the journey to settlement and citizenship respectively. Under this option, new migrants granted settlement would continue to be unable to access specified benefits in line with existing visa conditions. This would have the effect of shifting the default position on access to benefits to citizenship rather than settlement.

Dependants and children

Under the existing system, dependants of those who enter and stay in, for example, economic routes are able to qualify for settlement at the point that the principal applicant is granted settlement and without having to meet any additional conditions. We anticipate that this will substantially change under the earned settlement system. We expect it to become the position that the qualifying period for settlement for a person granted entry and stay as the adult dependants of an economic migrant will be separately determined according to their own attributes and circumstances. This will mean that a person admitted as the dependant of an economic migrant will not necessarily enjoy the same qualifying period for settlement as their partner. It may be shorter or longer, according to their particular circumstances.

It would, however, remain the position that a person whose basis of stay has been as a dependant will only have a pathway to settlement where the main applicant is able to qualify. For example, in the case of an economic migrant whose application fails under grounds for mandatory refusal, their dependants will not (as now) have a pathway to settlement independently of the main applicant.

In the case of children, it is acknowledged that many of the requirements in the earned reduction model outlined above – such as making NICs or meeting an income threshold – cannot be met by those who may still be children at the point that their parents become eligible for settlement. At the same time, however, the introduction of an earned settlement system with a longer baseline qualifying period does bring into focus whether and how those who turn 18 during their parents' qualifying period should be brought within earned settlement principles and be expected to qualify for settlement in their own right.

The consultation questionnaire therefore includes questions seeking views on how dependants should be accommodated within an earned settlement system. The Home Office considers that the system should continue to provide a window during which those who were originally given a permission as a dependent child when they are under 18 can be granted settlement (or a limited permission to extend their stay) at the same time as their parents, even if they are over 18 at that point. The Home Office will, however, develop proposals under which a cut-off point, linked to age, may operate, and at which point such a person will transition to an immigration pathway under which they progress to settled status in their own right. This could, for example, involve specifying an age limit below which some mandatory requirements (i.e. the requirement to have paid NICs in the 3 years prior to applying) are waived.

We intend to adhere to commitments laid out in the 2025 UK Immigration White Paper, titled Restoring Control over the Immigration System, to ensure children who have been in the UK for most of their life, turn 18 and discover they do not have status, are fully supported and able to regularise their status and settle. We plan to put in place appropriate safeguards for children who were not aware they were here unlawfully and who have not previously been involved with their immigration status.

Vulnerable groups and compassionate circumstances

There are existing arrangements under which settlement may be granted, without being subject to a minimum qualifying period of residence, to adult family members needing long-term care from a UK-based relative; to individuals whose relationship (on a partner visa) has broken down due to domestic abuse; those entering the UK on resettlement schemes; and to partners of UK citizens or settled persons who have died. We will continue to have pathways to settlement for these groups. We are consulting on whether

and how an earned settlement system may be tailored for these groups and other groups that may require such treatment in the light of their vulnerability or compassionate circumstances.

HM Armed Forces

The Armed Forces Covenant is a national commitment that those who serve or have served in HM Armed Forces should not face disadvantage due to their service. The government recognises the sacrifices made by service personnel and their families — including the loss of civilian freedoms — in defence of the UK. The government is committed to upholding the Covenant by ensuring fair treatment for all who serve or have served, including non-UK personnel. The consultation will seek views on the treatment of armed forces members under the earned settlement system, but we are not proposing that HM Armed Forces and their family members should have a different pathway to settlement than they do today.

Transitional Arrangements

This consultation includes questions intended to seek respondents' views on how far the implementation of the earned settlement model should be accompanied by transitional measures.

Transitional arrangements refer to temporary measures or rules put in place to manage the shift from one system, or policy framework, to another. Without any transitional arrangements, the earned settlement policy will affect people already in the system, who are not already settled when relevant Immigration Rules come into force. Transitional arrangements may be designed to ease the impact of policy change, especially for individuals or groups already afforded permissions by the previous system. The consultation seeks views on whether there should be transitional arrangements for those already on a pathway to settlement.

Citizenship

The Immigration White Paper also stated that reforms to citizenship will be introduced, and that these would build on any changes made to settlement through the earned settlement approach. These would aim to reflect similar principles for extending qualifying periods, while allowing those who have made greater contributions to qualify sooner.

We recognise both that primary legislation will be required to make any changes to the British Nationality Act 1981 and that any recommendations should understandably await this consultation process for settlement and subsequent decisions on approaches to be taken. The processes for applicants to reach settlement and then move on to citizenship will need to work together and make sense, for both the applicant and the system.

Exporting carceral migration “management”: €30 million from the EU to Senegal for migration control

Exporting carceral migration “management”: €30 million from the EU to Senegal for migration control

Topic

Country/Region

€30 million from the EU's aid budget has been provided to Senegal for migration control. An examination of European Commission documents makes clear the main focus of the funding: border surveillance and control, maritime interception of people trying to leave Senegal to travel to European territory, and reception/detention infrastructure.

Key points

In October 2024 the EU announced it would provide €30 million from its aid budget to Senegal

The funding focuses on stepping up the fight against migrant smuggling: measures to enhance border surveillance and control, maritime interception, and reception/detention infrastructure

The funding priorities align with some of those supported by the Senegalese government elected in April 2024, but also fit neatly into longer-term dynamics of cooperation with the EU and other external actors

Ultimately, the plans can be seen as contributing to a new era of carceral EU migration “management” in West Africa

EU budget boost for Senegal

In October 2024, Jutta Urpilainen, the former European Commissioner for International Partnerships, visited Senegal. During the visit she announced that the Commission would be providing a fresh €30million to support Senegalese authorities in their fight against irregular migration.

According to Urpilainen at the time, the funding will “strengthen capacity to provide relief to migrants, fight trafficking, and raise awareness.” Recent reporting by Andrei Popviciu and documents obtained through requests to EU institutions offer more detail on the EU’s and Senegal’s plans.

The funding will come from the EU’s “Flexible Mechanism for Migration and Forced Displacement in Subsaharan Africa Action” (pdf), part of the EU’s almost €80 billion Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI).

Most of it will be distributed through the second phase of the Common Operational Partnership (pdf) (Partenariat Opérationnel Conjoint), a police cooperation project. While the first phase of the POC project focused on the fight against criminal networks tied to smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings, the second phase now also includes efforts to curb terrorism.

The budget increase follows “high-level discussions” between the EU and Senegal defining “common interests in the areas of border management, prevention, smuggling, and information communication.” These common interests are also influenced by long term cooperation between the EU and Senegal in the field of migration control, and the longstanding role of external actors in Senegalese migration and border governance.

Peak in arrivals on the Canary Islands and long-term EU involvement

Urpilainen’s announcement came in the context of an all-time high in arrivals on the so-called Atlantic Route to the Canary Islands from Senegal, Mauritania, and Morocco. In 2024 this was the deadliest migration route in the world. The increase in arrivals took place in the context of the EU and Senegal’s long engagement on containing and constraining mobility.

Beyond the Common Operational Partnership (COP), the EU has a broader stake in migration “management” in Senegal. Its long-term engagements include so-called capacity building projects seeking to enhance border and surveillance infrastructure. Development aid has been deployed to curb the so-called root-causes of migration.

The EU previously also had an operational presence in the country. From Between 2006 and 2018, Frontex conducted surveillance of Senegal’s maritime borders (pdf) under its Operations Hera II and III. Spain’s Guardia Civil are still present, with at least four boats deployed.

Diverging and converging interests in Senegal–EU migration cooperation

Hoping to re-deploy Frontex to Senegal, in July 2022 the Council of the EU authorised negotiations on a “status agreement”. This would let Frontex conduct border surveillance operations in the country. Negotiations on a working arrangement on technical cooperation between Frontex and Senegal were noted in EU documents as early as 2016.

The reinstalment of Frontex (pdf) remains a key priority of the EU, but is a contentious issue (pdf). In absence of an agreement to monitor Senegalese waters, Frontex entered into discussions with the Authorities of Cape Verde regarding aerial surveillance on the so-called Atlantic route (pdf).

The flights were officially launched in November 2025, aiming “to enhance situational awareness over the Atlantic.” This is despite reported internal concerns over human rights protection, in particular in regard to the principle of non-refoulement, raised by Frontex's Fundamental Rights Officer, Jonas Grimheden.

Cooperation on deportation is another contentious topic between Senegal and the EU. To enhance pressure on this front, the Commission proposed ‘visa sanctions’ in 2022. They have not yet been approved by the Council. The EU is also stalling the launch of a Talent Partnership (pdf) with Senegal, which would open legal migration routes.

In recent years there have been demonstrations in Senegal in relation to European immigration policies. Protesters have denounced the unjust treatment of visa applicants by European and other embassies, calling for swifter and less stringent application procedures, the suspension of outsourcing, and the reduction of waiting times.

Civil society actors, including the Senegalese branch of Amnesty International, have expressed serious concerns over the potential deployment of Frontex. Others, such as Boza Fii, have actively organized against its presence.

The linkage of migration governance, growing social inequality and extractivism, most notably industrial fishing, has also been clearly noted by Senegalese civil society. Meanwhile, the loss of lives along the Atlantic route remains a major concern for affected communities.

Convergence despite contention: stopping illegalised migration

The EU considers that the Senegalese government has a clear interest in “developing an effective system of border management, including maritime, land borders and international airports.” Indeed, cooperation in the field of border and migration control between the two sides has been going on for years.

In March 2024, the party Patriotes africains du Sénégal pour le travail, l'éthique et la fraternité (PASTEF) won both the presidential and parliamentary elections. The party has an an ostensibly anti-imperialist and neo-sovereigntist agenda.

The current focus on stopping illegalised departures follows initiatives taken up by the previous government. In late 2020, Senegal launched its Interministerial Committee for the Fight against Irregular Migration (Comité Interministériel de Lutte contre la Migration Irrégulière, CILMI), which formulated the country’s 2023 Strategy to Fight Irregular Migration.

After a tragic shipwreck costing the lives of at least 37 passengers in September 2024, Senegal’s president Bassirou Diomaye Faye reasserted the government’s commitment to stopping migrant smuggling. In April this year the prime minister, Ousman Sonko, announced the government’s intention to penalize smugglers more harshly.

The additional budget support announced by the EU in October 2024 is set to support these and related initiatives, propping up an increasingly restrictive approach towards illegalized emigration.

Funding migration control: from a Trust Fund to a Flexible Mechanism

As noted, the €30 million will be distributed via the EU’s Flexible Mechanism for Migration and Forced Displacement in Subsaharan Africa. This is part of the near-€80 billion Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation (NDICI) budget.

The Flexible Mechanism follows on from the EU Trust Fund for Africa, and is designed to:

Strengthen partner countries’ cooperation with the EU on migration and forced displacement

Support partner countries’ national and sub-national capacities to tackle migration and/or forced displacement challenges identified in migration dialogues with the EU

The funding provided through the Flexible Mechanism comes with strong conditions attached (pdf). Country interventions depend not only on the displacement situation faced by the country concerned, but also on its relations with the EU and level of engagement on:

the fight against migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings;

hosting migrants and/or displaced people in line with EU and international standards;

reinforcing “migration management capacities”;

deportations and reintegration;

legal migration and the implementation on the Global Compact on Refugees.

€30 million for border control, surveillance, and detention

A European Commission “concept note” (pdf), released following an access to documents request, offers more insight into what will be funded by the €30 million budget increase. Four key objectives (table 1) are supposed to be achieved across five axes (table 2).

Most of the actions seek to enhance the border control and surveillance powers of the Senegalese security forces, raising serious concerns regarding the potential for human rights abuses. Similar issues arise with the actions linked to enhanced protection and assistance to migrants.

Table 1: Four key objectives of the action (compiled by author)

Table 2: Principal axis of the action (compiled by the author)

Enhancing border control, surveillance, and intelligence capacity

Under the Flexible Mechanism, numerous measures to reinforce border control and surveillance at Senegal’s maritime, riparian, land, and air borders are foreseen. Measures include the acquisition of border patrol boats for the police and gendarmerie (some with search and rescue capacity), and the building of the infrastructure needed to manage and maintain the vessels. It was expected that 15 boats would be provided by mid-2025.

Increased securitisation of the land border entails construction and rehabilitation of border posts. There is significant emphasis in the documents “interconnection of these posts” and facilitating communication between gendarmerie, police, and customs, as well as material support to the territorial brigades of the gendarmerie.

Support will also be provided to what might seem rather unusual actors in a border control context: the National Agency for Maritime Affairs (Agence Nationale des Affaires Maritime) and the Fisheries Directorate (Direction des Pêches).

This is linked to the development of a regulatory framework for the registration of small boats and motors. The aim is to enhance state control over vessels and to facilitate investigations if they are used for illegalised maritime migration.

Financing and training (new) migration control actors

There are further steps aimed at strengthening of intelligence and investigation work. The regional branches of the National Division to Fight Migrant Smuggling and Assimilated Practices (Division Nationale de Lutte contre le Traffic de Migrants et Practices Assimilées) will have their “operational capacity” reinforced, building on previous EU funding.

The National Division to Fight Migrant Smuggling was founded in January 2018. It initially received bilateral support from France. Follow-up support came from the EU’s Common Operational Partnership. The Division is part of Senegal’s border police (Direction General de la Police de l’Air et des Frontières).

With around fifty police officers working under the authority of a police commissioner, it has become the key security actor in the country’s efforts against migrant smuggling. Besides its headquarters in the capital, the EU has funded regional branches in Rosso, Karang, Tambacounda, Kédougou, Saint Louis, Saly, and Ziguinchor.

Additionally, the creation of a new border patrol unit (Unités de Patrouilles Frontalières) will be supported. In line with long-ongoing negotiations, “synergies” with Frontex are expected.

Finally, the EU funding aims to improve investigations on fraudulent documents. To do so, the creation, equipping and training of a Division of Investigation against Fraudulent Documents at the heart of the Police de l’Air et des Frontières is planned.

Finally, there will be funding for information campaigns aimed at deterring illegalised migration. These will be based on the experience gained through the EUTF funded ‘Tekki fii’ project.

Building so-called “reception centres”

The Commission “concept note” further reveals that the EU also plans to fund the construction of four reception centres for “rescued/ intercepted migrants”.

Given the EU’s track record both within and without its borders, any proposal to fund “reception centres” requires close scrutiny. Examined in context, there is a very strong risk that “interception for search and rescue” will become “interception for detention”.

The proposed locations for the “reception centres” are Saint Louis, M’bour, the port of Dakar and Dakar airport. The funding will also support the development and implementation of a Standard Operating Procedure on disembarkation of rescued people. This was recently developed by the International Organization for Migration, alongside the development of procedures and internal directives.

The “protection” element of the action pertains predominantly to the treatment of people once intercepted and detained. The intention is to contract civil society organisations to monitor the treatment of migrants and advise security forces on their rights.

A de facto detention infrastructure?

There is a significant risk that the so-called reception centres will end up as a de facto detention infrastructure. The “concept note” specifies that migrants should stay in these centres for the first 72 hours after rescue/interception.

The document contains a reference to a distinct zone for “smugglers” in the centres. Here, interviews for investigative purposes would be carried out and people may be detained for longer periods.

How this will work in practice remains to be seen, and may lead to the long-term detention of migrants. The Senegalese legal framework (Law 2005-06 of 10 May 2005) does not meaningfully distinguish between smugglers and migrants.

Article 12 of the law says migrants should be excluded from prosecution only if they were not aware that they were committing an offence. Recent research, longer-standing work and recent reporting highlight that migrants have been prosecuted under the law.

A proposal to amend the law was technically adopted in 2019. This would have introduced a distinction between smugglers and migrants, thereby aligning the Senegalese legal framework with the UN Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. However, it has not yet been legally adopted.

The idea of building “reception centres” as such is not new. It first appeared officially in Senegal’s National Strategy for the Fight against Irregular Migration. The strategy calls for “administrative detention centres” at border crossing points.

Currently, post-interception practice involves holding migrants in police custody for between 72 and 96 hours. With police stations often ill-equipped to host larger groups, accommodation in classrooms has been noted.

A report by the IOM on disembarkation assistance highlights the crude detention/assistance logic at play: “Migrants often hide in local populations, which slows down the investigation and does not allow for appropriate support for the victims.”

Whatever the Senegalese government’s own political rationales, external partners have encouraged more prosecutions for migrant smuggling.

One of the indicators used to measure the success of EU funding under the Flexible Mechanism (pdf) is the number of cases investigated and prosecuted. The number of convictions was used as an indicator in a previous Joint EU–Senegal Strategy Document that guided cooperation and programming.

Maritime containment rather than enhanced sea rescue capacity

The concept note also foregrounds the need to enhance search and rescue capacity and the imperative of saving lives at sea.

Measures foreseen include improving of surveillance capabilities and setting up a coordination centre for maritime operations in Dakar, which will have four antennas in coastal regions: Saint-Louis, Petite-Cote, Saloum, and “South”.

The coordination centre will focus solely on cases related to smuggling of migrants, trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking, and piracy.

It will coexist with Senegal’s main Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and its secondary rescue centres. These operate under the High Authority for the Coordination of Maritime Safety, Maritime Security and Protection of the Marine Environment (Haute Autorité chargée de la Coordination de la Sécurité maritime, de la Sûreté maritime et de la Protection de l’Environnement marin), established in 2006.

The Decree establishing the High Authority gives it responsibility for coordination in all areas relating to safety, security, and environmental protection within maritime and inland waters under Senegalese jurisdiction (article 3). In normal circumstances it is responsible for ensuring the operational readiness of the main Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre and the secondary rescue centres (article 6).

The Order on the Organisation and Functioning of the High Authority (also approved in 2006) further defines its role. It should coordinate all missions carried out by the specialised bodies, gendarmerie, national police and the navy that promote a secure maritime environment. This includes the safeguarding of persons (article 15 and 16).

However, coordination of migration-related maritime incidents is carried out by a parallel structure coordinated by security forces. Interventions at sea with a “migration mandate” (relating to both interception and rescue) are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Armed Forces, which is supported by the Spanish Guardia Civil.

Interceptions, meaning the act of stopping, detaining, or redirecting a vessel before it reaches its intended destination represent nearly all cases coordinated under this framework. Interception is distinct from rescue, the latter being life-saving assistance to a vessel and its occupants that are in distress or danger at sea.

Interception itself can be deadly and dangerous, as illustrated in 2023 case in which 17 passengers of a boat lost their lives. Furthermore, a recent study published by Statewatch and the Transnational Institute finds that 92.3% of all interceptions carried out under Frontex’s Operation Hera II amounted to pushbacks.

The EU-funded action proposes enhancing search and rescue capacities and protecting migrants’ lives. However, it misses the chance to invest in Senegal’s overall maritime coordination infrastructure, focusing instead on the country’s migration interception infrastructure. This mirrors the EU’s wider “Rescue-Through-Interdiction/Rescue-Without-Protection’ Paradigm.”

This comes at the same time that artisanal fishing along Senegal’s coasts, an important economic sector increasingly under pressure, is becoming more dangerous and deadly. This demise is linked to industrial overfishing and oil and gas exploitation along the Senegalese coast. It is an important factor in many young people’s decision to leave.

An investment the country’s overall search and rescue coordination infrastructure could have at least contributed to enhancing the human security of all actors present in the Senegalese maritime space.

Lip service to human rights

The underlying aims of the €30 million budget are interception, detention and an instrumental concern for human life. The initiative maps onto longer-term developments predating the change of government in 2024, marked by the long-term involvement of external actors, often operating with EU funding.

The intervention is indicative of a wider regional trend of EU-funded actions enforcing detention and disregarding human rights concerns. This comes in the guise of “fighting migrant smuggling,” which is both a condition for and objective of EU financial support.

Together, these factors constitute the building blocks of a new era of carceral EU migration “management” in West Africa.

Good morning Chair Restler and Members of the Committee, and thank you for convening this important hearing on protecting New York City from federal overreach. This is an urgent moment. National Guard or federal troops have been deployed, against the wishes of state and local elected officials, to Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, Washington DC, and now Charlotte, stoking fear, provoking chaos, and imposing federal power in a manner designed to undermine constitutional democracy. ICE agents are lawlessly abducting our neighbors every single day. President Trump has weaponized federal funding, using taxpayer dollars for purposes of coercion and extortion.

Now, in the wake of New Yorkers’ election of Mayor-election Zohran Mamdani, Trump and his Administration are threatening to send troops here, to further ratchet up ICE agents’ brownshirted abductions across the five boroughs, and to cut off funds to which we are legally entitled. It is a critical moment for unified action by New York’s local, state, and federal officials. It has been profoundly disappointing that Eric Adams has utterly failed to stand up for New Yorkers in the face of this federal onslaught; and let’s be clear: that’s a key reason why voters utterly rejected him at the polls. Thank you to the City Council for approaching this issue with the deadly seriousness it requires, and for convening today’s hearing. This is a moment for New Yorkers to be united in our resolve.

Federal overreach has primarily taken on three forms: (1) aggressive abduction, detention, and deportation of immigrants, without sufficient legal basis; (2) weaponizing and withdrawal of federal funds; and (3) deployment of out-of-state National Guard or federal troops without sufficient rationale and over the objection of state and local officials. New York City has already seen the first two. Now, we are preparing for the third. I will talk briefly about each, and how New York can respond.

Abduction and detention of immigrant New Yorkers, without legal basis

Nearly one in three New Yorkers is an immigrant, and over half of the City’s workforce is made up of immigrants or children of immigrants. These are not just numbers, they are home health aides, delivery workers, small-business owners, students getting their high school diplomas, and parents juggling two jobs. They are New York City.

Trump’s cruel and often lawless mass deportation agenda violates the Constitution, and the values of this immigrant city, with that copper-plated statue in the harbor. In recent months, I have spent a great deal of time in immigration court. It is impossible to sit there, day after day, watching masked ICE agents violate the centuries-old sanctuary of courthouses, separating families and abducting individuals following the rules for seeking asylum pursuant to the global convention against torture, without identifying themselves, presenting warrants, and giving any reason for the arrests, and not feel heartbroken and furious.

And we are already seeing how quickly that agenda can devastate communities. The horrific raid on Canal Street, where immigrant street vendors were swept up in a show of force meant to intimidate an entire neighborhood, is just the first example.

In court, at ICE check-ins, and now increasingly in our neighborhoods, the consequences are not abstract. They fall on real people, with real lives and families and schools and jobs. The Trump Administration has detained or deported thousands of immigrants (and some U.S. citizens), the significant majority of whom had no criminal record and presented no public safety threat. Here are just a few of the New Yorkers we have met in recent weeks whose lives have been upended by this broken system:

Joel, a 16-year-old junior at Gotham Collaborative High School with Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, was detained at his ICE check-in despite having lawful protection. He was taken into ORR custody and held for several weeks before a judge finally ordered his release on November 17, allowing him to return to his loved ones, his community, and his favorite classes.

I watched ICE agents seize “George” immediately after his master calendar hearing, even though the immigration judge had simply asked him to provide additional information for his asylum application and return in April 2026. Agents detained him without verifying his identity and later released him only after realizing he was not the person they were targeting. My office helped connect him with legal services so he can prepare his asylum case.

Following his master calendar hearing, “Connor” was detained by ICE in front of his wife and three young children and transferred to a detention facility in Louisiana. Because NYFIUP contracts restrict out-of-state representation and legal providers in Louisiana are extremely limited, he was unable to secure counsel to appeal a removal order issued against him while he was detained.

These are not isolated cases. They are snapshots of a system designed to intimidate, destabilize, and deport. And it is about to get worse. Just this week, White House Border Czar Tom Homan, who is competing to be both the crudest and cruelest member of the administration, threatened to “flood the zone” and send more federal agents here.

New York City is the largest sanctuary city in the country, home to the largest population of immigrants in the country. With a new incoming Mayor, we have a real opportunity to change course.

Thanks to the Council and immigration advocates, last year’s budget saw a major increase in funding for immigration legal services, but the need remains far greater than the resources we have. These service providers, advocates, volunteers, and mutual aid groups are doing the heavy work, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to show up for immigrant New Yorkers. What is most urgent now is flexible funding that can respond to fast-changing conditions, from full representation in removal proceedings to emergency habeas petitions for New Yorkers taken to out-of-state detention centers, and to expand the capacity of our legal services providers so they can keep pace with the rising demand.

My office looked at how other sanctuary cities are responding and found promising models an incoming Mayor could replicate:

In Los Angeles, the City coordinates rapid response efforts while trusted community groups, labor unions, and mutual aid networks lead the on the ground work, protecting sensitive data and mobilizing quickly when ICE shows up.

In Illinois and Colorado, centralized intake systems gather key information once and route people quickly to the right help, reducing confusion and helping ensure no one falls through the cracks.

In Colorado, nonprofits partner with a vetted network of private immigration attorneys through a shared platform, almost like a virtual law firm, which expands capacity by shifting straightforward cases to private counsel so nonprofits can focus on complex deportation defense.

And in Chicago, the Mayor strengthened sanctuary protections through executive orders requiring clear officer identification, increasing transparency around federal enforcement, and coordinating citywide defense of residents’ rights.

New York City knows how to rise to moments like this. We should advance the bills that will strengthen our sanctuary city laws, like Council Member Hanif’s Trust Act and the New York for All Act at the State level. And we should look to the best practices in other cities to strengthen our legal service and rapid-response capacity today, along with the City–State task force I have called for to identify vulnerable funding streams, so that we are far more prepared for what is coming tomorrow.

My office is preparing a detailed memo for the incoming Mamdani Administration on how it can better coordinate with legal service providers, deploy the funding that the City Council allocated, address procurement issues to deploy these resources effectively, and provide legal protection, advice, and representation to as many of our neighbors as possible. We will of course be glad to provide it to the Council as well.

Weaponizing and withdrawal of federal funds

Just days after the election, my office released Protecting NYC, a report that assessed the risks ahead, from threats to the City’s budget, economy, and infrastructure to the rights and protections of the most vulnerable New Yorkers. It identified how federal funding cuts, immigration enforcement, infrastructure pullbacks, and civil rights rollbacks could play out in real time. Many of those risks are now coming to fruition, and still the City did next to nothing to prepare.

When we uncovered that 80 million dollars in FEMA funds, money already disbursed to New York City, had been quietly clawed back by the Trump Administration, and Mayor Adams was failing to do anything about it, we forced the Adams Administration to sue to get our money back. That case is still in court. The Law Department is working diligently to get our money back, but it is woefully understaffed.

At the same time, New York City’s funds have been clawed back or jeopardized in many other areas as well. Trump has canceled or delayed $450 million in clean energy grants, $34 in counterterrorism funding, millions is grant for afterschool and other public education programs, and $18 billion in infrastructure funding. Now, following the election of Zohran Mamdani, Trump has threatened to withhold more funds, essentially seeking to punish New Yorkers for exercise our constitutional rights to elect our own representatives.

Mayor-elect Mamdani has rightly pledged to quickly hire additional attorneys, and to work closely with New York State Attorney General Tish James and Governor Hochul on more coordinated litigation to protect New York City’s funds. This is critical. These are funds that were legally appropriated by Congress, and are due to New York City. We need a coordinated, aggressive legal approach to get them back.

Ultimately, I am optimistic that courts will order these funds be released to us. However, it may take many months or even years for those cases to work their way through the court system. That’s why a better-coordinated financial strategy is needed.

In my Tin Cup Day remarks last year, I urged the creation of a City and State task force to identify which funding streams were most at risk from federal retaliation, and to allocate additional funding to the General Reserve to make sure we have sufficient funds to avoid sudden cuts to housing, public health, human services, or infrastructure. That work is even more urgent now.

As we approach budget season for both the State and City, I urge leaders to work together on a coordinated plan, that includes transparent identification of the funds that are at risk, coordinated legal strategy, an increase in the General Reserve, and regular updates from elected officials, in a united fashion. As we move past the shameful capitulation of the Adams Administration, I hope elected officials across levels of government will work together. Governor Hochul, Attorney General James, and Mayor-elect Mamdani can lead the way – and include legislative leaders from the State Legislature and the City Council, the State and City Comptrollers, our District Attorneys, and of course a wide array of other stakeholders as well. This is a time for united action.

National Guard and federal troop deployment

United action is what we will need as well in the face of anticipated deployment of out-of-state National Guard and federal troops. As lawyers for Portland and Chicago have argued in court, these deployments violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the President’s power to federalize the Guard, or for federal troops to engage in civilian law enforcement.

New York State and New York City are working together, first in efforts to persuade Trump not to deploy troops here (which is worth trying, of course, given Trump’s mercurial nature), but also on aggressive legal strategies to enjoin any such deployment. I am encouraged by the cooperation of Governor Hochul and Mayor-elect Mamdani in these efforts. Though they come from different wings of the Democratic Party, they are showing a commitment to work together that can serve as a model for all of us.

Maybe, somehow, despite their cruelty, ignorance, thuggish instincts, and willingness to violate the Constitution, Trump and Homan will wise up and decide not to try to deploy the National Guard or federal troops here. They got a taste of how New Yorkers will respond on Canal street, when dozens of regular New Yorkers – not people who had downloaded a resistance app or purchased whistles in advance – surrounded the agents, and made clear that New Yorkers revile ICE.

Through persuasion and some amount of acceptable flattery of his monstrous ego; through clarity that federal occupation will not ultimately succeed, and in fact will have a significant political backlash for Trump, as we saw in this month’s elections; and through a proactive and coordinated legal strategy, hopefully we can avoid the stationing of federal troops here.

Taking action together

But if Trump proceeds with the deployment, as seems likely, we will all need to work together to respond. Hands Off NYC is a coalition of over 100 community groups, labor unions, advocacy organizations, businesses, and other stakeholders, providing New Yorkers with know-you-rights training, ICE watch, how to organize and mobilize neighborhood support, nonviolent resistance, and more.

It has been heartening to see New Yorkers taking action together by the hundreds of thousands – turning out to the No Kings and Hands Off NYC marches, participating in courtwatching at 26 Federal Plaza, showing up for neighbors in grassroots ways as on Canal Street, or in more coordinated actions.

Just this weekend, I was out with Councilmembers Hanif and Aviles, as we reached out to hundreds of businesses, many of whom employ immigrants, to talk about action they can take to protect employees and neighbors. Some of the steps people can take are simple but powerful. While ICE agents are allowed to come into the parts of a store where customers are allowed, if store owners or managers simply place an “Employees Only” sign on the break room, supply room, or employee bathroom, now ICE agents would need to present a judicial warrant for entry.

We are doing this work in a spirit of patriotism, building a broad coalition, and in the spirit of nonviolent civil disobedience and bearing witness. That is the spirit in which I started attending court hearings at 26 Federal Plaza in June, as a result of which I was arrested by ICE agents in June while simply trying to accompany an asylum-seeker named Edgardo out of 26 Federal Plaza. That is the spirit in which I joined with other elected officials and New Yorkers in an effort to conduct oversight of the tenth floor at 26 Federal Plaza and to see whether ICE was complying with a federal injunction limiting detention and requiring humane conditions like clean bedding, hygiene supplies, and access to counsel. Instead of transparency, we were met with obstruction and arrest.

This week, we had our first court appearance on that arrest. While the legislators received adjournments in contemplation of dismissal, I chose to move forward with trial – because the real crime is not what we did in the elevator lobby demanding access, but what ICE is doing behind those closed doors. If ICE and DHS can question why I stood in that hallway, then I will question what they were doing on the other side of it.

In federal court this week, we participated in due process. But our immigrant neighbors have not. And we intend to use our platform to ensure the rule of law.

Finally, the actions we are discussing today are consistent with our history as New Yorkers. Next year, we will celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of this country. Just six weeks after the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, British troops occupied New York City, following the Battle of Brooklyn. What followed was a seven-year long occupation, characterized by martial law, harsh conditions, extensive damage to the city, and cruel detentions.

New Yorkers resisted tyranny then; and we are resisting tyranny now. Lets act together so that, when the history books are written, they reflect that Trump’s tyranny began to fail when he sought to occupy New York City, in the days after we elected Zohran Mamdani as our mayor – our first Muslim mayor, and our first immigrant mayor in generations – and New Yorkers remembered who we are, remembered what it means to wake up every day in this city with that copper-plated statue in the harbor, and relit the lamp of liberty, for the whole world to see.

New Yorkers have risen to these challenges before. We can do it again now.

Thank you again, Chair Restler, and thank you to the Council for your commitment to protecting the people who make this city home.

We didn’t take them to court on the FEMA funding. You could say we threatened to take it to court ourselves.

People throughout Charlotte have been using many of the same tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights.
There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.
“I’m not sure which of my students I’m going to see again,” Gillespie told CNN affiliate WCNC.
High school students in the district staged a walkout Tuesday morning to protest immigration enforcement in the city.","The pews of the Charlotte church were packed as onlookers watched a man restrain a woman while a group in bright vests furiously blew their whistles and filmed the interaction, chanting, “La migra esta aqui.”

Another group loudly sang, “This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine.”

Clapping then erupted from the crowd.

The scene was among several role-play scenarios hundreds watched Wednesday evening at Dilworth United Methodist Church as part of a training on how to respond to the expanding federal immigration enforcement operation that has gripped the Charlotte area and left residents on high alert.

“Let’s practice our whistling language,” Rev. Joel Simpson, a pastor at First United Methodist Church in Taylorsville, said before a dissonant symphony of whistles filled the church.

“We’re going to report active operations that are happening in our city, alert people nearby and offer reminders of our rights,” Simpson, who led the training, told the crowd. “We’re going to document and record unlawful practices, and we’re going to deter violence by getting as many people as possible to join quickly as an organized presence.”

The plan is simple: Volunteers sign up for shifts and receive instructions from a “patrol dispatch team” on specific zones in Charlotte they will drive around in and alert people when they see immigration enforcement activity. They’re advised to do it in pairs, keep a safe distance from agents and to never try to physically impede law enforcement.

The initiative is just one of many launched by Charlotte residents to help immigrant neighbors as the Trump administration touts over 250 arrests in the area since the aggressive immigration crackdown began over the weekend.

Parents are banding together to guard school entrances or carpool students to class, and business owners across the city are patrolling their neighborhoods and closing their doors to protect their customers.

People throughout Charlotte have been using many of the same tactics employed in Chicago – including watching for raids, blowing warning whistles and carrying signs advising people of their rights. Flags from Honduras, Colombia and Mexico were seen adorning cars and hanging from homes and businesses.

Still, the fear throughout the city is palpable: families are keeping their children home from school and taking off from work, worrying they’ll be targeted by federal immigration agents.

‘Loving your neighbors is holy’

Immigrant worker group Siembra NC organized Wednesday’s event at the church to train volunteers to help immigrants safely get to school and work and guard against constitutional violations during immigration enforcement activities, according to the organization.

Volunteers stood outside the church doors, passing out warning whistles and held signs saying “Loving your neighbors is holy.”

Hundreds of volunteers have attended training sessions held by the group to help immigrants as they travel within the city, document and record “unlawful practices” by agents and warn about enforcement activity, Simpson said.

“They’re coming out on weeknights and they’re saying this is how we need to be spending our time and we want to be on the streets and in our communities, making sure people are cared for,” Simpson told CNN.

Over 1,000 people registered for Wednesday’s training and some people had to be turned away, the pastor said.

Simpson said they got “best practices” from other communities that have been stops in the administration’s immigration blitz, including Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, DC.

“People are telling me as they go through this training like, ‘I’m feeling empowered,’” he said. “‘I feel like I can do something and there’s a way to channel my love and my anger and my fear into something that supports other people.’”

That was the case for Maria Klein, who has used the training as a way to channel her frustration about the crackdown in her city.

She attended the training because she cares about “our children who should be able to go to school safely, for our parents who should be able to go to work for the American dream.” Klein, who teaches English as a Second Language to adults, says many of her students have stopped attending class.

“This was an opportunity to really do something practical and to have an immediate impact,” Klein told CNN.

Parents and teachers help families as school attendance plummets

“What is gonna happen if I go home and my parents aren’t there?”

“What does that mean if my parents get taken away?”

These are the questions teacher Jamie Roldan told CNN she has been getting from students at Charlotte East Language Academy since the immigration crackdown began in the city.

“I tell them that I’m gonna fight if someone comes to my door. I’m fighting – hands, feet, it doesn’t matter. You’re not coming in my classroom and taking any of my kids,” Roldan said. “My classroom is a safe space and it will stay that way.”

Amid “Operation Charlotte’s Web” – the immigration enforcement operation in the city named after the classic 1952 children’s book – more than 30,000 students were absent from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools on Monday, about 20% of the district’s enrollment.

“We just understand that they were not in school receiving education, advancing their social skills and we know that that there was an impact to those homes where parents had to modify their work schedules,” Charlotte Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson told CNN Wednesday. “They had to have an economic impact out of fear that something would occur at those schools.”

The district issued a statement Sunday night that no immigration activity had happened on their campuses and that leaders hadn’t been informed of impending action. There were no reports of immigration enforcement on their campuses on Monday or Tuesday.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools teacher David Gillespie says hallways and classrooms were nearly empty on Monday.

“I’m not sure which of my students I’m going to see again,” Gillespie told CNN affiliate WCNC. “Whether because their parents were involved in detainments or because their parents have to make that unfortunate safety calculus — is it worth it to send my kids to school and put myself at risk?”

As attendance plummets, some parents in the district are organizing to help families who are afraid to leave their homes.

Some PTA members are standing guard at school entrances during drop-off and pick-up so they can alert staff and families if they see federal immigration agents, WCNC reported. Others are passing out information packets and using PTA funds to help families experiencing food insecurity or transportation issues.

“We’re standing there bearing witness and being part of the community,” PTA member Amy Hawnelson told WCNC. “They do not stick around — and that’s why we’re here.”

Another member, Mike Mastry, said they want to help students feel safe at school.

“Seeing a familiar face that’s friendly and smiling helps bring a sense of normalcy,” Mastry told WCNC. “When kids don’t know what’s going on, they get disoriented and have trouble learning.”

Roldan said parents with legal status are picking up children whose parents may not have legal status to bring them to school.

Gillespie says he’s reaching out to families to help students stay on top of schoolwork.

Extracurriculars have been impacted by the operation too. OurBRIDGE, an organization that helps newly arrived immigrant children and their families, has suspended its afterschool programs after Border Patrol activity at one of its sites, the group announced on social media.

High school students in the district staged a walkout Tuesday morning to protest immigration enforcement in the city. Several hundred students gathered around the edge of a football field at East Mecklenburg High School, many wearing black and holding flags, photos of the demonstration showed.

“The students’ main objective is to provide protection and cover to their fellow students of immigrant descent,” a news release on the demonstration said.

Business owners work to protect customers

Charlotte business owner Bryan Li enrolled in a training session offered by a local advocacy group and has been out patrolling the city the past few days, looking for federal agents and reporting back to advocacy groups that alert the community.

Li, a US citizen born in Hong Kong, told CNN he couldn’t sit at home and not do something.

“When harm is done, more people rally, learn and prepare so we can help protect our most vulnerable,” Li told CNN. “Charlotte will stand united and protect our immigrant community with everything we have.”

While people like Li patrol the city, many businesses have shuttered their doors, fearing their customers will be a target.

About half the mom-and-pop businesses the community development organization CharlotteEast works with have closed their doors at some point, despite all of them being owned by US citizens, Executive Director Greg Asciutto said Tuesday.

“From strictly an economic standpoint, it’s pretty catastrophic right now,” Asciutto said, comparing current closures to the first week of the coronavirus pandemic in the area.

A Colombian bakery open for 28 years closed its doors Saturday after men in tactical gear chased and tackled people outside the shop. Community members showed up afterwards to guard the business.

Beth Clements, who stood outside the bakery wearing a yellow vest, had been standing guard there for three days.

“I’m going to walk the streets with my whistle and I want to keep my neighbors protected because they deserve protection and they deserve to live in a world where they’re not scared,” Clements said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2247342884-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-20 09:58:29.825575

It came as activists in Eugene-Springfield reported another uptick in ICE activity Wednesday, including near the Marcola Apartments on Pierce Parkway.

University of Oregon General Counsel Jessica Price warned faculty could be charged if they try to stop a detainment, or guide a student to an alternate exit to avoid federal law enforcement.

She said while classrooms are generally private spaces, hallways are public and ICE officers can access them.

""Someone with really good intentions might promise someone safety and say, 'in my class, you are safe,'"" said Price. ""And I would say, don't make promises you can't keep.”

Price said if staff are presented with a warrant from federal law enforcement, they should forward it along to the university's legal team.

The operation that began over the weekend is the latest phase of Republican President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation efforts that have sent the military and immigration agents into Democratic-run cities — from Chicago to Los Angeles.

Immigration officials have blanketed the country since January, pushing detention counts to all-time highs above 60,000. Big cities and small towns across the country are targeted daily amid higher-profile pushes in places such as Portland, Oregon, where more than 560 immigration arrests were made in October. Smaller bursts of enforcement have popped up elsewhere.

The push to carry out arrests in North Carolina expanded to areas around the state capital of Raleigh on Tuesday, spreading fear in at least one immigrant-heavy suburb.

Late Wednesday, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said via the social platform X that “border patrol enforcement appears to have been suspended” in the city. DHS did not announce a change to its presence and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The number of arrests around Charlotte and beyond during what the government has dubbed “ Operation Charlotte’s Web ” was about double the total announced by DHS officials earlier this week. The department said in a statement that agencies “continue to target some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens.”

Their targets include people living in the U.S. without legal permission and those who allegedly have criminal records.

Federal officials have offered few details about those arrested. They've also remained quiet about the scope of the enforcement operations across North Carolina and where agents will show up next, keeping communities on edge.

The crackdown in Charlotte has been met with pockets of resistance and protests.

About 100 people gathered outside a Home Depot store in Charlotte on Wednesday, where federal agents have been spotted multiple times since the surge started. Protest organizers briefly went inside the store with orange and white signs that read, “ICE out of Home Depot, Protect our communities.”

Arrests in Charlotte and the Raleigh area have created a chilling effect in immigrant neighborhoods — school attendance dropped, and small shops and restaurants closed to avoid confrontations between customers and federal agents.

Customers at a laundromat left behind their clothes in washers and dryers and haven't returned after agents showed up at a Charlotte shopping center on Sunday, said David Rebolloso, who owns the business.

Agents didn't target his laundromat, but it still impacted his bottom line and shut down the neighboring shops, said Rebolloso, a Mexican American born in Brownsville, Texas.

“We’re only open because I’m an American citizen, so it doesn’t bother me,” he said. “But of course, business is down. I have no customers.”

Just days after beginning the crackdown in North Carolina, Border Patrol agents were expected to arrive in New Orleans by the end of the week to start preparing for their next big operation in southeast Louisiana, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press and three people familiar with the operation.

Around 250 federal border agents are set to descend on New Orleans in the coming weeks for a two-month immigration crackdown expected to begin in earnest on Dec. 1.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander tapped to head the Louisiana sweep, has been on the ground in North Carolina this week, leading the operation there as well.

Louisiana Republicans voiced their support on Wednesday. The chair of the state party, Derek Babcock, said it shows a commitment from Trump and Republican Gov. Jeff Landry to “keeping our citizens safe.”

The head of the state's American Civil Liberties Union chapter said they were compiling information to help people know their rights and coordinating with legal services and groups connected with the immigrant community.

“We urge those with privilege and the opportunity to risk it to stand up for their neighbors and friends,” said Alanah Odoms with the ACLU of Louisiana.

Why it matters: A single joint task force raid last weekend in San Antonio netted more arrests than ICE and Border Patrol's high-profile entry into Charlotte, North Carolina.

The Texas raid, which targeted alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, resulted in more than 140 arrests, Axios San Antonio reported. Two days of surged enforcement in Charlotte totaled 130, according to press statements for the respective operations.

The San Antonio operation also resulted in more arrests than a similar operation in Chicago with federal agents and a Black Hawk helicopter, which caught 37 people.

Zoom in: The task forces, co-led by the FBI and ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit, will eventually have outposts in all 50 states. They're up and running in South Texas, Alaska and Indianapolis.

They'll have a centralized command center led by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Kristi Noem, with a mandate to combat cartels, international gangs and terror groups.

The task forces were established by a Day One Executive Order from Trump and began ""full implementation"" in September, according to the FBI.

Immigrants without status caught in the investigations will either be deported or used ""to pursue investigations and prosecution of those individuals,"" said Section Chief Mark Remily, who leads the Bureau's Transnational Organized Crime Program.

Zoom out: ICE has so far done high-profile operations in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, with one planned after Thanksgiving in New Orleans.

The immigration enforcement agency touts the arrests of the ""worst of the worst."" But it's behind on the administration's ambitious goal of 3,000 arrests a day and one million deportations per year.

To boost stats, the agency has turned to Border Patrol agents, who have used more aggressive tactics to make arrests, to aid its mission.

The result has also led to community resistance as well as lawsuits over excessive use of force, arrests of U.S. citizens and warrantless arrests.

Between the lines: The new task forces are drawing agents to their mission, as concerns grow that thousands of law enforcement officers are being assigned to the immigration agenda instead of their prior roles, as the New York Times investigated.

The priority shift has led to a drop in investigations on child trafficking, sex crimes and time-sensitive tracking of sanctioned products, like oil from Iran, the Times reports.

""D.H.S. keeps being pulled further away from its core missions in protecting the homeland,"" David Lapan, who served as DHS press secretary during the first Trump administration, told the Times.

The bottom line: ""The government has never had a one centralized location to really combat and coordinate the transnational criminal threats that we target,"" Remily said on the FBI's in-house podcast.",https://images.axios.com/wdKx9Zil7KuRE_qBpfw_mOkEZDY=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/11/19/1763595528028.jpeg,N,,2025-11-20 10:58:00.739864

“We are a city, state and country that has benefited from the hard work of immigrants,” Assm.
Praeli said the Trump administration’s policies have resulted in nearly 200,000 people either being deported or leaving the country on their own.
Those two sectors are expected to be hardest hit because immigrants tend to work in fields such as agriculture and construction.
Many of these people are being pulled from the hospitality and construction industries, she said.","An ongoing federal crackdown on immigrants is shrinking Nevada’s workforce in key industries and the state’s economy could suffer because of it, according to panelists who spoke on the issue earlier this month in Las Vegas.

The aggressive immigration tactics from President Donald Trump’s administration — including multimillion-dollar ads encouraging immigrants to self-deport — could reduce the raw number of workers keeping the state’s economy humming, panelists said at the Nov. 6 event hosted by FWD.us and Dream Big Nevada.

Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) added that immigrants are afraid to go to work, school, hospitals, immigration hearings and other events because of high arrest targets given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — and at least one business owner said he’s seen it firsthand.

“I’m personally seeing on construction sites and in our warehouses we have a lack of the construction workforce because now they’re actually afraid to be on the job site,” said Abraham Camejo, founder of small business Camejo Safety. “So not only am I having to train them and make sure that they’re complying with safety regulations from working on our roofs, on our landscaping jobs, but now they’re afraid of going to work.”

According to Maria Praeli, deputy manager of government operations for FWD.us, a nonprofit that focuses on immigration and criminal justice, Nevada has one of the largest immigrant populations in the country. Immigrants make up a quarter of Nevada’s workforce, with nearly 400,000 workers, and bring in $20.2 billion to the state’s economy.

“We are a city, state and country that has benefited from the hard work of immigrants,” Assm. Howard Watts (D-Las Vegas) said during the event at the East Las Vegas Community Center.

They work across industries, including 36 percent in construction, 31 percent in leisure and hospitality, 25 percent in transportation and 24 percent in agriculture, according to FWD.us. In Las Vegas alone, the immigrant community spends $16.6 billion a year and pays $4.3 billion a year in taxes.

Praeli said the Trump administration’s policies have resulted in nearly 200,000 people either being deported or leaving the country on their own. An analysis by her organization — which was started by Silicon Valley leaders including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and advocates for comprehensive immigration reform — estimates that by the end of the president’s four-year term, the average American family nationwide will have to pay a little over $2,000 a year due to immigration enforcement.

FWD.us ran economic simulations based on 2024 data on immigrant and U.S. workers to see how deportation, a reduction in work permits and a decrease in new workers coming into the country would change labor supply, production costs and ultimately the prices Americans pay by 2028.

The analysis stated “producer prices can be expected to increase by 14.5 percent for most food products and 6.1 percent in construction” because of immigration changes, on top of price changes stemming from other inflationary causes. Those two sectors are expected to be hardest hit because immigrants tend to work in fields such as agriculture and construction.

The report adds that “America’s working class spends most of their income on food and housing, and consequently would experience the highest cost-of-living increases.” This comes even as inflation, affordability and economic concerns are a top priority for voters and immigration being a lower priority.

Praeli said the mass deportations are affecting workers who had previously been authorized to be in the country, such as those here under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and on a Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Many of these people are being pulled from the hospitality and construction industries, she said.

FWD.us said “canceling or restricting legal work permits for those with TPS and other protected statuses, including asylum seekers, would result in nearly 2.6 million workers being sidelined from the labor market.”

Praeli also said the executive order that imposes a $100,000 fee for employers seeking H-1B visas will lead to a “massive loss of highly skilled workers across many industries.”

“We are seeing more talks about the cancellation of work permits for asylum seekers and temporary protective status holders, which will pull even more essential workers out of the economy without action from Congress to protect immigrants,” Praeli said.

Lee said the fight against hard-line immigration policies is a “slow process and it’s hard.” She also noted she cosponsored the Dignity Act, which among other things created protections for asylum seekers. The bill was introduced this summer but has made little progress since.

“It’s heartbreaking for all of us,” Lee said. “We’ve taken issues to the courts, and I know it’s not fast enough but we have been moved to a seismic shift in the environment. All I can say is we can never give up.”",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2025/01/09394fbf-immigration-rally-012125-8-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 10:58:05.013411

Greg Abbott of Texas declared on Tuesday that one of the nation’s largest Muslim advocacy and civil rights groups is a foreign terrorist organization, saying the move will prohibit the organization from acquiring land in Texas and authorize the state attorney general “to sue to shut them down” in Texas.

In his declaration, Abbott said that the group, the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations, had direct ties to Hamas, which has been designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. government. The nonprofit, known by its initials, CAIR, has denied having any such ties.

The governor also suggested, without offering evidence, that CAIR’s leadership sought to impose Islamic law, known as Shariah, on Americans.

The council on Tuesday responded to Abbott in a letter, calling his declaration “defamatory” and saying it had “no basis in law or fact.”

“You do not have the authority to unilaterally declare any Americans or American institutions terrorist groups,” wrote Robert S. McCaw, the council’s director of government affairs. “Nor is there any basis to level this smear against our organization.”

CAIR Attracted Intense Scrutiny

Abbott appeared to be the first state leader to make such a declaration about the organization, which has been a presence in American political debates for more than 30 years. CAIR has attracted intensifying scrutiny and criticism since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the subsequent war in the Gaza Strip.

Abbott’s move went further than the Trump administration has so far been willing to go. His declaration also included the Muslim Brotherhood, a group founded in Egypt almost a century ago that has a range of overseas offshoots.

This year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested that similar actions by the federal government against both groups were “in the works,” But the administration has yet to follow through.

Abbott also went further than the state’s hardline conservative Republican Party leadership, which urged Rubio last month to declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, but did not say the same about CAIR.

Before Abrego Garcia's criminal trial is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to several African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.
Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture.
They have also argued that the Trump administration's repeated efforts to send Abrego Garcia to Africa is a form of retaliation, and Abrego Garcia should instead be sent to Costa Rica.
They noted the government had offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer, but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee.","A top Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is set to testify Thursday about the steps the Trump administration has taken to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the West African country of Liberia, as the Trump administration continues its push to remove him from the U.S. ahead of his criminal trial on human smuggling charges next year.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration urged U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to lift an August order that prevents Abrego Garcia from being deported to a third-party country without due process, arguing that the government has gone through all the necessary steps to remove Abrego Garcia.

Abrego Garcia's case has been a flashpoint in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown since the Salvadoran immigrant was removed from where he lived in Maryland to his native country in March. He was sent to El Salvador even though in 2019, an immigration judge granted him a legal status known as withholding of removal because of concerns Abrego Garcia could be persecuted by gangs there.

He faces deportation proceedings because he entered the U.S. illegally as a teenager in 2011.

In June, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. after he was detained in El Salvador's notorious mega-prison to face two felony charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.

Before Abrego Garcia's criminal trial is scheduled to begin next year, the Trump administration has repeatedly sought to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. again, proposing to send him to several African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and now, Liberia.

The Justice Department said that Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, was interviewed in October by a U.S. government asylum officer, and that officer determined that he failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia. The Justice Department said any additional due process steps would be unwarranted.

Abrego Garcia's ""claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,"" the Justice Department said in its filing. ""This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.""

In addition, the Justice Department submitted declarations from U.S. officials stating that Liberia has made ""sufficient and credible"" assurances that Abrego Garcia would not be harmed there or removed from Liberia to another country where he potentially could be persecuted.

In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on ""a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,"" following a U.S. request.

Abrego Garcia and his legal team have repeatedly challenged the government's attempts to deport him to African nations, claiming fear of persecution or torture. They have also argued that the Trump administration's repeated efforts to send Abrego Garcia to Africa is a form of retaliation, and Abrego Garcia should instead be sent to Costa Rica.

They noted the government had offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer, but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee.

""The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation,"" the attorneys said in a response to the Justice Department's motion.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also asked Xinis to keep her block on his deportation in place ""unless and until an immigration judge concurs"" with the Trump administration's determinations.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/26/85b95d25-c652-4055-894c-5f4fa66c686b/thumbnail/1200x630/ea7c75906231f245785d8803d60fb153/gettyimages-2231358090.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 08:57:00.795983

The coalition says the video appears to show agents pointing guns at a mother and her four children and forcibly removing the mother from her bed.

The ICE agents were reportedly searching for an individual who does not live at the address. According to the coalition and reporting by The City, the agents were looking for the mother’s cousin. All four children are U.S. citizens, The City reported.

“You see ICE agents become aware of the surveillance equipment that is at the home. They move it to not capture what they’re going to be doing,” Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, said in an interview with NY1. He said the cousin ICE was searching for never lived at the home.

“But that didn’t stop them from kicking in their door and terrorizing them,” Awawdeh said. After the cellphone video ends, he said the mother was grabbed by her hair and neck while her children watched.

“Think about the little children who had to witness their mom being manhandled,” he said.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson disputed the coalition’s account, saying allegations that the woman and her children were threatened with firearms were “false.”

“On Thursday, Nov. 13, ICE and U.S. Marshals Service attempted to serve a criminal arrest warrant for Raymundo Gabriel Huerra-Betancourt. His criminal history includes assault, reckless driving, and illegal re-entry. The woman in this video was the target's cousin,” the spokesperson said, adding that the address was listed on Huerra-Betancourt’s probation form and associated with his Social Security number and phone records.

“Officers approached the residence and knocked on the door for approximately 20 minutes, attempting to gain voluntary cooperation to enter the residence. When no response was received, officers used their training and lawfully entered the home. Upon entering the house, Jennifer Diaz, the target's cousin, refused to respond to the officers’ repeated knocking. Diaz refused to comply with officers’ commands despite explicitly being told to exit the room for her safety. Officers safely guided her and the children to the kitchen for their safety while they searched for the criminal target,” the spokesperson added.

The NYPD briefly responded but left after being told it was an ICE operation, as interfering with federal agents is illegal.

“It breaks my heart that a neighbor rightfully thought this was a home invasion, a family got traumatized,” City Councilmember Alexa Aviles, chair of the Committee on Immigration, said. She said the video raises questions about enforcement protocols and due process.

“What's illegal is busting out a door without following appropriate protocol,” Aviles said. “[Dragging] this mother out with her children at gunpoint.”

Advocates say the footage underscores the need for oversight and for families to know their rights.

“They have the right to remain silent, the right to ask for an attorney, the right not to open the door if there is no judicial warrant,"" Awawdeh said.

Their goal, of course, is to gerrymander U.S. House districts for 2026.
Mass immigration distorts both apportionment, which is the distribution of U.S. House seats among states, and also redistricting, which is the drawing of legislative boundaries within states.
The distortion is due to the 25 million noncitizens added to the U.S. population through immigration.
All of these groups show up in census data, but by law they cannot be voters in federal or state elections.","Interest in the midterm elections has developed even earlier than usual this cycle, due in large part to redistricting battles. Six states have already taken the unusual step of redistricting between decennial censuses, with several more states actively considering it. Their goal, of course, is to gerrymander U.S. House districts for 2026. California alone may net five extra seats for Democrats, thanks to its new district lines.

What is sometimes forgotten in the restricting debate is the role that immigration plays in distorting representation, effectively worsening the impacts of gerrymanders. Mass immigration distorts both apportionment, which is the distribution of U.S. House seats among states, and also redistricting, which is the drawing of legislative boundaries within states.

The distortion is due to the 25 million noncitizens added to the U.S. population through immigration. Noncitizens include not only illegal immigrants, but also legal permanent residents, guest workers, foreign students, etc. All of these groups show up in census data, but by law they cannot be voters in federal or state elections.

Rather than apportioning U.S. House seats by the number of eligible voters in each state, the current system apportions seats based on the total population of each state, which includes noncitizens. Since some states have far more noncitizens than average, those states get significantly more representatives per eligible voter than do states with smaller numbers of noncitizens.

Why it matters: In an earlier update, the agency said 44 of the roughly 130 arrests made during the first two days were ""criminal illegal aliens.""

Yes, but: That leaves between 86 and 206 people whose criminal backgrounds or immigration statuses are unclear.

Of the 44, DHS identified only a handful, whom it described as the ""worst of the worst"" criminals. The list included two people whom DHS describes as known gang members. Other crimes ranged from larceny to aggravated assault to driving while intoxicated. One of the featured individuals had only a bench warrant and ""illegal entry"" listed as their crime.

Axios is awaiting a response to a Freedom of Information Act request seeking the full names and criminal backgrounds of those apprehended in Charlotte during ""Operation Charlotte's Web,"" which launched Nov. 15.

Catch up quick: DHS says the purpose of the Charlotte enforcement ""surge"" is to target serious criminals, including alleged murderers and child sex offenders, and those who were released from jail after immigration detainers weren't honored.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden has a reputation for not ""cooperating"" with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but he's since said relationships with federal partners are improving.

Reality check: Nationwide, Border Patrol and ICE agents have been accused of stopping law-abiding citizens of Latino descent and asking them to prove citizenship, or in some cases, wrongfully detaining them.

In Chicago, 97% of undocumented immigrants detained by ICE in raids from June to early October who are still in the country had no criminal record at the time of their arrest, NPR reported, citing a Department of Justice document.

After the Trump administration tripled ICE's quota, arrests of people without criminal charges or convictions spiked, Axios reported in June.

The big picture: The ongoing Charlotte operation, now in its fifth day, is rattling the Latino community and weighing on the local economy. Immigrant-owned businesses have temporarily closed, construction sites have emptied, and school absences have surged.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools reports 30,399 students were absent on Monday. Nearly 25,700 were out on Tuesday, according to unofficial totals.

Read on … to learn more about what LAist uncovered about the latest issue embroiling the city agency responsible for LAX and its contractor.

An ongoing dispute over maintenance of parts of the system that powers the LAX Automated People Mover could be the reason the long-awaited train won’t open until next summer, or even later, according to public documents reviewed by LAist.

The current dispute adds to a long series of disagreements between the city and LINXS, the group of companies contracted to design, build and operate the train, that have led to the ongoing saga of delays, hundreds of millions in cost overruns and diminishing public confidence that there’ll ever be a rail-only connection to LAX.

An L.A. County Civil Grand Jury report released earlier this year claimed that LINXS has used the dispute resolution process and “political pressures” to force contract extensions and additional compensation throughout the design and construction process.

In October, LAist reported about how the train’s estimated completion date moved from early 2026 to next summer. The dispute detailed in the public documents offers a more specific reason for the delay, which was previously opaque.

Dispute over metering cabinet equipment

In February, staff from city agencies directed LINXS to repair faulty equipment in a metering cabinet, according to a summary of the dispute and findings by a third-party evaluator. While the type of equipment isn’t specified, it’s likely related to measuring the power distributed throughout the system.

Power was partially shut down during the period of repair work, which lasted until July 2025.

That power shut-off delayed critical testing of the technology that allows for central control of the train’s systems, according to the third-party evaluator.

The third-party evaluator’s report said LINXS argued it was not required by contract to perform the repair work and is entitled to a schedule extension and compensation. The third-party evaluator, whose recommendations are not legally binding, agreed with LINXS’ position.

Los Angeles World Airports, the agency that manages LAX and the Van Nuys Airport, did not participate in an August hearing regarding the dispute, the third-party evaluator’s findings said.

The agency “rejected” the third-party evaluator’s conclusions, according to a November report from a management consulting firm retained by project lenders to monitor project progress.

What happens next?

According to the project contract, if a dispute remains unresolved after inquiring with the third-party evaluator, the next step is for LINXS to file a claim under a section of state law that governs complaints against public entities.

A section on the California Tort Claims Act on the Sacramento County Public Law Library website notes that the claim is a required precursor to any civil action.

“Filing a claim gives the agency the opportunity to settle the claim before a lawsuit is filed and to investigate the claim so that it can properly defend itself, or to correct the conditions or practices that led to the claim,” the website states.

The management consulting firm’s November report notes that LINXS “formally submitted” a claim on Oct. 21, triggering a 60-day period for the city to “respond to the claim and sets out the basis for the LINXS entitlements to relief.”

“Submission of [the] claim was explicitly requested by [Los Angeles World Airports] as a precursor to negotiation,” the report continues.

The status of the Automated People Mover

In a statement, Los Angeles World Airports said it’s not ""unusual"" to see ""contractual disputes"" on large capital projects like the Automated People Mover and that the train is still on schedule to open to the public next summer.

“LINXS continues to assure us the train will be ready for the FIFA World Cup, but we have back up plans in place to ensure an outstanding experience for all fans who visit Los Angeles,” the statement added. “[Los Angeles World Airports] does not comment on pending legal matters.”

To find the page relevant to the Automated People Mover, head to emma.msrb.org. Then, in the search box on the upper righthand corner, search for 13048VBA5.

Halfway down the page, select the “Disclosure Documents” tab, and you’ll see a list of documents, including the third-party evaluator’s findings, as well as the monthly reports from LINXS and the management consulting firm.

Construction on the project is nearly complete, and most of the current work is focused on testing and ensuring all the parts of the system work together.

In November, Fluor, one of the companies that makes up LINXS, reported to investors that they can expect the Automated People Mover to “reach substantial completion over [the] next 3 quarters.”

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which was also named in the documents about the dispute, declined to comment.

LAist also reached out to LINXS and the companies that make up the group, but did not receive any response.

The management consulting firm also did not respond to emails requesting an interview.

News that Warner Bros. Discovery is up for sale has Hollywood buzzing. The legendary film studio, which has grown to include streaming services and cable channels, is currently accepting non-binding bids until Thursday. According to company spokesperson Robert Gibbs, they expect to have a decision about the sale by Christmas.

It's become something of a Hollywood parlor game to guess who will ultimately take over the business, which was founded in 1923 by four brothers: Harry, Albert, Sam and Jack Warner. They owned a movie theater in Pennsylvania before coming to Hollywood to make movies.

Warner Brothers Pictures found one of its first silent picture stars in a German shepherd named Rin Tin Tin. By 1927, the studio made history with its feature-length ""talkie"" picture: The Jazz Singer, starring Al Jolson.

Over the years, Warner Brothers has made or distributed countless iconic films including: Casablanca, The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon in the 1940's. The list goes on, with titles like A Clockwork Orange, Goodfellas, Barbie, as well as Bugs Bunny and all the Looney Tunes cartoons.

Warners Brothers has had multiple owners over the decades. Three years ago, Warner Media, as it was called, merged with Discovery. And in June, the company announced it would split in two, with film, TV and streaming studios in one camp, and in the other, mostly legacy cable channels, including CNN.

The planned split has not yet happened, and a new buyer might get the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery and its film and TV libraries.

As the film industry continues to consolidate, there's speculation that Warner Brothers' old rival Paramount could take over. Having just merged as Paramount Skydance, CEO David Ellison has already made several overtures.

The idea of streaming giant Netflix buying the company has raised antitrust concerns on Capitol Hill. In an earnings call last month, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors, ""We've been very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks. There is no change there.""

Industry watchers suggest other suitors could be Comcast, Amazon, or an investor who's not already in the entertainment business.

Regardless of whoever does end up buying the company, theater owners say they hope making movies for cinemas will be a priority.

""As long as we have more movies,"" says Daniel Loria, senior vice president at The Boxoffice Company, which analyzes data from studios and theaters. ""That doesn't mean the same amount, doesn't mean less, but more movies. I think you're going to find folks in the movie theater industry support any business decision that gets us there.""

Loria recalls that after Disney purchased Fox and Fox Searchlight, their combined studios significantly reduced the number of films they released in the theaters. Crunching the numbers, Loria says in 2016, a year before the merger announcement, Disney and Fox released a total of 38 theatrical films. This year, the consolidated studios released 18.

That's a problem for theater owners who've been struggling to bring audiences back to cinemas after the COVID-19 pandemic shut them down; they're competing with movie-watching on TVs, computers and phones.

Some theater owners and cinephiles also fear studio conglomerates will only greenlight a few big-budget blockbusters, leaving the lower budget indies behind.

""The concern is you're going to see less of that risk taking, less of that experimentation and less of that embracing new directors, new filmmakers in the future,"" says Max Friend, the CEO of Filmbot, the ticketing platform for independent cinemas in the U.S. ""It's really important that there are studios that are funding and supporting, cultivating that kind of work.""

He points out that this year, Warner Brothers made a string of critical hits, including Ryan Coogler's Sinners, the horror film Weapons and Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another.

Friend wonders if the next owner will take similar risks with future original, creative films.

Topline:

Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman says his office is looking into allegations that people filed fake claims of childhood sexual abuse as part of two large settlements the L.A. County Board of Supervisors approved this year.

Potential amnesty: Hochman said anyone who filed a fraudulent claim and comes forward to cooperate with his office could potentially avoid prosecution. He said his office would offer something called ""use immunity,"" which he said means someone who comes forward and shares complete, truthful information about a fraudulent claim they filed would, in exchange, not have those words used against them in court. He would not go as far as to say that doing so would protect them from prosecution.

"" It's not a guarantee, but it is certainly a significant factor in deciding of the probably what will amount to hundreds of cases, potential cases that we might have, which ones we go forward on and which ones we don't.""

The backstory: In April, L.A. County supervisors approved a $4 billion settlement for thousands of people who said they were sexually abused as children while under the county's supervision. The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed in 2021 and grew to include claims against several county departments, including Probation, Children and Family Services, Parks and Recreation, Health Services, Sheriff and Fire. In late October, the Board signed off on a second payout of $828 million for a separate batch of claims.

Why it matters: Hochman said it will ultimately be taxpayers footing the bill for those two sums, and he wants to make sure L.A. County taxpayers aren't on the hook for fake claims.

"" That'll be you and me paying for that,"" Hochman said. ""That'll be our children paying for it. ... These are valuable dollars that otherwise could go to other purposes.""

Why now: The D.A.'s announcement follows a unanimous vote by L.A. County supervisors last month to direct the county counsel to investigate fraudulent claims. Days before the vote, the L.A. Times reported some plaintiffs were paid cash in exchange for agreeing to work with a law firm to sue the county.

What's next: The D.A.'s office says anyone with information about false sex abuse claims can call the hotline for the investigation at (844) 901-0001, or report it online.

A downtown hearing kicked off Wednesday, during which a federal judge will consider holding the city of Los Angeles in contempt of court. The hearing is the latest step in a long-running legal saga regarding the city's response to the region’s homelessness crisis.

The hearing was ordered by U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, who has been overseeing a settlement in a lawsuit brought against the city by the L.A. Alliance for Human Rights, a group of downtown business and property owners. L.A. Alliance sued the city, and county, in 2020 for failing to adequately address homelessness.

Several witnesses are expected to testify during the contempt-of-court hearing, including Gita O’Neill, the new head of the region’s top homeless services agency, and Matt Szabo, the L.A. city administrative officer.

L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger watched at least part of Wednesday’s hearing in the courtroom.

Why now?

Carter said in court documents that he’s concerned “the city has demonstrated a continuous pattern of delay” in meeting its obligations under court orders. During a hearing last week, the judge pointed to several delays, including recently reported issues related to data and interviewing city employees.

The judge noted that similar concerns have come up at previous hearings. Carter told attorneys for the city in March 2024 that he “indicated to the mayor that I’ve already reached the decision that the plaintiffs were misled” and “this is bad faith,” according to court transcripts.

The judge said in a Nov. 14 order that he’s concerned the “delay continues to this day.”

The contempt hearing is expected to cover whether the city has complied with court orders and provided regular updates to the court under the settlement agreement.

Reducing delays

Attorneys for the city have pushed back against the hearing, filing objections with the judge and making an unsuccessful emergency request with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to block it from happening.

City authorities also asked the appeals court to press pause on the judge’s order to appoint a monitor in the case to make sure the city stays on track with the settlement. The city argued that Carter handed the monitor “a blank check to interfere with the democratic process,” according to court documents.

The appeals court partly denied the city’s request. It allowed Wednesday’s hearing to move forward, but it agreed to pause the appointment of Daniel Garrie as monitor.

In light of that response, attorneys for the city have argued that looking at the city’s cooperation with Garrie “would be inappropriate” during the hearing and that L.A. “cannot be held in contempt for either the substance or the manner of its compliance with the order,” according to court documents.

Previous hearings related to the settlement have elicited tense questioning of witnesses and harsh words from the judge, who has been vocal about reducing delays and moving the case forward.

In an opening statement Wednesday, Theane Evangelis — one of the attorneys representing the city — urged the judge to “turn down the heat” on the closely watched case. Evangelis said the “city is constantly under fire” in court while L.A. has made “enormous strides” in getting people off the streets.

Elizabeth Mitchell, lead attorney for L.A. Alliance, said the city treats transparency as a burden.

She said Wednesday that the “city still fights oversight harder than it fights homelessness” and that the court should address L.A. 's “consistent” delays throughout the case.

What’s next?

The hearing will resume Dec. 2, when more witnesses can appear in person.

City authorities told the court they believed a one-day hearing wouldn't be enough time to go over all the evidence.

If the judge does find the city of L.A. in contempt of court and that it ""isn't doing what it promised to do,"" the consequences could range from nothing all the way up to serious sanctions, according to Matthew Umhofer, an attorney for L.A. Alliance.

Umhofer told LAist after the hearing that sanctions could include the court ordering more intensive monitoring of the city’s performance, imposing new requirements on the city, monetary penalties or possibly a receivership.

Carter previously stopped short of seizing control of the city’s hundreds of millions of dollars in homelessness spending and handing it to a court-appointed receiver, deciding against that option in a June ruling.

L.A. Alliance is considering asking for an extension to the settlement agreement, Umhofer said.

The Seventh Circuit panel cautioned against ""overreading"" its stay, noting that a fast-track appeal could result in a ""more tailored and appropriate"" order.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction after media organizations and demonstrators accused federal officers of using excessive force during an immigration operation that has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests since September across Chicago and nearby communities.

Justice Department lawyers argued that the order restricted law enforcement’s ability to carry out its duties and could ""subvert"" the constitutional structure.

The panel said the order was ""too prescriptive"" because it specified riot control weapons and other devices in a way that ""resembles a federal regulation.""

Ellis’ order barred agents from using physical force and chemical agents such as tear gas and pepper balls unless necessary or to prevent ""an immediate threat."" The judge said the use of those tools violated the constitutional rights of journalists and protesters.

Witnesses told the court they were tear-gassed, shot with pepper balls while praying, and had guns pointed at them.

Ellis found that Trump administration witnesses were ""simply not credible,"" including Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol commander who led the Chicago area operation before moving on to North Carolina.

Bovino has defended the agents’ use of force and oversaw about 230 officers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the region beginning in September. Federal border agents are expected to next be deployed to New Orleans.

At immigration court in Tacoma, Washington, the detainees came up one after the other with the same plea.
From the bench at immigration court in Cleveland, she prided herself on listening carefully to each person’s asylum claim.
The gutting of the immigration court has driven migrants to one place where standards of judicial independence are upheld: federal court.","The government lawyer knew what was coming as she stood inside a courtroom and texted an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent waiting in a corridor a few feet away.

“I can’t do this,” the lawyer said in a text message as she looked at her docket of cases. “This is a new emotional load.”

“I understand,” the agent responded. “Hopefully we meet again in a better situation.”

Nearby, a Cuban man who had lived in the United States for years stepped from an elevator and into the courtroom where the government lawyer was waiting for what the man thought was a routine hearing.

The man was doing what the law required, and brought along his wife, a legal resident, and their 7-month-old infant.

Then the lawyer quickly moved to have the man’s asylum claim dismissed and a judge agreed, making the man eligible for “expedited removal.” As he left the courtroom, the man was swarmed by plainclothes immigration agents who had been surveilling him. A struggle ensued and the wife’s shouts could be heard from the hallway as the lawyer moved on to the next case.

The agent replied four minutes later: “Got him.”

Similar scenes of courthouse arrests, part of a makeover of the immigration courts under President Donald Trump, are playing out across the United States as his call for mass deportations of migrants is executed with unusually aggressive tactics.

Trump's pledge during his 2024 campaign, to impose hardline immigration policies was a major reason he won a second term. Now that Americans have seen how the his plan is being implemented, there are signs that many think he has gone too far. About 57% of adults disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, according to a survey this month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Over several months, reporters for The Associated Press observed immigration court proceedings in 21 cities. Hearings repeatedly ended with cases dismissed by the government, allowing plainclothes federal agents to carry out arrests in courthouse hallways in close coordination with attorneys from the Department of Homeland Security.

Screenshots of the text messages were obtained by The Associated Press from a government official who feared reprisal and provided them on condition of anonymity. The messages offer a rare look at how the nation's 75 immigration courts are churning out rulings in an assembly-line like fashion and how, for many people, the courtrooms have become deportation traps.

In a court system with a backlog of about 3.8 million asylum cases, families have been torn apart and lives upended. Due process seemingly is an afterthought.

“When Americans picture a courtroom, there are a few core expectations"" of fairness, dignity and impartiality, said Ashley Tabaddor, a former immigration judge in Los Angeles and past president of the National Association of Immigration Judges.

""That’s what makes a court — not a room with a bench or person with a robe,” she said. “But what we have here is a vision completely turned on its head.”

Over the past nine months, the Trump administration has fired almost 90 immigration judges seen by Trump's allies as too lenient, directed masked officers to handcuff migrants at closed asylum hearings and sent memos instructing judges to fall into line.

Unlike federal courts, where there are strict rules of procedure and judges have lifetime tenure, the Justice Department runs immigration courts and the attorney general can fire the judges with fewer restraints.

Nine current officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Most expressed deep misgivings about punishing people who had followed the rules and showed up for court hearings.

“As a government attorney, my duty is to uphold the law and protect the public interest — not to secure removal or detention outcomes by default,” a government lawyer wrote to the American Bar Association seeking professional guidance.

But that is not how cases are often unfolding.

Courthouse arrests are coordinated days in advance to meet quotas with little regard for the particulars of a case, according to several of the U.S. officials.

According to one official, Homeland Security lawyers note on a spreadsheet which cases are “amenable” to dismissal, allowing an asylum-seeker to be immediately rearrested and placed in expedited removal proceedings. Most of those detained are men without lawyers who entered the U.S. alone and are expected to appear in court in person. Contrary to Trump's claims that he is targeting the ‘worst of the worst,’ most don't have a criminal conviction, according to a Cato Institute analysis of ICE data.

ICE reviews the spreadsheet and selects which people it wants to pursue if cases are dismissed. On the hearing date, federal agents communicate directly with DHS lawyers, who act as prosecutors in immigration courts. The lawyer often provides near verbatim updates of the proceedings over text message to agents waiting outside the courtroom.

“Black shirt? Let me know if the judge dismissed,” an ICE agent texted during one hearing.

Almost from the outset, immigration courts were plagued by a lack of resources, authority and judicial independence.

The courts were established in 1952, but it was not until 1973 that “special inquiry officers” were given the “judge” title and allowed to wear judicial robes. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, or EOIR, was created in 1983. But that agency remained a part of the Justice Department, giving the attorney general authority to override decisions.

“We were a legal Cinderella,” said Dana Leigh Marks, who retired as an immigration judge in 2021 after a 34-year career. “No other court in the nation functions like this.”

The first Trump administration undertook a series of changes to reduce the case backlog, including instructing judges to deny entire categories of asylum claims such as for victims of gang or domestic violence.

It also set up a dashboard that would become the bane of many judges: Red, yellow and green gauges measure each judge’s performance on goals ranging from completed cases — a minimum of 700 annually, regardless of complexity — to how many custody cases were decided on their first hearings.

To meet the metrics, judges must race through dockets, sometimes devoting mere minutes to evaluate asylum-seekers' claims.

“It’s like deciding death penalty cases in a traffic court setting,” Marks said.

When Trump returned to the White House in January, his allies took direct aim at the court.

Since then, the Justice Department has issued 52 policy memos — more than the previous six years combined — making it easier to hire and fire judges and warning against pro-migrant bias.

The memos highlight the courts’ weakened status by referring to judges as “inferior officers” — a rarely used term taken from the Constitution.

In early September, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he would lend 600 military lawyers to the immigration courts, about equal to the current number of judges. The goal, according to the administration, is to more effectively reduce caseloads by widening the pool of potential judges to include people already steeped in administrative law. But many migrant advocates are concerned the incoming judges lack the necessary experience to decide asylum cases.

“It makes as much sense as having a cardiologist do a hip replacement,” said Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The administration has pushed back against criticism it is co-opting the courts to accelerate its deportation goals. In a statement, Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said DHS decides whether to arrest migrants and that most judges consider it an “honor rather than an insult” to be called an inferior officer empowered by the Constitution and serving at the will of the attorney general.

Baldassarre likened a record surge of asylum seekers during the Biden administration to an “improper conspiracy between DHS and the Immigration Courts to effectuate an unlawful amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.” The Justice Department, she said, had ""restored the integrity, impartiality, and independence of the Courts.”

DHS did not respond to repeated email and phone requests for comment.

For some inside the courts, work has become a stressful, lonesome grind. Fear prevails. Resumes are being updated.

One DHS lawyer described being haunted at night by the sound of jangling shackles of migrants the lawyer helped arrest. The lawyer joined the government after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, believing that protecting America’s borders was a patriotic duty.

The lawyer still cherishes a signed copy of Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel’s memoir “Night,” which was handed out at a work seminar. “Think higher, feel deeper,” reads the author’s inscription of the book, which is marked DHS “Training Material.”

Today, its message torments.

“This isn’t what any of us signed up for,” the lawyer said.

After a turbulent summer, the courthouses are starting to look lonely, too. With word spreading that a trap had been laid, many migrants, fearing arrest, are asking to appear online or are skipping hearings altogether.

Meanwhile, ambitious managers are publicly upbraiding those who raise doubts about the legality of locking up migrants with no criminal record in packed facilities. In a recent town hall with DHS principal legal adviser Charles Wall, several lawyers complained about the pressure, confusing orders and lack of resources, according to notes from the meeting shared with AP.

Wall said the pace is likely to continue for years, the notes say. When one federal employee asked about bringing firearms to work for fear of harassment by activists inside courthouses, Wall said that judges should not hesitate to kick out the public. Wall could not be reached for comment.

The harsh tactics have had one effect the administration wants: Voluntary migrant departures have soared, with more than 14,000 people seeking court permission to self-deport in the first eight months of 2025, according to federal data collected by Mobile Pathways, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that pushes for transparency in migration proceedings. That is more than the previous five years combined. The number is almost certainly an undercount because most migrants do not withdraw their asylum claim before self-deporting.

At immigration court in Tacoma, Washington, the detainees came up one after the other with the same plea.

“I want to go back to my country,” a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala.

“I want to leave the country,” said a man from Mexico.

Immigrants know what they face: detention centers with ominous names — “Alligator Alcatraz,” “Louisiana Lockup” and “Speedway Slammer” — as well as workplace raids and neighborhood dragnets.

Tania Nemer believes she was cut out to be a judge. From the bench at immigration court in Cleveland, she prided herself on listening carefully to each person’s asylum claim.

“There’s a simplicity about it that I just loved,” she told the AP. “If you can provide justice in an efficient manner, you can really help a lot of people.”

The decision to apply to become an immigration judge in 2023 was deeply personal. Her father fled turmoil in Lebanon and arrived in Ohio at 16 with $6 in his pocket. He washed cars, learned English and eventually opened a namesake bar — Manny’s Pub — that allowed him to provide for his family. When Nemer married, her wedding gift was the unspent dollar bills, so she would never forget her roots.

But Nemer’s fondness for the law came crashing down Feb. 5. In the middle of a hearing, her supervisor opened the door of her packed courtroom and told her she needed to come with him.

“As soon as he said ‘Grab your ID,’ I knew I was being terminated,” she said.

Still in shock, she was handed a two-paragraph letter, digitally signed by Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It said she was being removed because the agency ""has determined that retaining you is not appropriate, and we thank you for your service.”

No justification was given. But she thinks she knows some of the reasons: her Arab-sounding name, a history of previously representing migrants and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, course work from Cornell University. She filed a discrimination claim with the Justice Department to find out why she was fired; the complaint was dismissed.

Nemer was the first judge fired after Trump returned to the White House. But 86 have been sacked since. Dozens more took the Department of Government Efficiency’s “Fork in the Road” resignation offer.

The majority were hired under Democratic President Joe Biden and are still serving two-year probationary periods, according to a list of the fired judges obtained by the AP.

It is unclear who ordered the firings or how they were selected. But those removed granted asylum at markedly higher rates than their peers — in about half of all cases since August 2023 compared with 34% nationwide, according to Mobile Pathways.

Among those purged were all 10 that appeared on the DHS Bureaucrat Watch List, a website created last year with funding from The Heritage Foundation, whose Project 2025 was a blueprint for the Trump administration’s policies and personnel decisions.

The list includes names, Facebook photos, salaries and campaign donations for what it calls “America’s most subversive immigration bureaucrats.” One target was Emmett Soper, a judge in northern Virginia who worked at EOIR headquarters during the Biden administration.

“As soon as I saw that, I knew the rules were changing, that I was under some kind of microscope that didn’t exist before,” he said.

Tom Jones, the conservative creator of the website, declined to be interviewed.

Baldassarre, the Justice Department spokeswoman, said the department is not targeting specific individuals for firing but does continually evaluate all judges.

“All judges have a legal, ethical, and professional obligation to be impartial and neutral in adjudicating cases,” Baldassarre said. “If a judge violates that obligation by demonstrating a systematic bias in favor of or against either party, EOIR is obligated to take action to preserve the integrity of its system.”

The wave of firings and new directives from the Justice Department has had a chilling effect. Denial of motions to appear for hearings online tripled after a March memo repealing Biden-era guidelines instructing judges to generally grant such requests, according to Mobile Pathways data. Denial of continuances, which allow migrants extra time to seek legal counsel, have also spiked as have the number of cases classified as abandoned.

Nemer returned to immigration court in October for the first time since being fired to represent a Mexican client she has known for 20 years and who was picked up by unidentified agents. While the man was jailed, his girlfriend, who was five months pregnant, miscarried.

Word of the former judge's return quickly spread and a stream of former colleagues came to the courtroom to hug her and express their dismay over her firing.

“By the third hug I couldn’t hold it in and just started crying,” she said.

Bug spray, sunscreen, fans and umbrellas compete with legal binders in the bed of a Toyota pickup across the street from immigration court in San Antonio.

This is the new office of American Gateways.

In April, the administration eliminated programs worth $30 million to provide free legal assistance to migrants, the vast majority of whom represent themselves in court.

But lawyers for American Gateways keep coming, four times a week, setting up in a parking lot. The conference room they once occupied inside the courthouse is now used as a break room for ICE agents.

Assistance ranges from helping immigrants file motions to rehearsing what they will say to judges. When they can, they sign people up for virtual appearances to minimize the risk of arrest.

The gutting of the immigration court has driven migrants to one place where standards of judicial independence are upheld: federal court.

Since May 15, when courthouse sweeps began, migrants have filed more than 3,000 habeas corpus petitions — to determine if someone is lawfully held in custody — seeking release.

The flood of claims threatens to clog the already crowded federal docket, which has little authority in immigration cases.

“The administration is attempting to press the gas at such an unreasonable speed without considering due process,” said Annelise Araujo, a Boston-based immigration attorney.

One petition, filed in Miami, was from a Cuban man detained the same day he and his American wife and 10-month-old daughter were moving into their first home. Several petitioners said they had survived torture at the hands of gangs in Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela.

Another legal challenge was introduced by an HIV-positive man from Brazil taken into custody four days after his husband died of a heart attack. With the body of Frederico Abreu’s husband still at the funeral home, ICE officials knocked on his door stating they had documents belonging to the deceased man.

Those unable to afford a lawyer so they can sue in federal court have little recourse.

One was a man from Honduras who showed up at the northern Virginia immigration court with his wife and their infant baby. Another child, a son, unable to walk, pushed himself in a wheelchair studded with flashing, colorful lights. The family, fearful of further immigration problems, did not want to be identified.

The judge denied a government request to deport the man. But seconds later, as the family stepped from the courtroom, they were stopped by four ICE agents.

The wife sobbed, hanging on her husband’s arm as she pleaded: “Por favor, Por favor.”

The husband clutched the sleeping infant’s carrier. Their son sat playing with a cell phone.

“I need you to go ahead and say goodbye,” an agent told the man. Crying, the man knelt to hug his son, who clung to his father, yelling repeatedly: “Papa! Papa!”

Finally, the father managed to pull himself away and started to leave with the ICE officers.

The boy tried to chase them. But the ICE agent was holding the back of the wheelchair as the boy futilely pumped his arms.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed his July arrest. The family said he was later deported. Homeland Security said he voluntarily agreed to leave the country and returned to Honduras on Oct. 8 after three months in detention.

Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear.","A federal judge is continuing his investigation into whether the Trump administration defied court orders in a high-profile immigration case involving the Alien Enemies Act, he said Wednesday.

In an 8-3 ruling last week, a federal appeals court left in place an earlier decision that blocked U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's April order, which said that probable cause exists to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over its ""willful disregard"" of his order in March to turn around two planes carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members bound for a prison in El Salvador.

But the panel also found that even though his initial ruling had been struck down, Boasberg, who is the chief judge for the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., could continue his probe into whether the Trump administration had violated his court order.

""The district court's order here was a measured and essential response to what it reasonably perceived as shocking executive branch conduct,"" Judges Nina Pillard, Robert Wilkins and Bradley Garcia wrote in a joint opinion.

""I will be going forward with it,"" Boasberg said. ""I certainly intend to find out what happened that day.""

In April, Boasberg wrote that the Justice Department's actions were ""sufficient for the court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the government in criminal contempt. The court does not reach such [a] conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.""

""The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders — especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,"" Boasberg wrote.

Boasberg will also continue to hear arguments on the merits of the case, which arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a seldom-invoked law from 1798, to summarily deport Venezuelans whom his administration claims are members of the gang Tren de Aragua.

After Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a group of Venezuelan migrants immediately sued to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law. Boasberg swiftly blocked the Trump administration from removing the plaintiffs from the U.S. for 14 days and, in an emergency hearing, ordered government lawyers to return to the U.S. people subject to the proclamation who were on planes headed toward El Salvador.

The judge then blocked the Trump administration from conducting deportations of noncitizens in its custody under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg's order did not block the government from deporting the alleged gang members or others under other immigration authorities, however.

But Boasberg said that after his orders, the government did not stop the removal process under the Alien Enemies Act, and planes carrying migrants subject to deportation under the invocation of the act later landed in El Salvador, where most were transferred to its Center for Terrorism Confinement, or CECOT.

Remarks by Trump administration officials raised questions for Boasberg regarding whether it had violated his order. In his opinion, Boasberg wrote that ""boasts"" by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele ""intimated that they had defied the court's order deliberately and gleefully.""

Who, exactly, in the Trump administration ordered the two planes to continue on to El Salvador, is unclear.

On Wednesday, Boasberg said that he plans to find that out through further proceedings and live witness testimony under oath, if needed.

Potential witnesses, Boasberg said, include Erez Reuveni, who admitted in court that the Justice Department should not have deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia in March and was put on leave and then fired by the Justice Department.

In an interview with CBS News' ""60 Minutes"", Reuveni said he was called to a meeting with Emil Bove, who was then the No. 3 in charge at the Justice Department and is now a federal judge, and Bove told him to potentially ignore court orders if a judge tried to slow the Alien Enemies Act deportations that were underway.

""Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what,"" Reuveni said. ""Then after a pause, he also told all in attendance, and if some court should issue an order preventing that, we may have to consider telling that court, 'f*** you.'""

Another likely witness, Boasberg said, is Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general who was the attorney of record in the first hearings in the case.

In court, Boasberg asked Ensign if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did, but the planes never turned around.

He said he's likely to hold his first hearing on the contempt investigation the week after Thanksgiving.

""Justice requires me to move promptly on this,"" Boasberg said.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/30/e406d206-bca9-49e5-a2b7-e250bf89acbe/thumbnail/1200x630/ec0ac6d3df330957aaf5387871adb021/ap25093587208419.jpg,N,,2025-11-20 03:56:38.364202

The 51-year-old father and grandfather was arrested in Crestwood last month during the Trump administration's immigration enforcement ""blitz"" in the Chicago area.

But last week, he was released from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody after prevailing in a federal court case. Three days after his return home, he sat down with the ABC7 Chicago I-Team to share his story.

""I felt so much terror, so much fear,"" Cabrera told the I-Team, speaking in Spanish. ""We longed to see two minutes of daylight, but we never saw it in the 41 days I was there.""

Cabrera is one of hundreds of people identified by the Department of Homeland Security as possibly arrested in violation of a 2022 consent decree restricting when agents can arrest someone without a warrant.

It was on Oct. 3 when Ramiro Cabrera, owner of ""Cabrera Rental Center"" was setting up a tent for a business in Crestwood when surveillance footage captured federal immigration agents pull up in a white van. And in less than three minutes, he was in federal custody.

""No one expects that,"" Cabrera told the I-Team. ""We were working at my company, doing our normal jobs. And in a matter of minutes, two minutes changed my world so much.""

Cabrera has lived in the U.S. without legal permission for more than 20 years, and has four U.S. citizen children, including a 19-year-old daughter he supports.

He has no criminal record, according to court declarations. But after agents arrested him, Cabrera says he was treated like a criminal.

""I don't know why that happens in a country like the United States,"" Cabrera told the I-Team.

Cabrera said he was initially taken to the Broadview ICE facility for two days, where he says he was given two bottles of water per day with a ham sandwich, and no phone calls with his attorney.

""There were between 90 and 110 of us there on the two nights I was there,"" Cabrera said. ""I think I slept for about half an hour each night. The bathrooms had no doors. We didn't bathe; we didn't change our clothes, very sad, terrifying.""

Cabrera said at one point during his time at Broadview, he had to be taken to an outside hospital due to complications from high blood pressure.

""I thought I might die. I said, 'My God, forgive me if I die. My daughters are fine. I'm leaving, but I felt like I was dying,'"" Cabera said. ""They took me to the hospital; they took good care of me. They cured me.""

Cabrera's daughter, Mariana, said she and her family lived in constant anxiety during the 41 days he was gone, knowing where their father was.

""It was hard to know, going to sleep, especially when he was in Broadview when we heard of the conditions there,"" Mariana said. ""Knowing that, like, I get to sleep in a comfortable bed tonight while he's there because he's undocumented.""

Since his time at Broadview, a federal judge has ordered ICE to improve conditions at the facility after hearing testimony from people detained about unsanitary and overcrowded conditions.

Cabrera was eventually transferred to an ICE detention facility in Clay County, Indiana, where he remained until his release.

As the I-Team previously reported, Cabrera's attorney, former Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jennifer Peyton, filed a habeas petition in federal court, challenging Cabrera's detention as unlawful and demanding due process.

More than 30 character witness letters were filed in his support from members in the community, Peyton said, and it was the habeas case that ultimately led to a judge ordering his release last week.

""I cried when I left. I called (my daughter); she cried,"" Cabrera told the I-Team. ""Only a miracle could happen, and it happened.""

While his habeas case was proceeding, Cabrera was also added as a class member in litigation over a 2022 consent decree restricting when immigration agents can arrest someone without a warrant, often referred to as the ""Castañon Nava settlement.""

He is one of more than 600 people who the Department of Homeland Security has since identified as possibly arrested in violation of that agreement.

Judge Jeffrey Cummings has ordered more than 400 people to be released by this Friday, and on Tuesday, Cummings denied a request by the government to delay the release.

If Cabrera hadn't been released already, he would have been included in that group.

In the list of individuals that DHS officials filed with the court, Cabrera was designated as having a ""Medium"" risk to public safety, but no further explanation was given on the basis for that designation. Attorneys have questioned the methods behind these ratings.

DHS officials did not respond to the I-Team's questions about the designation, or request for comment on Cabrera's release.

Cabrera and his attorney said that designation makes no sense.

""That part of the government makes me sad. It makes me very sad because I've been a defender of the government,"" Cabrera told the I-Team. ""No matter if they're Democrats or Republicans, it's the best government in the world. They're just doing things wrong right now.""

Cabrera's immigration case is not over. His attorney told the I-Team he's awaiting a new court date to be set in immigration court.

While he's happy to be home, Cabrera hopes the people he met while in ICE custody -- most of whom he said did not have criminal histories -- will be released to their families just like him.

""I will always ask God in my prayers that they get out because they should be with their families, like I am,"" Cabrera said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18177687_111925-WLS-iteam-ice-detainee-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-20 00:56:16.270406

Nearly one year since his return to the White House, Trump’s insistence that legal immigration is not only tolerable but an economic necessity continues to roil hardliners on the right, who are at odds with the business and tech interests that Trump has long aligned himself with.

“The people who are against us are really, really smart,” Trump said. “They’re unbelievable patriots, but they just don’t understand — our people have to be taught.”

He added that companies that invest big money to create plants here need to “bring a lot of their people from their country to get that plant open, operating and working. I’m sorry. So my poll numbers just went down, but with smart people, they’ve gone way up.”

Trump’s statement is unlikely to quell the MAGA anger, which has bubbled up every few months since the president was elected. Many saw in the president someone who would fight to curtail nearly all immigration, sparked by concerns over job losses or, more controversially, racially tinged fears about Americans being replaced by foreigners.

Trump reignited the debate earlier this month when he said on Fox News that Americans don’t have “certain talents” to fill jobs, in response to Laura Ingraham, who had pushed him on his stance on visas for high-skilled workers, known as H-1Bs. And even as the White House and much of the Trump base was consumed with the vote to release the Epstein files this week, frustration among key Trump allies about the president’s comments simmered beneath the surface.

With little hope that Congress can reach a solution on immigration, the president is in a quagmire of his own making. He is caught between those within his base and administration who want to overhaul the employment visa system and others who argue that the economy is dependent on low- and high-skilled immigrant labor, and that the country’s policies must reflect that reality.

“You’ve got things like H-1Bs taking away jobs from Americans, that’s huge,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) told POLITICO last week. She added that it’s a top issue for her constituents.

Some Trump allies argue that the outrage is misplaced and point to the president’s September decision to charge a $100,000 fee for new applicants to receive a visa through the H1-B program, which allows workers such as engineers and computer programmers to temporarily work in the United States. The move was designed to reduce the number of visas used by U.S. companies. The administration earlier this month also announced new probes into H-1B abuse.

The White House has argued that Trump has done more than past presidents to prioritize American workers by tightening immigration laws, including by issuing new guidance to ensure unauthorized immigrants are not allowed access to federal workforce development resources and grants and changes to the U.S. citizenship test.

“Under the President’s bold leadership, all employment gains have gone exclusively to American-born workers; critical and long-overdue reforms are being made to the H-1B visa process; America’s manufacturing industry is being reshored through powerful tariffs and trade deals; and illegal immigrants are no longer stealing taxpayer-funded benefits,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Trump’s comments on Wednesday aren’t the only time he’s unveiled a soft spot in his otherwise hardline immigration stance. He spurred MAGA blowback in June, when he promised a solution for farmers who rely on undocumented labor, which immigration hawks slammed as a slippery slope. And after vowing to aggressively revoke Chinese student visas earlier this year, the president reversed course, announcing he would allow 600,000 Chinese students to attend U.S. universities.

Trump’s Kennedy Center comments are at odds with immigration hawks and senior policymakers in his administration who insist the program needs to be overhauled.

“If you reform ‘x,’ but keep ‘y’ part of the system, it won’t matter either way,” said Kevin Lynn, a fellow at the right-leaning Institute for Sound Public Policy think tank in Washington who leads an effort advocating on behalf of U.S. tech workers. “The H1-B visa system is not being abused, it’s working exactly as designed to to displace American workers and prevent recourse.”

It also appears that Trump’s message is at odds with Vice President JD Vance who, in a separate interview with Fox News last week, said that the U.S. should use technology to “empower the blue-collar workers rather than replace them with foreign labor.”

Trump’s break with his base reflects his desire to increase investments in the tech and manufacturing sectors, which the president does not believe would be possible — in the short term — without foreign workers.

The president also has close ties to the tech industry, a top user of the H-1B program. During the last fiscal year, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Google relied most on H-1B visas. Those companies have contributed handsomely to Trump efforts including his inaugural fund and the $300 million ballroom that will replace the White House East Wing.

“You saw the list … they’re all on there, and they all want their H-1B workers,” said a person close to the administration, granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “So he’s hearing about this from all of those folks.”

Trump’s defense of foreign workers has some fearing that it will kill the already slim chance for Congress to pass immigration reform. Still, some lawmakers have moved ahead with legislation to overhaul a system they say is increasingly harming American college graduates.

“I tend to be on the skeptical side of that program,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) told POLITICO, adding that the president’s $100,000 fee for H-1B applicants is a “good idea.”

“In general we want to do everything we can to promote American workers and get as many Americans into jobs, get wages up,” he said. “I tend to view all of our visa policies through that lens.”

Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) introduced a bill in September which would restructure the lottery system for H1-B visas and direct DHS to eliminate the Optional Practical Training program, which advocates say has allowed companies to hire foreign-born workers without having to pay the government taxes for their work under the auspices of continuing their education. Other H-1B legislation is expected in the coming weeks and months, though it’s unclear if there will be an appetite without buy-in from the White House.

“There’s a political imperative after the GOP got their heads handed to them,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies think tank in Washington, which favors restrictions on legal immigration. “There’s a real election in a year, and lots of messaging from Labor and DHS about protecting American workers. But action is needed.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F55%2F22%2F7a4823e3493283ae3a19c85f0c25%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2247496868,N,,2025-11-19 21:56:27.582480

Chula Vista has been the site of at least one high-profile, immigration-related arrest this year.
A disclosure process could give residents more clarity on when and where federal immigration agents are launching enforcement actions.
Elsewhere in California, city officials have been divided over whether to tell residents when federal immigration agents are in town.
While similar resolutions have drawn large crowds and sparked heated deliberation in other cities, Chula Vista City hall was relatively quiet Tuesday night.","Chula Vista residents will be getting more information about how their police officers interact with federal immigration officials after the City Council voted Tuesday to develop a new disclosure process.

In a 4-0 vote, council members in San Diego County’s second-largest city directed the city attorney to develop clear procedures for how police should respond to agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“Sometimes we don't even know that there's ICE activity happening in the city,” said Councilmember Cesar Fernandez, who led development of the resolution. “But if the department were to learn of it, they need to report it in a timely fashion.”

Mayor John McCann, the lone Republican on the city’s five-member council, abstained. McCann claimed he was unable to “oppose or potentially oppose federal law” as a naval reserve officer.

Tuesday’s resolution makes Chula Vista the latest city in San Diego County to establish new protections for immigrants amid the Trump administration’s aggressive mass deportation campaign. Others include San Diego, Oceanside and Vista.

Chula Vista has been the site of at least one high-profile, immigration-related arrest this year. In August, ICE agents arrested a parent from South Korea outside an East Chula Vista elementary school. The parent’s children were in the backseat of the car.

Elected officials sharply criticized the actions of armed federal agents, who made the arrest during morning dropoff. Councilmember Michael Inzunza said the display of force was too close to the school and unnecessary for apprehending someone who does not appear to have been charged with or convicted of a crime.

“If this was just an expired visa or a warrant, why make such a traumatic event?” Inzunza told KPBS in August.

A disclosure process could give residents more clarity on when and where federal immigration agents are launching enforcement actions.

In an interview with KPBS, Fernandez said he envisioned Chula Vista police publishing a notice on their public data portal every time they were contacted by ICE or other federal immigration agencies.

ICE has arrested at least 35 people in Chula Vista this year, according to federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by KPBS. More than half of them, 51%, had not been charged or convicted of a crime.

Those numbers are up from previous years amid ICE’s acceleration of arrests in San Diego and Imperial County. Last year, ICE arrested just nine people in Chula Vista, and six of them had been convicted of crimes. In 2023, ICE arrested 4 people — all of them convicted of crimes, the data show.

Elsewhere in California, city officials have been divided over whether to tell residents when federal immigration agents are in town.

This summer, the Orange County city of Santa Ana considered its own alert policy requiring police to alert residents of ICE activity within 48 hours of receiving a notification. But they backed off the idea after U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said his office could prosecute city officials over the policy.

Chula Vista’s disclosure policy is still under development, but Fernandez said his hope is to provide clarity for both police officers and residents.

“It provides that transparency for the public and ultimately creates more trust for residents in our city,” he said.

Tuesday’s resolution also included other restrictions on immigration enforcement.

For example, it tasks city staff with reworking the language of city agreements to bar future contractors from sharing personal data in “cooperation with discriminatory enforcement actions.”

Council members also asked city staff to create a digital “Know Your Rights” campaign and explore partnering with immigration law groups to offer residents legal services.

While similar resolutions have drawn large crowds and sparked heated deliberation in other cities, Chula Vista City hall was relatively quiet Tuesday night.

Longtime human rights advocate Pedro Rios sent a written notice of support. Two commenters spoke in opposition of the resolution, including newly appointed city Housing and Homelessness Commissioner Bogdan Matuszynski.

“This is virtue-signalling to the most I have ever seen,” said Matuszynski “If you vote yes on this, you are actually dividing us more.”

Councilmember Jose Preciado pushed back on Matuszynski’s argument. He said families are being “attacked” under President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown.

“I use that language very clearly,” Preciado said. “Immigration law is a civil matter. It should be dealt with in a civil way. But it is not that.”",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/b535914/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6048x3175+0+428/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F6a%2F5e%2F3089e116482789f66209f3b399c5%2F20250722-ksuzuki-chula-vista-city-council-file-060.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 20:57:22.583076

An immigration policy based on dignity What would dignity-based immigration policy require?","The past 10 months have seen the second Trump administration pursue increasingly draconian immigration enforcement policies aimed at seizing and removing unauthorized immigrants or even those who are perceived to be. Sandra Portocarrero writes that this approach ignores basic human dignity. Human dignity, she argues, is an inherent quality, and should not be based on someone’s worth to American society. A dignity-based immigration policy would end the current administration’s practices and mean a fundamental shift in the way we think and talk about immigration.

There are different approaches to describe, justify, or challenge the Trump administration’s draconian policies for managing the presence of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. Those in favor believe that anyone who has crossed the border illegally or overstayed their visa has clearly violated the law and should face the consequences of their actions. Others with moderate views believe that certain “ideal undocumented immigrants”—those who work and contribute positively to American society—should be spared from the threat of deportation or other draconian policies, precisely because of their contributions. And then there are people, like me, who believe that any decision or action affecting any human being, including unauthorized immigrants, should be made on the basis of dignity. That is, founded on the principle that people have inherent human worth not because of their economic contributions to society but simply because they exist.

In writing this piece, I first thought of providing a justification for why people migrate to the United States. I considered writing about US intervention in Latin America and how privatization and deregulation led to the destabilization of political economies, pushing people to seek better lives in places like the United States. Or perhaps writing about the Bracero Program, the temporary labor initiative that ran from 1942 to 1964, which brought millions of Mexican laborers into the US to address labor shortages. What would have happened to the United States’ agricultural and railroad industries during and after World War II without the braceros? But enough justifications in favor of unauthorized immigrants have been written on the basis of US intervention abroad or US policy. The underlying tone in those arguments hovers somewhere between “we created this mess, let’s deal with it” and “unauthorized immigrants are hardworking people. Let’s keep them.”

Dignity is an inherent quality – not based on someone’s “worth”

The justification I provide here is made solely on the basis of dignity. Our modern understanding of dignity is heavily influenced by philosopher Immanuel Kant, who argued that dignity stems from human rational autonomy—a quality that requires us to treat every person as an end in themselves, not as a means to an end. This means that our appreciation of someone, or the worth we attribute to a person, should not be based on what that person does for American society through the fulfillment of jobs that “nobody wants” or jobs where the undocumented worker is exploited and underpaid. In the Kantian sense, dignity is not earned through productivity or good behavior. Dignity is an inherent quality of being human. So, when we condition our treatment of unauthorized immigrants on their utility to American society—when we ask, “what have you done for us Americans?” we reduce human beings to mere instruments, violating the very foundation of human dignity.

It is worth noting that neither the Declaration of Independence nor the US Constitution explicitly mentions the word “dignity.” Yet the concept permeates both documents and the jurisprudence that has shaped American society. My interpretation of the Declaration’s assertion that all people “are created equal” and “are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” is that worth and dignity are inherent to the human condition. The Constitution’s protections in the Bill of Rights against searches and seizures, cruel punishment, and deprivations of life, liberty, or property without due process all flow from an underlying recognition of human worth. While the authors of the US Constitution may not have used the word, they built a system of government premised on respect for human dignity.

The consequences when human dignity is not honored

But what happens when government actions, regardless of which administration, fail to honor the dignity of humans? In part IV of her dissent in Utah v. Strieff (2016), Justice Sotomayor wrote about how unlawful police stops violate the dignity of people and “corrode all our civil liberties.” Writing to herself, she added how such violations of dignity and the risk of being a victim of scrutiny disproportionately affects those who are Black and Global Majority, describing how these practices implies that people are not “citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state just waiting to be cataloged.”

Indeed, these experiences resonate with the experience of unauthorized immigrants. Current immigration enforcement practices—workplace raids, detention centers, family separations, the constant threat of deportation—treat human beings as subjects to be surveilled, catalogued, and removed. What is more worrisome is that these practices allow for racial profiling, the practice of targeting individuals for suspicious activities based solely on the individuals perceived race or ethnicity or country of origin, in a country where racial segregation and the practice of slavery was once legal. In fact, in a 6-3 vote in the Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem case, the Supreme Court granted an emergency request from the Trump administration that temporarily allowed Immigration and Costumes Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents to stop anyone they perceived to be in the state of California without authorization. Most of the people stopped by these agents during these raids were perceived as Latinos. Again, Justice Sotomayor dissented. She warned that the US Supreme Court’s decision risked turning Latinos into second class citizens. Sotomayor said: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.” The practice of stopping people based on how they look denies the fundamental dignity of millions of people living in the United States.

But the violation of dignity extends beyond enforcement practices to the very language and framing of the immigration debate. When we speak of unauthorized immigrants as “illegals,” we deny their humanity. When we debate their presence based solely on economic impact or whether they are a net benefit to the economy or a fiscal burden—we engage in precisely the kind of instrumental reasoning that denies their dignity, because we refer to people as means rather than ends.

Arguments that defend unauthorized immigrants on the basis of their contributions—“they work hard,” “they pay taxes,” “they do jobs Americans won’t do”—inadvertently participate in this instrumentalization. These arguments, while well-intentioned, make the dignity of people conditional.

An immigration policy based on dignity

What would dignity-based immigration policy require? At a minimum, it would demand an end to degrading and dehumanizing practices: detention centers that separate families and hold people in cage-like conditions, abolishing travel bans based on people’s characteristics, workplace raids that terrorize communities; deportations that occur without adequate due process or consideration of family ties and community integration. It would require us to create pathways for people already living in the United States to regularize their status, not because they have earned it through good behavior or economic contributions, but because their dignity demands that we not perpetually relegate millions to a legal limbo, such as those who currently fall under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) categories, that denies them basic protections and opportunities.

More broadly, it would require a fundamental shift in how we think and talk about immigration. Instead of asking what unauthorized immigrants have done to deserve to stay, we should ask what justifies treating any group of human beings as perpetually excludable from the protections and recognition that dignity demands. Instead of debating who among unauthorized immigrants is worthy of compassion—the DACA, the essential workers, the parents of US citizens—we should recognize that all are worthy simply by virtue of being human. This is not some sort of naivete mixed with idealism. It is a practical framework grounded in the fundamental principles of human rights and the constitutional democracy we, Americans, have historically fought for and deserve.",https://blogsmedia.lse.ac.uk/blogs.dir/58/files/2025/11/Dignity-not-detention-Flickr-747x420-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 20:57:27.086317

Circuit Court of Appeals put the entire order on hold.
Then, on Nov. 5, she presided over an eight-hour hearing featuring emotional testimony from witnesses who spoke of jarring encounters with armed federal agents.
Ellis’ order, which is now on hold, forbade agents from using “riot control weapons” against protesters or observers who pose no immediate threat, and without two warnings.
The 7th Circuit then found that the meetings would infringe on the separation of powers.","The federal appeals court in Chicago signaled Wednesday it might narrow an historic order handed down earlier this month, which limited the use of force by federal agents amid the aggressive deportation campaign that swept the city this fall.

For now, a three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put the entire order on hold. The panel found the Nov. 6 preliminary injunction from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to be “overbroad.” But it also promised a quick appeal process.

“In no uncertain terms,” the panel wrote, “the district court’s order enjoins an expansive range of defendants, including the President of the United States, the entire Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and anyone acting in concert with them.

“The practical effect is to enjoin all law enforcement officers within the executive branch,” it said.

The panel, made up of Judges Michael Brennan, Frank Easterbrook and Michael Scudder, set a briefing schedule that lasts through Dec. 8. Oral arguments have not been scheduled.

It’s the second time the 7th Circuit has intervened in the case before Ellis, brought by media organizations such as the Chicago Headline Club, Block Club Chicago and the Chicago Newspaper Guild, which represents journalists at the Chicago Sun-Times.

It became a high-profile vehicle for lawyers to challenge the use of tear gas, pepper balls and other aggressive tactics by U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and the agents who carried out “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Ellis at one point forced Bovino into her courtroom and also required him to sit for a five-hour deposition. Then, on Nov. 5, she presided over an eight-hour hearing featuring emotional testimony from witnesses who spoke of jarring encounters with armed federal agents.

She also heard portions of Bovino’s videotaped deposition, in which he said the agents’ use of force had been “more than exemplary.”

But news broke days after Ellis handed down her preliminary injunction that Bovino and many of his agents would be leaving town, at least for the winter. They’ve since taken their deportation campaign to Charlotte, North Carolina.

A DHS source told the Chicago Sun-Times they could return four-fold in March. Ellis made note of that reporting as she recently scheduled a trial on a more permanent ruling for March 2. She’s also set to meet with lawyers in the case Thursday.

Ellis’ order, which is now on hold, forbade agents from using “riot control weapons” against protesters or observers who pose no immediate threat, and without two warnings. It restricted the feds’ use of chokeholds, and it required agents to display identifying star or badge numbers “conspicuously” in “two separate places.”

Ellis made clear during the litigation that she did not intend to micromanage agents, nor did she mean to interfere with the executive branch’s decision to enforce federal immigration law.

Still, the appellate panel found that her order “resembles a federal regulation” when it came to restrictions on the use of “riot control weapons.”

The appeals court panel also questioned whether the plaintiffs have standing that gives them the authority to sue the Trump administration. They said there are “open questions” as to whether the harm allegedly inflicted upon the plaintiffs in the past “is likely to imminently happen to them in the future.”

“A fear that such harm will recur is insufficient, on its own, to show standing for injunctive relief,” the panel wrote. “And we are aware of public reporting suggesting that the enhanced immigration enforcement initiative may have lessened or ceased, which could affect both the justiciability of this case and the propriety of injunctive relief.”

The panel also warned, “do not overread today’s order,” promising the expedited appeal process.

“We have not concluded that preliminary relief is precluded,” the panel wrote. “Acting on a very compressed timeline, the district court has developed voluminous and robust factual findings. Those findings may support entry of a more tailored and appropriate preliminary injunction that directly addresses the First and Fourth Amendment claims raised by these plaintiffs.”

The 7th Circuit also intervened last month after Ellis, having already ordered Bovino into her courtroom, told him she wanted him to return every weeknight over seven days, so they could discuss his agents’ daily actions.

She did so after hearing claims that the agents, including Bovino, were using tear gas without justification.

Bovino agreed to the meetings. But the Justice Department challenged the order. The 7th Circuit then found that the meetings would infringe on the separation of powers.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6557f53/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3558+0+299/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2Fce%2Fccd2e281474696beb85729a280cd%2Fbroadviewprotest-100425-013.JPG,N,,2025-11-19 20:57:41.004437

A key premise of the hearing was the wrongful detention of U.S. citizens in immigration enforcement, which have become visible amid the U.S. government’s sweeping efforts in immigration raids.
A recent ProPublica report counted 170 such incidents since the beginning of the Trump administration.
“We’re watching the Trump administration weaponize the government and military against its citizens right now,” Salinas concluded.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in an opening statement that people on the left continue to vilify immigration enforcement officials who are simply carrying out their duties under the law, and assaults and attacks on immigration officers have skyrocketed.","House Democrats held a forum Wednesday to call attention to harms from President Donald Trump’s tough-on-immigration enforcement push, highlighting stories of individuals who interacted with immigration agents.

Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the event was necessary to push back on Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions and the Trump administration’s policies.

“Democrats are doing what Republicans won’t, sounding the alarm on what Border Patrol and ICE are doing to American citizens and communities across the country under the Trump administration,” Thompson said.

Witnesses included Rev. David Black, a Chicago-based pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, who told of his story of immigration agents firing upon him with pepper balls while he was protesting at the Broadview ICE Detention Center.

“We know very little about what happens to people after they are detained by ICE, though many are sent to outsourced internment camps, which have been described by independent observers as death camps,” Black said.

James Brown, a military veteran, told the story about his wife Donna Hughes Brown, an Irish national whom he said legal permanent U.S. resident with a green card. He said she is currently in immigration detention based on misdemeanor bad check charges from more than a decade ago that were valued at $60.

Brown questioned why the Trump administration would seek to detain his wife for the misdemeanor and seek to deport her while Trump issues pardons in million-dollar fraud cases.

“You know, my wife’s got a $60 deal, and they pardon people for millions of dollars,” Brown said. “Just insane.”

Naureen Shah, director of policy and government affairs on immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union, told the forum the Trump administration policies were not about immigration enforcement but “consolidating power.”

“The administration promises safety but threatens the safety of us by unleashing agents in our communities and essentially promising them immunity, immunity that they do not have,” Shah said.

Other witnesses were pediatricians — Minal Giri, executive director of the Midwest Human Rights Consortium, and Alan Shapiro, senior medical director of the Bronx Health Collective — who warned about the immigration raids’ impact on the health of children and called for schools and hospital to be declared safe zones from immigration enforcement.

A key premise of the hearing was the wrongful detention of U.S. citizens in immigration enforcement, which have become visible amid the U.S. government’s sweeping efforts in immigration raids. A recent ProPublica report counted 170 such incidents since the beginning of the Trump administration.

Rep. Andrea Salinas, D-Ore., said the number is actually “at least 172” and shared the stories of two of her constituents who are U.S. citizens and detained by immigration enforcement.

One was a woman who was with her husband and taken from her car, had a gun pointed to her face, her wrists handcuffed to her ankles and was detained for hours at a field office in Portland before immigration officers realized their mistake, Salinas said.

The other was a man who was taken from work site by masked ICE agents, forced on to the floor of van and held for hours at a field office despite his pleas they had the wrong person, she said.

“We’re watching the Trump administration weaponize the government and military against its citizens right now,” Salinas concluded. “This is plain and simple. That is what they’re doing.”

Senate hearing

The forum took place as a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee concurrently held a separate hearing titled, “ICE Under Fire: The Radical Left’s Crusade Against Immigration Enforcement,” which a different perspective on immigration enforcement and hostility toward officials as the problem.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in an opening statement that people on the left continue to vilify immigration enforcement officials who are simply carrying out their duties under the law, and assaults and attacks on immigration officers have skyrocketed.

He said people have rammed officers with vehicles, thrown rocks, bottles and smoke grenades, laid down in roads to prevent officers from leaving and slashed tires on government vehicles, among other actions.

“Protestors have made violent threats against ICE officers, comparing them to fascists and Nazis, inciting more violence against immigration officers who are again are simply doing the job Congress asked them to do, they are enforcing federal laws,” Cornyn said.

Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said in an opening statement that American citizens were caught up in these raids, such as a pregnant woman in Florida, a U.S. citizen, who was thrown to the ground in an arrest and later miscarried.

“What we are seeing every day is new acts of brutality and misuse of force in communities across the country,” Padilla said.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/police_gold_medal671_120622-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 19:56:31.626508

State sovereign immunity derives from the traditional immunity held by governments at the time of the Constitution’s ratification.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court should hold that the NJTC can be held accountable in court for the injuries it causes.","Under our constitutional system, states like New Jersey have sovereign immunity, which protects them from being sued unless they have agreed to it. But states can create corporations that are distinct from the state to carry out public functions like transportation. Buses operated by one such entity, the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJTC), struck and injured people in New York and Pennsylvania. When defending against suits to recover damages, the NJTC insisted that it was immune from suit as an arm of the State of New Jersey. The Court of Appeals of New York disagreed, while the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania agreed that the NJTC was immune. The United States Supreme Court agreed to review both decisions.

In November 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that the NJTC lacks sovereign immunity and can be sued for injuries it causes.

State sovereign immunity derives from the traditional immunity held by governments at the time of the Constitution’s ratification. And under English common law at that time, corporations like the NJTC were considered legal entities distinct from the sovereign, which could sue and be sued, regardless of whether they served a public purpose. As a wealth of scholarly treatises and judicial decisions makes clear, the common law inextricably associated the capacity to sue and be sued with corporate status. Accordingly, even corporate entities associated with the monarch, like the East India Company, the Bank of England, and others, were routinely sued in the decades preceding ratification of the Constitution.

The American Framers embraced the English rule that state-affiliated corporations could be haled into court. As Chief Justice John Marshall recognized, American “ideas of a corporation, its privileges and its disabilities,” were “derived entirely from the English books.” Throughout the federal and state constitutional conventions, participants consistently distinguished corporations from true sovereigns like the states. Precisely because the states were not corporations, it was understood that states would retain their sovereignty and be immune from suit without their consent.

It was also understood, however, that state-affiliated corporations, unlike the states themselves, were amenable to suit. In the early decades of the new nation, the Supreme Court regularly exercised jurisdiction over these corporations, such as state-created and state-controlled banks. The Court was clear that “public corporations,” i.e., those “founded by the government, for public purposes,” could be sued just like any others. These cases demonstrate that corporations like the NJTC traditionally lacked the sovereign immunity of the states that created them.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court should hold that the NJTC can be held accountable in court for the injuries it causes.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-11-19 20:57:45.915194

And in 1969, the year following his deportation order, a court issued another order allowing Bojerski to be released from custody and apply for employment authorization, according to Stoller.
But the court did not rule the deportation order fulfilled—and therefore invalid—and denied his application for permanent residency.
After 15 years of compliance under the most recent supervision order, Bojerski was taken into ICE custody during his follow-up immigration meeting on October 30.
According to his wife, Bojerski is unable to take his regular medications and is now in a wheelchair.","In October, Paul John Bojerski, a 79-year-old grandfather who has been in the United States since he was five, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for not complying with a deportation order that was issued nearly 60 years ago. On Tuesday, a judge ordered Bojerski to remain in ICE detention as she considers the complications of the case.

Over the summer, Bojerski was told during a routine meeting with immigration officials that he must self-deport or face detention based on an unenforced deportation order issued in 1968, the Orlando Sentinel recently reported. But with no passport or country to return to, David Stoller, Bojerski's immigration attorney, says Bojerski has nowhere to go.

""There are situations where it is just impracticable to try and deport them,"" Stoller told WESH 2 News, a local NBC News affiliate.

Bojerski, whose birth name is Zbigniew Janusz Bojerski, was born to Polish parents in a German refugee camp in 1946 following World War II and has been in the U.S. since his parents legally immigrated in 1952, according to the Sentinel. Although he was admitted as a lawful permanent resident under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, Bojerski never became a citizen. Following a conviction for larceny and receiving stolen goods in his early 20s, Bojerski was ordered to be deported, reports the Sentinel.

However, attempts to deport Bojerski failed after Poland and West Germany—both under communist rule at the time—refused to take him. And in 1969, the year following his deportation order, a court issued another order allowing Bojerski to be released from custody and apply for employment authorization, according to Stoller.

After his release, Bojerski ran into legal trouble again and was convicted of rape in 1972. Bojerski's wife of 37 years, Gayle Bojerski, told the Sentinel that the conviction stemmed from a fraternity party incident involving multiple students. Although Bojerski was convicted and served three years in prison, he maintains that he was not involved in the incident. After his release, Bojerski would go on to complete school and become an optician, according to the Sentinel, which ultimately led him to move to Florida, where he met his wife and worked until his retirement.

Bojerski later applied for permanent residency through his wife, arguing that he was eligible because the 1968 deportation order had been fulfilled, and cited multiple trips out of the country where he had been able to reenter without issue or questioning by immigration officials. But the court did not rule the deportation order fulfilled—and therefore invalid—and denied his application for permanent residency. Instead, the court issued a new supervision order in 2010.

After 15 years of compliance under the most recent supervision order, Bojerski was taken into ICE custody during his follow-up immigration meeting on October 30. Since being detained, Bojerski—who's undergone three back surgeries—has been in declining health. According to his wife, Bojerski is unable to take his regular medications and is now in a wheelchair. Last week, Bojerski was left on the floor for hours and suffered a minor concussion after facility staff were locked out and unable to help after he fell from his chair while sleeping.

During his bond hearing on Tuesday, Judge Romy Lerner said she had ""concerns"" about detaining Bojerski given his age and health, according to the Sentinel. But for now, Lerner has postponed making a determination on whether he could be released on bond, given the case's complications. ""Unfortunately,"" Lerner said during the hearing, ""no matter what I decide, the government may appeal my decision, which may involve you remaining in detention even if I were to grant the bond."" The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lawyer confirmed that she would appeal a decision to grant Bojerski bond—despite agreeing that he is not a flight risk—and will issue a new deportation order to deport him to a third country if Lerner rules the 1968 deportation order invalid, reports the Sentinel.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/11/krtphotoslive958615-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 21:56:30.731392

One of the school’s infant teachers, Diana Santillana Galeano — known to the students as “Miss Diana” — was abducted by ICE on the morning of November 5 as she prepared to start her shift for the day. While my 3-year-old son did not see the teacher’s abduction, we arrived at the school — Rayito de Sol, located in the Roscoe Village neighborhood — shortly thereafter, and he was emotionally shaken by the traumatic aftermath unfolding at his beloved daycare.

Seeing his classmates, teachers, and other parents weeping and huddling together caused my son to break down. He eventually became withdrawn and quiet, appearing to become numb in the midst of the chaos around him. My husband was thankfully able to leave work to come to the school and care for him at home. He did his best to offer what comfort he could, telling our son that mommy had to stay behind at the school because I was a “helper” and that I needed to help Miss Diana come back. The next seven days were a whirlwind of community care and rapid organizing, as we tried to help our kids process this trauma.

How Can We Comfort Our Children When the Trauma Is Ongoing?

After a child witnesses a traumatic event, parents are generally advised to reassure the child that they are safe, to promise that the grownups in their life will protect them from harm, and to confirm that the threat has passed. But parents living in cities being terrorized by Donald Trump’s secret police can’t actually offer these recommended words of comfort to our kids — to do so would be a bald-faced lie.

Because the truth is that while this regime still reigns — with a bloated Department of Homeland Security budget, helmed by untrained, violent agents hell-bent on ignoring laws while abducting our neighbors, and with little to no meaningful resistance by an opposition party — our children are not safe.

Children in Illinois have suffered months of systematic physical and emotional abuse by ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents during Operation Midway Blitz, with kids of color enduring the worst of it. For example:

A baby was recently pepper sprayed in Cicero.

Kids in South Shore were zip-tied — restrained with plastic flex-cuffs on their wrists — after their home was raided in the dead of night, so that agents could cosplay Call of Duty characters and rappel from a military-grade helicopter.

A child suffering from stage four cancer lost her primary caregiver to a raid in a Home Depot parking lot in Niles, Illinois, a village near Chicago’s northwest border.

Children playing outside at an elementary school in Logan Square were surrounded by tear gas as agents tossed canisters through their car windows.

A 15-year-old boy on the Southeast side was slammed to the ground and then disappeared into a garage for several hours.

Numerous schools across the city have been forced into soft lockdowns after ICE has abducted family members, nannies, or workers outside of schools. Teachers have reported their kids crying, expressing feelings of fear and confusion.

Once separated from their parents, this regime has also pressured children to renounce asylum claims, threatening them with criminal liability if they do not self-deport.

ICE claims in their video propaganda that raids like the South Shore attack removed criminals from our streets. Not only was this later determined to be false, but untold levels of terror were inflicted on innocent children that day.

How We Mobilized to Defend Miss Diana

I was already working as a part-time immigration attorney and anti-ICE organizer before the abduction of the infant teacher at my son’s daycare, so I was fortunately in a position to begin leading efforts for Miss Diana’s release. The values that the school cultivates — empathy, diversity, and altruism — lend themselves well to a robust parent community that instantly sprang into action. Together we rapidly mobilized for Miss Diana.

Phone calls from parents and community members to elected officials and legal counsel led to a same-day press conference and a vital habeas corpus petition filed on Miss Diana’s behalf in federal court by 2 p.m. that day, just a few hours after ICE stormed the daycare. Such petitions have been crucial for disappeared Chicagoans; DHS enjoys shipping our abducted neighbors to states like Kentucky, Michigan, or Louisiana within 24 to 48 hours after routinely denying them access to legal counsel at Broadview, the immigration jail just west of Chicago, known for its “unnecessarily cruel” and inhumane conditions, where members of our community have been protesting ever since ICE began its occupation of our city. Here, because of our swift action, the Northern District of Illinois retained jurisdiction in Miss Diana’s case.

A community rally that night drew upwards of 500 people and also aided in our fundraising efforts, eventually growing her legal defense fund to over $150,000. Parents at the school banded together physically as well: Because the school was closed for several days as a result, some formed communal home daycares among themselves.

We spent the next week circulating a petition calling for Miss Diana’s immediate release, creating t-shirts and yard signs, and making thoughtful media appearances. We wrote cold direct messages to Instagram influencers and celebrities. We joined Zoom conferences in collaboration with local unions and the ACLU for Know Your Rights seminars and participated in “Migra Watch” trainings led by one of the city’s leading resistance organizations, the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, that shared knowledge on how to safely document and record ICE. We collaborated with local Alderman Matt Martin for a Purple Day of Action in solidarity with Miss Diana and all care workers. We tied purple ribbons — symbolizing Miss Diana’s favorite color and the color of the union working with child care staff — to local schools in the neighborhood and held rallies demanding that ICE leave Chicago and return Miss Diana to her community. We protested at Broadview and praised the suburban moms who were arrested in solidarity with our fight.

We also created a care plan for the rest of our teachers in line with the dozens of other mutual aid networks that have been vital in Chicago to support our immigrant communities. Many of our teachers suffer from food insecurity as a result of their fear over leaving the house because of ICE, so we began coordinating meal donations and deliveries. We offered to escort them to their cars or homes and signed up for patrol shifts outside of the school, whistles at the ready should ICE return. We began working with the school’s administration to assist them with long term immigration support. We did all of this while attempting to ignore a vile smear campaign orchestrated by DHS’s social media operators and explaining to folks that a “.gov” website is not in any way a reliable source to cite for information.

These Fears Take a Toll on All Our Children

Like all moms juggling numerous tasks at once, we tackled this work while also trying to prioritize the increasing emotional needs of our kids. We crafted thoughtful responses as best we could to their heartbreaking questions, like “If I speak Spanish outside of our house, are they going to take me too?” For families of immigrants especially, when they asked these questions, we wanted to reassure them, but struggled not to mislead. The Trump administration makes baseless claims that agents are only going after “the worst of the worst,” but Chicagoans recognize this as a blatant lie. They’ve stolen U.S. citizens simply for being Brown. They’ve snatched our tamale workers, our teachers, and our gardeners. Being undocumented is not a criminal offense no matter how many times Kristi Noem tries to convince you otherwise, and, regardless, nothing would justify the indiscriminate violence that “shocks the conscience,” according to one federal judge, that we’ve seeing from these federal agents. I’ve lived in Chicago for 15 years and have only felt unsafe when these masked agents started invading our communities.

This new danger has taken a toll on our children. Many parents have described their kids working through their trauma through role playing, relaying nightmares, struggling with sleep, and emotional outbursts. A new study links Trump’s immigration raids to rising fear and mental health risks among kids in immigrant families. Researchers identified harm to emotional development and academic performance. Chicago public schools reported that attendance is down significantly since Trump began terrorizing our beloved city.

What do you say to a child in this moment? I often struggle with how to explain this level of anti-immigrant racism to my two kids. I try instead to highlight our resistance: I bring them with me to anti-ICE rallies, they help me make HANDS OFF CHICAGO posters, and we read books like “Dreamers” by Yuyu Morales and “Prisons Must Fall” by Mariame Kaba and Jane Ball. We work on our Spanish and visit Latine neighborhoods for “Dia de Los Muertos” celebrations. My husband shows them videos of me whistling at ICE near our home and collecting tear gas canisters. When they see my gas mask on the table and ask me why I need that, I teach them about state violence while explaining the tools I have to defend myself and our neighbors.

Last week our community received the incredible news that Miss Diana was released by DHS after a federal judge determined her detention was illegal. We were overjoyed to celebrate this win with our children and eager to spotlight how the collective can prevail. When our community came together with a singular goal, we defeated an enemy much larger and more powerful than us. Anchored by Miss Diana’s strength and grace, we hope that this lesson can be a balm to some of our children’s fears. At the same time, we want them to know that this fight isn’t over. These resources should be available to all of our abducted neighbors, not just beloved daycare teachers with the backing of an army of parents. And we intend to continue organizing to achieve this.

Fascism relies on division. Leaning hard into your community is a powerful tool in opposition. As I look to my comrades in Charlotte and New Orleans, I am hopeful that they will build on Chicago’s resistance to keep their children, and all of their neighbors, safe.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2244959570-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:57:44.605141

“Our priority is to uphold the human rights standards that these individuals deserve and to ensure that plans to house undocumented immigrants at the joint base do not interfere with military readiness.” Loading...","President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed months ago that it would use Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst as an immigrant detention center, but in a letter sent to two New Jersey congressmen this week, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said there’s “no firm timeframe” for when the facility will begin operations.

Noem’s letter to Reps. Donald Norcross (D-Camden) and Herb Conaway (D-Delran), the latter of whom represents half of the base in Congress, indicates that the process of constructing the infrastructure needed to detain immigrants has not even begun, and that DHS is still “assess[ing] the viability” of such a plan.

“Currently, there is no approved construction plan for the location of this facility and no firm timeframe for intakes or length of operation at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst,” Noem wrote. “ICE is working with [the Department of War] to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy to support this site. Should a contract be awarded to build and operate a detention facility at this location, the contract will establish the detention standards by which the detention operator will be obligated to abide.”

Some of Noem’s answers, though, could be out of date; the letter is dated September 29, 2025, but Norcross and Conaway said they did not receive it until November 17. Their initial letter to Noem requesting details on the JBMDL plan was sent on July 28.

New Jersey currently has two operational immigrant detention facilities, the Elizabeth Detention Center and Delaney Hall in Newark, that collectively have around 1,300 beds. The Trump administration, which has sought to massively ramp up the country’s immigrant detention and deportation networks, began looking into the possibility of using JBMDL in Burlington and Ocean Counties as as detention center at the beginning of this year, and confirmed in a July 15 letter to Conaway that they were moving ahead with the plan.

Conaway, Norcross, and most of their Democratic colleagues in the New Jersey delegation quickly sent a letter asking a number of follow-up questions: when would the facility begin operations? Who would be detained there? Would federal officials coordinate with base leaders and surrounding communities? What costs would be reimbursed?

Noem’s response answers some of those questions. She wrote that detainees will be allowed access to medical care and legal representation, and that DHS will “coordinate with law enforcement partners”; she also claimed that ICE is focusing its detention efforts on criminals and other potentially dangerous persons, though data from New Jersey’s two existing detention centers show that isn’t necessarily the case.

“ICE makes custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, weighing all relevant factors, including risk of flight, danger to public safety, and national security concerns,” Noem wrote. “ICE also evaluates humanitarian circumstances as required by law, including serious medical conditions or primary caregiver status. Consistent with Trump Administration directives, however, ICE is prioritizing the detention of criminal aliens, cartel-linked traffickers, and others who pose clear threats to the safety and security of the United States.”

Noem’s letter is the second response Conaway and Norcross have gotten from the Trump administration on JBMDL; the first, an October letter from the Department of Defense, contained no new information at all.

The two congressmen said in a statement that they remain concerned about the Trump administration’s “ongoing disregard” for undocumented immigrants’ rights, and that they will continue to press for detailed answers on the administration’s plans for JBMDL.

“While we acknowledge that the Department of Homeland Security has finally responded to our questions, we will continue to monitor for any further developments regarding plans to house undocumented immigrants at the joint base,” they said. “Our priority is to uphold the human rights standards that these individuals deserve and to ensure that plans to house undocumented immigrants at the joint base do not interfere with military readiness.”

“Republicans claim they care about rejecting the horrific actions of abusive regimes but refuse to call out the authoritarianism we’re seeing unfold right before our eyes,” said Pettersen. “Trump is unhinged — he’s weaponized our judicial system to target anyone who disagrees with him, worked to silence the press dedicated to exposing his corruption, and has terrorized immigrant communities – including citizens, legal residents, and even children – and deployed the military against our country’s own citizens.

The city had been on high alert since last week, as reports surfaced that the operation would involve armored vehicles and as many as 200 agents.

Immigrants in Charlotte are the latest target of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement blitz.

It was only a matter of time before a city in the American South became the subject of a CBP operation. Cities across the United States like Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Chicago had been previously targeted with excessive and unnecessary enforcement tactics.

Yet, Charlotte has a different history of immigration than those cities—one that makes these raids, arrests, and tactics especially worrisome for the city’s Latino community.

North Carolina’s Latino population does not stretch back generations like in cities such as Los Angeles or Chicago. Rather, the Latino population in the state has grown exponentially since the 1990s. Charlotte is a prime example of how Latino immigrants contributed to the development of cities across the South as well as other non-traditional immigrant gateways. As the immigrant population in the city increased, construction boomed and Charlotte grew into a thriving economic hub, serving as the home of Bank of America’s headquarters. It is not unusual for cities to grow on the backs of immigrant workers, but it is particularly true for Charlotte. Immigrants not only contributed to the city’s traditional industries like construction and hospitality; they also opened new businesses and revitalized neighborhoods in the Queen City. Now, those same businesses that propped up Charlotte’s economy are in jeopardy of closing as a result of the fear fostered by these aggressive enforcement tactics.

The politics of immigrant rights issues in the city have been complex. Back in 2006, Mecklenburg County, where Charlotte is located, was one of the first jurisdictions in the nation to implement a 287(g) agreement – a section in the Immigration and Nationality Act that allows local law enforcement agencies to deputize local officers to carry out certain immigration enforcement functions. This type of collaboration between local law enforcement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) then spread throughout several other counties in North Carolina and throughout the country.

However, the collaboration had its costs. First, it eroded the trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Why would noncitizens report crimes committed against them if they thought that by doing so, they could attract police officers who could ask them for proof of immigration status and potentially deport them? Fewer crimes reported means fewer crimes investigated and solved.

Second, the U.S. Department of Justice brought a lawsuit against the sheriff in Alamance County, North Carolina – about an hour and a half drive from Charlotte – for racial profiling Latinos through the 287(g) program. The lawsuit against Alamance led to the termination of the 287(g) agreement in that jurisdiction.

Fueled by the movement away from continued cooperation with ICE, and after arduous advocacy from grassroots organizations, several candidates running for sheriff in North Carolina counties in 2018, including in Mecklenburg, vowed to discontinue their 287(g) agreement if elected; and they were. This did not make Charlotte a “sanctuary” jurisdiction by any means, but the shift gave Republican lawmakers in the state the pretext they sought to brand the Mecklenburg County as such and invite harsher enforcement tactics.

The administration’s latest assault in Charlotte is an effort to stifle the dissent communities have expressed against fueling the administration’s deportation pipeline. The administration’s, and now Republican lawmakers’, talking point is that the deployment is to keep communities safe and assist efforts to reduce crime.

But that explanation doesn’t check out. Charlotte Police figures show reductions in violent crime in the city over the past years. What crimes was CBP targeting when agents were filmed shattering the car window of a Latino U.S. citizen and violently dragging him out? None. CBP let him go, and Charlotte Police were not called. In the eyes of CBP, he looked undocumented. In fact, North Carolina Governor Josh Stein came out and claimed that CBP’s actions amounted to racial profiling.

What is most alarming is that the U.S. Supreme Court implicitly sanctioned these tactics. In Vazquez Perdomo v. Noem, the Court paused a lower court order that had set limits on immigration enforcement agencies’ use of “roving patrols” to target those who appear to be noncitizens. Justice Sotomayor gave a stark warning in her dissent, noting that Latinos would bear the brunt of SCOTUS’ action.

In a previous life, I worked in immigrants’ rights did more Know-Your-Rights (KYRs) presentations than I can remember. KYRs are always tricky because the audience expects to hear magic words that will lead law enforcement officers to respect people’s rights. In practice, however, law enforcement will likely find an exception to the rules that gets them the result they seek – be it the right to interrogate or even search an individual. As such, the right to remain silent was the most crucial piece of information one could share with community members. And while that piece of advice still applies, such words don’t seem to stop the Border Patrol officers conducting these enforcement actions from interrogating, harassing, and threatening Latinos who fit the profile of who they think is an undocumented person.

Charlotte’s vibrant immigrant community heavily contributed to and continues to power the growth of the city. Time and time again, however, immigrant communities are scapegoated by politicians looking to score partisan points, blaming noncitizens for crime despite statistics that show the contrary, and Charlotte is no exception.

The inspiring news is that the people of Charlotte have risen to voice their opposition. It is no secret that the immigrants’ rights infrastructure in a city like Charlotte is not as robust as other larger cities that have faced these actions. But community members, elected officials, organizations and attorneys are leveraging their limited resources to respond to this crisis.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/immigration-impact-north-carolina-charlotte.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 17:58:19.021307

But so far, their demands to add guardrails to funding bills to stop the administration from engaging in so-called “pocket rescissions” have gone unanswered.

One senior House Republican, though, did try to add such a provision to an appropriations bill — only for the White House to intervene and stop him, NOTUS has learned.

The Office of Management and Budget’s director, Russell Vought, is the mastermind behind the administration’s pocket rescissions strategy which involves a request from the president to withhold money already appropriated by Congress. But the request comes so late in the fiscal year that Congress doesn’t have enough time to act within the allotted timeframe. and the administration considers the money rescinded once the fiscal year ends.

Sign Up for NOTUS’ Free Daily Newsletter

The Trump White House had so far used pocket rescissions once, when it withheld nearly $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid in August. The Supreme Court allowed the move, effectively greenlighting Vought’s strategy for the near future.

But in July, Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee and one of the 12 so-called “cardinals,” quietly added a provision to the fiscal 2026 bill for the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Subcommittee — which funds the agencies most impacted by Trump’s two rescissions requests — that would have addressed pocket rescissions.

The clause, Sec. 7065, would have given Congress an extra 45 days to consider rescissions requests submitted late in the fiscal year.

After the bill text was released, Vought reached out to Díaz-Balart, explaining that the White House was concerned about the provision, one senior White House official told NOTUS. The official said that after Vought relayed the issue, Díaz-Balart removed the provision.

The White House did more than just reach out to Díaz-Balart. Republican appropriators started receiving pressure from the White House to not support the bill if the provision remained, according to a source familiar with the matter.

A second source familiar with the matter told NOTUS that some GOP appropriators contacted the White House shortly after the bill came out to let officials know that they were “working to get it out.”

Members quickly spoke to Díaz-Balart about the provision, urging him to remove it. Rep. Andy Harris, a top appropriator and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, which has continuously supported the White House’s rescissions efforts, confirmed to NOTUS that he spoke with the Florida congressman, saying “there was discussion about (the provision) and it never came to fruition.”

Rep. Andrew Clyde, another appropriator and Freedom Caucus member, told NOTUS that Díaz-Balart’s move “would have eviscerated pocket rescissions. It wasn’t supported, so it came out.” He declined to comment on conversations he had with Díaz-Balart on the issue, saying that “member to member conversations are private.”

Rep. Chuck Edwards, vice chair of the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs appropriations subcommittee, told NOTUS that he spoke with Díaz-Balart and that they “agree that the idea of pocket rescissions has been a new one, one that we’ve never faced before.”

“We should have a broader discussion on handling this situation. Whatever we decide has to be agreed on by the White House, since ultimately the president would have to sign off on anything,” Edwards told NOTUS.

“I had rather Congress have the authority and the power of the purse. One more small provision in exercising that authority, it deserves a broader conversation,” Edwards added.

When asked what drove him to add the provision to the bill, Díaz-Balart told NOTUS, “I’ve always believed that Congress has a tendency to always give too much away to the administration — any president, any administration.” Díaz-Balart said the language was not targeted at the Trump administration specifically and added that he has a “great relationship” with Vought and the White House.

The Government Accountability Office has said pocket rescissions are an attempt by the executive branch to circumvent Congress’ power of the purse and unilaterally withhold congressionally approved funding, and are therefore unlawful. Díaz-Balart did not address their lawfulness but Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, the latter of whom chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, believe they are illegal.

“My bill is a great bill,” Díaz-Balart said. “I got a lot of input from different members on different issues, on everything you can think of.”

House appropriations bills typically pass in party-line votes, so Díaz-Balart could not afford to lose any Republicans in the narrow majority. The congressman introduced a manager’s amendment changing some of the bill’s text and quietly added a note to remove the pocket rescissions clause. At the bill’s full committee markup in July, when Díaz-Balart brought up the amendment for a vote, he explained various of the provisions that would change in the bill, but did not specifically address the portion eliminating Sec. 7065.

Democrats did.

The section, House Appropriations Ranking Chair Rosa DeLauro said at the hearing, “is a clear check on agency overreach and accountability and is intended to ensure that this committee, that the Congress remains at the center of appropriations decisions.”

“There weren’t a lot of things in this bill that I liked, but I applauded and I appreciated Sec. 7065 — and now it’s gone,” Rep. Betty McCollum echoed at the time.

Speaking directly to Díaz-Balart, she added, “I realize that you have some challenges on your side, … but I cannot ideally stand back and not speak to the fine provision that you put in the bill.”

“You had a great idea, I wish you would have stuck with it,” she continued.

Ultimately, Republican appropriators passed the manager’s amendment, and the pocket rescissions provision was removed from the bill. Díaz-Balart said the manager’s amendment was “not unusual” and that “it’s part of the process where you’re constantly tweaking, moving, changing in committee, and then also on the floor, and then obviously in negotiations.”

DeLauro told NOTUS she still thinks about the provision. The ranking member said that she raised it in meetings with Congress’ top appropriators — Rep. Tom Cole along with Collins and Sen. Patty Murray — as something she wanted to add to a bipartisan continuing resolution before the government shut down in October. Guardrails against pocket rescissions ultimately did not make it into the GOP continuing resolution.

“We were anticipating that we would move in that direction,” DeLauro said. “The consensus among the four corners of appropriations was that we would have a bipartisan continuing resolution that would consider Democratic priorities and would consider looking at these issues — a mechanism to keep them from stealing what we appropriate.”",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/ab88d5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2250+0+209/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F70%2Fb4%2Fb9977a8c4372bee9e09e61812d26%2Fap23297505367306.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 17:57:28.834125

In a previous interview with Lookout Eugene-Springfield, Juanita Avila, a business owner in Cottage Grove, described how federal immigration enforcement officers yanked her from her minivan and held her down on the street Nov. 5. A resident since 2014 in the community about 19 miles south of Springfield, Avila has won support from friends and neighbors appalled by the ICE actions.

Chris Ellis told commissioners he lives around the corner from Avila’s store.

“What they did to her, what they’ve been doing to so many others everywhere, this is straight-out barbaric,” Ellis said. “There’s no other way to describe it. These people are just mindless psychos.”

Ellis said his grandfather, who fought the Nazis in World War II, would have been angry “to see the same thing happening here that he witnessed in Europe 80 years ago.”

“It has to stop,” Ellis said, echoing what many in the room expressed to commissioners. “It has no place whatsoever in a civilized democracy.”

Avila attended the commissioners’ meeting but didn’t address officials. Others spoke out, reflecting on the shattered peace and tumultuous times.

“Lane County has been a bit of an oasis until last week, when terror came to our front door,” Brenda Kame’enui, a Eugene resident, told the group.

She urged commissioners to speak out “loud and clear” to federal authorities about the proper standards for law enforcement behavior, to stand up for the rights of all county residents and “denounce excessive force.”

“The lawless federal government needs to hear from every county and state in the nation,” Kame’enui said.

County commissioners expressed support for immigrant communities and said they’d do what they can to help.

Commission Chair David Loveall shared a story about an undocumented friend he has worked with on development projects for years, who “shed tears of great fear,” worried he would be detained and have to rebuild his immigration status anew.

Loveall said he’s helped that person obtain legal representation and written letters of recommendation to aid his immigration process.

“This is everyone’s problem,” Loveall said, encouraging people to “be involved in a brown person’s life. … It’s not us and them, it’s us.”

Commissioner Heather Buch, who participated in a vigil in Cottage Grove after the ICE raids, said the event was well-attended and commended Avila’s willingness to share her story, calling her “one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.”

A video of the encounter between Avila and ICE agents “was excruciating to watch and she has stood up in her community and told her story several times since then,” Buch said.

Commissioner Laurie Trieger commended county administrators for their response to the raids, which included making $100,000 available for emergency assistance to families impacted by federal immigration activity so they can get help with rent, utilities and other needs.

Trieger said the five commissioners are well-positioned to make public statements in support of community members.

The last public statement about immigration from the commission ended with a split vote.

In April, commissioners voted 3-2 to approve a statement reaffirming that the county upholds the Oregon Sanctuary Promise Act, which prevents law enforcement from aiding federal immigration enforcement actions. That statement also reaffirmed the county’s support for transgender community members.

At the time of that vote, commissioners Pat Farr, Buch and Trieger passed the statement, while Loveall and Vice Chair Ryan Ceniga voted against it.

At the time, the disagreement hinged in part on an amendment to the statement that called for the county to pursue policies that upheld the rights of immigrants and transgender people. In April, Loveall said the county needs to uphold the rights of “all people,” not just those two groups. Ceniga at the time said he wondered if the statement added to the tension amid uncertain times, stressing he supports and accepts immigrants.",https://i0.wp.com/lookouteugene-springfield.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251106Lookout_JuanitaIW_3-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-19 18:57:48.505628

President Trump has voiced support for U.S. attacks inside Mexico and Colombia.","While hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House yesterday, President Trump called for ABC’s broadcast license to be revoked, after ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce asked him why he had not released the Epstein files.

Mary Bruce: “Mr President, why wait for Congress to release the Epstein files? Why not just do it now?”

President Donald Trump: “You know, it’s not the question that I mind. It’s your attitude. I think you are a terrible reporter. It’s the way you ask these questions. … I think the license should be taken away from ABC, because your news is so fake, and it’s so wrong. And we have a great commissioner, the chairman, who should look at that, because I think when you come in and when you’re 97% negative to Trump and then Trump wins the election in a landslide, that means obviously your news is not credible, and you’re not credible as a reporter.”

President Trump defended Prince Mohammed bin Salman when ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce asked about the Saudi crown prince’s involvement in the 2018 murder of Washington Post opinion columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

President Donald Trump: “As far as this gentleman is concerned, he’s done a phenomenal job. You’re mentioning somebody that was extremely controversial. A lot of people didn’t like that gentleman that you’re talking about. Whether you like him or didn’t like him, things happen. But he knew nothing about it. And we can leave it at that. You don’t have to embarrass our guest by asking a question like that.”

Trump’s comments contradict a U.S. intelligence report which found that Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi’s killing. Back in 2018, Khashoggi was lured into the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, where a 15-person team led by a close associate of Prince Mohammed drugged, murdered and dismembered Khashoggi with a bone saw. Following the press conference, Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, issued a statement saying, “Trump’s shameful and disgusting comments about the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi cannot be separated from Trump’s personal business interests with the Saudi regime. Trump and his family are receiving, at a minimum, tens of millions annually from branding deals with Saudi Arabia — payments for doing nothing more than permitting their name to be attached to Saudi projects.”

On Tuesday night, Trump held a black-tie dinner for MBS at the White House. Dozens of CEOs attended, including Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook.

Hamas and other factions inside Gaza are rejecting the U.S.-backed U.N. plan to place Gaza under the control of a U.S.-led board and an international stabilization force. In a statement, the Palestinian groups likened the plan to a “deep international partnership in the war of extermination waged by the [Israeli] occupation against our people.” This is Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem.

Hazem Qassem: “This resolution fully adopts the Israeli position and completely ignores the Palestinian position and the interests of our Palestinian people here in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu does not want to continue with the ceasefire agreement, but rather wants to impose his vision on the Gaza Strip and the entire region.”

This comes as Israel continues to carry out airstrikes in Gaza. Officials in Gaza say Israel has killed 279 Palestinians since the ceasefire came into effect in October.

In Lebanon, Israel launched an airstrike on a Palestinian refugee camp Ein el-Hilweh, killing 13 people and wounding several others. Another Israeli attack targeted a vehicle in southern Lebanon, killing one person. Established in 1948, Ein el-Hilweh is the largest of 12 Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and is home to at least 64,000 people. Tuesday’s attack is the latest violation of Israel’s ceasefire with Hezbollah, which went into effect a year ago. According to the U.N., Israel has been targeting Hezbollah in near-daily attacks since the ceasefire, resulting in at least 100 civilian deaths.

President Trump has voiced support for U.S. attacks inside Mexico and Colombia. This comes as Trump is refusing to rule out sending in ground troops to Venezuela. The New York Times reports Trump has also signed off on CIA plans for covert measures inside Venezuela, possibly to prepare the battlefield for a wider war. However, Trump has also reportedly reopened back-channel communications with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has recently amassed over 15,000 troops in the region and bombed over 20 boats in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific. The U.S. has claimed the boats were carrying drugs, but no proof has been offered. On Tuesday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Trump’s threats.

President Claudia Sheinbaum: “We’ve said this with the State Department, with Marco Rubio, and they have understood, so much so that the understanding we have with them is one of collaboration and coordination. And the first points make very clear the respect for sovereignty, respect for our territoriality, and that there is collaboration and coordination without subordination.”

A federal court ruled that Texas cannot use its recently passed congressional map for the 2026 midterm elections and will instead have to rely on a previous map from 2021. Texas Republican state legislators over the summer pushed for a new congressional map that could garner the GOP five additional House seats. In his ruling striking down the new congressional map, Trump-appointed Judge Jeffrey Brown wrote, “The public perception of this case is that it’s about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map. But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton vowed to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the ruling.

Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott declared Tuesday the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the country’s largest Muslim civil rights group, a foreign terrorist organization. In a statement, Governor Abbott said CAIR’s goal was “to forcibly impose Sharia law and establish Islam’s mastership of the world.” Abbott also designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization and prohibited both groups from acquiring property in the U.S. Robert McCaw, CAIR’s director of government affairs, responded to Abbott in a letter, saying, “You do not have the authority to unilaterally declare any Americans or American institutions terrorist groups. Nor is there any basis to level this smear against our organization.”

The Trump administration has taken more steps to dismantle the Department of Education by shifting several key programs to other federal agencies. In one move, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education will be transferred to the Labor Department. Becky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, criticized the moves. She said, “Donald Trump and his administration chose American Education Week, a time when our nation is celebrating students, public schools, and educators, to announce their illegal plan to further abandon students by dismantling the Department of Education.”

A federal judge has ruled in favor of Meta and against the Federal Trade Commission in an antitrust suit that claimed the social media giant was trying to establish a monopoly by buying up Instagram and WhatsApp. In his ruling, District Judge James Boasberg wrote, “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the FTC brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down.” Earlier this year, President Trump called for the impeachment of Judge Boasberg after he ruled against President Trump’s ability to invoke wartime powers to deport migrants.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/66/79866/full_hd/hd1-Congress-Vote-Epstein-Files.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 18:57:33.754422

At 12:35 p.m. the OUSD sent an email alert to parents confirming that ICE agents were “seen near the intersection of 31st Street and Market Street,” two blocks away from Hoover Elementary.

“Your child is safe,” the email said.

According to OUSD officials, Hoover Elementary went into a “secure school protocol” because of the ICE enforcement activity nearby. Another school, Harriet Tubman CDC, “was on secure school protocol before regular dismissal for the day,” the district’s email said.

“Our other schools are following standard protocol for potential ICE activity in the community,” OUSD explained.

Neither OUSD nor Hoover Elementary officials responded to questions from The Oaklandside.

The Alameda County Immigration Legal and Education Partnership confirmed ICE was in the neighborhood around 8:40 a.m. The group said in a social media post it was “likely related to a targeted enforcement,” meaning the agents were searching for a specific person and not stopping individuals randomly. “At this time, we are not aware of any related ICE arrests in Oakland,” they wrote.

Councilmember Carroll Fife, who represents West Oakland, said in a social media post that the ICE agents may have been targeting a person who was dropping their child off as school, causing a collision.

“They were chased by masked men in an SUV that caused this collision,” Fife said.

The Oakland Police Department said in a press release they were not notified about the ICE operation. “Preliminary findings indicate that an outside law enforcement agency was conducting an investigation within the City of Oakland,” OPD said. “During their operation, officers attempted to contact the vehicle involved in their case. That vehicle later collided with an uninvolved vehicle.”

However, law enforcement officials note that in some investigations, disguise or plainclothes operations are necessary, especially considering an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against immigration law enforcement officials across the country.","While a woman from Ypsilanti, Michigan, was recently indicted for her role in an international smuggling operation that moved illegal aliens, including children, from Central America through Canada and into Michigan, a state senate committee held a hearing to consider three bills that would significantly limit state and local cooperation with federal immigration officers.

On November 6, the Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee held a hearing on three bills, Senate Bills (SB) 508, 509, and 510, that if passed, would act as a magnet for more illegal immigration and impose new burdens on state and local law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with federal immigration officials. These bills would affect how officers interact with illegal aliens, what information government agencies can share, and which procedures officers must follow when conducting immigration-related actions.

SB 508 prohibits officers from conducting immigration enforcement actions in what the bill calls “sensitive locations.” The list of these locations includes schools, colleges, and other educational institutions, places of worship, hospitals, courthouses, and facilities assisting children, pregnant women, victims of crime, or individuals with significant physical or mental disabilities. The legislation does allow enforcement in these locations only if there is an imminent threat to public safety or a court order.

Such a broad definition of “sensitive locations” creates significant operational challenges for law enforcement. If a smuggling suspect works at a hospital, drops children at school, or regularly attends services at a place of worship, officers would be unable to apprehend them at these locations even with probable cause for arrest. Individuals with outstanding immigration violations could effectively shield themselves from consequences by remaining in these protected zones. These restrictions will make routine enforcement actions more difficult, and more dangerous for all involved.

SB 509 focuses on information sharing, prohibiting state and local agencies from providing data to federal authorities that could be used for immigration enforcement. This provision would fundamentally alter how Michigan law enforcement operates in cooperation with federal partners by barring state and local agencies from sharing basic identifying information, arrest records, or custody status if that information could be used for immigration enforcement purposes. Without access to crucial intelligence gathered by Michigan law enforcement, ICE and Border Patrol will be forced to operate blindly.

SB 510 is similar to a bill recently passed in California. It requires officers conducting immigration enforcement actions to wear uniforms and forbids masks or personal disguises. The stated goal is to increase transparency and accountability. However, law enforcement officials note that in some investigations, disguise or plainclothes operations are necessary, especially considering an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against immigration law enforcement officials across the country.

While supporters of SB 508, SB 509, and SB 510 argue that the bills protect vulnerable populations and ensure privacy, Michigan’s recent smuggling case highlights potential consequences of limiting enforcement authority. As criminal networks increasingly view northern border states as a target-rich environment for smuggling operations from Canada, now is the time to strengthen the tools law enforcement needs to protect public safety and secure the border, not weaken them.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/Michigan-485947989.jpeg.webp?itok=fuAIVkFj,N,,2025-11-19 16:57:35.552046

Donate to sustain Prism’s mission and the humans behind it.

Manuel, an undocumented immigrant in North Carolina, is still reeling from two close calls with immigration enforcement as President Donald Trump’s police state unfolds nationwide.

The first close call, on Nov. 16, was at a police checkpoint in Raeford, North Carolina, a rural area in Hoke County where the population is less than 5,000. In a state where more than two dozen law enforcement agencies have signed on to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as part of the federal agency’s 287(g) program, a seemingly innocuous driver’s license checkpoint can serve as a funnel into detention and deportation.

“Thank God, we managed to get through it,” Manuel told Prism over WhatsApp, noting that he was in a car with two labor organizers. He asked to use a pseudonym for fear of deportation. “I was very scared.”

The second close call came on Nov. 17 when Manuel was on his way to work. The former North Carolina farmworker now works in construction near Newton Grove in Sampson County, another rural region of the state home to a sizable immigrant population. A co-worker sent Manuel a photo of a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) truck parked at a nearby restaurant. Manuel immediately headed home and alerted other workers to do the same.

Deciding to miss work isn’t an easy decision as the holidays approach, but Manuel said he didn’t feel as if he had a choice. Many in North Carolina’s immigrant communities are choosing to remove themselves from public life until “things return to normal,” Manuel said.

But it’s hard to know when that will be. Since June, the Trump administration has bombarded American cities with large-scale, indiscriminate, and often unlawful immigration raids targeting Latino communities. With little more than racial profiling and disdain for Democrat-run cities guiding the way, unvetted, untrained, and trigger-happy federal agents have been hard at work terrorizing local communities and apprehending immigrants and citizens alike at workplaces, businesses, and locations once considered off limits, such as churches and schools.

Trump’s mass deportations began in Los Angeles and have expanded to Chicago; Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; and New York City. Beginning Nov. 15, Charlotte—North Carolina’s largest city that is home to the state’s most sizable immigrant population—became the first Southern locale targeted with widespread immigration raids.

But ICE and CBP agents have also been spotted in rural areas such as the one where Manuel lives and works. As the impacts of the widespread raids quickly ripple outward, North Carolinians are mobilizing to stem the flow of enforcement operations in their communities.

“Snatch people up and ask questions later”

In a statement Sunday night, the migrant justice organization Siembra NC reported that Nov. 16 was “the day the most immigrants were arrested in a single day in state history.” ICE and CBP have detained more than 130 people in Charlotte thus far, with enforcement in the city expected to continue.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools educator Mechelle Vaughn told Prism that this school week has been “extremely tough.” Vaughn, a member of Public School Strong, an organization that advocates for North Carolina public schools, told Prism that English-language learners make up a large percentage of her elementary school students. Almost 21,000 children in the district were absent from school this week, and those who came to class were clearly in emotional pain, the educator said.

“It is really, really difficult when students tell you how scared they are, and when one tells you that they know that their mommy’s not going to be home when they get there because ‘they are going to get her,’” Vaughn explained. “Today it was call after call after call to the office, with parents crying because they are scared. I was crying because I could hear the fear in their voices; some were afraid their children would be taken getting off the bus.”

Parents’ fears are not unfounded. During school hours on Tuesday, Vaughn received confirmation that ICE agents were at a nearby mobile home park where students lived. She contacted the Charlotte Mecklenburg Association of Educators and Public School Strong, which are helping support Siembra NC’s ICE watch and safety patrol rapid response. Educators and members of Siembra NC quickly arrived at the mobile home park to ensure that students getting off the school bus would be safe.

“The ICE agents had already left, but there was concern that they may be back, and we were also told that people were apprehended,” Vaughn explained. “We just kind of all knew we had to jump into action, and we came up with a plan for what we would do if ICE came back. We weren’t going to let our kids off the bus.”

The public school teacher told Prism that immigrant educators across the district are also afraid to report to work, including those who have permission to live and work in the U.S.

“It’s a very scary time. They snatch people up and ask questions later,” Vaughn said.

Axios reported that New Orleans was likely the Trump administration’s next Southern target. However, the North Carolina publication The Assembly confirmed that federal agents planned to descend on the state capital this week—and descend they did.

For locals tracking enforcement operations on the ground in the Raleigh area, ICE and CBP sightings began rolling in early on Nov. 18. Masked agents were seen carrying out enforcement at an apartment complex on Navaho Drive in midtown. Later in the afternoon, in nearby Durham, Siembra NC confirmed multiple detainments downtown and further north on Avondale Drive, an area beloved for its immigrant-owned businesses.

Local and state officials have been quick to condemn this week’s raids. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein said in a video statement Nov. 16 that the raids are “not making us safer” and that they are “stoking fear and dividing our community.”

“We’ve seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks,” Stein said.

At a Durham City Council meeting this week, Mayor Leo Williams read a joint statement from his office, the Durham County Board of Commissioners, and the Durham Public Schools Board of Education decrying the raids.

“We denounce any effort that promotes exclusion, incites fear, undermines human rights, and compromises safety,” Williams said. “Our schools, neighborhoods, and places of employment are stronger because of the diversity of the cultures, languages, and experiences that define Durham.”

While Raleigh and Durham are often grouped as a single metro area, they have decidedly different cultures, with Durham housing a vast network of grassroots organizers focused on migrant justice. More broadly, the city serves as North Carolina’s progressive organizing hub—an effect of the region’s legacy of Black freedom struggles.

While locals such as Iván Almonte anticipated that wide-scale immigration enforcement was coming down the pike in Durham, the organizer with Respuesta Rápida de Durham told Prism that immigrant communities have been pummeled in recent years, making it difficult to build sustainable infrastructure for the effective rapid response network needed in moments like this.

“It’s one thing after another,” Almonte said in a phone interview. “The attacks against our communities are unfair.”

The organizer also told Prism that North Carolina’s current fight is “bigger than ICE”: Locals are also fighting a web of anti-immigrant laws, bills, and policies. Almonte’s organization now meets with local groups and leaders on a daily basis to coordinate how best to meet the needs of immigrant communities in the region, with legal aid emerging as a top priority.

Earlier this week, the community organizer conducted a Facebook Live event that was attended by hundreds of immigrant community members. Many of the attendees are longstanding Durham County residents, immigrant business owners, and homeowners who must now consider legal action to ensure their children in the U.S. will inherit their property if they are abruptly taken by ICE. Others who attended the Facebook Live wanted help navigating the power of attorney process so that they could decide who would care for their children if they were detained. Many were concerned that if they kept missing work to avoid immigration enforcement, they would also lose their housing, though there is no legal aid that can assist with this new reality.

“These are people established in the U.S. who are facing being torn apart from their families, and it’s devastating,” Almonte said. “Immigrants from Central America and other countries fled violence, and now they are being hunted by ICE and Border Patrol in their own communities. It’s traumatizing.”

This was echoed by Ilana Dubester, the founder and executive director of El Vínculo Hispano, a nonprofit organization in Siler City that serves Latino communities across Chatham, Alamance, Randolph, Lee, and Harnett counties.

“We know it’s just a matter of time until we’re hit with enforcement,” Dubester said. “We anticipate that they will target areas where Latinos work, where they shop, where they worship. I think the goal is to make it feel like nowhere is safe.”

Dubester is fielding reports of immigration enforcement in more rural areas of the state, including Mount Airy, near the Virginia border, where she heard confirmed reports on Nov. 18 that ICE was in the area.

Leticia Zavala, a former farmworker and current coordinator with the North Carolina farmworker organizing group El Futuro Es Nuestro, also has her eye on rural areas that are home to thousands of the state’s farmworkers. Advocates are on edge, given that a few months ago, immigration raids were carried out on California farms, leading to hundreds of detainments and one farmworker’s death during a particularly chaotic workplace raid.

Zavala told Prism that she hasn’t heard of any enforcement taking place on farms, but in recent weeks, she’s received an alarming number of reports from H-2A agricultural workers alleging harassment. These are primarily Mexican farmworkers who have temporary visas to perform agricultural work in North Carolina, and, according to Zavala, many are reporting that federal immigration agents are hassling them as they attempt to return to Mexico once their season is over.

“They are fingerprinting them, asking to see their documents, and taking pictures of them for no apparent reason,” Zavala said.

Dubester is also fielding calls from terrified and confused community members. As immigration enforcement plays out across North Carolina, the Brazilian immigrant’s overarching goal is to keep the community informed—even if that means having to confirm ICE sightings herself.

“Being a naturalized American citizen used to give me a huge amount of assurance of my rights in this country, but right now those rights don’t feel 100% guaranteed,” Dubester said, noting the dozens of American citizens who have been detained by ICE in recent weeks. This includes an incident in Charlotte in which federal agents stopped a U.S. citizen twice, shattering his car window and even briefly detaining him.

“There’s no longer a guarantee of safety, as a Latina doing this work,” Dubester said. “But it won’t stop me from doing what I need to do.”.

“We’re still showing up”

This isn’t the first time the Trump administration has carried out retaliatory immigration raids in North Carolina as apparent punishment for the state’s left-leaning policies.

During the first Trump administration, voters in the state elected a series of Black sheriffs who refused to cooperate with ICE, which led to a series of workplace raids and other enforcement actions mostly targeting undocumented workers. While local organizers and residents who spoke to Prism expressed feeling overwhelmed and saddened by the latest round of enforcement, they also said they remain committed to protecting their neighborhoods.

Across Durham and Mecklenburg counties, community patrols are forming—including some outside of formal organizing spaces. Locals are making plans to accompany immigrants to court hearings, and many are already shopping for immigrant families and picking up their children from school to reduce their risk of encountering federal immigration agents.

One local resident, an immigrant mother with children in Durham public schools who requested anonymity for safety reasons, told Prism that it’s important for North Carolinians to understand that they don’t have to wait for local organizations to take action. “If you see a need in your community, there’s nothing stopping you from meeting it,” she said.

The woman, who is now carrying her passport in case she’s stopped by federal agents, told Prism that attendance is down considerably this week across Durham public schools. She is hoping that community patrols will make parents feel safer sending their children to school with trusted community members.

Previously considered “sensitive locations,” schools, hospitals, and places of worship were once protected from immigration enforcement. But in January, Trump rescinded the policy that largely governed enforcement at these locations, replacing it with a directive “that gives ICE agents unbridled power to take enforcement actions in any of these spaces,” the National Immigration Law Center reported. Faith leaders across North Carolina are now on high alert, especially after reports from Siembra NC that immigrants were detained outside of two Charlotte churches. This includes a man who was volunteering to perform church cleanup.

Rev. Breana van Velzen is the executive director of Durham Congregations In Action (DCIA), a multifaith organizing network that includes hundreds of clergy members. Van Velzen told Prism that at the beginning of the year, DCIA was alerted that the Trump administration would likely prioritize Durham for immigration enforcement because of its status as a “sanctuary city.” Faith leaders immediately partnered with Siembra NC and the social justice organization Ready the Ground for Know Your Rights.

“We’ve been holding trainings for 10 months, including one on Saturday with almost 400 local residents,” van Velzen said. “Now these community members are putting what they learned into action, doing patrols and documenting ICE in the area. In some cases, we’ve been able to scare ICE agents away, and in others, we were able to film detentions so that we could at least alert families their loved one was taken. We’re as ready as we can be.”

In recent days, the reverend has told locals who are tracking immigration enforcement in the region that they can print out copies of the Department of Homeland Security’s Form G-28 in case they can get a person’s signature before immigration agents cart them away.

“The form can help people who are getting detained get a lawyer,” van Velzen explained. “If you can get the paper in front of them—even if they just sign an X for their name—you can send the form to a lawyer or organization so they have legal aid and someone who will advocate for them and make sure they don’t get disappeared.”

Churches, mosques, and synagogues across the state have a leg up when it comes to safety protocols and scenario planning because of the nature of the attacks they experience, according to the reverend, and because many of their members have also experienced persecution and state violence. But no amount of preparation will lessen the blow if ICE carries out enforcement inside places of worship, van Velzen said.

Under the first Trump administration, North Carolina led the country in the number of immigrants who lived in churches while fighting their deportations. The state was even home to a radical network of sanctuary leaders who organized against ICE together. Samuel Oliver-Bruno was one of those leaders, and his tragic fate remains a source of trauma for local organizers.

Oliver-Bruno was in sanctuary at CityWell United Methodist Church in Durham for 11 months when he left the church on Nov. 23, 2018, to attend what was supposed to be a routine biometrics appointment for deferred action. Instead, Oliver-Bruno was violently detained by plainclothes immigration agents. Members of the Durham community rallied around him and even attempted to stop ICE from taking Oliver-Bruno by surrounding agents’ cars. But it was to no avail. Oliver-Bruno was quickly deported to Mexico, where he died shortly after, separated from his wife and son. It was later found that federal immigration agencies monitored the sanctuary leader’s social media and colluded to detain him.

The anniversary of Oliver-Bruno’s detainment is approaching as federal immigration agents again descend on the state of North Carolina and threaten the lives of thousands of immigrant families.

“Many of us are really scared, but we’re still showing up,” van Velzen said. “I’m proud of our city, and I want people to know that clergy are ready to be called upon for whatever is needed. Tell us what you need and where to go, and we will show up.”

Gris.” She immediately translated: “We are here reporting from Shelltown, San Diego.
But the immigrant community in San Diego has felt some version of this fear for a long time, Orozco added.","Three teachers drove through a quiet neighborhood in southern San Diego, the sun not yet fully up over the horizon. They drank coffee and talked about their jobs. The start of the school day was still an hour or two away.

Suddenly, mid-conversation, they spotted something: what appeared to be an undercover Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, driving right past them.

To an untrained eye, the unmarked SUV didn’t look out of place among the dozens of other cars lining the residential street. But the educators saw what many might miss: the completely tinted windows of the unmarked Dodge Durango (a popular choice for law enforcement), the small strip of lights near the front of the car, the steel prisoner partition faintly visible inside (dividing the front seat from the back). Sure enough, the SUV’s driver picked up a handheld radio.

Watching this, high school teacher Marysol Duran clicked her own walkie talkie to life.

“We have identified a potential,” she reported to others in her unit, following closely behind. “He is on 39th and Gamma. We will keep close watch.”

Duran, and other members of her organization, are not just teachers. They’re also members of the Association of Raza Educators, a group of activists that regularly patrols southern California streets to keep an eye out for ICE. When they spot undercover agents, who may be in the area conducting surveillance or actively planning to arrest or detain someone, they alert the surrounding community: via social media, group chats – and sometimes a giant megaphone.

The fall morning they spotted the Dodge Durango, the teachers were patrolling a several-mile radius near half a dozen local schools. That choice of location was intentional. Only two months before, at least four parents were arrested or detained by immigration officials near schools in San Diego county alone. Outside one Chula Vista elementary school, an undocumented mother, who had allegedly overstayed her visa, was arrested during morning drop-offs as her children watched from the car.

ICE’s San Diego field office did not respond to several requests for comment regarding the suspected undercover vehicle or any other San Diego arrests near school sites.

In the US, children have the right to a free public education from kindergarten to 12th grade, regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. Although immigration officers were previously limited in their ability to make arrests in or near “sensitive locations”, like schools and churches, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded those Obama and Biden-era guidelines earlier this year.

So when the three teachers noticed the potential ICE agent in October, they turned their car around and followed. The Dodge parked and the teachers did, too. Juan Orozco, a high school counselor, watched from the driver’s seat. Duran sat next to him, and Aremi Lopez, an elementary school teacher, clutched a megaphone in the backseat.

After a few minutes, the Dodge sped away without warning. The teachers drove after it.

“Buenos días, compañeros,” Duran reported in a series of live social media updates. “Estamos en la comunidad de Shelltown. Estamos aquí reportando, parte de la Association de Raza Educadores y Unión del Barrio, y tenemos movimiento: un Dodge Durango. Gris.”

She immediately translated: “We are here reporting from Shelltown, San Diego. We have identified a Dodge Durango, grey, that has been surveilling our community.”

Fear among students and parents across southern California is at an all-time high, particularly after the supreme court ruled earlier this fall that federal agents can stop and detain residents in Los Angeles simply for speaking Spanish, appearing Latino or working certain types of jobs. Now, there have been instances where students don’t come to school because they, or their parents, are scared to leave the house, Orozco said.

“We live in a state of fear, [whether you’re a] citizen or not a citizen: plumber, professional, mother, grandma, everyone,” he said. “And we shouldn’t live like that.”

But teachers, and a handful of their students, are also quietly and consistently mobilizing in big and small ways: by hosting morning patrols near local schools, organizing know-your-rights seminars, and keeping each other informed about the presence of ICE.

“We said, ‘Hell no, we have to resist,’” Orozco said. “We have to stand for dignity and protect this safe place for us: schools.”

‘They’re coming after all of us’

In the small library of a nearby San Diego high school, 14-year-old Azda* sat across from her sister, 19-year-old Guadalupe*. Behind them, many of the books on the shelves and posters on the wall had activist themes; an illustration of Che Guevara peeked out from the top shelf. In the hallway outside the library, a hand-painted banner read “education not deportation”. The school is located only a few miles from where the suspected undercover ICE vehicle was spotted a week prior.

While Azda just started her freshman year of high school, and Guadalupe her second year of college, the sisters often have more on their minds than other teenagers might.

Because of where they were born, Azda is a citizen, but Guadalupe is undocumented. They’ve always worried that one day ICE may pick up their mother, who is also undocumented.

“I do fear for her,” Guadalupe said of her mother. “But not only just when she’s dropping off her kids at school, it’s every second of the day.”

Growing up, their family had a specific action plan in case of emergency, like other parents in California might prepare for earthquakes or wildfires. But instead, Azda and Guadalupe’s mother prepared them for ICE. If she was deported, their mother told them, they would need to immediately seek help from their aunt, or close friends who lived nearby. Then, to avoid breaking up the family, all of them would need to “flee together” back to Mexico.

Azda and Guadalupe have tried to explain this looming specter of ICE and deportation to their younger siblings, in ways they might be able to understand. When it comes to their little brother, who is four years old, they’ve chosen their words carefully.

“We have to simplify these big concepts to him,” Guadalupe said. “We just say, like, ‘Okay, la migra, they do bad things. They take families – se llevan a las mamás [they take mothers].’”

The language of ICE protests has even worked its way into the four-year-old’s budding vocabulary. He’ll sometimes walk around the house, they said, chanting: “La chota, la migra. ¿La migra, porque dia?” [Or: “Immigration, why are you here?”]

This year, as ICE agents have circled San Diego neighborhoods, businesses and school zones, Azda and Guadalupe have felt perpetually on edge. Everywhere they go, whether to school, or the grocery store, or to hang out with friends, they’ve learned to scan for signs of undercover ICE vehicles: Are those overly tinted windows? Does that SUV have a different kind of license plate?

That sense of unease follows Azda when she goes home, too. As she scrolls through Instagram, reels of dancing and cooking videos bleed into shaky footage of people from around the country being dragged away by ICE. Often, their spouses or children stand off to the side, screaming and crying. But recently, after seeing one of those videos, Azda got angry. She put down her phone and wrote a poem, titled La Migra.

“Todo lo que te digan es una mentira. ¿No saben que esta es nuestra tierra también?” [Or: “Everything they tell you is a lie. Don’t they know this is our land too?”]

Azda’s high school, which is uniquely involved in anti-ICE activism and patrolling, has encouraged her burgeoning sense of advocacy. A majority of the school’s students, if not all, are undocumented themselves or come from mixed-status families, according to staff members there. Azda has attended meetings about how to patrol around her school for ICE, and has walked around her own neighborhood with her aunt to look for “suspicious cars or suspicious people”.

She also recognizes that because she’s a US citizen, unlike her sister and mother, she has an added layer of security when it comes to protesting or being outspoken about immigration issues.

“I don’t feel like I have to do this, I feel like I want to be the one to do it,” Azda said. “Because if I’m not, then who is?”

Guadalupe attends monthly Association of Raza Educators meetings, but thinks her school in particular – San Diego City College – could do more than just hosting a few know-your-rights sessions.

“It’s something that we have to keep actively engaging with. It can’t just be a one-time workshop,” she said. “You can’t just do things by yourself. If something happens to you, you need to have this group of people backing you up.”

As a kid, Guadalupe sometimes felt a gulf between her and her siblings when it came to their differing legal statuses. Now, though, it feels as if they’re all under threat.

“La migra [immigration] and the state are attacking anyone that’s brown. They’re attacking anyone, even US citizens,” she said. “So I don’t feel that division no more. It’s like they’re coming after all of us.”

‘The right to an education’

The three educators on the early-morning ICE patrol agreed: students across different age groups, from high schoolers to younger elementary school students, have had similar responses to the immigration crackdown. Fear, they said, is an equalizing force.

“They’re all stressed, scared,” Orozco remarked from the driver’s seat, before they spotted the undercover ICE vehicle. “They don’t know what this means.”

San Diego has seen far more immigration activity in 2025 than in years past; three times as many people were arrested by ICE in just the first half of this year compared to all of 2024, NBC reported. More than 50% of the 2025 arrests involved people with no criminal convictions.

But the immigrant community in San Diego has felt some version of this fear for a long time, Orozco added. Unión del Barrio, the southern California-based political organization that founded the Association of Raza Educators, first started conducting community patrols to scan for law enforcement more than three decades ago. And the recent supreme court ruling merely formalized the racial profiling that’s been happening behind the scenes for years, he said.

When he was 12 years old, in the early 1980s, Orozco remembers waiting at a bus stop in downtown San Diego. An unmarked white van – with the telltale metal prisoner partition inside – pulled up unexpectedly in front of him. What he believed to be immigration agents got out and threw Orozco in the back.

“And I started kicking and screaming, kicking and screaming,” he said. “Then they pulled off to the side and the two officers said: ‘Say the Pledge of Allegiance.’ I started saying it and they let me go.”

Orozco walked shakily back to the bus. Bystanders were shocked. “It looked like a kidnapping,” he said.

One of the goals of the early-morning teacher patrols is to prevent similar situations from happening – or to at least alert people when they do.

But after the three educators followed the undercover Dodge down a few streets, they eventually lost track of it. At an intersection, Duran and Orozco looked left to right, and examined the parked cars in driveways for signs of recent movement. But the Dodge was gone.

“There’s the relief that although we did lose [the vehicle], we did at least change their plans,” Duran said. “And they might not have had the luck to execute whatever they were expecting to.”

On a policy level, there is some hope on the horizon: in late October, the San Diego city council voted to move forward with an ordinance that, once passed, would require federal law enforcement to obtain a judicial warrant in order to access any non-public area of city-controlled property, which would include the inside of city-run public schools. The ordinance would not apply to the outside of schools, or to surrounding neighborhoods.

Another similar law was passed at the state level in September, although some immigration experts say it may be too soon to tell what kind of impact the new legislation will truly have on ICE operations. The Association of Raza Educators and other groups are also preparing for the eventual fallout from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which allocated billions to be spent hiring as many as 10,000 new immigration officers across the US.

As the teachers ended their morning patrol and headed back to their original meeting point, the neighborhood began to fill with families. Parents walked hand-in-hand with their children to an elementary school nearby.

“You see the beauty of our community,” Duran said, watching the scene unfold from the passenger seat. “Just doing what any other human being would do in the United States: taking their children to school because they have the right to a free education.”

With the patrol over, Duran, Orozco and the other educators and volunteers quickly packed up their gear: their mounted car cameras, their walkie talkies, their megaphones.

It was 7am, and they needed to make their way to their real jobs – the school day was starting soon.

Agents seen near Hoover Elementary

What we know:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were in the area of 31st and Market streets, close to Hoover Elementary School.

The Oakland Unified School District told KTVU, ""We have confirmed ICE activity in the West Oakland community.""

Parents notified

Dig deeper:

Parents received an alert on the ParentSquare platform notifying them of the activity.

""We got confirmation that there is ICE activity in the neighborhood. They are on 31st and Market Street knocking on doors. The kids are safe and secure at school. Please do no come to the school. We will alert you when things are quiet in the neighborhood again,"" the notification read.

Despite the district’s request to stay away, a group of parents and community advocates gathered in the area and were posted at every corner.

Jeff Ernstfriedman, whose daughter is a second-grader at Hoover Elementary, said he went to the school after receiving the alert and was told the campus was on lockdown.

""I personally saw camouflage individuals going door to door. I didn’t see them take anyone out. I did see the community was able to raise enough of an issue for them, and they stopped,"" Ernstfriedman said.

He described the situation as alarming but said he believed students were safe.

""I feel they are safe here. This is the safest place to be if they’re already here. It’s unfortunate that it happens, but it’s scary,"" he said.

Community vows to keep watch

While school officials urged parents not to come to campus until the situation calmed down, advocates said they planned to stay put to monitor for any potential federal activity.

Ernstfriedman said when community members asked agents to leave, one reportedly replied that they were ""there to protect the homeland,"" and then thanked the residents for doing their part, but asked them to let agents do theirs.

Unclear why agents in the area

District officials said the agents did not enter the school but were seen in the surrounding neighborhood.

(WTVD) -- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have shifted their immigration enforcement focus away from Raleigh and stay in Charlotte, according to a source familiar with operations. This comes after sparking fear and protests across the Triangle.

Reports from the Triangle included federal agents apprehending people in Cary and North Raleigh.

Businesses across the Triangle also closed for the day out of caution. Several chose not to open on Wednesday. Some shops along Chatham Street in Cary were shuttered, and others in downtown Raleigh, like El Toro Loco Taqueria, posted online that they were closing for the safety of the Latino community.

Durham Public Schools (DPS) reported low attendance numbers Tuesday among Latino students district wide.

""They are fearful of walking to school and getting detained or questions. Somebody putting a gun in their face,"" Carmon Ramon, a counselor with DPS, said. ""They are fearful of their parents going to work.""

Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said in a statement on Monday that federal agents were expected to continue their operations in her city on Tuesday after they fanned across nearby Charlotte over the weekend.

Cowell, a Democrat, said the federal action was not requested.

""As the capital city, it is important to us that everyone who lives, works, plays, and learns in Raleigh feels safe,"" Cowell said. ""We have been made aware that Customs and Border Protection are coming to Raleigh. While the Raleigh Police Department is not involved in immigration enforcement, we are committed to protecting our residents and to following the law.""

The immigration enforcement surge in the Charlotte area has led to the arrests of over 250 illegal immigrants as of Monday, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told ABC11 in a statement.

Greg Bovino, the commander-at-large of CBP, is blaming North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein for what he said was an increase in violent rhetoric that federal agents are facing in their immigration enforcement blitz in the state.

Bovino took to social media on Tuesday to slam Stein, a Democrat who released a statement over the weekend asking residents of the Tar Heel State to report any ""inappropriate behavior"" they witness from federal agents.

""If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement, who will continue to keep our communities safe after these federal agents leave,"" Stein said.

In a social media post, Bovino told Stein, ""You need to check yourself,"" and cited an online video of a woman threatening to use a screwdriver to stab U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents if they pull her over.

""Governor Stein, you caused this,"" Bovino said in the post. ""Let me say that again, Governor. When you spout lies about a lawful law enforcement operation, you spark something in weaker-minded people like this who may act upon your direction.""

Bovino did not specifically say what statements from Stein prompted his social media response.

On Sunday, Stein issued a statement, saying, ""We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin color, racially profiling, and picking up random people in parking lots and off of our sidewalks.""

Bovino's warning to Stein came after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cited two incidents this week in Charlotte in which people allegedly rammed the vehicles of federal agents or drove directly at the agents.

Federal agents are expected to stay in North Carolina until Friday, according to preliminary information from federal authorities. By the end of the week, about 200 agents are expected to be redeployed to New Orleans to begin ""Operation Catahoula Crunch"" in the Big Easy, according to multiple law enforcement sources.

November 19, 2025

Dear Majority Leader Thune, Minority Leader Schumer, Speaker Johnson, Minority Leader Jeffries, Chair Collins, Vice Chair Murray, Chair Cole, and Ranking Member DeLauro:

On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 240 national organizations to promote and protect the rights of all persons in the United States; our Census Task Force co-chairs, Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC and NALEO Educational Fund; and the 48 undersigned organizations, we write to highlight several essential issues affecting the success of the 2030 Census and availability of useful, accurate Census Bureau data to guide policymaking, as you finalize the Fiscal Year 2026 Commerce, Justice, and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill (as a stand-alone measure or part of an omnibus package):

We urge funding for the Census Bureau at or above the amount requested in the president’s budget and allocated in the House Appropriations Committee CJS mark: $1.6765 billion.

Conferees must exclude section 556 of the House CJS bill. The directive to exclude undocumented immigrants from the congressional apportionment base would violate the U.S. Constitution and dash any chance for an accurate census in all states.

Conferees must also exclude section 605 of the House CJS bill. This provision would limit attempts to collect data from households for the census and surveys to two inquiries. The effect on data quality and accuracy would be catastrophic.

I . Full funding for the Census Bureau is essential to keep robust 2030 Census planning on track.

Sound investments now will help to ensure the future success and cost efficiency of the 2030 Census. An insufficient funding level for the Census Bureau will disrupt census planning at a pivotal point in the decade, undermining a carefully developed research and testing agenda that will significantly increase costs later in the decade and put accuracy at risk. It also would diminish efforts to strengthen other vital Census Bureau surveys that produce data on which public and private sector decisionmakers (including members of Congress) rely every day. For example, the American Community Survey (ACS), the ongoing part of the decennial census, is a trusted source of accurate and regularly updated demographic, socioeconomic, and housing data used by governments, businesses, and the nonprofit sector nationwide. Failure to fund even modest improvements to the ACS will continue to erode data quality, even as Congress itself relies on ACS data to allocate trillions of federal assistance dollars annually to states, localities, and families.

FY 2026 is particularly pivotal in the ramp-up to the 2030 Census, as the Census Bureau prepares to conduct the 2026 Census Test, the only large-scale field test of outreach, methodological, and operational improvements for the next census before the dress rehearsal in 2028. A robust 2026 Census Test is essential to ensuring the accuracy of the 2030 Census and containing overall costs, goals that Congress supports on a bipartisan basis. The window of opportunity to research methods to reach groups at risk of being missed, including renters and young children, as well as increasingly distrustful population groups in rural areas and low-income neighborhoods, on American Indian reservations, and in Black, Hispanic, and other historically undercounted communities, will close soon.

II. The U.S. Constitution requires a count of all persons living in the U.S, for apportionment purposes.

Section 556 of the House Appropriations Committee CJS mark cannot remain in a final FY 2026 bill. Every census since the first enumeration in 1790 has included citizens and non-citizens for the purpose of congressional apportionment. Section 556 would require the Census Bureau to exclude undocumented persons living in the United States from the tabulation of state population used to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives after each census. Throughout the nation’s history, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have concluded that excluding undocumented immigrants or all non-citizens from the apportionment base would be unconstitutional and contrary to the 14th Amendment’s clear command to count the “whole number of persons in each State” for apportionment. While the constitutional infirmity of section 556 cannot be overcome, it is worth noting that asking about immigration status on the census questionnaire — which would be required to meet such a directive — is unnecessary and would raise concerns among all respondents, both native-born and immigrant, about the confidentiality and privacy of information provided to the government. This will have a chilling effect on participation and keep many residents from responding, jeopardizing the accuracy of the census used for many non-apportionment purposes in every state and community. We strongly urge you to remove section 556 from the final FY 2026 CJS appropriations bill.

III. Limiting household contacts in the census and surveys would result in unreliable and unusable data that guides critical decision-making in all sectors.

Section 605 of the House Appropriations Committee CJS mark limits contact with households to two “inquiries,” significantly restricting the Census Bureau’s ability to collect information from households and businesses that do not respond quickly to censuses and other surveys. If enacted, section 605 would fundamentally transform how the Census Bureau conducts virtually every census and associated survey. Particularly alarming, the proposal could shut down counting efforts in the decennial census after only a third of households have responded, based on the 2020 Census experience. Equally alarming, incomplete follow-up for the ACS could deprive towns, rural communities, and tribal areas of any useful data, while Economic Census data that serve as a baseline for Gross Domestic Product and other key economic indicators could be compromised. Valuable socio-economic data for smaller population groups, such as people with disabilities and veterans, also could be curtailed. In short, section 605 would force the Census Bureau to stop contacting households and businesses after two attempts to secure a response in every census and survey, no matter how low the initial response rate. The enactment of section 605 would result in lower response rates for Census Bureau surveys, thereby disrupting the collection of foundational statistics that support our democratic institutions and economy. Without sufficiently high response rates in many areas, the Census Bureau will not be able to publish demographic and economic data of acceptable quality and reliability, threatening informed private sector decision-making and the prudent allocation of federal program funds to every state, county and city, and community in the country.

For these reasons, we strongly urge any final Fiscal Year 2026 CJS package to ensure Census Bureau funding that matches or exceeds the president’s budget request and the House mark of $1.6765 billion and excludes sections 556 and 605 of the House CJS appropriations mark. Thank you for considering our views as Congress moves towards completing the FY 2026 appropriations cycle.

Sincerely,

The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights

Tens of thousands of public school students have been reported absent. And businesses in immigrant communities shuttered as border agents patrolled the streets.

North Carolina has become the latest focus of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, as federal agents surge into Charlotte and spread out across other Democratic-led cities in the notorious swing state, including Durham and Raleigh.

Located hundreds of miles from the southern and northern borders, North Carolina doesn't often generate national attention for immigration related issues, leading residents and local officials to question why the state that voted for Donald Trump in the last three presidential elections is being targeted.

The Department of Homeland Security said it launched “Operation Charlotte’s Web” to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

But Charlotte is not considered a sanctuary city, and the state has some of the strictest immigration provisions in the country, experts said, including a mandate passed last year requiring local jails to hold arrested immigrants for a limited time so they can be picked up by federal authorities.

“No cities in the state have sanctuary policies, if they did they would be violating state law,” said Rick Su, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina who specializes in immigration and local government.

Su also noted that no city in North Carolina was included on the Justice Department’s list of ""sanctuary jurisdictions,"" which the agency defines as areas with “policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Over the weekend, federal agents arrested over 130 undocumented immigrants in Charlotte, including several dozen with previous charges ranging from driving under the influence to aggravated assault, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). USA TODAY is unable to independently verify those figures as the agency has not released the names of those arrested, or their exact charges.

After the weekend raids, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein criticized the operation as inducing “widespread fear” and said it is “not about public safety.”

“They’re driving around Charlotte in unmarked cars wearing paramilitary garb, masks, stopping people on the street randomly based on the color of their skin,” Stein said. “This is not promoting safety in our communities. The people of North Carolina deserve to be safe.”

Charlotte reeling from immigration sweeps as enforcement expands

Federal agents began surging into Charlotte neighborhoods on Saturday, Nov. 15, spurring business closures across immigrant communities as protesters took to the streets to decry the operations.

Homeland Security officials have not said how many agents have been sent to the state or how long the heightened enforcement will last.

The operations are being led by Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol official who coordinated immigration raids in Chicago that triggered lawsuits and fierce backlash over what many described as agents' aggressive enforcement tactics.

Bovino, who, according to a federal judge, admitted to lying about a rock-throwing incident used to justify the deployment tear gas on protesters, is from western North Carolina.

Since the enforcement began in Charlotte, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District said over 30,000 students – about 20% of the student population – were absent on Monday, Nov. 17, according to preliminary data. Officials have not tied the low attendance numbers directly to the immigration enforcement. According to data from the school district, 31% of the student population identifies as Hispanic.

Videos of border agents conducting arrests have drawn scrutiny, including one of masked agents smashing the window of a U.S. citizen and pulling him to the ground. The man, Willy Aceituno, was brought into a Border Patrol vehicle and released after he showed agents documentation proving his citizenship, he told the Associated Press.

“I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I’ve seen,” said Mayor Vi Lyles in a statement on X. She added that her office is working to determine “what more we can do to support our community while working within complicated legal boundaries.”

At a city council meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 18, Raleigh Mayor Janet Cowell said immigration authorities were spotted in Wake and Durham counties. She urged people to call the Raleigh Police Department if they feel unsafe or see something illegal.

In Durham, local officials held a news conference and spoke out against the federal intervention. Nida Allam, the chair of the Durham Board of County Commissioners, said border agents were in the city to stoke fear, not fight crime.

“Durham is over 1,300 miles from the border,” Allam said. “None of this was about securing our borders, none of it was about enforcing the law. It was a show of force meant to scare people.”

Charlotte, a recent flashpoint in the debate around crime in US cities

This is not the first time Charlotte has found itself at the center of national debates around public safety.

In August, the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a public train in Charlotte drew national headlines and the attention of the White House. Trump seized on the incident as an example of rampant violent crime in Democratic-led cities, pointing to the suspect’s lengthy criminal history.

In Charlotte, rates of violent crime have fallen sharply this year, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. The agency said through the first nine months of 2025, Charlotte saw a 20% reduction in violent crimes including as homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

So far this year, Durham and Raleigh have seen rates of violent crime either stay level or dip when compared with 2024, according to their respective police departments.

In its recent statements, the Department of Homeland Security has sought to tie its immigration enforcement in North Carolina to public safety and policies that they say allow criminals to roam the streets.

Research has shown that, on average, immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans. Further, immigration violations, such as living in the country without proper documentation, are civil, not criminal, under U.S. law.

""Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”

In a statement posted to its website, DHS also accused local law enforcement in North Carolina of refusing to comply with almost 1,400 detainer requests by immigration officials to hold arrested suspects for 48 hours.

It is true that for years, Mecklenburg County, which encompasses Charlotte, did not honor such detainers. But that changed last year when the majority-Republican legislature overcame a veto and passed a measure forcing sheriff's offices to hold arrested immigrants temporarily for federal authorities.

Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has publicly feuded with immigration authorities over enforcement but he has maintained that his office is complying with detainer requirements.

In recent months, he said he has sought to improve communication with federal immigration officials. In late October, McFadden called a meeting with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement's regional leaders.

""I made it clear that I do not want to stop ICE from doing their job, but I do want them to do it safely, responsibly, and with proper coordination by notifying our agency ahead of time,"" McFadden said after the meeting, according to local media reports.

Last week, McFadden announced publicly that two federal officials told him Border Patrol agents would soon be arriving in Charlotte. He added, “specific details regarding the federal operation have not been disclosed.”

Brad Schneider, released the following statement in response to the current status of permitting reform negotiations in Congress:

“The members of our respective caucuses hold diverse views of how Congress should improve the energy infrastructure permitting process; however, as leaders of these caucuses, we are unified in our belief that the current actions of the Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans are blocking us from engaging in good-faith, bipartisan permitting reform negotiations.

“Any serious permitting reform package must address—as a threshold matter—the Trump Administration’s active undermining of America’s clean energy industry by using every tool it can find to slow or block projects. The Administration regularly does not follow existing law, including revoking duly issued permits, rescinding previously awarded grants, and issuing stop-work orders on projects well under construction. Over the past 10 months, we have heard outcries over the Administration’s actions from state governments, businesses, and workers responsible for building critical clean energy projects to address growing electricity demand while improving the reliability and affordability of our energy system, but our Republican colleagues in Congress have remained largely silent in the face of the Trump Administration’s abuses.

“Ensuring that clean energy projects are treated fairly and can move forward where appropriate is the prerequisite for serious, practical negotiations on a reform package capable of meeting the nation’s energy needs. Additionally, to be comfortable with any sort of agreement, we need to be able to trust that this Administration is going to follow the law that we write.

The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, argues that USCIS’s August 2025 “voter registration ban” violates both the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment by discriminating against speech promoting voting rights for naturalized citizens.​​

For decades, the League has been a trusted partner at naturalization ceremonies, registering hundreds of thousands of newly sworn-in Americans to vote. In 2024 alone, League volunteers attended 2,789 naturalization ceremonies and helped 122,141 new citizens register—roughly 8 percent of all people naturalized that year.​

But on August 29, 2025, USCIS announced without notice or public comment that only state and local election officials—not nonpartisan civic groups—would be permitted to provide voter registration services at administrative naturalization ceremonies.​​

“Purposely excluding groups like the League from administrative naturalization ceremonies is a deliberate move by this administration to deny new citizens access to the democratic process,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters of the United States.​

The lawsuit names USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as defendants, along with their respective agencies.​

Pattern of Sexual Violence in Immigration Detention

The legal challenge comes amid mounting evidence of systemic sexual abuse of women detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection—abuses that advocacy groups say often go uninvestigated and unpunished.

Between 2010 and 2017, migrant women filed more than 1,224 complaints of sexual assault by ICE officials covering nearly all states with immigration detention facilities. Recent data obtained by investigative journalists reveals 308 sexual assault and abuse complaints filed by immigrants detained in ICE facilities nationwide between 2015 and 2021. More than half of all abuse allegations were directed against staff members.​

In one harrowing 2020 case at an El Paso detention center, guards systematically sexually assaulted detained women in security camera “blind spots,” forcibly kissing them and touching their intimate parts. When one 35-year-old Mexican woman reported the abuse to a captain, he dismissed her. Guards told her “no one would believe her” because the assaults occurred where no footage existed.​

That woman was deported while investigations were ongoing, effectively silencing a key witness.​

At Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, five women accused a male nurse of sexually assaulting them during medical examinations between 2021 and early 2022. The women alleged the nurse exploited his position to force them to expose themselves and inappropriately touched them without medical justification. When two women reported the abuse while still detained, they faced aggressive interrogations, threats of extended imprisonment, and food being withheld.​

A year after their complaint was filed, the nurse remained employed at the facility.​

In Florida’s Glades County Detention Center, seven immigrant women filed a federal lawsuit in 2021 alleging that male guards would watch them shower or enter living areas unannounced for sexual voyeurism. One woman also reported sexual harassment by the facility’s psychiatrist.​

A 2023 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that sexual assault allegations in ICE facilities were stable between 2018 and 2022, though allegations against facility staff significantly increased. The research revealed that sexual assault occurred in ICE detention at a rate up to 3.5 times higher than in the general U.S. population.​

Only 2.4 percent of sexual abuse complaints filed with the DHS Office of Inspector General between 2010 and 2016 were investigated.​

Border Patrol Agents Accused of Abuse

Border Patrol agents have also faced allegations of sexual misconduct and violence against migrant women.

Internal Department of Homeland Security documents obtained by Human Rights Watch in 2021 detailed over 160 reports of misconduct and abuse of asylum seekers by CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, and ICE officials, primarily between 2016 and 2021. The reports included allegations of physical, sexual, and verbal abuse.​

In one instance, an asylum officer reported that a young girl was “forced to undress and touched inappropriately by a guard in the Ice Box wearing green,” referring to a border holding cell. The documents do not indicate how DHS responded to the allegation.​

In August 2024, Border Patrol agent Shane Millan, 53, was arrested and charged with violating women’s constitutional rights after allegedly coercing several women to reveal their chests during virtual processing for entry into the United States. Prosecutors said Millan instructed women on at least three occasions to remove their clothing and display their bare chests via webcam, claiming it was standard procedure when it was actually “driven by his own personal gratification”.​

And in February 2025, former CBP officer Aaron Thomas Mitchell was convicted of kidnapping and civil rights offenses after abducting and sexually assaulting a teenage girl while identifying himself as law enforcement.​

A report analyzing Border Patrol complaint outcomes found that most allegations of sexual misconduct resulted in “no action taken,” including cases where agents allegedly solicited sexual favors in exchange for entrance to the U.S. or made minors remove their clothing.​

“They Treat You Like You Are Worthless”

The American Civil Liberties Union has documented nearly 200 allegations of sexual abuse from immigration detainees since 2007 alone. Yet the Department of Justice explicitly excluded immigration detention facilities from coverage under the Prison Rape Elimination Act in proposed regulations.​

“Without PREA’s protection, immigrants in detention remain vulnerable to abuse,” the ACLU warned.​

The National Prison Rape Elimination Commission found that immigrant women in detention are especially vulnerable to sexual abuse. Despite this, in April 2025, the Department of Justice terminated all funding for the National Prison Rape Elimination Act Resource Center, which trained auditors and provided resources to sexual assault victims. The funding was restored only after a preliminary injunction in litigation.​

Whistleblowers revealed that the closure of DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties resulted in the abandonment of at least 25 sexual abuse complaints.​

Human Rights Watch researcher Clara Long described the conduct reported in internal government documents as “jaw-dropping,” adding: “These internal government documents make clear that reports of grievous abuses—assaults, sexual abuse, and discriminatory treatment by US agents—are an open secret within DHS”.​

League Calls Ban Unconstitutional

The League’s lawsuit argues that USCIS issued the voter registration ban without following the Administrative Procedure Act’s required notice-and-comment process and without providing any reasoned justification. The ban also violates the First Amendment by restricting core political speech and discriminating based on viewpoint, content, and speaker identity, the complaint alleges.​

“The ban discriminates—based on viewpoint, content, and the identity of the speaker—against speech promoting the right to vote for new citizens, and tramples on the League’s freedom of association,” the lawsuit states.​​

USCIS claimed the change was necessary to ensure “nonpartisanship” and reduce administrative burdens, but the complaint notes that state and local election officials in numerous states are themselves partisan actors elected on a partisan basis. The ban also identifies no existing problems with the nonpartisanship of groups like the League.​

Since the ban took effect, state and local League chapters have been forced to cancel at least 166 planned voter registration events where volunteers expected to register approximately 10,000 new voters.​​

The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the ban unconstitutional, set it aside as unlawful, and enjoin DHS and USCIS from enforcing it.​

The League is represented by Campaign Legal Center, which has previously litigated to protect nonpartisan voter registration work in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Missouri and Montana.​","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!z-NW!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6b66552-35b1-465a-a5a3-6ea5efaeee15_300x168.jpeg",N,,2025-11-19 13:58:21.967084

The Immigration Defense Network (IDN) gathered at Bro-Tex Inc., a paper and textile company located at 830 Hampden Ave., at 9 a.m. The organization is asking authorities for clarity on Tuesday morning's raid, which ICE says involved conducting a search warrant connected to an ongoing criminal investigation. IDN wants to know how many people were detained in the Tuesday morning raid, and what type of property was confiscated.

Among the speakers at the gathering was Mayor-elect Kaohly Her, who said she was not speaking from a political platform but as someone who has lived the immigrant experience.

""I want you all to know I am standing with you, not as somebody who is in government but as somebody who is in an impacted community who has watched people from my own community who are American citizens get detained by ICE for days until they can prove that they were American citizens,"" Her told the gathered crowd of more than 200.

""When that happens to our community it is not just that they were detained and released, that they lose jobs from not being able to go to them, that their families that relied on them cannot, the children that need their parents to be there to give them transportation to school do not have them, that there are huge ripple effects when our families are targeted in this way,"" Her said.

Marco Hernandez, outreach coordinator for the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, spoke of tactics used by federal agents and the Trump administration to strip away the civil rights of those seeking status.

""The conduct we've seen around the country is disturbing. Masked ICE agents have been tearing families apart and terrorizing communities,"" Hernandez stated. ""Here in Minnesota, more than 200 people have been detained outside the immigration court at Fort Snelling this year. People making use of one of their very few legal pathways that people have to acquire status, only to be arrested by ICE when their cases are prematurely canceled and they walk out of the courtroom.""

Armed agents wearing vests from ICE and the FBI descended on the building that houses Bro-Tex LLC early Tuesday, and were seen moving in and out of the building. Witnesses said they saw people being detained.

While ICE would not comment on people being taken into custody, a man who identified himself as Jesus Trejo told a KARE 11 photojournalist that his father, Isaias Villagrana Flores, and uncle were taken into custody after agents entered the business.

""They took my dad, he comes to work, he supports his family. A good guy, no criminal,"" Trejo said, fighting to hold back tears. Trejo said his dad called his mother and said agents ""stormed"" the building.

""They'll see the outcome of what they've done, what they've taken away,"" Trejo said. He said his father has worked at Bro-Tex for years.

It did not take long for messages to get out via text and social media platforms, and a crowd of hundreds swarmed the scene, blowing whistles and screaming at the federal agents. Some activists challenged a line set up by agents, which led to some nose-to-nose confrontations, pushing and shoving. Eventually, one agent pulled a can of pepper spray and doused multiple protestors in the face.

The operation was one of several by ICE in recent months that have community organizers concerned. A raid at a Minneapolis restaurant in June led to similar hostilities between activists and agents. In October, a Latino roofer was pulled off a job site by ICE, and one month later in Northfield, a man was taken from a vehicle.

A New York federal judge struck down a Justice Department lawsuit this week that sought to end a law that prevents immigration officials from arresting individuals in New York State courthouses.

U.S. District Judge Mae D'Agostino dismissed the lawsuit from the Trump administration lawsuit that argued the 2020 Protect Our Courts Act and two state executive orders that limit state employees' cooperation with the federal government were unconstitutional. The decision marks a major setback for the president’s efforts to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in the city and state.

The 41-page ruling released on late Monday evening flatly rejected the Trump administration’s arguments that POCA and the executive orders were unconstitutional and went against the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, referred to as INA.

Core to the Justice Department’s argument was that federal law supersedes any conflicting state law, and state officials were required to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

But D'Agostino, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, saw otherwise and ruled that the state’s sovereignty in these matters is protected by the 10th Amendment.

“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the decision reads. “The Executive Orders and POCA reflect Defendants' decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law – a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment and not preempted by the INA.”

The decision for now puts to rest the question of whether federal immigration authorities will appear in New York’s state and local courts. D'Agostino’s ruling will have no effect on ICE operations at 26 Federal Plaza, which is under federal jurisdiction.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who was listed as a defendant iin the lawsuit, celebrated the decision.

“Everyone deserves to seek justice without fear,” James said in a statement. “This ruling ensures that anyone can use New York’s state courts without being targeted by federal authorities.”

The decision was also applauded by numerous legal aid organizations, including the Legal Aid Society, The Bronx Defenders, Brooklyn Defender Service and the New York Civil Liberties Union.

“Today’s decision confirms what we’ve said for months: courthouses are no place for ICE agents to arrest people,” Amy Belsher, director of Immigrants’ Rights Litigation at the NYCLU, told the Eagle in a statement. “This is a significant victory, but the work doesn't end here: the NYCLU is fighting in the courts to ensure ICE is also prohibited from conducting arrests in immigration courts.”

Other advocacy groups, like the New York Immigration Coalition, said Monday’s ruling was a significant win but called for lawmakers to continue advocating for further legislation prohibiting local law enforcement from working with federal immigration agents.

“When ICE arrests people who show up for their court cases, it disincentivizes people from following the legal processes set forth in our country,” Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, said. “Judge D'Agostino’s ruling is an important step towards maintaining the integrity of local and state courts in New York.”

“New York must further its commitment to the safety of all New Yorkers by passing the New York For All Act, and the federal government must stop its unlawful detentions of New Yorkers at federal immigration courts throughout the state,” Awawdeh added.

New York State does not have a specific immigrant sanctuary law, but does have laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials.

POCA was signed into law by former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in December 2020. The law prohibits arrests in and around New York State courthouses without a judicial warrant, with a specific intent towards migrants. The law does not pertain to federal courts or immigration courts.

The two Executive Orders named in the suit, 170 and 170.1, were also signed by Cuomo in 2017 and 2018 respectively. They restrict warrantless civil arrests in New York State buildings and limit state employee cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The Justice Department filed the 17-page lawsuit against the state, the attorney general and Governor Kathy Hochul in June 2025.

""Governor Hochul has been clear: You don't make New York State safer by targeting families, children and hardworking individuals,” a spokesperson for the governor told the Eagle in a statement. “The court made the right decision in upholding New York’s sovereignty, and the state will continue to work with federal and local law enforcement in cracking down on violent offenders while keeping our communities safe and enforcing our laws.""

Legal advocates and immigration attorneys have said ICE arrests during immigration hearings have had a chilling effect on immigrants seeking to obtain citizenship through the proper channels. Preventing federal agents from making arrests in state and local courthouses, advocates argue, will likewise prevent that same chilling effect for local criminal and civil cases.

“As public defenders, we are bolstered by the Court’s dismissal of the federal government’s lawsuit challenging New York’s Protect Our Courts Act,” Lucas Marquez, director of Civil Rights and Law Reform at Brooklyn Defender Services, said in a statement. “POCA ensures that New Yorkers who attend court to address critical issues in their lives can do so safely without interference from federal immigration agents, and codifies the long-standing privilege against civil arrests in courthouses.”

The Office of Court Administration did not respond to the Eagle’s request for a comment.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b9ffe0f1137a680c2c08250/5ba02661cd8366eb6ec50772/691e08b6d6504d1ed8887b73/1763576112086/POCA+Lawsuit1.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-11-19 13:58:42.209175

On the same day, Irgi was arrested by the Philadelphia Police Department and charged with strangulation, simple assault and recklessly endangering.

While conducting a targeted operation in Tonawanda Nov. 5, ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations officers observed a target driving a vehicle away from a residence. The officers followed and activated their emergency lights when it was safe to do so. During a consensual encounter, ICE officers confirmed the driver was Saim Irgi, an illegal alien from Turkey without authorization to be in the U.S. Officers asked Irgi to exit the vehicle multiple times, but he consistently refused and actively resisted when officers attempted to remove him. Officers were eventually able to remove the alien from the vehicle and escort him to the ground where he continued to resist the officers. Officers drew their tasers and informed Irgi multiple times that if he did not stop resisting, he would be tased. While attempting to place Irgi in custody, he grabbed onto an officer's taser while screaming “Allahu Akbar,” at which point another officer deployed their taser to gain control of Irgi. The illegal alien was subsequently placed in restraints, taken into custody, and transported to Buffalo Federal Detention Facility for processing and detention. Upon arrival at the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility, Irgi was evaluated by the medical staff and deemed medically fit for detention.

If the judge later rules that Bojerski’s current deportation order is no longer valid — as his attorney argues — the department will issue a new one and seek deportation to a third country, she said.

Sanford grandfather, born in refugee camp, nabbed by ICE after 70 years in U.S.","A 79-year-old retired Sanford optician who faces deportation for his criminal past after living in the United States since he was five will remain in federal custody while an immigration judge decides whether she can rule on his request to be released on bond.

“There is a legal issue in your case that is a little complicated that I am going to have to think about, so I won’t be making a decision on your bond today,” Judge Romy Lerner told Paul John Bojerski at a bond hearing Tuesday at the Krome Detention Center in Miami.

“Unfortunately, no matter what I decide, the government may appeal my decision, which may involve you remaining in detention even if I were to grant the bond,” she added.

A lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security at the hearing confirmed that she would appeal a decision made in Bojerski’s favor. If the judge grants bond, the government will appeal. If the judge later rules that Bojerski’s current deportation order is no longer valid — as his attorney argues — the department will issue a new one and seek deportation to a third country, she said.

Gayle Bojerski, 82, said she talked to her husband after the hearing. “He sounded good. and he can handle it,” she said. “That’s all we can do.”

Bojerski, born to Polish parents in a displacement camp in war-torn Germany in 1946, came to the U.S. with his family in 1952 where they were granted lawful permanent residency.

He was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Oct. 30 and sent to Alligator Alcatraz, based on a deportation order issued over 50 years ago that U.S. immigration authorities failed to act on. The order was issued after Bojerski’s conviction for larceny and accepting stolen goods in the 1960s. Several years after the deportation order, he was convicted of rape, in 1972.

The US revoked his permanent residency status but couldn’t execute the deportation order because the countries where he and his parents were born — Germany and Poland — refused to accept him. Immigration authorities allowed him to stay in the U.S. on a supervisory order that requires him to check in with officials whenever asked.

His lawyer, David Stoller of Orlando, argued that the deportation order is no longer valid because in 1988 Bojerski and his wife, Gayle, went to Canada for their honeymoon and reentered the US successfully — essentially fulfilling the obligations of the order. They were not questioned or held by immigration officials at that time.

DHS officials argued that Bojerski had no proof that he re-entered the country legally, and therefore was here illegally.

Sanford grandfather, born in refugee camp, nabbed by ICE after 70 years in U.S.

But Stoller argued that the burden is on the government to prove that Bojerski attempted or succeeded to enter the country without inspection by immigration officials.

“The government just can’t say ‘you’re here, we’ll agree that you left and came back, you don’t have proof you reentered legally so we’ll just assume that you didn’t’.” Stoller said. “And to the extent that the assumption would be made, we have affidavits explaining exactly how he came back to the states … lawfully.”

Stoller said Bojerski posed no danger to the community because the “last time this gentleman had any trouble I was two years old.”

Despite his criminal history, Lerner questioned the need to detain an elderly man. “At this age, stage and health situation. I have concerns about that,” the judge said.

Bojerski has severe back problems and vascular stenosis and requires pain medications and blood thinners, which his family said he has not received regularly since he was sent to Alligator Alcatraz on Oct. 30. At Krome, he fell out of his wheelchair, Stoller said.

Bojerski is not a flight risk, Stoller added, noting that when ICE dug up his file in 2008, it was able to reach him at the phone number and address in his file.

“They asked him to come in, which he did, and he has done every single time in the subsequent 16-17 years.” Stoller said. “He knew that the possibility existed on Oct. 30 that he might be detained and he went there knowing what he was facing and knowing he had an obligation to show up when and as required and he will continue to do so.”

Bojerski tried to gain permanent residency as a spouse of a U.S.-born citizen in 2009, but the application was denied. He has never applied for citizenship, Stoller said.

The DHS lawyer said his rape conviction from 1972 made him a danger to the community but agreed he was not a flight risk.

The rape charge stemmed from an incident at a fraternity party, where several other students sexually abused a young woman, his wife said. Bojerski said he didn’t participate but was arrested along with the others, who took plea deals. He didn’t take a plea deal because he believed he did nothing wrong, she said.",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TOS-L-Bojerski-bond-hearing-01-e1763495120770.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-19 14:57:21.755834

""The City of Hillsboro calls on all elected officials, including members of Congress from Oregon, to publicly denounce these unconstitutional actions, demand immediate oversight and transparency from immigration enforcement agencies, and work to ensure the rights of all individuals—regardless of immigration status—are fully protected under the Constitution,"" the resolution reads in part.

The declaration comes after the arrest of Victor Cruz, a local grandfather who family says has work authorization and is present legally, last month.

Cruz was arrested in what family said was a case of mistaken identity and was released from custody earlier in November.

City Hall was packed during the last council meeting by people who came to share comments on the negative impact that ICE has had on their community.

""We, like you, do not want ICE to be operating in the city of Hillsboro,"" Mayor Beach Pace said during Tuesday night's meeting. ""We are in this together and we felt it important to publicly publicly acknowledge the challenging time we're in via the resolution we're about to consider[...]""

In early November, Washington County Board of Commissioners declared a state of emergency after seeing a rise in ICE activity in their communities. As part of the declaration, the county pulled $200,000 from its reserves to support immigration-related services. The funds go toward organizations that assist families in connecting with detained family members, as well as, be used to help document detainments, and ensure due process is followed.

(AP) — A federal judge in Florida is pushing for a resolution in a lawsuit over whether detainees at an immigration center in the Florida Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz” are getting adequate access to attorneys.

U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell last Friday ordered a two-day conference to be held next month in her Fort Myers courtroom, with attorneys present who have the authority to settle. The judge asked for an update at a hearing next Monday.

“The court will not entertain excuses regarding leaving early for flights or other meetings,” the judge wrote about next month's conference.

The lawsuit filed by detainees against the federal and state governments over legal access is one of three federal cases challenging practices at the immigration detention center that was built this summer at a remote airstrip in the Florida Everglades by the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

In a separate environmental lawsuit, a federal appellate court panel in September allowed the center to continue operating by putting on hold a lower court’s preliminary injunction ordering the facility to wind down by the end of October. The appeal was put on hold during the government shutdown but resumed last week.

A third lawsuit claims immigration is a federal issue and Florida agencies and private contractors hired by the state have no authority to operate the facility.

President Donald Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. While the facility was built and operated by the state and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing Florida for $608 million.

In the legal access case, attorneys representing detainees at the Everglades facility are seeking a preliminary injunction that will make it easier for their clients to meet and communicate with their individual attorneys.

They claim that detainees' attorneys must make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other detention facilities where the lawyers can just show up during visiting hours; that detainees often are transferred to other facilities after their attorneys have made an appointment to see them; and that scheduling delays have been so lengthy that detainees are unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.

Florida officials said in a motion to dismiss that the case is now moot since the concerns initially raised by the detainees and their attorneys have been addressed. Any delays were due to trying to construct a facility for thousands of detainees in a remote area with little infrastructure, they said.

“In other words, there is no longer a live controversy,” Florida officials said in their court filing.

As the Trump administration spearheaded a surge in what many human rights advocates describe as unlawful and discriminatory raids, detentions and deportations, more immigrant families report avoiding activities outside their homes, such as taking children to school, going to work, or receiving health care, compared to two years ago.

“Immigrants’ avoidance of activities outside the home are likely driven in part by heightened immigration enforcement activities,” wrote the report’s authors, “as well as policy changes that have allowed immigration enforcement activity in previously protected areas, including places of worship, schools, and health care facilities and to allow ICE to pursue arrests without a warrant.”

Four in 10 immigrants, including 7 in 10 undocumented immigrants, said they personally worry they or a family member could be detained or deported, compared to about 2 in 10 in 2023. About 4 in 10 immigrants also said they were worried about their immigration status being revoked and being separated from children or family members.

These fears extended to children in immigrant families, with about a quarter of immigrant parents saying their children have expressed worries or concerns about something bad happening to someone in their family because they are an immigrant. The share rose to 6 in 10 among likely undocumented immigrant parents and to about 4 in 10 among Hispanic immigrant parents.

“My family, friends, and colleagues are worried, stressed, and scared every single time we step out of our homes as we don’t want to be the next family to be deported,” said a 40-year-old Nicaraguan immigrant woman in Illinois who was quoted in the survey.

More immigrant families are also struggling financially since Donald Trump took office. About half of immigrants say they have had problems paying for essentials like housing, food and health care, as well as earning a living, in the past year — up from 3 in 10 who said the same in 2023.

Texas’ map that adds five Republican pickup opportunities is now blocked unless the Supreme Court intervenes.

Judges will convene Wednesday to consider blocking North Carolina’s new map that could give Republicans another seat. And a similar hearing is two weeks away in California, where voters passed a new map that adds as many as five pickup opportunities for Democrats.

In each state, lawmakers contend they redrew the maps for partisan advantage. Federal courts have no authority to strike down partisan gerrymanders.

But the challengers insist the changes were really about race.

In Texas, a 2-1 ruling Tuesday that the state’s new map is a likely racial gerrymander moves the ball to the Supreme Court.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) vowed to “swiftly appeal” to the justices.

“The Legislature redrew our congressional maps to better reflect Texans’ conservative voting preferences – and for no other reason. Any claim that these maps are discriminatory is absurd and unsupported by the testimony offered during ten days of hearing,” Abbott said in a statement.

Texas’s candidate filing deadline is fast approaching on Dec. 8, less than three weeks away. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) confirmed the state will bring an emergency appeal asking the high court to immediately revive the map.

The justices’ consideration will come as they work behind the scenes on drafting their decision on Louisiana’s congressional map, a long-running battle that predates the recent redistricting blitz.

Louisiana’s case raises far-reaching questions about the future of race in redistricting that could impact the new challenges.

As Texas heads to the Supreme Court, the battle over North Carolina’s newly minted congressional map is headed into the spotlight. A hearing will unfold in Winston-Salem, N.C., Wednesday afternoon.

Passed last month, the map redraws the state’s First Congressional District, currently represented by North Carolina Democratic Rep. Don Davis, to be more conservative.

The district has elected a Black representative for more than 30 years, and the case focuses on how the new design decreases the Black voting-age population by 8 percentage points. The map is challenged by two groups.

The first comprises Black and Latino voters represented by Elias Law Group, a powerful Democratic election law firm led by Marc Elias. They argue North Carolina unconstitutionally used race and failed to account for population deviations since the five-year-old census data.

“The racial effects of the 2025 redraw cannot be explained by partisanship,” they wrote in court filings.

The second group comprises voters, the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and watchdog Common Cause. They argue the map violates the First Amendment because it frustrated the groups’ right to petition and was passed as retaliation for the groups’ existing challenge to North Carolina’s previous map.

“Redistricting does not occur in a First Amendment-free zone,” they wrote in court filings.

The hearing is before a three-judge panel all appointed by Republican presidents: U.S. Circuit Judge Allison Rushing and U.S. District Judge Richard Myers, both Trump appointees, and U.S District Judge Thomas Schroeder, an appointee of the second former President Bush.

As Democratic lawyers attempt to strike down North Carolina’s map for unconstitutionally diluting Black voting power, Republican lawyers will attempt to strike down California’s map for unconstitutionally boosting Hispanic voting power.

The Trump administration and the state GOP will attempt to topple the map championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that could provide Democrats with as many as five additional House seats.

“They’re trying to create seats based on race,” Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News’s Sean Hannity last week. “And they can’t do it, and we’re going to hold them accountable just like any other state.”

The panel overseeing the California case comprises U.S. Circuit Judge Kenneth Lee, a Trump appointee, U.S. District Judge Wesley Hsu, an appointee of former President Biden, and U.S. District Judge Josephine Staton, an appointee of former President Obama.

And just remember: We’re only about four years away from the next census, when the whole process will start anew.

IN FOCUS

Reagan judges emerge as Trump’s fiercest judicial critics

An unexpected class of jurists have emerged as the fiercest critics of President Trump’s assault on the legal system: appointees of former President Reagan.

Often the seniormost judges on their courts, Reagan judges have wielded their experience as a weapon in impassioned opinions striking down the president’s policies and in once rare public remarks.

One such jurist, U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf, resigned from his senior position on the federal bench in Massachusetts earlier this month to dedicate his time to fighting back against the president.

He wrote in The Atlantic that his public service began in 1974, a “time of dishonor” for the Justice Department at the end of President Nixon’s term. But what Nixon once did “episodically and covertly,” Trump now does “routinely and overtly,” the former judge said.

“My reason is simple: I no longer can bear to be restrained by what judges can say publicly or do outside the courtroom,” Wolf wrote, calling Trump’s conduct “contrary to everything that I have stood for” in his time as a prosecutor and judge.

“The White House’s assault on the rule of law is so deeply disturbing to me that I feel compelled to speak out,” he added. “Silence, for me, is now intolerable.”

He’s not the only fed-up Reagan-appointed judge.

U.S. District Judge William Young made headlines in September with his blistering rebuke of Trump’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activists, the effect of which is to “unconstitutionally chill freedom of speech.”

The judge quoted a portion of Reagan’s Inauguration speech in the ruling that says, “freedom is a fragile thing and it’s never more than one generation away from extinction.” He contended that Trump understands the importance of the message but draws from it a “darker, more cynical” meaning.

“I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,” Young wrote. “Is he correct?”

Similarly, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour wrote in a decision striking down Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order that, to Trump, “the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals.”

Coughenour took a rare step in July to speak out publicly alongside another judge overseeing Trump cases against threats they’ve faced as a result.

“It’s just been stunning to me how much damage has been done to the reputation of our judiciary because some political actors think that they can gain some advantage by attacking the independence of the judiciary and threatening the rule of law,” the judge said.

Their outspokenness has drawn some criticism.

Mike Davis, a Trump ally and head of the conservative Article III Project, wrote in a Fox News op-ed that Wolf, the judge who stepped down to speak out against Trump, is a “wolf in wolf’s clothing” — a callback to the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s famous dissent in a case about the separation of powers.

Davis claimed that Wolf is “no judicial conservative,” pointing to the Senate blue slips practice that lets home-state senators weigh in on a president’s nominations to district courts and U.S. attorneys’ offices. Both senators from Massachusetts at the time Wolf was appointed to the bench were Democrats, he said.

Rob Luther, a law professor at George Mason University, wrote in posts to X about Wolf that any federal judge who gives up “actual power” to join Trump’s crowd of critics “severely misunderstands power.” He joked that Wolf’s status as a retired Reagan-appointee with the backing of those Democratic senators is “likely at peak market value.”

“I hope more federal judges follow now-retired Judge Mark Wolf’s lead and take their anti-Trump activism off the bench so that (Trump) can replace them,” he said in another post.

“Step right up, please!”

A mystery in the Supreme Court’s passive voice

Did Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson continue her independent streak in the Supreme Court’s recent handling of the food stamp lapse during the government shutdown?

When the full court extended a pause on an order requiring the Trump administration to pay full Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits during the government shutdown, Jackson publicly dissented.

That in itself made the junior liberal justice’s disagreement clear. But a language change elsewhere in the court’s order suggests the division may have gone deeper. We’ll add an underline to the important part:

“The application for stay presented to Justice Jackson is referred to the Court.”

It’s subtle, but that passive voice is highly unusual. It may give away the inner workings of the court’s deliberations.

To explain why, let’s walk through the emergency appeal process:

When someone files one at the Supreme Court (formally called an “application”), by default, it goes to the justice assigned to the area of the country where the case originated.

The divisions align with the boundaries of the federal circuit courts, so they are known as the “circuit justice.” Chief Justice John Roberts handles three circuits, Justices Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh have two and the others each have one.

Read the full assignments here.

The circuit justice can act on an emergency appeal alone, and they often do for ministerial and low-profile ones. If they deny it, the applicant can then try another justice, and another one, until they fail with all nine. (In practice, the full court will vote to cut off anyone who tries to start going down the line.)

Or, the circuit justice can refer the appeal to the full court. That’s the general practice for any filed by the sitting presidential administration.

When the Trump administration filed its SNAP emergency appeal, the case came from Rhode Island. Jackson was the circuit justice.

At first, Jackson acted alone. She paused the order for a few days so a mid-level appeals panel could weigh in.

Just before Jackson’s pause was set to expire, a funding deal in Congress appeared in

sight. This time, the full court took a vote. It extended the SNAP pause a few more days — and over Jackson’s dissent.

That’s the order that included passive voice indicating the application “is referred to the Court.”

We checked, and in every other application brought by the second Trump administration, the order has read “by her referred to the court” (or “by him” when the circuit justice is male).

The dynamic did appear in one other recent high-profile case, though it wasn’t brought by the administration.

When the American Civil Liberties Union sought to block a round of imminent deportations under Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act this spring, the case arose from Texas and went to Alito. The full court voted to temporarily block the deportations over Alito’s dissent.

“There is before the Court an application,” the order began.

Jackson’s shift suggests the possibility that she wanted to act alone and did not agree to send it to the full court for a vote, only for her colleagues to overrule her.

Was it a meaningless edit, or does it reveal the internal deliberations? Neither the majority nor Jackson explained their reasoning.

‘Fake elector’ cases get new life

A few weeks ago, the 2020 election subversion cases were on their last legs.

We wrote in October that the state cases against Trump’s allies and the so-called “fake electors” had faced sharp blows, leaving prosecutors with big decisions about how — and whether — to proceed.

Well, now, we’ve got some answers.

By Friday, Georgia’s Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council (PAC) had to pick a new prosecutor to oversee the state’s case against Trump, his allies and the alternate electors or see it potentially dismissed, thanks to the disqualification of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D).

Pete Skandalakis, PAC’s executive director, announced that he himself would take on the prosecution after the search was fruitless.

“Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment,” he said in a statement.

So, the prosecution’s future is in Skandalakis’s hands, from picking up where Willis left off to dismissing the charges altogether.

It’s not the first time that’s been the case.

After Willis was disqualified from charging Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones (R) for headlining a fundraiser for his political rival, Skandalakis similarly appointed himself. He ultimately declined to bring charges.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee set a hearing for Dec. 1 to discuss next steps in the case, including whether Skandalakis intends to pursue a superseding indictment on the state’s behalf.

A day prior, Nevada’s top court revived the state’s criminal case against its six “fake electors” after a venue fight put the prosecution in purgatory for more than a year.

The original case was filed by Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford (D) in Clark County, a Democratic-leaning division that includes Las Vegas. However, a state judge dismissed it last year after finding that the charges should have been brought in Carson City, where the sham Electoral College votes were cast.

The Nevada Supreme Court reversed that decision and sided with Ford, ruling that Clark County is the proper venue because the fake electors’ alleged offenses were complete when the federal court there received the certificates, not when they were mailed.

A status conference is set for Dec. 10 before the state judge to discuss the top court’s order.

And soon, more pivotal decisions will be made.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) faces a Friday deadline to appeal to the state’s top court a ruling ordering her office to return its case against the state’s pro-Trump electors to a grand jury or see it dismissed, after a mid-level appeals court declined to weigh in.

Local outlets took comments Mayes made earlier this month, which referred to the case in past tense, to suggest she’s leaning toward letting the prosecution fizzle out.

“I certainly don’t want to give it up,” the Arizona attorney general told 12 News when reminded how she once fiercely defended the case. “It is certainly not something that I want to do.”

However, Mayes told a local radio station she would “caution folks against reading into my comments.”

Asked about her remarks and planned next steps, her office declined to comment.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

IN: Asylum ‘metering’

The high court took up one new case at its recent conference, Noem v. Al Otro Lado. We previewed in last week’s edition.

The justices will decide the legality of a now-rescinded immigration policy called “metering.”

From 2016 to 2021 (started under Obama, used during Trump 1.0, rescinded by Biden), immigration officials managed an influx of migrants by turning people away without considering their asylum claims.

But federal law guarantees that a migrant who “arrives in the United States” may apply for asylum and must be inspected.

So, how did the policy work? Immigration officials turned the noncitizens away while they were still on the Mexican side of the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Justice Department argues an individual doesn’t “arrive” in the United States until actually crossing the border. It appealed to the justices after a legal challenge succeeded in a lower court.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer acknowledged the Supreme Court’s decision won’t have an immediate impact, but he cited a likelihood “metering” could return as an immigration policy in the future.

OUT: New Orleans prison

As the Supreme Court term kicked off, we previewed Hutson v. United States, an appeal of a court order requiring Louisiana and New Orleans to construct an 89-bed prison facility to improve inadequate housing for inmates with mental health needs.

In nearly two months since, the court kept punting whether it would take the case. On Monday, the suspense ended.

Only three justices voted to hear the New Orleans sheriff’s appeal, one short of what’s required.

Those three votes came from the court’s conservative wing: Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch.

Alito called the court-ordered construction “illegal from the beginning.” Additionally, Alito wrote the lower court got “the inquiry backwards” when Louisiana years later sought to dissolve the order under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a 1995 law that curbs prisoner lawsuits.

“This case cried out for our review. By failing to intervene, we leave New Orleans to pay for the Fifth Circuit’s serious errors,” wrote Alito, joined by Thomas.

Gorsuch didn’t join the dissent and did not publicly explain his reasoning.

MAYBE: Water rights

The Supreme Court wants the Trump administration’s views on whether to take up Nebraska v. Colorado, a battle between the two states over water rights.

Nebraska officials accuse Colorado of unlawfully threatening Nebraska’s water supply along the South Platte River.

The Constitution and federal law give the Supreme Court “original jurisdiction” (meaning the power to decide a case first) over lawsuits between states.

These days, the high court maintains a policy that it has discretion to take up those cases. The Trump administration’s opinion on what to do is likely to carry serious weight in most justices’ consideration.

That is, except for two. Thomas and Alito believe the court is required to take up lawsuits between two states (see examples from 2025, 2021, 2020 and 2016). So regardless of how they feel about the water dispute, expect them to dissent again if their colleagues refuse the case.

PETITION PILE

Petitions to take up cases that the justices are keeping a close eye on.

The Supreme Court will consider roughly 180 petitions to take up cases at this week’s conference, the final one before Thanksgiving.

Let’s start with several petitions the court weighed last week that are “relisted” again this week. It is a potential signal the court will take up the case, or a justice is drafting a dissent and needs more time to finish it:

Eminent domain: In Hoffmann v. WBI Energy Transmission, a group of North Dakota ranch owners are seeking to collect nearly $400,000 in attorneys’ fees incurred during their legal fight with a natural gas company. The company used its eminent domain authority to take some of the ranch owners’ land for a pipeline. Everyone agrees the owners are entitled to compensation, but a lower court ruled that does not include legal fees.

Aquatherapy: In Doe v. Dynamic Physical Therapy, an anonymous man is seeking to revive his damages lawsuit against a Louisiana provider that during the pandemic allegedly refused his request for aquatic physical therapy because he is HIV positive. Under Louisiana law, claims against providers during a health emergency must clear a higher legal bar, so lower courts dismissed the man’s lawsuit. He says it improperly overrode his claims under federal disability laws.

Title IX: Crowther v. Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia raises whether school employees can sue under Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education. MaChelle Joseph, a longtime Georgia Tech women’s basketball head coach fired over emotional abuse accusations, and a fired Augusta University professor are seeking to revive their sex-discrimination lawsuits under Title IX. But a lower court ruled they instead must bring claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which more generally protects against employment discrimination.

Some notable first-time listings:

Trump’s bid to uphold his birthright citizenship restrictions, Cameroonian journalist Simon Ateba’s challenge to the Biden administration revoking his White House hard pass, Alliance Defending Freedom’s challenge to a school district’s policy that doesn’t inform parents’ when their child uses different pronouns at school, Alabama’s defense of its congressional map and whether private parties can enforce a key Voting Rights Act provision.

ON THE DOCKET

Don’t be surprised if additional hearings are scheduled throughout the week. But here’s what we’re watching for now:

Today:

Former FBI Director James Comey’s motion to dismiss his charges for selective and vindictive prosecution is set to be argued before a federal judge in Alexandria, Va.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., is set to consider relief for a group of migrants deported to the El Salvadoran mega-prison CECOT under Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act, in addition to next steps in his contempt inquiry. They migrants have since been moved to Venezuela.

Another D.C. judge is set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing in a challenge brought by four migrants who live in the nation’s capital and were arrested by immigration authorities without warrants.

A federal judge in California is set to hold a summary judgment hearing in a challenge brought by Stanford’s student newspaper and two anonymous students who allege the administration is unconstitutionally deporting students for their pro-Palestinian advocacy.

Federal judges in North Carolina are set to hold a preliminary injunction hearing over North Carolina’s new congressional map that could give Republicans an additional seat.

A federal judge in Chicago is set to hold a hearing about revealing a government informant in the case against Juan Espinoza Martinez, an alleged Latin Kings member accused of putting a bounty on the head of a top immigration enforcement official.

Thursday:

A federal judge in Maryland is set to hold an evidentiary hearing in the case of mistakenly deported man Kilmar Abrego Garcia as she weighs whether to dissolve a preliminary injunction that would allow the government to deport him again.

Anibal Hernandez Santana, a retired lobbyist accused of firing a gun into an ABC affiliate office in Sacramento, Calif., the day after activists protested the network’s removal of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing, is set to be arraigned on state charges.

Friday:

Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton is set to appear before a federal judge in Greenbelt, Md. for the first hearing since he entered his not guilty plea.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes (D) faces a deadline to appeal to the state’s top court a ruling that ordered her to return her case against the state’s so-called “fake electors” to a grand jury or see it dismissed.

Monday:

The Supreme Court will announce orders.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit is set to hear oral arguments in the Trump administration’s appeal of a district judge’s finding that the administration may not exclude journalists based on their opinions, stemming from its efforts to block the Associated Press’s access over its decision not to abide by the president’s change of the Gulf of Mexico’s name to the “Gulf of America.”

Please note that the views of outside contributors do not reflect the official opinions of SCOTUSblog or its staff.

In its defense of President Donald Trump’s executive order limiting access to birthright citizenship, the Justice Department claims that the government’s policy would bring the United States in line with the modern global trend. It is true that most countries do not grant citizenship at birth to people born within their borders with as few restrictions as the United States. But that isn’t new: The United States has been a global outlier since the 14th Amendment was added to the U.S. Constitution in 1868.

Understanding which countries grant citizenship primarily based on the location of birth, and which don’t, helps make sense of the 127-year-old approach that the Justice Department is asking the court to reconsider. This also reveals the troubling history of why certain countries have chosen not to recognize birthright citizenship in the first place.

***

Trump’s birthright citizenship order, which denies U.S. citizenship to some children born in the United States based on the citizenship or immigration status of their parents, has faced legal challenges since shortly after the president signed it in January. In June, the court weighed in on the administration’s side regarding a technical – albeit important – procedural issue, and over the past five months courts considering a new round of lawsuits have uniformly concluded that the executive order is likely illegal. In its petition asking the court to review decisions from two federal courts – the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire – the Justice Department argues that broad access to citizenship at birth “degrades” and “dilutes” U.S. citizenship. “Presumably for those reasons, hardly any developed country retains a theory of citizenship similar to the United States’ current approach,” the U.S Solicitor General, D. John Sauer, writes in the government’s petition.

The solicitor general’s claim isn’t so much incorrect as it is misleading. Sauer doesn’t cite any source or give any examples, so it is impossible to be sure which countries he considers “developed.” Germany, Japan, and most Nordic countries, for example, historically relied on biological relationships to determine citizenship. In practice, a citizen’s child would obtain citizenship at birth based on the parent-child relationship even if the child was born outside the country of citizenship. Called jus sanguinis – a Latin term meaning “right of blood” – what matters most under these citizenship practices, which remain common, is a child’s genetic inheritance. Current law in the United States features jus sanguinis options for some children born abroad to U.S. citizens.

By contrast, the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause, which ties citizenship to the place of birth, is an example of a jus soli citizenship law – a Latin phrase that means “right of the soil.” Since at least 1898, when the Supreme Court issued its decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, courts and executive branch agencies have interpreted the citizenship clause as granting U.S. citizenship to everyone born in the United States except for the children of foreign diplomats, invading military forces, and Native Americans.

Like in the United States, jus soli citizenship laws are common throughout the Western Hemisphere. Canada and Mexico both extend citizenship to children born within their borders. Alongside Argentina and Brazil, South America’s two largest economies, the five wealthiest countries in the Americas recognize a broad jus soli citizenship right. Except Mexico, each of these countries exempts children born to diplomats.

Despite being far from unusual in the Americas, jus soli citizenship originated in the United Kingdom. In 1608, Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke announced that Robert Calvin, who was born in Scotland, was a citizen of the king’s entire realm rather than simply of Scotland. “Whosoever is born within the King’s power or protection, is no alien; but Calvin was born under the King’s power and protection; ergo he is no alien,” Coke wrote in Calvin’s Case. Importantly, Coke qualified this broad recognition of citizenship through birthplace by excluding children born to invading enemies. A child born to someone who successfully attacks “any castle or fort” isn’t treated as a citizen “though he be born within his dominions, for that he was not born under the King’s ligeance or obedience,” Coke added.

The immediate impact of Coke’s decision in Calvin’s Case was that Robert Calvin could claim property in England on the same terms as any English male. Over the long run, the theory of citizenship based on the location of birth that Coke announced in 1608 also proved convenient to a country that would go on to spread its reach across the world. The U.K.’s broad jus soli policy ensured that its own emigrants could count on their children receiving U.K. citizenship no matter where in the kingdom they lived.

Nevertheless, almost 400 years after Calvin’s Case, the United Kingdom narrowed its citizenship law. As Sauer notes in his petition to the court, “[e]ven the United Kingdom, which pioneered near-automatic birthright citizenship, abandoned that approach in 1983.” By the last decades of the 20th century, the U.K. had stopped invading new territories, subduing their populations, and stretching its global reach through generation after generation of emigrants. Rather than send its own native-born residents abroad, residents of the remaining Commonwealth countries, as well as residents of the U.K.’s former colonies, began heading to the U.K. To limit who acquired citizenship, in 1981 Parliament enacted a law, the British Nationality Act of 1981, that tied a child’s citizenship to birth in the U.K. and the citizenship or immigration status of their parents. That law, which combines jus soli and jus sanguinis principles, went into effect on Jan. 1, 1983 and remains in effect today.

Indeed, the division between countries that rely primarily on jus soli citizenship and those that use jus sanguinis reflects their histories of colonization. Most countries that default to jus soli citizenship share a common history of European colonization, including displacement and near annihilation of native populations. The United States, like the rest of the Americas, fits this description. By contrast, few countries that prioritize jus sanguinis citizenship were colonized by European powers.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-11-19 13:58:51.801605

Comey's lawyers argue that Trump's public comments prove case is a personal attack

Lawyers for James Comey are arguing that the case against the former FBI director is nothing more than a personal attack, born out of Donald Trump’s desire to prosecute his political adversary.

“This is an extraordinary case and it merits an extraordinary remedy,” Comey’s defense lawyer, Michael Dreeben, said today at a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. Dreeben added that the president’s public comments about Comey are “effectively an admission that this is a political prosecution and not based on evidence”.

A reminder that Comey is charged with lying to Congress in 2020, and has pleaded not guilty.

On Monday, another federal judge found evidence of “government misconduct” in how Lindsey Halligan, the interim US attorney general for the eastern district of Virginia, secured criminal charges against the former FBI director, and ordered that grand jury materials be turned over to Comey’s defense team.

House set to repeal funding bill provision to allow senators to sue government over phone records

Later today, we’re expecting a vote in the House that would repeal a provision tucked into the stopgap spending bill passed last week (which ended the record-breaking government shutdown) that allows senators to sue the federal government because their phone records were subpoenaed in 2023 by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

Most Republicans in the House have derided the measure, while the Senate majority leader, John Thune, remained convinced it was necessary. “The House is going to do what they’re going to do with it,” he said of the lower chamber lawmakers. “It doesn’t apply to them.” However, a number of GOP senators have indicated they’re happy to do away with the provision. This even includes some of the eight lawmakers whose phone data the FBI sought and obtained as part of Jack Smith’s investigation.

That vote is currently scheduled for 8:15pm ET.

Exclusive: State department to cut 38 universities from research program over DEI policies

Joseph Gedeon

The state department is proposing to suspend 38 universities including Harvard and Yale from a federal research partnership program because they engage in diversity, equity and inclusion hiring practices, according to an internal memo and spreadsheet obtained by the Guardian.

The memo, dated 17 November, recommends excluding institutions from the Diplomacy Lab – a program that pairs university researchers with state department policy offices – if they “openly engage in DEI hiring practices” or set DEI objectives for candidate pools.

Elite institutions including Stanford University, Yale University, Johns Hopkins University, Duke University and the University of Southern California are among those marked for suspension, effective 1 January 2026. Other targeted schools include American University, George Washington University, Syracuse University and several University of California campuses.

An accompanying spreadsheet, reviewed by the Guardian, uses a color-coded system to evaluate 75 universities on a four-point scale, with institutions showing “clear DEI hiring policy” marked in red for suspension and those with “merit-based hiring with no evidence of DEI” marked in green to maintain partnerships.

The suspensions follow Trump’s near year-long campaign against DEI in higher education. In January, he declared diversity programs “illegal” and ordered agencies to force universities receiving federal grants to certify compliance or lose funding, with a 21 April deadline. In April, he moved to terminate accreditors that require DEI practices, threatening universities’ ability to access federal student aid.

Trump administration crafting plan with Russia to end war in Ukraine - report

The Trump administration is working with Russia to craft a plan to end the war in Ukraine, according to a report by Axios.

Citing unnamed US and Russian officials, a 28-point peace plan is inspired by Trump’s deal to end the war in Gaza. According to Axios’ sources, the plan’s 28 points fall into four general buckets: peace in Ukraine, security guarantees, security in Europe, and future U.S. relations with Russia and Ukraine.

Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is leading the drafting of the plan Trump’s envoy and has discussed it extensively with top Russian diplomat, Kirill Dmitriev. The aim, according to Dmitriev is to produce a written document along those lines before Trump and Putin next meet, according to Dmitriev.

According to Axios’ Barak Ravid, Witkoff also met with Ukraine’s national security adviser, Rustem Umerov, in a meeting earlier this week in Miami, Florida.

This comes as an overnight strike by Russia on western Ukraine killed 25 people and left 73 people injured, according to Ukrainian interior ministry

Larry Summers steps down from OpenAI board following release of Epstein emails - report

Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary and Harvard professor, told Axios on Wednesday that he was resigning from the OpenAI board following the publication of a series of email exchanges he had with the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

His resignation comes one day after Charlie Stadtlander, the New York Times’ executive director for media relations and communications, said the publication was cutting ties with him amid new revelations about his relationship with Epstein from documents released by members of the House last week.

The documents revealed that Summers maintained a friendly relationship with Epstein long after the disgraced financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008, and continued to correspond with him until 5 July 2019, the day before Epstein was arrested on sex-trafficking charges.

“In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,” Summers said in a statement to Axios. “I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress.”

The Senate is expected to formally vote on Wednesday on a bill that would force the full release of the investigative files related to Epstein. Some of the documents that have already been released appear to suggest that Donald Trump “knew about the girls” procured for Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring and that he had once Trump “spent hours” with one victim at Epstein’s house.

Former FBI director James Comey to appear in court

Former FBI director James Comey is set to return to court on Wednesday, where his lawyers will argue that Donald Trump unlawfully directed the Justice Department to prosecute as a form of malicious retribution.

Comey was charged with lying to Congress in 2020 just days after Trump appeared to urge his attorney general to prosecute the former FBI director and other perceived political enemies. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, with his attorneys arguing that the charges are an example of vindictive prosecution.

On Monday, Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick ruled that the justice department engaged in a “disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps” on its way to indicting Comey and directed prosecutors to produce to defense lawyers all grand jury materials from the case.

Mike Pence says 'I did my duty' in UK talk touching on January 6, tariffs and MBS visit

Former Vice President Mike Pence is speaking at Chatham House in London, reflecting on the US and its place in the world today.

He was diplomatic when discussing Donald Trump, saying he remained proud of the record of the Trump-Pence administration, though “it didn’t end the way I wanted it to” – Pence split from Trump when he refused to block certification of Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 as rioters incited by Trump chanted “hang Mike Pence”.

“I will always believe, by god’s grace, that I did my duty that day in January 2021,” Pence said to loud applause.

However, Pence said he disagreed on Trump’s statements on Tuesday during a White House visit with Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump brushed off questions from a reporter about a US intelligence assessment that the prince had approved the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US green-card holder and Washington Post columnist, saying “things happen” and that bin Salman “knew nothing about it, and we can leave it at that”.

“I would not have made that statement,” he said without much more detail, adding that the visit would have gone much differently had he been in the Oval Office.

Pence also distanced himself from Trump’s global tariffs, saying he believes that while tariffs “have a use as a means of facilitating negotiation…I believe in free trade with free nations.”

“The simple truth is at the American founding, taxes on tea were kind of an issue,” he said as the crowd laughed. “Those were tariffs. By the time they got around to that second draft of an American government in 1787 that we call the constitution of the United States, the one thing they wanted to make clear was that no one person could impose import tariffs and taxes on the American people, that it would be done by the elected representatives of the American people. I’m hopeful that our supreme court will draw the same conclusion.”

Democrats and Republicans celebrate passage of bill to release Epstein files

Hello and thank you for joining us on the US politics live blog. I’m Vivian Ho and I will be bringing you the latest news over the next few hours.

The Senate agreed on Tuesday by unanimous consent to approve legislation that would force the release of investigative files related to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The move came mere hours after a 427-1 vote in the US House to pass the bipartisan measure that Donald Trump had been fighting for months.

“Americans are done being lied to. These survivors deserve full transparency. Every document, every truth, every name,” Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump ally who split from the president over the Epstein files, posted on X on Tuesday.

The scandal over the Epstein files has dogged Trump since his return to the White House. For months, the president has dismissed the uproar over the government’s handling of the Epstein case as a “Democrat hoax”. Over the weekend, he relented and urged Republican lawmakers to vote for the measure that many of their constituents demanded they support.

“I don’t care when the Senate passes the House Bill, whether tonight, or at some other time in the near future, I just don’t want Republicans to take their eyes off all of the victories that we’ve had,” the president posted on Truth Social on Tuesday.

The Senate majority leader, John Thune, told CNN that the bipartisan bill will likely be sent to Trump’s desk for signing on Wednesday, after the House formally transmits the bill and the Senate officially approves it. Trump told reporters on Monday that he would sign the bill.

Congressman Ro Khanna, a Democrat who sponsored the bill alongside Republican congressman Thomas Massie, posted on X that Trump “should have the survivors who made this possible at the bill’s signing.”

Backlash related to the Epstein files, some of which have already been made public by members of the House, has begun: the New York Times said it will be cutting ties with the former treasury secretary Larry Summers after documents revealed that Summers maintained a friendly relationship with Epstein long after the disgraced financier pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in 2008.

Trump is set to speak at a US-Saudi forum focused on investment on Wednesday. After a White House visit on Tuesday from Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader, Mohammed bin Salman, Trump said that the US and Saudi Arabia have entered into a security agreement that would ease weapons transfers between the two countries and elevate Saudi Arabia to a “major non-Nato ally,” Politico reports.

This came after Trump brushed off questions from a reporter about a US intelligence assessment that the prince had approved the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a US green-card holder and Washington Post columnist. Marty Baron, the former executive editor of the Washington Post, called Trump’s remarks “a disgrace”. “‘Things happen,’ he said. Actually, someone made them happen. And that was the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. He had Jamal Khashoggi assassinated, and then he and his government lied about what happened.”

Federal judges are set to hear arguments on Wednesday afternoon to determine a preliminary injunction request in two consolidated challenges to North Carolina’s congressional map, which was redrawn with the aim of adding more Republicans to Congress. On Tuesday, a panel of federal judges ruled that Texas cannot use 2025 congressional maps, which added five Republican districts, for the 2026 midterms and must use the 2021 boundaries. Judge Jeffrey Brown wrote: “Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 map.”

A new Marquette Law School survey finds more people are favoring Democrats than Republicans in the anticipated 2026 vote for Congress.

The Trump drag on the GOP A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular.
Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party.","Heading into the 2026 midterm elections, there are some very big warning signs for Republicans in the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist poll.

The survey of 1,443 adults, conducted from Nov. 10-13, found:

Democrats holding their largest advantage, 14 points, since 2017 on the question of who respondents would vote for if the midterm elections were held today;

President Trump's approval rating is just 39%, his lowest since right after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol;

A combined 6-in-10 blame congressional Republicans or Trump for the government shutdown; and

Nearly 6-in-10 say Trump's top priority should be lowering prices — and no other issue comes close.

""I don't think rent prices or food prices are at the forefront like they should be,"" said Nicole Stokes of Dallas, Texas, who participated in NPR's poll and voted for Trump last year. ""You know — the American people — it's our pockets that are getting ripped apart to fund things.""

From the political parties and Congress to the Supreme Court and the media, other respondents said they had little to no confidence in these critical institutions.

""I feel lost,"" said poll respondent Wayne Dowdy of Memphis, Tenn., who calls himself a ""lapsed Democrat."" ""The parties don't speak to me anymore.""

He said he often feels unseen by the Democratic Party, but, given the alternative, he plans to keep supporting Democratic candidates — for now.

The disillusionment extends to how people see those in the opposite political party. Big majorities of Democrats and Republicans said the other party is ""dishonest"" and ""closed-minded"" about politics.

All of it makes for a volatile political stew heading into the holidays, but with Republicans in charge of all the levers of power in Washington, Democrats have the clear advantage a year out from next year's midterm elections.

Democrats in the driver's seat for control of Congress

Coming off huge wins up and down the ballot across the country in this year's off-year elections, Democrats lead Republicans, 55%-41%, when people were asked who they would vote for in their district if the election for Congress were held today.

It's the largest Democratic advantage on this question, known as the congressional ballot, in the Marist poll since November 2017. The parallel is striking, considering that was at the same point in Trump's first term as this poll now. Democrats wound up winning 40 House seats in 2018.

What's more, independents chose Democrats by a 33-point margin on this question. It's all quite the reversal of fortune from a year ago when, just before the 2024 elections when President Trump won back the White House, the parties were tied on the congressional ballot.

Historically, Democrats have needed a sizable advantage on the congressional ballot to signal that they would do well in upcoming midterms.

Consider:

In the fall of 2022, with Democratic President Biden in the White House, Democrats' lead ranged from 0 to 4 points. They lost nine House seats;

In 2018, during Trump's first term, Democrats' lead ranged between 6 and 12. They won 40 seats;

In 2014, when Democrat Barack Obama was president, Republicans had a 5-point advantage. The GOP gained 13 seats.

All that said, with redistricting, the number of competitive seats has shrunk significantly, so major gains are less likely than they were in previous years. Trump has also encouraged conservatives in red states to try and create more Republican districts in rare mid-decade redistricting.

Democrats have responded in kind, so the landscape for control of the House for next year remains uncertain at this point.

The Trump drag on the GOP

A big reason for Democrats' advantage is that Trump is unpopular. Not only is he at 39% approval, the lowest of this second term in the Marist poll, but he gets just a 24% rating with independents as well.

Overall, almost half of those surveyed — 48% — said they strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing. That's also the highest of this term and the highest since just after Jan. 6, 2021.

The president has seen low ratings for his handling of various policy areas, including the economy and foreign policy, and people think he's gone too far on immigration.

Trump has said on more than one occasion in this second term that while campaign advisers told him prices were the most important issue, he always felt it was really immigration. But respondents in the NPR survey are sending a clear message: they think the cost of living should be Trump's top priority.

Almost 6-in-10 — 57% — said lowering prices should be his top priority. Immigration is a distant second at 16%. Even a plurality of Republicans (40%) said lowering prices should be the priority compared to immigration (34%).

Despite Trump's slide in approval ratings, he's holding up well with his base — 9-in-10 Republicans continue to say they approve of the job he's doing.

Stokes, the Trump voter from Dallas, said a year into his presidency, said she's pleased by his attempts to tackle illegal border crossings and restrict U.S. foreign aid, but she is concerned that the president hasn't made the economy a focus.

But her support of Trump doesn't translate to Republicans on Capitol Hill. Instead, she said, she has little confidence in the elected officials representing either political party.

""They're not in tune with anyone on the ground,"" Stokes said. ""I don't really see anyone in [the House] or in the Senate that's really for the American people right now.""

It's not just Trump. Democrats and others get low marks

Trump's approval is low and so is confidence in the office he holds — 61% said they have little to no confidence in the institution of the presidency.

But the scores were even poorer for other key institutions. Worst among them was Congress — 80% said they had little to no confidence in it, followed by the media (75%), the Democratic Party (71%), the Republican Party (65%) and the Supreme Court (62%).

This is yet another poll that shows Democrats have a problem with their base. While 80% of Republicans have ""quite a lot"" or a ""great deal"" of confidence in the GOP, just 57% of Democrats said the same of their party.

Despite long supporting liberal candidates, Dowdy, the Democrat from Memphis, argues the party has become disconnected from everyday voters.

""They don't interact with working people,"" he said, ""regardless of whether they work in an office or on a job site or building homes or working in a factory. They don't know how people like that live... They have no connection to the real people. And there's no attempt to try and reach that.""

And yet, Democrats have a wide advantage on the congressional ballot, which, coupled with the electoral gains earlier this month, indicate that left-leaning voters may rally to Democrats' side when faced with having to choose between them and Republicans.

Democrats and Republicans see each other as ""dishonest"" and ""closed-minded""

It's no wonder political acrimony is as high as it is in the country; people have very little respect for where the other side is coming from.

The survey found that more than 8-in-10 Republicans and Democrats described people in the other political party as ""closed-minded""; more than 7-in-10 Republicans and roughly two-thirds of Democrats also see the other as ""dishonest"" when talking about politics.

Independents have better views of Democrats than Republicans. They said Republicans were more dishonest and closed-minded than Democrats with a majority of independents (54%) saying Republicans were ""mostly dishonest"" compared to more than 6-in-10 saying Democrats were ""mostly honest"" when it came to politics.

Nearly 7-in-10 independents also described Republicans as mostly closed-minded, while a majority (53%) said Democrats were mostly open-minded.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5616x3159+0+293/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9e%2F75%2F027c0c3046f9bd50f8d3ffc63f00%2Fgettyimages-2245835281.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:59:15.415056

The decision comes after the Department of Homeland Security released a list last week identifying 610 people still in custody after arrests by ICE agents in the Chicago area between June and Oct. 7.

The list was required by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who ordered the release of everyone on it on a $1,500 bond unless they were deemed a public safety risk by ICE or if they had a prior removal order.

Homeland Security attempted to block or delay the releases while the federal government appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Cummings denied the request, stating in his late Tuesday order that ICE didn’t show irreparable harm nor that it could win on appeal. The judge also wrote that the plaintiffs faced concrete harm if the releases were delayed.

The release will apply to 442 people detained by ICE between June and Oct. 7 who have not yet been deported and not deemed a public safety threat, according to court documents.

ICE identified 57 people who were deemed “high public safety risk” and are therefore to remain in detention, Cummings ruled.

The list provided by Homeland Security includes a Risk Classification Assessment for each person, which reviews a person’s criminal history, immigration record and community ties to recommend whether they should be detained or released while their case moves forward, according to a 2012 report from the department. But questions around how risk is calculated by the government remain, as the rubric has changed several times since its inception.

The system assigns separate ratings for public-safety risk and flight risk — each ranging from low to high — and then issues a final overall score, also from low to high. Department of Homeland Security officials did not answer questions about how these ratings are determined.

Of the 610 people on the list, ICE assigned final risk assessments as follows: 21 high, 58 medium/high, 39 medium/low and 488 low. Separately, ICE assigned the following public safety risk as follows: 42 high, 87 medium and 473 low.

Homeland Security initially identified 16 people on the list to remain in custody after receiving a “high public safety risk” designation from ICE. The list states those people were arrested for criminal charges ranging from driving under the influence to assault with a gun. But the government later deemed all but one of them to be low or medium threats to public safety.

On Friday, Homeland Security expanded its list to include 39 additional people it labeled as posing a high public safety risk, but it offered no explanation for those designations. In a response, attorneys for the National Immigrant Justice Center noted Saturday that ICE’s own risk assessment rated several of those people as low or medium-low risk overall and asked the judge to require the Department of Homeland Security to justify each of the added cases.

Attorneys for the National Immigrant Justice Center and ACLU of Illinois, who are plaintiffs in the case, have repeatedly criticized ICE’s risk rating system as unclear and inconsistent.

Researchers have also raised concerns. A 2022 study published in the Columbia Human Rights Law Review found that between 2012-2015, ICE changed how the tool scored people, including what counted as a higher-risk offense, which pushed more people into detention categories instead of release.

A 2020 study meanwhile found the tool routinely failed to follow its own risk logic. A review of three major risk-scoring revisions showed Homeland Security rewrote scoring rules so more people were labeled “medium” or “high” risk. The study also found the risk assessment hid key information from judges and misclassified some people, resulting in the detention of many medically vulnerable migrants.

Block Club was unable to verify most of the government’s allegations of criminal conduct through searching publicly available court records and arrest databases. Even when Block Club found criminal cases involving people flagged in the immigration data, the charges were often different from those listed by the government.

For example, an individual listed as a high “national security” risk was charged in February with causing a traffic crash and lacking a valid driver’s license. Another person accused by the government of assault with a gun was charged with a misdemeanor domestic violence offense after threatening to stab a man this year.

Block Club found records showing some of the people deemed high risk had been arrested on felony charges, including sexual abuse and home invasion. In other cases, neither public records nor government information explained why they were considered threats to public safety.

However, arrests highlighted by the government could have happened in other areas or might not be readily found by the public.

By Wednesday, Homeland Security is mandated to produce an expanded list of more than 3,000 people arrested and detained by Border Patrol in the Chicago area.

The judge said he would consider whether damages were necessary at a later date.
In a witness statement, Abu said he suffered “paranoia and flashbacks” in the separation system, and in segregation “[my] mental health has deteriorated to the point that I am experiencing constant thoughts of suicide and self-harm”.
Separation centres, which currently house 12 prisoners, according to the judgment, have come under increased scrutiny this year.","Shabana Mahmood and David Lammy have been found to have breached a prohibition on inhuman or degrading treatment with respect to a prisoner who spent months segregated from other inmates, in what is believed to be a legal first.

Sahayb Abu was confined to his cell at HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes, for 22 hours a day and prevented from associating with other prisoners for more than four months after Hashem Abedi, the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber, allegedly attacked prison officers at HMP Frankland.

Abu, a convicted terrorist serving a life sentence, was already being held in a separation centre for prisoners believed to be at risk or radicalising others, which has also been described as small group isolation, but was moved to even more restrictive conditions following the attack by Abedi in April.

In what is believed to the the first instance of ministers being found in breach of article 3 of the European convention on human rights, Mr Justice Sheldon found that Lammy, the justice secretary, and Mahmood, his predecessor, should have considered Abu’s existing mental health issues before he was moved.

In his written judgment, the judge said: “In the context of a prisoner who has a history of trauma and where there was a failure to obtain an assessment of his needs even though he was known to have mental health issues, and a failure to provide him with any therapeutic treatment to address his trauma, a contravention of article 3 is made out, notwithstanding the importance of the aim behind the segregation regime.

“The suffering that the claimant has experienced goes way beyond the inevitable element of suffering that is connected with segregation: an otherwise legitimate form of treatment. An individual who is segregated from others and deprived of the usual activities available to prisoners (education, work, communal prayer) will inevitably suffer isolation and an element of distress and anxiety. What the claimant experienced was much more severe than that: he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, brought on (at least in part) by the segregation.”

He said that his judgment did not mean that the same segregation regime would contravene article 3 in the case of a prisoner with an ordinary level of resilience, but the “claimant was not such a prisoner, given his history of trauma and associated mental health needs”.

The judge said he would consider whether damages were necessary at a later date.

In a witness statement, Abu said he suffered “paranoia and flashbacks” in the separation system, and in segregation “[my] mental health has deteriorated to the point that I am experiencing constant thoughts of suicide and self-harm”.

Separation centres, which currently house 12 prisoners, according to the judgment, have come under increased scrutiny this year.

In another judgment, handed down in January, the high court found that the decision to place Denny De Silva, who was serving a life sentence for a gangland murder, in a separation centre was unlawful as it had relied on allegations of radicalisation activities in prison by De Silva, without establishing whether or not they were true. In comments that were also referred to in the Abu case, Mrs Justice Hill said: “Research indicates that small group isolation regimes can produce serious and adverse psychological effects similar to solitary confinement.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8e2b45c6d8beb717aa8f9655cbac592d6749896/512_0_2560_2048/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b43a73608ff5348c2d5f8efb2edc5704",N,,2025-11-19 11:59:44.949990

States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests.
The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.
New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.","A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.

In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.

“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.

Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.

They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.

The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.

In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.

States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.

Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.

“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.

But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.

“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.

Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.

Knowing where a target will be

Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.

Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.

“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.

In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.

“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”

An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.

McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.

Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.

Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.

Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.

Trump administration court actions

But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.

The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.

U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.

“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.

The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.

In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.

Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses

Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.

Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.

“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.

Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”

Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.

“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.

Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.

“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.

“It is absolutely unacceptable that the Trump administration is dragging its feet on the awarding of these vital security grants,” said Congresswoman Pou. “As domestic extremism and terrorist threats to synagogues and other religious and community centers explode, Congress appropriated these grant funds to help support readiness. Americans have an unshakeable right to worship in peace and security. Congress deserves answers and our nation deserves action from this administration.”

In their letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the recently resigned former head of FEMA, Pou and her colleagues demand transparency and answers from the Trump government.

“We are alarmed that the administration has not awarded the $275 million that Congress made available for NSGP in fiscal year 2025 given the escalating threats that nonprofit organizations – including synagogues, churches, and mosques – continue to experience,” the Members wrote. “Further, FEMA continues to disregard the congressionally mandated outreach, engagement, and educational assistance to advise nonprofits on how to apply for NSGP.”

Members expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s refusal to share basic program information with Congress: “In further departure from precedent, the administration has yet to share with Congress which nonprofits received NSGP awards from the National Security Supplemental funding, despite awards having been made months ago and repeated bipartisan requests. Congress has invested historic levels in NSGP and the administration’s refusal to share information with Congress hurts the ability of Congress to properly assess resource needs.”

Congresswoman Pou is also the top Democrat on the House panel tasked with overseeing the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the 2028 Summer Olympics, and celebrations of America’s upcoming 250th birthday. Throughout 2025, she has helped lead efforts to ensure security for these events and that they receive full support from the federal government.

A copy of the letter signed by Congresswoman Pou and 33 House Democrats is available here. The text is below.

Dear Secretary Noem and Mr. Richardson:

We write to you out of shared concern about the status of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) awards.

FEMA was required by law to publish the FY 2025 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for NSGP by May 14, 2025, but chose not to comply. The administration finally released the FY 2025 NSGP NOFO on July 28, but it lacked basic information necessary to move the application process forward and to fruition, such as when FEMA planned to administer the application process, make award decisions, and release funding to nonprofit organizations. To date, FEMA still has not shared this information with States or nonprofit organizations, nor has FEMA indicated whether the period of performance for awarded projects has already begun. States have repeatedly asked FEMA for this information, and they have received no response. This has also created a chilling effect on faith-based and nonprofit organizations that are hesitant to participate in an opaque application process.

We understand that FEMA plans to continue to withhold the $275 million in FY 2025 NSGP funds and, prior to the government shutdown, awards for nonprofit organizations were scheduled to take several months. Further, FEMA continues to disregard the congressionally mandated outreach, engagement, and educational assistance to advise nonprofits on how to apply for NSGP. As of the date of this letter, FEMA has not held a single webinar to advise nonprofits on how to apply for these needed funds. Because of FEMA’s delays and lack of coordination and communication with States, many States have already opened and closed the application period for nonprofit organizations, meaning that any outreach from FEMA at this point would be too late. Other States have not opened the application process and have not communicated with faith-based and nonprofit stakeholders, leaving the process and the potential applicants in limbo.

In addition, FEMA’s FY 2025 NOFO introduced vague, new requirements and conditions that have created confusion among States and nonprofits, leaving applicants uncertain about whether their proposals would be qualified or disqualified for funding and what constituted compliance in order to receive payments from FEMA. For example, the NOFO includes language implying that eligibility for funding could depend on cooperation with Federal immigration enforcement efforts—a significant departure from past practice. FEMA also now requires States to collect and submit additional information about each nonprofit organization before awards can be made and each time nonprofits need to be reimbursed—steps that could significantly slow the process for both States and nonprofits and add undue administrative costs and burden. Such provisions have created concern that faith-based and community organizations might not be able to receive timely reimbursements from FEMA, if they receive any reimbursement at all, discouraging them further from applying for funds.

We are also deeply concerned by reports that DHS may be discriminating against Muslim organizations. In August 2025, DHS reportedly cancelled NSGP funding that had been awarded to over 40 Muslim organizations and banned their eligibility for future funding, citing “alleged affiliations with terrorist activities.” More recent reporting indicates that these cancellations may have been part of a broader attempt by DHS leadership to ban FEMA funding for all Muslim organizations. DHS has not presented evidence sufficient to justify disqualifying these organizations from receiving grant funding.

We are alarmed that the administration has not awarded the $275 million that Congress made available for NSGP in FY 2025 given the escalating threats that nonprofit organizations—including synagogues, churches, and mosques—continue to experience. This delay comes at a time when our Nation continues to see nonprofits targeted by bad actors, which the NOFO itself acknowledges. In August, a Minneapolis Catholic Church was the site of a mass shooting that left 2 children dead and injured 21 other people.6 In September, a man opened fire and set ablaze a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, killing 4 people and wounding 8.7 The U.S. has also seen a rise in violent antisemitic attacks, including the hostage taking incident at Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville, Texas in 2022, and the deadly shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. earlier this year. Now is not the time for NSGP resources to be withheld from communities, nor the NOFO and grant guidance to continue to remain incomplete.

In further departure from precedent, the administration has yet to share with Congress which nonprofits received NSGP awards from the National Security Supplemental funding, despite awards having been made months ago and repeated bipartisan requests. Congress has invested historic levels in NSGP and the administration’s refusal to share information with Congress hurts the ability of Congress to properly assess resource needs.

Therefore, we urge DHS and FEMA to take the following actions:

Immediately clarify the timeline for the FY 2025 NSGP applications, address all other open issues or incomplete grant guidance to the State Administrative Agencies and nonprofit sub-applicants, and expedite application completion and awards to nonprofits.

Immediately remove the vague NOFO requirements that unduly burden States and nonprofit organizations and may ultimately prevent nonprofits from accessing funds.

Immediately provide Congress with the full list of nonprofits that received NSGP awards this year and continue to provide this information each time awards are made in the future.

Immediately begin outreach, engagement, and educational assistance to nonprofits to share essential information about the NSGP application process.

Immediately rescind any guidance or directives that have resulted, or could result, in violations of anti-discrimination laws within NSGP.

FEMA must take immediate steps to get the FY 2025 NSGP back on track so that FY 2026 can proceed without the present delays, inconsistencies and uncertainties, and lack of uniformity and predictability that have previously been the hallmarks and guardrails for a program serving several thousand faith-based and nonprofit applicants each grant cycle. The Administration’s own budget for FY 2026 endorsed continued NSGP funding, reflecting a shared commitment to keeping communities safe and ensuring funds reach those who need them most.

Sincerely,

If family life is strictly limited to parents and children, as the Home Secretary suggests, then this would be in conflict with Article 8 ECHR.","Backlash against the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) is heavily driven by immigration and is often a direct reaction to it. This is not a new phenomenon, but the politics are escalating, both domestically and internationally. On the international plane nine states issued a joint letter earlier this year challenging the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) migration jurisprudence and it is reported that further discussions about potential reform of the ECHR are ongoing. On the domestic plane, both the Conservative Party and Reform have announced that if they win the next election they intend to tackle immigration by withdrawing from the ECHR. Against this political backdrop, the Labour Government has announced its proposals. In Restoring Order and Control: A statement on the government’s asylum and returns policy it proposes to reform the asylum system; limit the right to respect for private and family life in Article 8 ECHR in domestic law; reexamine the interpretation of ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’ for the purposes of Article 3 ECHR as part of international initiatives; and bring forward legislation on modern slavery. There is, and will be in the coming months, much to discuss, but what is clear is that change is afoot.

In the midst of this political maelstrom, it is imperative that debate and analysis is premised on a clear understanding of the legal issues. In an excellent report for the Bonavero Institute, Victoria Adelmant, Alice Donald and Basak Çali highlighted the problematic ways in which immigration law and human rights are presented in media coverage. Alan Greene has also recently suggested that the way in which politicians discuss human rights is a form of ‘kayfabe’, a staged performance which ‘allows politicians to ground reality in a fictional story of their own creation rather than objective truth’. He points to various statements by politicians about immigration as exemplary of this but concludes that ‘when stepping from the kayfabe to the real world, these arguments must come into contact with reality’ and that ‘it is here where the technocratic defences of human rights come into their own.’ This blog post might therefore be seen as part of that technocratic examination, or to quote Greene again, to be ‘bringing facts to a vibes fight’.

The Government’s proposals have grave implications for many aspects of immigration law, and I will explore some of these issues elsewhere; some insights into the constitutional implications can also be found in Mark Elliott’s blogpost. In the space accorded for this blog post I will focus on Article 8 ECHR. In particular, the Government’s proposal to limit the right by: (i) strengthening the public interest test; and (ii) defining ‘family’ for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR. I will argue (i) that domestic law already defines the public interest test, and it is difficult to see how this can be strengthened in ways that are compatible with the Convention; and (ii) that the Government’s definition of ‘family’ is neither necessary, nor will it inevitably lead to the desired result. In respect of Article 3 ECHR, readers would be well advised to read Natasa Mavronicola’s earlier analysis on the prospect of losing this right.

Strengthening the public interest test

The Government’s first proposal is to bring forth legislation setting out ‘to Home Office decision makers, and the courts, how to properly balance the public interest against’ Article 8 ECHR. One might legitimately ask, however, whether this is not already provided for in domestic law. Since 2012, Immigration Rules have set out how Article 8 ECHR should be balanced and these provisions were inserted into the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (NIIA) by s.19 of the Immigration Act 2014. There is therefore already domestic law which establishes how Article 8 ECHR is to be balanced against the public interest. In particular, s.117A NIAA provides that a court or tribunal must have regard to s.117B NIAA in all cases, which states, amongst other things, that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public interest. Section 117A also provides that a court or tribunal must have regard to s.117C NIAA in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals. Section 117C NIAA states that deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest unless one of three exceptions applies. Those exceptions require, in respect of sentences of less than four years, that there are either ‘very significant obstacles to integration’ or that the effect of deportation on a partner or child would be ‘unduly harsh’. Moreover, in cases where someone has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, only ‘very compelling circumstances over and above’ those other two exceptions will suffice. The severity of these thresholds has been addressed in the case law. See, for example, the observation in SSHD v Treebhawon and Others, at [37], that very significant obstacles to integration ‘is a self-evidently elevated threshold, such that mere hardship, mere difficulty, mere hurdles and mere upheaval or inconvenience, even where multiplied, will generally be insufficient in this context’. As well as the Supreme Court’s confirmation in HA (Iraq), at [41-45], that

‘unduly harsh’ does not equate with uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or merely difficult. Rather, it poses a considerably more elevated threshold. ‘Harsh’ in this context, denotes something severe, or bleak. It is the antithesis of pleasant or comfortable. Furthermore, the addition of the adverb ‘unduly’ raises an already elevated standard still higher.

These provisions (albeit in the form of Immigration Rules at the time) were accepted by the ECtHR in Unuane v United Kingdom as not in themselves incompatible with Article 8 ECHR on the basis that they do not preclude the domestic courts and tribunals from employing the criteria set out in the Convention case law for assessing whether an expulsion is necessary and proportionate. Importantly, however, in Unuane the ECtHR stated (at [79]), that

where the domestic courts do not carefully examine the facts, apply the relevant human rights standards consistently with the Convention and the Court’s case-law, and adequately balance the interests of the applicant against those of the general public, the Court remains empowered to give the final ruling on whether an expulsion measure is reconcilable with Article 8.

Consequently, it will be necessary to see whether the Government’s proposal for a ‘fundamental reset’ which ‘narrows the circumstances in which an individual’s Article 8 rights would outweigh the public interest in removing them’ is consistent with the human rights standards established in the ECtHR’s case law.

In contemplating what the Government’s proposals might look like it is helpful to recall that the Labour Government is not the first to suggest curtailing Article 8 ECHR. Indeed, this was a core part of the former Conservative Government’s proposals for repealing the HRA and replacing it with a Bill of Rights. Some insight into the issues that the Labour Government might now face may thus be found in responses to the former Conservative Government’s proposals. In 2021-2022 in my role as Director of the Centre for Public Law at the University of Cambridge, I and twenty-nine other members of our centre produced an extensive response to that consultation in which we observed, amongst other things, that it was unlikely that the proposals could require the courts to do anything other than what they were doing under the existing legal framework. We suggested that anything more restrictive was likely to lead to the ECtHR finding violations of Article 8 ECHR.

Defining family

The Government is also proposing to bring forth primary legislation stating that ‘[f]amily, for the purposes of Article 8, should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’. Some insight into what is driving this proposal might be found in Lord Wolfson’s legal advice for the leader of the Conservative Party, which was published by the Conservative Party as the Wolfson Report in September 2025. The advice in that report is structured around a series of tests promulgated by Kemi Badenoch in June 2025 as the means of deciding whether the UK should remain a signatory to the ECHR. The choice of tests, the framing of those tests, and the interpretation of the outcomes of those tests is, of course, political.

One of the five tests presented and used in the Wolfson Report is the ‘sovereign borders test’. In respect of which the Report states at [16-17] that the UK could, free from the purported constraints of the ECHR, ‘adopt more robust policies in this area and still maintain compliance with other international instruments to which the UK is signatory, principally the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture’ (emphasis added). The report cites Australia in support of this contention. Stevie Martin, Stephanie Palmer and I have written in our forthcoming editorial for the December 2025 issue of the European Human Rights Law Review that any suggestion that Australia’s immigration laws, policies and/or practices comply with international rights instruments including the Convention Against Torture is plainly incorrect. Consequently, it is troubling from a rule of law perspective to read statements such as the following, at [73], that: ‘where there is no body capable of providing a definitive conclusion on the interpretation of an instrument, the UK will be in a better position to argue that its actions and policies are compatible with the instrument in question, provided it has bona fide opinion as to the meaning of the instrument’. Particularly when observing that the Report immediately goes on to state that ‘[t]his in part explains how the Australian Government maintains that its border policy is compliant with international law: while it is signed up to the Refugee Convention, it is not a member of the ECHR. As a result, its position cannot be authoritatively second-guessed in any competent international court’ (emphasis added). These repeated references to ‘maintaining compliance’ as opposed to ‘being compliant’, as well as avoiding legal scrutiny, run the risk of venturing into the world of Humpty Dumpty- enabling states to maintain that words (laws) mean just what they say they mean. This was arguably the underlying ethos of the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024.

Returning, however, to the question of family life, the Wolfson Report states (at [45]) that ‘courts have given an extremely broad interpretation to the scope of the concept of “family life” to include relationships between siblings (including adult siblings); aunts or uncles and nephews or nieces; and grandparents and grandchildren.’ Yet any suggestion that the ECtHR accords a broad interpretation to family life in the immigration context is untenable. This is evident if one looks at the ECtHR’s case law and compares it with the three cases cited in the Wolfson report, namely Boughanemi v France; Boyle v United Kingdom; and Marckx v Belgium. None are recent cases and two of the three cases are not even immigration cases (Boyle was a child custody case, while Marckx was about state recognition of the relationship between a mother and her child). It is true that Boughanemi concerned deportation but the ECtHR has clarified in subsequent case law that adult children only have ties with their parents where there is the requisite level of dependency. In fact the ECtHR’s threshold for establishing family life beyond the core or nuclear family (spouses and children that have not yet come of age) is very high and is centred around the concept of dependency (a concept that does not feature in the Wolfson report).

This concept can, however, be seen in Kumari v. the Netherlands and Martinez Alvarado v. the Netherlands. Those judgments were handed down some nine months prior to the Wolfson report, but they were by no means the first occasion on which the Court has stated that: ‘there can be no family life between parents and their adult children or adult siblings unless they could demonstrate “additional elements of dependence, involving more than normal emotional ties”’. Moreover, the severity of the threshold for dependency was already evident in cases such as Savran v Denmark, where an applicant who was receiving treatment for paranoid schizophrenia could not rely upon his close ties with his mother and siblings in order to establish family life. It can also be seen in Senchishak v Finland, where family ties could not be established between an elderly mother who had suffered a stroke and her daughter who was her only surviving relative.

As for the interpretation given by our domestic courts, the single case cited by the Wolfson Report (at [45] fn.75) in support of the claim that a broad approach to family life operates is IA v SSHD, a case which concerned a family from Gaza that sought reunification with a family member in the UK. This case received considerable political attention after it was embroiled in a back-and-forth in Parliament between Kemi Badenoch and the Prime Minister. The application in IA was rejected by the Home Office, following which the First Tier Tribunal found that, although there was family life, this could not outweigh the weight to be attached to the public interest. This was subsequently overturned by the Upper Tribunal, which found flaws in the way in which the judge assessed the significance to be accorded to family life when carrying out the balancing exercise. Given Kemi Badenoch’s views on IA it is not surprising that it made its way into the Wolfson Report. What is surprising, however, is that the Wolfson Report did not mention that permission to appeal was granted by the Court of Appeal in May 2025, precisely in order to enable the court to consider whether family life could extend beyond the core family. The appeal was heard in the Court of Appeal in November and a judgment is pending.

This is the political backdrop to the Government’s proposal, and it will be interesting to see how it develops in the coming months. In particular, we will need to look closely at precisely how the Government intends to define family life. When the Home Secretary made her statement in Parliament announcing the policy she stated that the Government will define ‘what, exactly, a family is – narrowing it down to parents and their children’. This, however, is a narrower approach to family life than that stated in the policy document which provides that family life ‘should not normally go beyond immediate family members; unless, for example, other family members are acting in a parental capacity or there is a different, exceptionally close link’. If family life is strictly limited to parents and children, as the Home Secretary suggests, then this would be in conflict with Article 8 ECHR. If, however, the Government proceeds with the model set out in its policy document then this could align with what the ECtHR currently provides (namely, additional elements of dependence, involving more than normal emotional ties) in which case there is arguably no change at all other than putting this interpretation on a legislative footing. Alternatively, the Government’s notion of an ‘exceptionally close link’ could bring into play different values from ‘dependency’. I have written in my chapter on immigration in a book that I recently co-authored with Stevie Martin and Stephanie Palmer that the ECtHR’s approach suggests that family ties are ‘only established where there is extensive physical and financial dependency. Indicating that the ECtHR approaches dependency as if something akin to an infantile relationship within a stable family set-up is required.’ Dependency for the ECtHR thus suggests a hierarchical relationship based on vulnerability and need, whereas the Government’s concept of ‘exceptionally close link’ may place the emphasis on strong emotional ties without the need for dependency. In this respect the Government’s proposed definition could in fact encompass a different, and potentially broader category of persons than those recognised by the ECtHR. This is clearly not what is intended.

We thus await further details in respect of these proposals, draft legislation and a section 19 HRA statement in respect of such legislation. These proposals will be subject to immense scrutiny, and clarity will be demanded as to precisely how the proposed changes are going to operate in ways that ensure that domestic law remains, as this Government intends, compatible with the ECHR.

The proposal comes during a time when Cal State is facing limited budgets, layoffs and program cuts.
Erin Foote, a union board member for California State Employees Union: “I am mad.","A San Francisco state senator unveiled legislation Tuesday that aims to give Californians the right to seek damages from federal agents, as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement across the U.S.

The bill authored by Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat and congressional hopeful, would enable people to file a lawsuit or seek redress against local, state and federal officers for violating their constitutional rights.

Wiener, at a press conference: “This (federal) administration is attempting to wield unchecked power to illegally kidnap and deport people, to punish the administration’s political opponents using government resources, to freeze university funding and to fire thousands of federal workers en masse.”

The measure works to promote what’re known as Bivens lawsuits, a precedent established by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1971, which permits individuals to sue federal officers for violating their constitutional rights. But in the years since, the high court has curtailed Bivens actions, making it difficult for people to bring forth claims and recover damages.

In October ProPublica found that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained during immigration sweeps — some of whom were reportedly beaten and shot. Little recourse is available for victims, though in a rare case, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department arrested a federal immigration enforcement officer last week after he held a teenage boy at gunpoint and detained him.

Wiener’s proposal comes a day after the Trump administration filed a lawsuit to block a new California law written by Wiener that bans law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing face coverings.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned other agencies that criminals have posed as immigration agents to carry out crimes, but the U.S. Department of Justice said California’s law threatens the safety of federal officers.

The California State University’s board of trustees plans to vote today on whether to change the university system’s executive pay structure in a way that would boost their wages — a potential overhaul that has drawn blowback from Cal State’s unionized staff and faculty, writes CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn.

Currently, Cal State caps the base pay of its 22 campus presidents at a salary that’s no more than 10% above what their predecessors made. Raises for sitting presidents are also no higher than 10%. The average base pay for presidents ranges from $370,000 to more than $500,000.

But Cal State says the policy leads to uncompetitive compensation. Trustees are deciding on a plan that would raise the executive base pay (along with overall wage increases for other Cal State workers), and add a 15% incentive-based pay bump that executives would be eligible for.

The proposal comes during a time when Cal State is facing limited budgets, layoffs and program cuts.

Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist and former hedge fund manager, said today that he is running to be California’s next governor, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.

Steyer kicked off his campaign with a video where he pledges to preserve the state as a place for business and innovation, while also lowering California’s cost of living by making corporations pay “their fair share.”

Steyer: “The Californians who make this state run are being run over by the cost of living. Californians deserve a life they can afford.”

The mega-donor for California Democrats spent more than $12.8 million in support of Proposition 50, making him the second-largest independent ad buyer in state history. As an outspoken critic of Trump, Steyer poured millions in a national ad campaign that advocated for the president’s impeachment during his first term. Steyer also ran for president in 2020 before ultimately dropping out of the race.

Federal authorities are denying more of certain work visas and green cards, vetting professionals’ social media platforms, and applying enhanced scrutiny to foreign employees’ credentials and work plans in the United States, according to interviews with 15 immigration attorneys, a federal official and three policy analysts. Visa holders also have been subject to more searches, interrogations and denials of entry at airports and border crossings, as well as deportation proceedings and visits to their employers by federal agents, the attorneys and experts said.

The administration this year rolled out a travel ban on 19 countries, a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas, and mandatory in-person interviews for most business and temporary work visa applicants at U.S. consulates in their home countries - a policy change that lawyers say could lead to longer wait times.

Officials also announced a “continuous vetting” policy aimed at all 55 million U.S. visa holders.

For foreign professionals, the crackdown has meant new levels of anguish and fear - indefinite separation from partners and children living in the United States, termination of employment offers, lost income and dashed opportunities.

“My patients are also suffering, and I’m suffering,” said Mustafa Alawad, a 27-year-old Sudanese doctor in Cairo, who was denied a visa after receiving a job offer from an internal medicine residency program at a community hospital in Huntsville, Alabama. The Trump administration denied him a visa because of a ban on visitors from Sudan. So Alawad has been unable to join his fiancée, a dentist, who is already in the United States.

Apple, Accenture, Lyft, Snapchat, Advanced Micro Devices, Pinterest, Silicon Laboratories, Rambus and Datadog have all warned for the first time in recent weeks that the new immigration and visa policies imperil their corporate performance, a review of earnings calls and quarterly reports by The Washington Post found. None of the companies responded to requests for comment.

“Laws and regulations, including immigration,” could “materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain a highly skilled, global workforce,” Apple told investors on Oct. 31. Hospitality and biotechnology firms issued similar alerts.

The State Department has not released data on visa issuances since May, and the latest data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which tracks visa applications and denials, is from June. The available data does not show any notable shift in the number of work visa applications and denials compared with last year, but attorneys say some of the crackdown began more recently.

Major groups representing U.S. employers, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Society for Human Resource Management, declined to comment or did not respond to questions. But the chamber sued the Trump administration last month over its $100,000 H-1B visa fee, in its first lawsuit against this administration.

“This stringent enforcement and stringent examination of what has always been perfectly legal visa categories is new,” said Jeff Joseph, president of American Immigration Lawyers Association. “But companies are too afraid to go out there and say, ‘Look what’s happening.’ … Companies are relying on litigation from the chamber and trade orgs to avoid retaliation.”

Kimberley Best Robidoux, a lawyer at WR Immigration in San Diego, said that after President Donald Trump took office this year, there was an uptick in deportation proceedings against foreign professionals on work visas during what had typically been a 60-day grace period for those switching employers or changing their immigration status.

“We have definitely seen the administration turn the benefits-based visa programs into enforcement tools,” Robidoux said. “This administration is using all the tools in their toolbox in a way where previously the prior administrations may have been using more discretion.”

The administration says these changes are intentional.

“Since day one, President Trump has been clear that he will put Americans first by tightening our immigration laws to ensure that our workers are not displaced, companies are not offshoring labor, and our national security is not compromised,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement to The Post. “The heightened scrutiny in the visa approval process is an administration-wide effort to implement President Trump’s America First agenda, a mandate from nearly 80 million Americans who were tired of being sidelined by the Democrats.”

The State Department is applying more scrutiny across the board rather than cracking down on specific work visa types and regions, a senior department official told The Post, speaking on the condition of anonymity to brief the media. The official said the administration is taking security and public safety seriously, including looking at things like drunken driving and assault charges. Authorities are using social media vetting and other tools in new ways to catch these issues, the official said.

“We don’t see scrutiny as a bad word. … Compared to previous administrations, we do have more scrutiny. National security is more of a priority than ever,” the official said.

The State Department is also scouring for visa fraud because some companies or individuals have applied for business visas, known as B-1s, instead of H-1Bs, even when that was not appropriate. Business visas are unlimited, while H-1Bs are capped.

Despite the new scrutiny, the official told The Post, interview wait times were down in many nations and 80 percent of countries had wait times of 60 days or less for a visa appointment.

Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement to The Post that the agency conducts deportation proceedings and unannounced worksite visits “to restore integrity and ensure the security of our nation’s immigration system.” It added: “The agency is committed to using its [Notices to Appear] authorities against removable aliens and denying or revoking H-1B petitions of those who refuse to comply with site visits.”

Immigration lawyers said professional visa categories appear to be receiving more scrutiny and denials than others, including temporary nonimmigrant visas for high-skilled professionals, such as H-1Bs, J-1s, L-1s and O-1s. The latter is nicknamed the “genius visa” and is designated for individuals of “extraordinary ability” in the sciences, arts, athletics, business and other areas.

The crackdown - heightened denials and enhanced vetting and questioning - has also hit employment-based green cards, including EB-1s, a category for foreigners with extraordinary abilities, three lawyers told The Post, affecting top scientists and engineers working in artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, payment systems, defense and cybersecurity.

“We’re seeing cases denied for people who build the systems our economy runs on,” said Sameer Khedekar, an immigration lawyer in Silicon Valley. “These are the people who are building the products that hundreds of millions of users use.”

Immigration officials denied one top software engineer at Capital One an EB-1 visa in August, according to a copy of his lawsuit against the government, which was reviewed by The Post. The engineer, an Indian national, had lived in the United States for years, performing “a critical role” in “the development and implementation of cutting-edge AI-driven financial technologies,” the suit said. He had also written articles for scientific journals, peer-reviewed research and judged prestigious contests in his field. Capital One declined to comment.

Applicants from countries identified by the State Department as national security threats, including China, Iran and Venezuela, also are seeing heightened vetting, lawyers said.

For companies, the scrutiny has resulted in delays in project development and hiring, and increased costs associated with managing visa uncertainties, said Alexander Jovy, a lawyer at Global Immigration Partners, who specializes in business visas. Some firms have shifted their hiring plans as a result. Meanwhile, foreign professionals working in the United States have expressed reluctance to travel internationally because of fears about being barred from reentry into the country.

“The United States is the market where people want to start businesses and want to be innovative and be pushing the envelope,” said Cecilia Esterline, immigration analyst at the Niskanen Center, a moderate think tank in Washington. “And if we lose the people who are able to do that, I think we risk our stature internationally, our competitiveness.”

Jeremy Beck, co-president of NumbersUSA, a group that lobbies for restricting immigration, supports the Trump administration’s narrowing of legal immigration programs, especially amid a souring economy and mounting layoffs.

“The case for large-scale guest worker programs, temporary work visas and permanent work visas is as weak now as it’s been since at least the Great Recession,” Beck said. “They are restoring credibility to the system, increasing the public’s trust that the system is working as it should. Those are good things. But it’s not clear that it’s going to radically change the numbers.”

Still, the administration has sent mixed messages. Last week Trump partially defended the H-1B program in an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, saying, “You also do have to bring in talent.”

“You can’t take people off an unemployment line and say, ‘I’m going to put you into a factory, we’re going to make missiles,’” Trump said. “It doesn’t work that way.”

Sharadha Kodem, an immigration lawyer in Irving, Texas, who files work visa petitions mostly for Indian and Southeast Asian nationals, said three of her clients on valid H-1B visas were denied entry by U.S. customs agents after they had been temporarily working remotely in their home country to deal with a family or medical emergency. They have been unable to return to the United States, where they have spouses and children and own homes.

“This didn’t happen under Biden,” Kodem said. “We came out of the first term of the Trump administration going through hell and beyond for our clients. Then it was much more relaxed during the Biden administration, and now the crackdown has started again.”

The resolution follows weeks of residents voicing concerns about police actions and involvement with federal immigration enforcement activities.

“This isn't the finish line. This is the starting line,” Mayor Jim Schwantz assured the crowd in the council chambers. “We're going to continue to build on this going forward.”

In addition to the resolution, Village Manager Reid Ottesen announced several steps the village is taking to rebuild trust with its immigrant community.

He said officers will now ask federal agents for identification and verification of which agency they represent.

The village also launched a bilingual webpage (English and Spanish) with information about immigration rights, resources and frequently asked questions.

Deputy Police Chief David Brandwein will lead efforts to meet with community members to explore ways the village can nurture its relationship with the entire community.

Council Member Joe Falkenberg addressed perceptions of inaction by the council by saying he has reached out to residents who spoke up at recent meetings.

Schwantz said some will think the resolution doesn’t go far enough, while others will think it goes too far.

That was reflected in the public comment at Monday’s meeting.

Palatine area resident Valeria Delgado, a daughter of immigrants, a graduate of Fremd High School and Harper College with a master’s degree from Loyola University, illustrated the climate of fear generated by the presence of federal agents.

She said one father of three, whose 3-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with autism, now shops for groceries only after 11 p.m.

She also mentioned the plight of a woman whose daughter is completing her confirmation at a local Catholic church. She said they have had to miss Mass due to reports of federal agents in the area.

“Their human right to go to church has been currently violated,” she said. “Just let that sink in a little bit.”

Palatine resident Laura Hernandez called the resolution a good first step but said she wants to see more engagement with the Hispanic community.

“Passing a resolution is just a paper,” she said. “We need more doing and less talking.”

But Palatine resident Frank Skorski argued that illegal means illegal.

“For some reason, the federal government and the state of Illinois has decided that people who come here illegally deserve certain rights. I disagree. They don’t deserve any rights,” he said.",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=068ed642-00da-5e29-b20e-05b298b79cb6&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-11-19 12:57:19.794947

Impact of fee increases New fees for asylum applications or increases to already established fees have become a fixture of immigrant policy in Trump’s second term.
Citizenship and Immigration Service reported it had 1,446,908 pending affirmative asylum applications at the end of 2024.","When President Donald Trump signed “The Big Beautiful Bill” into law in July, the massive legislation included an overhaul of several immigration-related fees for applications and forms commonly used to seek asylum, appeal court decisions and apply for work permits.

The fee increases and the establishment of new ones are part of the Trump administration’s sweeping changes to the immigration system.

The cost of appealing an immigration judge decision rose from $110 to $900, while the fee for people seeking temporary protected status jumped from $50 to $500.

To some Indiana immigration attorneys, the immigration-related fee increases or new fees came with seemingly no warning and appeared to be more of a deterrent to immigration than a way to cover agency costs.

John Broyles, a partner with Indianapolis-based Broyles & Ricafort, PC, said he had several questions and concerns regarding the fee increases.

“What was wrong with the original fees? Were they not covering the costs?” Broyles said.

Broyles said there was no analysis provided or any explanation he had seen as to why there needed to be fee increases, something he believes is being done to disincentivize people from applying for asylum or filing other immigration-related applications.

Some fees are five times higher than before, he noted.

Sarah Burrow, director at Lewis & Kappes, called the fee increases “devastating” and “terrible,” with an impact felt by the most vulnerable population.

Burrow said her firm has clients in court that have been in federal custody and not able to work, with their families hit with as much as $1,500 in additional fees.

For someone filing an asylum application fee, the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill changed the application from being free to carrying a $100 cost.

“$100 is a lot of money, especially for someone who may be a new arrival,” Burrow said, adding, “there is nothing beautiful about what this administration is doing in the context of immigration, not a single thing.”

In late October, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued an order in Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, et al. temporarily staying the annual asylum fee, according to the USCIS.

Impact of fee increases

New fees for asylum applications or increases to already established fees have become a fixture of immigrant policy in Trump’s second term.

Trump’s Sept. 19 proclamation included imposing a $100,000 annual fee on new H-1B visas and rolled out a $1 million “gold card” visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.

Like the asylum fee, the H-1B visa fee drew its own legal challenge.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration, alleging that Trump’s new $100,000 visa fees for the H-1B program, widely used by Silicon Valley, violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for D.C..

About 85,000 new H-1B visas have been available each year, although Congress exempts universities from that cap, with the government receiving about 425,000 H-1B visa petitions in 2024.

By comparison, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service reported it had 1,446,908 pending affirmative asylum applications at the end of 2024.

Burrow said the rise in asylum application fees are most often mentioned by clients.

She said she didn’t think anyone could have anticipated such large fee increases or the imposition of fees for applications that previously had no cost attached.

The Lewis & Kappes attorney also noted that USCIS announced it was phasing out check and money order payments.

USCIS announced in August it would accept only ACH debit transactions or credit card payments after Oct. 28.

“We have a responsibility to the American people to operate as efficiently and securely as possible,” said USCIS Spokesman Matthew Tragesser in a news release. “Over 90% of our payments come from checks and money orders, causing processing delays and increasing the risk of fraud and lost payments. America deserves better, and we intend to deliver.”

Broyles said he had a client in a non-lawful permanent resident cancellation case who paid a $130 filling fee prior to the Big Beautiful Bill’s passage.

He said if the client, who won her case, filed the case today, she would have to pay $1,630.

“I’m not sure my client could afford that,” Broyles said.

Broyles stressed that he has been practicing for 27 years and has seen periodic fee adjustments, but not something as dramatic as fee disparities with the aforementioned case.

“They’re a lot. It’s all just the overall plan of this administration to discourage people at any means to remain here,” Broyles said.•",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/immigration-law.jpg,N,,2025-11-19 11:59:21.954016

In her morning news conference on Tuesday, Sheinbaum was asked about Trump’s statements a day prior, when he expressed displeasure with Mexico and mused about taking forceful action.

“It’s not going to happen,” Sheinbaum replied in Spanish.

She proceeded to explain that she had made her position clear “many times” in telephone conversations with Trump and his secretary of state, Marco Rubio.

“He has suggested on several occasions or has said, ‘We offer you a United States military intervention in Mexico or whatever you need to combat criminal groups,'” she explained.

While she said she would accept collaboration and intelligence-sharing with the US military, she repeated her stance that no outside intervention would be allowed on Mexican soil.

“We do not accept an intervention by any foreign government,” Sheinbaum continued. “I’ve told him on the phone. I’ve said it with the State Department, with Marco Rubio.”

A response to Trump

Her comments come on the heels of an Oval Office meeting between Trump and FIFA President Gianni Infantino on Monday. The Republican president used the public appearance to address his expanding military campaign against drug cartels and criminal networks in Latin America.

When a reporter asked if he was considering “potentially launching strikes in Mexico”, Trump answered in the affirmative.

“To stop drugs? It’s OK with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs,” Trump said. “I looked at Mexico City over the weekend. This is some big problems over there.”

He then made a reference to the US bombing campaign that began on September 2.

At least 21 deadly missile strikes have been conducted against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, killing 83 people.

United Nations officials and other legal experts have denounced the military campaign as an illegal form of extrajudicial killing.

Trump, however, suggested the campaign could eventually include strikes on land-based targets in Mexico.

“ If we had to, would we do there what we’ve done to the waterways? You know, there’s almost no drugs coming into our waterways any more,” Trump continued.

“ Would I do that on the land corridors? I would absolutely. Look, every boat we knock out, we save 25,000 American lives, not to mention the destruction of families.”

While Trump has repeatedly used that number — 25,000 — to justify the boat bombing campaign, there is no factual basis for that figure.

Provisional data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that fatal drug overdoses have declined in recent years, with 73,960 deaths recorded during the 12-month period ending in April.

The Trump administration has also provided no definitive evidence to prove who was on board the bombed vessels, nor that they were linked to drug trafficking.

The identities of the victims remain largely unknown, though families in countries like Venezuela, Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago have asserted that their loved ones disappeared after the attacks. Some have claimed their relatives were only fishermen.

Two survivors were repatriated in October, one to Colombia and another to Ecuador, the latter of which released the man without charging him with a crime.

Trump has long threatened to broaden his bombing campaign to include land-based targets. But he declined to say whether he would ask permission before striking Mexico, should he choose to do so.

“ I wouldn’t answer that question,” he told a reporter in the Oval Office on Monday. “I’ve been speaking to Mexico. They know how I stand.”

He later added, “ Let me just put it this way. I am not happy with Mexico.”

Framing cartels as ‘enemy combatants’

Since taking office for a second term, Trump has claimed extraordinary powers to justify his increasingly aggressive actions against drug cartels, going so far as to claim the US is in a state of war with traffickers.

Only Congress can formally declare war in the US. But in August, Trump reportedly signed a secret order allowing the military to take action against the cartels, leading to renewed fears in Mexico.

Sheinbaum, at the time, told her constituents there would be “no invasion”.

Then, on October 2, Trump issued a memo to Congress asserting that Latin American cartels were “enemy combatants” in a “non-international armed conflict”, laying out his administration’s legal argument for the ongoing attacks in the Caribbean and Pacific.

Trump has also categorised various drug cartels as “foreign terrorist organisations” throughout his second term, though that designation alone does not justify military action under international and domestic law.

In Monday’s Oval Office remarks, Trump reiterated his position that he viewed the US as being in an armed conflict.

“ We know the addresses of every drug lord. We know their address. We know their front door. We know everything about every one of them. They’re killing our people. That’s like a war,” Trump said.

The US has a long and controversial history of military intervention in Latin America, and in recent years, there has been renewed interest on the US right to send armed forces into Mexico.

In 2023, for example, then-presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, a prominent Republican leader, said he would deploy US special forces across the border to Mexico to fight drug-trafficking cartels.

“And I will do it on day one,” DeSantis told Fox News at the time, musing on his plans for the presidency.

Fears that Trump could spearhead such an action stretch back to his first term, from 2017 to 2021, when he first considered using the “foreign terrorist organisation” designation.

For months, federal officers have used less-than-lethal weapons and tactics against protesters outside the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, facility in Portland.

Demonstrators accuse the officers of using excessive force and instigating confrontation. The federal government says it’s simply protecting its property.

But a closer look reveals something deeper — a little-known federal agency with broad authority and a system that allows the Department of Homeland Security to pull in elite, specially trained tactical teams to help police protesters.

At the center of the response is the Federal Protective Service, or FPS. The agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for guarding federal buildings and ensuring the safety of employees and visitors.

In Portland, that means protecting the ICE facility. The government-leased building in the South Waterfront neighborhood has been the focal point of anti-ICE protests since early June.

Normally, there are four FPS inspectors, along with an undisclosed number of private security officers assigned to the Portland ICE office, according to the agency’s deputy regional director.

But over the past few months, the number of federal officers protecting the ICE building has surged to as many as 197 officers in a single 24-hour period, according to court records.

And the officers protecting the ICE building aren’t all FPS employees. Many came from other parts of DHS through what’s known as cross-designation. The mechanism allows FPS to bring in officers from other DHS agencies including Customs and Border Protection, Bureau of Prisons, and the Secret Service.

Video evidence indicates specially trained units such as U.S. Border Patrol BORTAC and a special response team from ICE have been on the ground in Portland.

Critics explain that many of these specially trained officers, who normally rely on military tactics, aren’t used to facing off with protesters.

“It actually creates a lot of danger and conflict, and that results in the various sorts of civil rights abuses and aggressive policing that we're seeing,” said Spencer Reynolds, formerly senior counsel in the Liberty and National Security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law and a former DHS intelligence attorney.

“These agents are not trained for crowd control,” Reynolds said. “They’re trained to go and do remote interdictions and the like.”

To better understand the crowd dynamics and interaction between protesters and federal officers, KGW reviewed dozens of video clips and social media posts. We spoke with eyewitnesses, listened to trial testimony and got a guided tour of the ICE facility — although access was limited.

Many nights outside the ICE facility in Portland follow a familiar pattern. Officers emerge from the front gate, then push out in a U shape or wedge formation, clearing the way for vehicles to enter or exit the ICE building.

Although protesters are sometimes antagonistic, video appears to show officers, at times, responding with disproportionate force.

On October 2, Leilani Payne stood in front of officers on the street after they cleared the exit, allowing a car to leave the property. She complied.

But after the 19-year-old allegedly shouted insults and swore at the officers, one of them blasted her with chemical spray in the face. Payne said she had trouble breathing and suffered burning in her eyes, ears and throat.

In some instances, federal officers appeared to attack when there was no apparent threat.

Videos show protesters who crossed the blue line marked “US Government, Do Not Block” being tackled by a team of officers.

On August 13, protester Daryn Herzberg was standing outside the driveway, when a federal officer tackled him from behind. His body slammed into the pavement from the unexpected shove. Smoke was deployed. Herzberg said he was taken into custody and cited for failure to comply.

In 2023, DHS updated to its use-of-force policy. It allows officers to use force “only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative” exists, and they can only use a level of force that is objectively reasonable.

On several nights, the policy appeared to be tested.

Officers blanketed the street with smoke and tear gas, used flash-bangs, pepper balls and other less-than-lethal munitions. Their actions often seemed to make the situation worse instead of calming it down.

On October 18, a large crowd of peaceful protesters gathered outside the ICE facility following a ""No Kings"" rally. KGW zoomed in and slowed down the video.

It showed a federal officer who fired a less-than-lethal round into the ground, ricocheting toward the ICE building. That triggered federal officers to deploy tear gas on the crowd. The intent of tear gas is dispersal, but misuse or abuse can cause injuries or inflame tensions even more.

KGW sent the Department of Homeland Security videos of the incidents described in this story. In response, a spokesperson issued a written statement.

“ICE and CBP are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” the statement said. “Our officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training.”

As of mid-November, court records indicate federal prosecutors have charged 36 people with crimes related to the ICE facility in Portland since June. Some of those cases involved assaults on federal officers, arson and property damage.

Federal law gives U.S. Homeland Security broad authority to protect federal buildings, with no clear limit on how far off-site officers can operate.

On Sept. 30, video showed a team of 20 federal officers spread out on the street away from the building’s entrance. One protester was arrested, then dragged back toward the building. Later, that same video showed another large group of federal officers walking toward the ICE building. They too had made an arrest.

The video went on to show federal officers returning to the street and marching more than a block from the ICE building and out of camera view.

At the same time, Homeland Security has used helicopters and drones to circle overhead, frustrating neighbors and inflaming tensions.

The conflict over immigration policy and attempts by President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops helped mobilize a new strategy among protesters: inflatable costumes. But even those in costume have faced off with federal officers.

On Oct. 2, Seth Todd said he was peacefully protesting in a frog suit when an officer aimed chemical spray directly at his costume’s air vent.

Protesters and local officials accuse the federal government of abusing its authority.

On October 6, Portland city attorney Robert Taylor wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice. “In Portland, we appear to be witnessing the federal government engaging in unconstitutional uses of force in violation of the Fourth Amendment against otherwise peaceful demonstrators exercising their First Amendment rights,” Taylor wrote.

Similar complaints were made during the 2020 racial justice protests in Portland, which centered around the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse.

A government audit by the DHS inspector general found that many of those federal officers deployed to Portland in 2020 were not sufficiently trained or prepared for the operation. Many of the same border and security forces have returned to Portland — this time to protect the ICE building.

“We can tell by the activities that are happening today that really not a lot has changed,” said Reynolds.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.
Executive order targeted benefits In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""
In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision.","The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services wants to expand a Biden-era policy known as public charge that could further curtail immigrants' use of public benefits.

That means that migrants' use of safety net programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or Medicare, could be considered when determining whether they should be granted further legal status, such as a green card.

Homeland Security Department officials released a new proposed regulation this week that's set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday. It would rescind a Biden-era version of the public charge rule, and expand the scope of what public benefits may be considered by immigration officers, to any social or health services people may use.

""Rescission would restore broader discretion to evaluate all pertinent facts and align with long-standing policy that aliens in the United States should be self-reliant and government benefits should not incentivize immigration,"" the proposal states.

Advocates were quick to criticize the proposal, arguing its new broad scope is too vague and could disincentivize the use of the benefits by immigrants who need them and qualify for them.

""This dangerous proposal puts the nation's health and economic wellbeing at risk,"" said Adriana Cadenas, executive director of the Protecting Immigrant Families Coalition. ""By creating chaos and confusion, it deters lawfully present immigrants and U.S. citizens from seeking health care and help they need and qualify for under federal law.""

Politics of social safety net programs

The proposed regulation from DHS comes as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are making false statements of rampant fraud in immigrants' use of social safety net programs.

People without legal status do not have access to SNAP, the healthcare marketplace, Medicaid and other public benefits.

Still, Congress recently applied further restrictions stripping health coverage and SNAP access from a range of lawfully present immigrants including refugees, asylum seekers and those with other humanitarian protections. It also cut funding from states that use their own funds to provide health care regardless of citizenship status.

The new rule proposed this week takes a broad approach that would also consider state-funded benefits in the review of immigrants' applications.

U.S. citizen children of noncitizens are still eligible for these programs.

Executive order targeted benefits

In February, Trump issued an executive order to end ""all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens.""

Trump's order is part of the administration's broader political messaging about Democrats and immigration. It came despite the lack of data to support the idea.

Only about 1% of over- or underpayments for SNAP were related to eligibility for citizenship. This data also does not indicate those without legal status were fraudulently using the program.

Trump in his first term had expanded the scope of benefits that could count as a ""public charge"" on someone's immigration record, and therefore make it harder for them to receive permanent status.

Public health providers said the regulation at the time created a chilling effect on immigrants being afraid to seek benefits they might have access to. The effect was exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when advocates said immigrants feared seeking health resources, such as getting medical care or using a food bank, out of concern that they would be considered a public charge for doing so.

In 2022, the Biden administration unveiled a new rule affecting immigrants and benefits that was similar to the regulation before Trump's 2019 revision. It meant that using benefits such as the SNAP, housing aid or transportation vouchers would not count against green card applicants.

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.","A day after President Donald Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a new directive to its agents: Arrests at courthouses, restricted under the Biden administration, were again permissible.

In Connecticut, a group of observers who keep watch on ICE activity in and around Stamford Superior Court have since witnessed a series of arrests. In one high-profile case in August, federal agents pursued two men into a bathroom.

“Is it an activity you want to be interfering with, people fulfilling their duty when they’re called to court and going to court? For me, it’s insanity,” said David Michel, a Democratic former state representative in Connecticut who helps observe courthouse activity.

Fueled by the Stamford uproar, Connecticut lawmakers last week approved restrictions on civil arrests and mask-wearing by federal law enforcement at state courthouses. And on Monday, a federal judge tossed a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice that had sought to block similar restrictions in New York.

They are the latest examples of a growing number of Democratic states, and some judges, pushing back against ICE arrests in and around state courthouses. State lawmakers and other officials worry the raids risk keeping people from testifying in criminal trials, fighting evictions or seeking restraining orders against domestic abusers.

The courthouse arrests mark an intensifying clash between the Trump administration and Democratic states that pits federal authority against state sovereignty. Sitting at the core of the fight are questions about how much power states have to control what happens in their own courts and the physical grounds they sit on.

In Illinois, lawmakers approved a ban on civil immigration arrests at courthouses in October. In Rhode Island, lawmakers plan to again push for a ban after an earlier measure didn’t advance in March. Connecticut lawmakers were codifying limits imposed by the state Supreme Court chief justice in September. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to sign the bill.

States that are clamping down on ICE continue to allow the agency to make criminal arrests, as opposed to noncriminal civil arrests. Many people arrested and subsequently deported are taken on noncriminal, administrative warrants. As of Sept. 21, 71.5% of ICE detainees had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization.

Some states, such as New York, already have limits on immigration enforcement in courthouses that date back to the first Trump administration, when ICE agents also engaged in courthouse arrests. New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, in place since 2020, prohibits civil arrests of people at state and local courthouses without a judicial warrant. The law also applies to people traveling to and from court, extending protections beyond courthouse grounds.

“One of the cornerstones of our democracy is open access to the courts. When that access is denied or chilled, all of us are made less safe and less free,” said Oren Sellstrom, litigation director at Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based group that works to provide legal support to immigrants, people of color and low-income individuals.

But in addition to challenging the New York law, the Justice Department is prosecuting a Wisconsin state judge, alleging she illegally helped a migrant avoid ICE agents.

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Stateline. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Some Republican lawmakers oppose efforts to limit ICE arrests in and near courthouses, arguing state officials should stay out of the way of federal law enforcement. The Ohio Senate in June passed a bill that would prohibit public officials from interfering in immigration arrests or prohibiting cooperation with ICE; the move came after judges in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, imposed restrictions on civil arrests in courthouses.

“The United States is a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of law and order. To have a civilized society, laws must be respected, this includes immigration laws,” Ohio Republican state Sen. Kristina Roegner, the bill’s sponsor, said in a news release at the time.

Roegner didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The legislation remains in a House committee.

Knowing where a target will be

Courthouses offer an attractive location for ICE to make immigration arrests, according to both ICE and advocates for migrants.

Court records and hearing schedules often indicate who is expected in the building on any given day. Administrative warrants don’t allow ICE to enter private homes without permission, but the same protections don’t apply in public areas, such as courthouses. And many people have a strong incentive to show up for court, knowing that warrants can potentially be issued for their arrest if they don’t.

“So in some respects, it’s easy pickings,” said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island.

In June, ICE arrested Pablo Grave de la Cruz at Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal in Cranston. A 36-year-old Rhode Island resident, he had come from Guatemala illegally as a teenager.

“They pulled up on him like he was a murderer or a rapist,” friend Brittany Donohue told the Rhode Island Current, which chronicled de la Cruz’s case. “He was leaving traffic court.”

An immigration judge has since granted de la Cruz permission to self-deport.

Trump’s National Guard deployments raise worries about state sovereignty

McLaughlin, the Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in her statement that allowing law enforcement to make arrests “of criminal illegal aliens in courthouses is common sense” — conserving law enforcement resources because officers know where a target will be. The department said the practice is safer for officers and the community, noting that individuals have gone through courthouse security.

Still, ICE’s directive on courthouse arrests sets some limits on the agency’s activity.

Agents “should, to the extent practicable” conduct civil immigration arrests in non-public areas of the courthouse and avoid public entrances. Actions should be taken “discreetly” to minimize disruption to court proceedings, and agents should generally avoid areas wholly dedicated to non-criminal proceedings, such as family court, the directive says.

Crucially, the directive says ICE can conduct civil immigration arrests “where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction.” In other words, the agency’s guidance directs agents to respect state and local bans on noncriminal arrests.

Trump administration court actions

But the Trump administration has also gone to court to try to overcome state-level restrictions.

The Justice Department sued in June over New York’s Protect Our Courts Act, arguing that it “purposefully shields dangerous aliens” from lawful detention. The department says the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, under which federal law supersedes state law.

New York Democratic Attorney General Letitia James argued the state law doesn’t conflict with federal law and sought the lawsuit’s dismissal.

U.S. District Court Judge Mae D’Agostino, an appointee of President Barack Obama, on Monday granted James’ motion. The judge wrote that the “entire purpose” of the lawsuit was to allow the federal government to commandeer New York’s resources — such as court schedules and court security screening measures — to aid immigration enforcement, even though states cannot generally be required to help the federal government enforce federal law.

“Compelling New York to allow federal immigration authorities to reap the benefits of the work of state employees is no different than permitting the federal government to commandeer state officials directly in furtherance of federal objectives,” the judge wrote.

The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE arrests fell in August despite show of force in DC, Los Angeles

The department is also prosecuting Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, who prosecutors allege helped a person living in the country illegally avoid ICE agents in April inside a Milwaukee courthouse by letting him exit a courtroom through a side door. (Agents apprehended the individual near the courthouse.) A federal grand jury indicted Dugan on a count of concealing an individual and a count of obstructing a proceeding.

In court documents, Dugan’s lawyers have called the prosecution “virtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutional.”

Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is set for December.

Lawmakers seek ‘order’ in courthouses

Rhode Island Democratic state Sen. Meghan Kallman is championing legislation that would generally ban civil arrests at courthouses. The measure received a hearing, but a legislative committee recommended further study.

Kallman hopes the bill will go further next year. The sense of urgency has intensified, she said, and more people now understand the consequences of what is happening.

“In order to create a system of law that is functioning and that encourages trust, we have to make those [courthouse] spaces safe,” she said.

Back in Connecticut, Democratic state Rep. Steven Stafstrom said his day job as a commercial litigator brings him into courthouses across the state weekly. Based on his conversations with court staff, other lawyers and senior administration within the judicial branch, he said “there’s a genuine fear, not just for safety, but for disruptions of orderly court processes in our courthouses.”

Some Connecticut Republicans have questioned whether a law that only pertains to civil arrests would prove effective. State Rep. Craig Fishbein, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, noted during floor debate that entering the United States without permission is a criminal offense — a misdemeanor for first-time offenders and a felony for repeat offenders. Because of that, he suggested the measure wouldn’t stop many courthouse arrests.

“The advocates think they’re getting no arrests in courthouses, but they’ve been sold a bill of goods,” he said.

Stafstrom, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in response that he believed the legislation protects many people who are in the country illegally because that crime is often not prosecuted.

“All we’re asking is for ICE to recognize the need for order in our courthouses,” Stafstrom said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-148799/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ice-courthouses1763546780.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=zzbtpd_2,N,,2025-11-19 14:58:11.380741

The University of Wisconsin-Madison Police are investigating stickers that appeared on campus encouraging violence against federal immigration agents.

Republicans are pointing to the imagery as another example of the hostile climate conservatives face on college campuses.

UW-Madison is removing the stickers and condemns violence of any kind, university spokesperson John Lucas said. He said he was aware of two or three stickers being removed.

One of the stickers showed a man wearing a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shirt and face mask, with red streaks that appear to be blood near his head. ""The only good fascist is a dead one,"" the text read.

Freshman William Hong spotted a sticker on a lamp post outside Memorial Library on Nov. 13. He said he was disgusted because he believed ICE in most cases is just trying to keep America safe. He ripped the sticker off but chalked it up as protected speech.

Hong is a board member of the UW-Madison chapter of Turning Point USA, the conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September. He said the campus climate since then has been mixed, with some progressive students celebrating Kirk's death in chalk messages left around campus and others who were more respectful. He said most instructors have created an unwelcome environment in his classes, but many students are open to civil conversations.

Howard Schweber, a UW-Madison professor who is an expert in free speech, said the stickers were unlikely to be constitutionally protected expression. The question of criminal charges would hinge on whether the person putting up the stickers either intended for the work to be perceived as a threat or acted recklessly by taking the chance that it would be perceived that way.

""Ask yourself whether it is likely that an ICE agent seeing this sticker would feel threatened,"" he said. ""If that is likely, then it is not hard to say that the person putting up the sticker was at least reckless about the possibility that a threat would be perceived.""

Schweber said the state would have a strong case for a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge. He was less sure about a new law adopted in February making it a felony to threaten judges or law enforcement officers because it seemed to need to be directed at a specific individual or group.

""That might be a question Wisconsin courts have to figure out,"" he said.

There’s a chance the stickers could reach a criminal level if they cause extensive damage to property, UW-Madison Police spokesperson Marc Lovicott said, but the incidents reported so far appear to be misdemeanor vandalism cases.

The imagery was first reported by the Madison Federalist, a new student newspaper.

Both Republicans running for governor condemned the sticker on X, formerly Twitter. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany said UW-Madison ""cannot keep quiet and pretend it's normal"" Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann said he wasn't surprised by the rhetoric and said it degraded the state flagship's reputation.
