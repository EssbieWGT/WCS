Many airport employees, including air traffic controllers, are required to report to work during the government shutdown — but they will do so without pay, and staffing issues are likely to arise.

Here’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.

1️⃣ Government shutdown

The US government has officially shut down for the first time in six years after a deadlocked Congress failed to pass a funding measure before the midnight deadline. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed, while many others deemed essential will continue working but will not receive pay until the impasse ends. As tensions escalate on Capitol Hill, Republicans insist that Democrats must agree to extend current funding for an additional seven weeks. Democrats refuse to do so without major concessions over enhanced Obamacare subsidies. The Senate will vote again today on the GOP funding plan, which Republicans vow to put on the floor daily until Democrats agree to reopen the government.

2️⃣ US military

President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are laying out a new vision for the US military. They addressed a gathering of top admirals and generals in Virginia on Tuesday, with Hegseth detailing new directives slamming diversity and bashing what he called “stupid rules of engagement.” Rules of engagement are directives governing how and when force can be used by the military. The defense chief also said combat troops will have to meet the “highest male standard,” and if that means there are no women in combat roles, “it is what it is,” Hegseth said. President Trump followed Hegseth with his own remarks, telling America’s military brass that “we’re under an invasion from within” as he defended his domestic crackdown.

3️⃣ ICE agents

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were seen on video grabbing and shoving journalists at a New York court on Tuesday, sparking swift condemnation from immigrant rights groups and Democratic lawmakers. The incident comes as tensions are escalating nationally over ICE tactics and press freedom. Critics argue that officers are being overly aggressive, while the agency says that the safety of agents is at risk. The journalists were documenting an arrest when they were shoved, according to the New York Immigration Coalition. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security offered a different account, saying the ICE agents were “swarmed by agitators and members of the press” while arresting an immigrant from Peru.

4️⃣ Hurricanes

Twin hurricanes Imelda and Humberto are churning up powerful waves along the US East Coast as the storms head toward Bermuda. The island is facing a rare one-two punch from the hurricanes, with Humberto passing nearby Tuesday and Imelda potentially making a direct hit today. In North Carolina’s Outer Banks, at least five homes collapsed into the ocean, the National Park Service said. Dramatic video shows the homes breaking apart and being swept away by waves as the surf battered the shoreline. Notably, the US has avoided a hurricane landfall so far this year. If this streak holds, it would be the first season without a storm coming ashore at hurricane strength in a decade.

5️⃣ Philippines earthquake

A 6.9 magnitude earthquake struck the central Philippines on Tuesday, killing at least 60 people and injuring more than 150 others. Several buildings collapsed, littering streets with debris after the shallow quake struck around 10 p.m. local time, just west of Palompon. Emergency services are scrambling to find survivors today, with military troops, police and civilian volunteers carrying out door-by-door searches. More than half a million people felt strong shaking across the Visayan Islands, which include Cebu, Biliran and Leyte, according to estimates from the US Geological Survey.

“This shutdown comes as communities across the country are voicing their concerns not just about the affordability of health care but also the devastating impact of unlawful immigration enforcement operations and the militarization of communities, like we have already seen in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Memphis and Portland.

Why has the US government shut down?

The US government shutdown began on 00:01 EDT (04:01 GMT) on Wednesday, which marked the beginning of the new fiscal year, at which point, the past year’s funding for government operations expired.

Republicans control both chambers of Congress, but failed to gather consensus to pass their bill laying out funding for government operations until November 21. Without this bill, the government cannot function.

Democrats refused to support the bill unless Republicans reverse recent cuts to Medicaid enacted under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill in July. Democrats proposed alternative solutions to the bill, but these were rejected by the Republicans. Congress was left deadlocked.

What happens to government employees now?

When the government shuts down, agencies must “furlough” – suspend or discharge – their “non-excepted” – or non-essential – employees.

These furloughed employees receive no pay for the duration of the shutdown. Once the government resumes operations, most will receive back pay, thanks to a 2019 bill passed by Congress enshrining this into law.

That law makes no mention of contract staff, however, meaning cleaning staff and other contractors working in affected government departments and agencies will only be paid if their contracting firm has budgeted for this.

“Excepted” employees are defined as those “who protect life and property”. These essential workers continue in their jobs during the shutdown but won’t be paid until the shutdown ends.

Each agency has already been required to submit its own staffing plan in the event of a government shutdown.

The funding lapse could lead to approximately 750,000 federal employees being furloughed each day of the shutdown, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). This would result in a daily loss of about $400m in wages, it said.

Many of these people may not return to their jobs, however. While the US government has faced dozens of shutdowns before the current one – and federal employees have been furloughed – the White House instructed government agencies to prepare for large-scale layoffs of federal workers in this case, via a memo from the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on September 24.

What does ‘furlough’ mean, and how do people pay bills in the meantime?

To be furloughed means to be suspended or discharged for a period of time without pay.

“When you’re furloughed, you’re on leave without pay, just as you might remember that many people were furloughed during the pandemic,” Scott Lucas, a professor of US and international politics at the Ireland-based University College Dublin’s Clinton Institute, told Al Jazeera.

“In this case, however, if you’re without pay, there’s also no federal support payments to cover this.”

Two years into Trump’s first term, in December 2018, a 35-day partial government shutdown occurred – the longest in modern US history – after Congress again failed to agree on government funding. Nine federal departments were fully or partially closed: agriculture, commerce, homeland security, housing and urban development, interior, justice, state, transportation and treasury.

Lucas explained that during that shutdown, many people were forced to take out loans or rely on family and friends to get by. Lucas added that some people went to food banks, which are nonprofit charitable organisations that store surplus amounts of food to distribute to those struggling financially.

“There’s no real safety net for what takes place. So that’s an immediate human cost of what’s going on here,” Lucas said.

What will stay open and what will shut down?

Here is what will happen to different government agencies and other services in the US during the shutdown.

The Social Security Administration will continue to issue disability and retirement benefits since it is funded by mandatory spending. However, it will furlough 12 percent of its staff and put all marketing campaigns on pause, according to its shutdown plan.

Medicare and Medicaid will also continue functioning during the shutdown, since they are also funded by mandatory spending.

The FBI, CIA, Drug Enforcement Administration, Coast Guard and other federal law enforcement agencies will continue to operate during the shutdown, and employees will stay on the job but will be unpaid until the shutdown comes to an end.

The US Postal Service, which earns its revenue from its services and is not funded by tax money, will continue operations during the shutdown. Post offices will remain open.

The International Revenue Service (IRS) will remain fully staffed for the first five days of the shutdown. The agency’s strategy does not detail what will happen to its staff if the shutdown lasts longer than five days. This year, the IRS lost about a quarter of its staff, many as a result of layoffs ordered by the Trump administration, and now employs approximately 75,000 people.

More than 13,000 air traffic controllers will continue to work during the shutdown. However, they will not get paid until the shutdown ends, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). There are more than 14,000 air traffic controllers in the US, according to the FAA website. Most Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees will also continue working.

Courts could run out of funds to remain fully operational as early as Friday, the federal judiciary warned last week. This marks a shift from the last shutdown during Trump’s first term, when courts stayed open for five weeks.

During the shutdown, the two million US military personnel will remain on duty without pay until it ends, and National Guard forces deployed to cities by Trump will also continue working. Trump has ordered the Department of Defense to rename itself the Department of War, but this requires congressional approval.

Most Justice Department staff overseeing the running of immigration courts will continue working, as Trump has declared illegal migration a “national emergency”, according to a statement released by the department.

Employees who coordinate with state and local officials to order immigrant arrests will also remain on the job. Border patrol, immigration enforcement agents and most customs officers will stay at their posts, according to Department of Homeland Security’s shutdown strategy.

The Small Business Administration will furlough 24 percent of its staff, according to its statement.

About 4,000 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) employees will be furloughed, according to the agency. However, FEMA has about $2.3bn in its Disaster Relief Fund as of September 15, to respond to a disaster such as a major hurricane.

US Customs and Border Protection tariff collections will continue, the Department of Homeland Security said on Tuesday. It also said operations funded by US Citizenship and Immigration Services fees would continue, along with services and operations essential for the running of the agency’s exempt activities.

Will Democrats compromise over Medicare cuts in order to resolve this?

It does not seem likely that the Democrats will compromise on their demands for Medicare cuts to be reversed – or for Medicaid subsidies to be extended beyond the end of this year – in order to get government operations up and running again.

When the White House released its memo informing agencies that staff will be laid off, not just furloughed, it earned condemnation from Democratic leaders in Congress.

“This is an attempt at intimidation,” Schumer wrote in response to the memo on X on September 25. Jeffries responded as well, posting on X on the same day: “We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings.”

Lucas said that one reason the Democrats are unlikely to fold now is that “a lot of Democrats wanted to hold the Trump administration to account back in March because the Trump administration was already running roughshod through the government”.

Back then, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was laying off hundreds of thousands of government employees in its bid to cut government spending. Agencies such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID) were shut down completely, a move ruled unconstitutional by US District Court Judge Theodore Chuang. The Trump administration also cut back on research funding in areas such as medical care and the environment.

What else could Trump do during the shutdown?

Trump has taken aim at the Democrats, whom he blames for this shutdown.

“So we’d be laying off a lot of people that are going to be very affected. And they’re Democrats, they’re going to be Democrats,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday.

He added that a “lot of good can come down from shutdowns” and suggested that he could make use of the shutdown to “get rid of a lot of things we didn’t want, and they’d be Democrat things”.

Lucas speculated that Trump is likely referring to US government programmes and departments here. Earlier this year, he signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. However, congressional approval would normally be required for this.

Trump could use the shutdown as an opportunity to find ways to push ahead with such plans. “He’ll label them as ‘Democrat’, whether it means closing agencies, trying to shut down the Department of Education, whether it is completely gutting the ability of other agencies to operate,” Lucas said.

Lucas added that this could also mean undermining the operations of agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, which has now largely become a “tool for the fossil fuel industry”, or the Justice Department’s Office of Civil Rights, which has been “neutered” because its focus has been redirected to “going after Trump’s enemies”.

“It’s anything that doesn’t suit his particular vision of his power. He goes after it. He kills it or he makes it loyal to him. That’s his vision.”

Trump could well use a shutdown to dismantle government functions, Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit focused on improving the federal government, was quoted as saying by PolitiFact.

If lawmakers can’t reach a deal, Stier said, Trump “will have enormous latitude to determine which services, programmes and employees can be sidelined – decisions that could go far beyond what has occurred during past shutdowns”.

How have markets responded to the US government shutdown?

Markets were braced for the shock and have, therefore, remained stable, experts say. The US’s three major stock indices – the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq – closed with slight increases on Tuesday.

“I think that’s in part because they priced in the fact that they thought a shutdown was going to be likely and it’s also because of other factors that they’re watching that are affecting global portfolios, as well as their investments in the US,” Lucas said.

“The markets have had to get used to Trump’s unpredictability and chaos across a number of issues and what you have is, is the shutdown on top of the tariff chaos, on top of his measures that threatened to increase inflation, on par with the measures that threaten recession.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_68dd019f-1759314335.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-01 10:56:55.733885

And because disparate impact often involves company-wide or industry-wide policies, the number of people affected is usually larger than an individual discrimination complaint.","The U.S. civil rights agency responsible for enforcing worker rights will stop investigating complaints about company policies that don’t explicitly discriminate but may disproportionately harm certain groups, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press.

The memo, emailed to all area, local and district office directors of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Sept. 15, says that the agency will discharge by Tuesday any complaints based on “disparate impact liability,” a legal concept that argues that even if a policy looks fair on the surface, it can still be discriminatory if it creates unnecessary barriers that make it harder for certain groups of people to succeed.

The EEOC’s decision to drop such cases aligns with President Donald Trump’s April executive order directing federal agencies to deprioritize the use of disparate impact in civil rights enforcement because it encourages the assumption that any racial imbalance in the workforce is a result of discrimination, which creates undue burden on businesses.

The move marks a significant shift in EEOC enforcement, and critics say it weakens an effective legal tool used to root out workplace discrimination. That’s especially true when it comes to addressing algorithmic bias as more employers rely on AI in the hiring process.

Since AI draws on large amounts of data to generate results, it can replicate the patterns of inequality even if it’s not programmed to do so. In one infamous example, Amazon developed a resume-scanning tool to recruit top talent, but abandoned it after finding it favored men for technical roles — in part because it was comparing job candidates against the company’s own male-dominated tech workforce.

“As AI is becoming more and more popular, it’s particularly important that we have the disparate impact tools available to be able to police it and make sure it’s not being used to resegregate the workforce,” said civil rights and plaintiff-side employment attorney Christine Webber.

Historically, discrimination claims invoking disparate impact have been less common than those alleging intentional discrimination, known as disparate treatment. But in AI systems, discrimination is more likely to occur in the disparate impact context, said Littler attorney Bradford Kelley, who was chief counsel to former Republican EEOC Commissioner Keith Sonderling.

Kelley said companies should still be concerned that their algorithms could invite disparate impact complaints, noting that many states and local authorities have their own laws and regulations.

“The risk is still there,” he said.

Despite its modern-day applications, the idea of disparate impact is not new: It has been an established part of U.S. civil rights law for decades, and has helped stop unfair practices that keep minorities, women, people with disabilities, older adults, and others from getting jobs, loans, or equal pay.

The EEOC memo cites Trump’s executive order arguing that disparate impact has become a “key tool” of a “pernicious movement” that threatens meritocracy in favor of “racial balancing” in the workforce, and instructs districts to compile a list of pending disparate impact cases, then close them by Tuesday. Workers who submitted complaints solely on these grounds will receive a notice from the agency saying they can pursue the case in court on their own if they wish.

The EEOC declined to comment on the memo, citing that its contents are privileged. But a spokesperson said that as an executive branch agency, the EEOC “will fully and robustly comply with all Executive Orders” and that it “continues to fulfill its statutory obligation of accepting all charges of discrimination from all charging parties and serving all charges of discrimination on the relevant employer, regardless of the theory of discrimination alleged.”

Webber said the EEOC’s decision not to pursue these investigations “definitely erects an unnecessary hurdle” for workers who filed complaints, and now no longer get the benefit of a publicly-funded investigation, which can be difficult and costly. Unlike private lawyers, the EEOC has the ability to compel employers to provide information early in the process.

Former EEOC general counsel Karla Gilbride, who was fired in January alongside two Democratic commissioners, said she was “disturbed” by the agency’s decision to close charges based on their category, not the facts and evidence.

And because disparate impact often involves company-wide or industry-wide policies, the number of people affected is usually larger than an individual discrimination complaint.

“You’re talking about thousands of people who could be affected by this,” added former EEOC commissioner Chai Feldblum.

Despite the EEOC’s new stance, some businesses are proactively addressing potential bias. Job search website Indeed, for example, recently developed a virtual hiring assistant using generative AI aimed at helping employers find and connect with talent, according to senior product director Heidi Laki.

She said a core tenet of building out that product is ensuring AI is used responsibly — and conducting both disparate impact and disparate treatment analyses to “make sure that we don’t have outcomes that disproportionately affect populations.”

And following the EEOC’s shift in enforcement, “we are maintaining all of our responsible AI analysis that we had before,” Laki said. ________",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/c2a60f7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2846x1601+0+422/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fc1%2F5d%2F1922374f57ae36ffc0f970792186%2Fdc59e6f1ffa44eaf9fad432e66238715,N,,2025-10-01 09:57:36.592394

Roughly 750,000 federal workers are expected to be furloughed, some potentially fired by the Trump administration. Many offices will be shuttered, perhaps permanently, as President Donald Trump vows to “do things that are irreversible, that are bad” as retribution.

Other functions — like NASA’s space missions, President Trump’s immigration crackdown and certain public health work at FDA and the USDA — would continue.

It’s the first government shutdown since 2018, in Trump’s first term, which was the longest ever at 34 days, lasting into early 2019. As of Wednesday morning, there was no clear path to a resolution, with the two sides fundamentally at odds over how to resolve the impasse.

The Republican Party controls both chambers of Congress, but it needs Democratic support to pass a bill in the Senate, where 60 votes are required. The two parties failed to craft a bipartisan bill, with the Senate rejecting both a GOP proposal and a Democratic proposal just hours before the shutdown deadline.

Here's a breakdown of what happened, what is expected, and how the shutdown could impact you.

Politics

Why is the U.S. government shutdown?

Republicans supported a short-term measure to fund the government generally at current levels through Nov. 21, but Democrats blocked it, insisting the measure address their concerns on health care. They want to reverse the Medicaid cuts in President Trump’s 'mega-bill ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" passed this summer and extend tax credits that make health insurance premiums more affordable for millions of people who purchase through the marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act.

Republicans called the Democratic proposal a nonstarter that would cost taxpayers more than $1 trillion.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has said Republicans are happy to discuss the health care issue with Democrats — but not as part of talks to keep the government open. More votes are expected Wednesday.

“What the government spends money on is a demonstration of our country’s priorities,” said Rachel Snyderman, a former White House budget official who is the managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington.

What happens in a shut down?

Now that a lapse in funding has occurred, the law requires agencies to furlough their “non-excepted” employees. Excepted employees, which include those who work to protect life and property, stay on the job but don’t get paid until after the shutdown ends.

The White House Office of Management and Budget begins the process with instructions to agencies that a lapse in appropriations has occurred and they should initiate orderly shutdown activities. That memo went out Tuesday evening.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates that roughly 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed each day of the shutdown, with the total daily cost of their compensation at roughly $400 million.

What’s staying open and shutting down

Overall, each federal agency develops its own shutdown plan. The plans outline which workers would stay on the job during a shutdown, and which would be furloughed.

Health and healthcare

The Medicare and Medicaid health care programs are expected to continue, though staffing shortages could mean delays for some services. Social Security payments still go out, and seniors relying on Medicare coverage can still see their doctors and health care providers can be reimbursed.

But Trump has warned that the administration could focus on programs that are important to Democrats, “cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.”

Health and Human Services will furlough about 41% of its staff out of nearly 80,000 employees, according to a contingency plan posted on its website.

As part of that plan, the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would continue to monitor disease outbreaks, while activities that will stop include research into health risks and ways to prevent illness.

Meanwhile, research and patient care at the National Institutes of Health would be upended. Patients currently enrolled in studies at the research-only hospital nicknamed the “house of hope” will continue to receive care. Additional sick patients hoping for access to experimental therapies can’t enroll except in special circumstances, and no new studies will begin.

Most of the Food and Drug Administration’s core responsibilities would continue, including responding to public health threats and managing product recalls and drug shortages.

Some routine activities, including previously scheduled inspections of company manufacturing plants, will be halted. But the agency will continue to conduct inspections when it has reason to suspect a problem that could endanger consumers.

Government activities that ensure the immediate safety of the food supply will continue, including food recalls, investigations and inspections of imports. But longer-term food safety efforts, including initiatives aimed at reducing foodborne illnesses, would be paused.

About 86% of the agency’s staff would remain on the job because their work is deemed essential or they are funded by non-federal sources, according to the administration’s shutdown plan. FDA scientists who review drugs, medical devices and tobacco products are mostly or entirely funded by company fees, not the federal government.

Parks and museums

As agencies sort out which workers are essential, or not, Smithsonian museums are expected to stay open at least until Monday. A group of former national park superintendents urged the Trump administration to close the parks to visitors, arguing that poorly staffed parks in a shutdown are a danger to the public and put park resources at risk.

FEMA

While FEMA’s core disaster relief functions would not be affected, at least in the short term, other aspects of the agency’s work would be impacted. Some grant approvals would be paused, and no new policies could be written under the National Flood Insurance Program, halting new mortgages that require flood insurance.

Air Traffic Control and Airports

Air traffic controllers already certified and on the job would be among the essential workers who would continue during any shutdown but their pay could be affected.

National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels has said that having to work without a paycheck adds stress to controllers who already do a difficult job. He said that in past shutdowns some controllers have even had to get side jobs to help pay bills while the shutdown drug on.

Capt. Jason Ambrosi, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, urged Congress to reach an agreement. “A shutdown threatens the stability of the safest aviation system in the world,” Ambrosi said.

At Airports, TSA agents would likely be required to work without pay until the shutdown ends.

Homeland Security and Immigration

Most Department of Homeland Security employees would continue to work, because much of the department’s workforce is connected to law enforcement or works in areas funded by user fees as opposed to Congressional appropriations.

In a message posted to X early Wednesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said there was no change to immigration laws or enforcement during a shutdown.

USPS

You'll still get mail delivered, and post offices will remain open. The U.S. Postal Service is unaffected by a government shutdown. It’s an independent entity funded through the sale of its products and services, not by tax dollars.

Impact on the economy

Impact on the economy

Phillip Swagel, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said a short shutdown doesn’t have a huge impact on the economy, especially since federal workers, by law, are paid retroactively. But “if a shutdown continues, then that can give rise to uncertainties about what is the role of government in our society, and what’s the financial impact on all the programs that the government funds.”

“The impact is not immediate, but over time, there is a negative impact of a shutdown on the economy,” he added.

Markets haven’t reacted strongly to past shutdowns, according to Goldman Sachs Research. At the close of the three prolonged shutdowns since the early 1990s, equity markets finished flat or up even after dipping initially.

A governmentwide shutdown would directly reduce growth by around 0.15 percentage points for each week it lasted, or about 0.2 percentage points per week once private-sector effects were included, and growth would rise by the same cumulative amount in the quarter following reopening, writes Alec Phillips, chief U.S. political economist at Goldman Sachs.

Will furloughed federal workers get paid?

Yes. In 2019, Congress passed a bill enshrining into law the requirement that furloughed employees get retroactive pay once operations resume.

While they’ll eventually get paid, the furloughed workers and those who remain on the job may have to go without one or more of their regular paychecks, depending upon how long the shutdown lasts, creating financial stress for many families.

Service members would also receive back pay for any missed paychecks once federal funding resumes.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/250930-capitol-getty.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-01 10:57:00.122821

Federal agents have used chemical agents, including pepper spray and tear gas, in plain sight to disperse Chicago protesters blocking immigration enforcement vehicles.","BROADVIEW, IL – Katrina Thompson, mayor of the small village outside Chicago home to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, is slamming federal agents for heavy-handed tactics, saying their presence in the area amounts to a ""siege.""

""You are making war on my community. And it has to stop,"" Thompson said, in a letter addressed to Department of Homeland Security Field Office Director Russell Hott. ""Beleaguered Broadview residents are begging for relief from your center's siege of our neighborhood.""

Thompson held a news conference at the Village Hall to call for relief. President Donald Trump’s Chicago-area immigration enforcement crackdown known as Operation Midway Blitz has transformed Broadview. The small village of some 8,000 people is home to the region’s main immigration enforcement facility and it has become a hotbed of clashes between federal agents and anti-immigration enforcement protesters.

Tense moments between the two sides have frequently ended with federal agents deploying chemical agents and other crowd control tactics on protesters as well as journalists. Broadview officials say federal agents are initiating some confrontations without provocation and village police are investigating immigration enforcement agents for three separate criminal cases.

""A lot of rhetoric comes from the White House about being tough on crime, but from where I sit, ICE has generated criminal activity in Broadview,"" Thompson told reporters.

Police Chief Thomas Mills also told reporters that federal agents ""verbally assaulted"" him when he confronted them about the aggressive tactics. He said agents, using profanity, told him they would bring chaos to the village in response.

In a statement to USA TODAY, Homeland Security officials said Broadview leaders were attempting to ""smear"" the agency and vehemently denied making the profanity-laced comment to Broadview police.

Thompson responded, saying she trusted the word of the village’s top cop.

""The Department of Homeland Security is running a disinformation campaign that would make even the Russians blush,"" the mayor said.

Spiraling tensions in Broadview come about three weeks into Trump’s blitz operation. The president says the crackdown is aimed at catching ""the worst of the worst"" immigrant criminals. Illinois leaders say the White House is preparing a power grab in the region.

Tear gas, pepper spray fallout hits neighborhoods

The immigration enforcement facility in Broadview lies on an industrial strip surrounded by residential streets, where trim lawns and towering Halloween skeletons make the neighborhoods look like any other in suburban America.

But the smell of tear gas lingering in the air signals the place isn’t as peaceful as it seems.

""Absolutely nobody in Broadview or the neighborhood around wants this here,"" Silas Lopez, a local resident, said of the immigration enforcement facility. The 20-year-old told USA TODAY gases have left him out of breath at points. He worries what impact the fumes will have on his younger siblings: ""The wind blows it right into the neighborhood.""

Thompson said village residents have been emailing, calling and showing up in person to complain about the impact the facility is having on the area.

Many residents also complain that protesters are taking up parking.

""I’m glad to see protests as long as it doesn’t get violent,"" Lonzia Casteel, a nearby resident, told USA TODAY. ""But, man, there’s cars parked everywhere.""

Rioters or protests?

Department of Homeland Security officials say immigration agents are appropriately under tough conditions.

""These rioters are laying siege and interfering with legitimate law enforcement operations,"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons said in a letter addressed to Thompson. ""Failure to provide relief makes you a party to the obstruction of justice. There will be no change in our operational posture until these unlawful activities cease. The only siege in Broadview is the one being waged against the United States government.""

Homeland Security officials say they have arrested 34 people in connection with the protests, including three who had loaded guns. Agency officials did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the people arrested.

Agency officials also distanced themselves from criminal allegations made by Broadview police who are investigating federal agents in connection with two hit-and-run incidents and in connection with damage done to the property of a news reporter’s vehicle.

""Less than a week after a terrorist attack at an ICE facility in Dallas, Mayor Katrina Thompson, Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills, and Acting Fire Chief Matt Martin chose to smear ICE and launch a bogus criminal investigation into our brave ICE law enforcement,"" said agency spokesperson Emily Covington. ""It’s disheartening that even after the terrorist attack and arrests of rioters with guns outside the Broadview ICE facility, these sanctuary politicians chose to engage in political theatre to inflame hatred of ICE.""

Federal agents have used chemical agents, including pepper spray and tear gas, in plain sight to disperse Chicago protesters blocking immigration enforcement vehicles.

Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador was also fatally shot in the attack, ICE said in a statement.

Gauffeny said her husband was shackled and restrained in his hospital bed after being shot, his face was swollen and he had staples in his forehead with dried blood on his face, neck and bedsheets. He had been shot about eight times in the shoulder, stomach, tailbone and neck, causing a stroke.

Tighter family rules, work visas

The law sets a two-year period of legal residence before immigrants can apply to bring in spouses.

Couples who were together for more than a year before moving can apply after a year. Children under 18 and dependants with disabilities can join regardless of the applicant’s residency period.

Job-search visas will be reserved for highly skilled workers. Another measure ends a pathway that had allowed Brazilians – the country’s largest immigrant group, with over 450,000 people – to regularise their status after entering on tourist visas.

“The Missouri National Guard is uniquely equipped to provide this essential administrative support, and we are confident their contributions will be invaluable to immigration enforcement efforts.
That involved Trump nationalizing the California National Guard and having the troops protect ICE facilities from protesters.
“This is not a force protection mission,” said Hardwick, who is a member of the Missouri National Guard but was speaking in his capacity as a state lawmaker.
“Missouri's National Guard exists to protect Missourians in times of crisis, like floods, tornadoes, natural disasters,"" Reed said.","Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe is dispatching the Missouri National Guard to support President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts.

The Republican governor announced on Tuesday that, starting on Wednesday, members of the Missouri National Guard will “assist with administrative, clerical, and logistical duties at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facilities within the State of Missouri.”

“Public safety, keeping Missourians safe, and upholding the rule of law is our administration's top priority,” Kehoe said in a statement. “The Missouri National Guard is uniquely equipped to provide this essential administrative support, and we are confident their contributions will be invaluable to immigration enforcement efforts. Missouri is proud to join in the Trump administration's efforts to keep our state and nation secure.”

Kehoe’s move comes as the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics are garnering a broader public outcry, most notably this week in Chicago. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has called on Chicago residents to film ICE personnel spotted downtown.

When asked if the Missouri National Guard will protect ICE facilities or ICE personnel detaining people who are suspected in being in the country unlawfully, Kehoe spokeswoman Gabby Picard said members of the Guard will assist “with tasks such as data entry, case management, and logistical support, enabling ICE personnel to focus on core enforcement and security functions.”

Picard said 15 members of the Missouri National Guard will participate in the mission.

State Rep. Bill Hardwick, R-Pulaski County, said Kehoe’s mission is not a deployment and is markedly different from what occurred earlier this year in Los Angeles. That involved Trump nationalizing the California National Guard and having the troops protect ICE facilities from protesters.

“This is not a force protection mission,” said Hardwick, who is a member of the Missouri National Guard but was speaking in his capacity as a state lawmaker.

He also said that the members of the Guard who volunteer to undertake this mission will be under Kehoe’s command – not Trump’s.

“I think what the governor is doing is a good thing,” Hardwick said. “I think it's a good opportunity for soldiers to get experience and to do a good job.”

Kehoe’s decision drew criticism from Democratic state Rep. Ray Reed, D-St. Louis County, who contended that the GOP governor should not be helping Trump with his immigration policies.

“Missouri's National Guard exists to protect Missourians in times of crisis, like floods, tornadoes, natural disasters,"" Reed said. “It’s really like just political theater designed to score some points with Donald Trump, not really actions that make communities across Missouri any safer.”

Although members of the Guard are voluntarily signing up for this mission and will focus on administrative work, Reed still said their energies would be best expended elsewhere.

“They're heroes who generally answer the call to help the state and our darkest hours,” Reed said. “They sign up to protect their neighbors, not do clerical work for Trump's broken immigration system.”

Kehoe’s office said that Missouri National Guard personnel assigned for the mission were selected on a volunteer basis and that their efforts to assist ICE will last until Sept. 30, 2026.

However, the CJEU judgment ensures these parameters will probably be subject to considerable challenge in the courts.
This is exactly what the 16 Member States that intervened in the CJEU case were afraid of, he believes.","A recent judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on Italy’s plan to process asylum applications offshore has provided migrants with crucial legal protection.

The judgment, published in August, concerns the principle of ‘safe countries of origin’ and affects Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s agreement with Albania, a non-EU country. Italy’s scheme is designed to repatriate migrants who have been picked up in the Mediterranean. ‘The CJEU judgment is the natural consequence of this latest attempt by a national government to outsource asylum processing and decide for itself – without the right to challenge – what is a “safe” country,’ says Alex Stojicevic, an officer of the IBA Immigration and Nationality Law Committee.

It’s the second and third elements of the CJEU’s judgment that appear set to provide legal protection for migrants, and in part explain why 16 EU Member States intervened in the case. The CJEU found that schemes such as that put in place by Italy will only be lawful to the extent that the process, and the designation by a Member State as to what is and isn’t a ‘safe’ country, can be properly and effectively challenged in the courts. Further, the sources of information, the data and evidence relied upon to reach any decision around the safety of a country must be accessible.

The immediate consequence for Italy is that the Albanian detention centre will be, for now, under-used. Ultimately, the new EU Pact will substantially increase the parameters of what might be considered a safe country for repatriating irregular migrants and thus provides Member States with greater room for manoeuvre to do so.

However, the CJEU judgment ensures these parameters will probably be subject to considerable challenge in the courts. ‘The buried treasure in the [CJEU judgment] is the effectiveness of a challenge, and access to documents,’ says Steve Peers, a professor of EU and human rights law at Royal Holloway, University of London. ‘With the new EU Pact, it might be easier to say a country is safe but it will be easier to challenge this in individual cases.’

Peers believes those challenges will probably turn into a debate about, for instance, the client’s religion or sexuality and a country’s treatment of this category. This is exactly what the 16 Member States that intervened in the CJEU case were afraid of, he believes. ‘As they see it, their internal procedures will be clogged up with legal challenges,’ says Peers.

According to Meloni, the CJEU is ‘claiming jurisdiction that does not belong to it […] The European Court of Justice has decided to delegate to any national judge the decision […] on the part of migration policy relating to the repatriation and expulsion of illegal immigrants.’

In the UK in August, a local council was successful in its application to the High Court to have a hotel in Epping, near to London, banned from housing irregular immigrants. The ruling was however overturned at the Court of Appeal. What followed was criticism, including by a senior lawmaker, of the judges involved in this and other immigration cases. The suggestion was that their backgrounds and personal views were influencing their rulings.

A major concern is that this rhetoric against the judiciary undermines the rule of law. ‘Over time, this position erodes the view that the courts are legitimate,’ says Stojicevic, who’s also Managing Partner at MKS Immigration Lawyers in Vancouver.

Despite the CJEU judgment, the combination of the new EU Pact coming into effect and a European Parliament that’s more hardline in its attitude to immigration means the EU appears set to take an increasingly restrictive approach on the issue. ‘We could see the Pact develop such that whole countries are declared safe and the rules being re-written to make it difficult to challenge that,’ says Stojicevic. The EU might even consider deportations, which ‘are a feature of the Canadian and Australian systems and, as we well know, are looked on favourably in the US right now,’ he adds.

Subsequent executive orders from Trump prompted states to begin sharing their voter data with federal agencies, the plaintiffs argue.","The Trump administration is breaking the law with its intra-agency efforts to cull protected personal information from millions of Americans to support its immigration and political motives, according to a lawsuit that privacy and voter advocates filed Tuesday in federal court.

The plaintiffs are seeking a class action designation to add more parties to their case.

Filed in the District of Columbia, the complaint alleges the Department of Homeland Security has created an illegal national citizenship database through its Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system. At least four states are using SAVE data to review voter rolls, even though it relies on Social Security data the agency considers unreliable, the lawsuit alleges.

The first state to plug into the SAVE system was Louisiana, where Secretary of State Nancy Landry announced Sept. 4 that she used the new database to scour state voting records going back to the 1980s. Her review found 390 noncitizen registered voters, including 79 who she said voted in at least one election over the past several decades.

The 390 voters in question represent 0.01% of all registered voters in Louisiana, though Landry acknowledged the possibility that some of her findings could be in error or attributed to outdated information.

“The consolidation and unlawful use of Louisianans’ sensitive data without our knowledge is alarming and terrifying,” M. Christian Green, president of the League of Women Voters of Louisiana, said in a statement.

Green’s chapter, its counterpart in Virginia and the national League of Women Voters are plaintiffs in the lawsuit with the Electronic Privacy Information Center and five individuals identified as J. Doe.

J. Doe 4 is a Louisiana voter who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014, according to the lawsuit. The court filing also claims that Social Security records incorrectly state that J. Doe 4 is not a U.S. citizen.

Defendants in the case are the Department of Homeland Security and its leader, Kristi Noem, the Social Security Administration and its commissioner, Frank Bisignano, the U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Trump administration officials have yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit.

The plaintiffs say the Trump administration has violated multiple federal laws by combining various government sources to form a national “Data Lake” under U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a subagency of Homeland Security. In addition, the lawsuit claims the separation of powers provision in the Constitution was violated when the executive branch chose to usurp Congress’ authority over elections.

The alleged violations include the Privacy Act, approved in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal and amended in 1988 through the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act. The advocacy groups say the Trump administration has ignored prohibitions against disclosing, combining and comparing data from different federal agencies beyond allowed exceptions.

“Unfortunately, the Defendants in this case are ignoring these laws to create comprehensive databases of American citizens’ data …” the lawsuit reads. “The Plaintiffs in this case include a proposed class of millions of American citizens and permanent residents whose records have been unlawfully pooled into new or revised centralized records systems.”

The alleged violations began with the formation of the Department of Governmental Efficiency through an executive order from President Donald Trump, according to the lawsuit. DOGE initiated a “government-wide consolidation of sensitive personal data” that culminated with the approval of the SAVE system. Subsequent executive orders from Trump prompted states to begin sharing their voter data with federal agencies, the plaintiffs argue.

Without evidence to support his claims, Trump has repeatedly alleged widespread fraud took place in the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. The states that have willingly joined the president’s SAVE campaign are Republican led, while Democratic state leaders are fighting the Justice Department’s attempts to compel them to share voter data.

The prime minister blamed the impact of Brexit for the surge in the number of illegal Channel crossings.
He was wrong about that,” Starmer told GB News.
Reform UK has pledged to scrap indefinite leave to remain, which would put hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants with that status at risk of deportation.
Starmer told Sky News that the announcement had made minorities in the UK feel a “shiver down their throat”.","Keir Starmer has said he will look at how international law is being interpreted by British courts in an effort to tackle small boats, which he labelled “Farage boats” because of their increase in number since Brexit.

Speaking after the Labour party conference, the prime minister signalled his unhappiness with how the European convention on human rights was being interpreted by judges making decisions about deportations. But he defended the UK’s membership of the ECHR, saying that ministers “need to look again at the interpretation of some of these provisions, not tear them down”.

Starmer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that while “those genuinely fleeing persecution should be afforded asylum … mass migration in a way that we have not seen in previous years”.

The prime minister blamed the impact of Brexit for the surge in the number of illegal Channel crossings. “These are Farage boats, in many senses, that are coming across the Channel,” he said.

Before leaving the EU, the UK was a signatory to the Dublin convention, which states that asylum seekers can be returned to the first member state they arrived in before their claims are considered.

The number of small boat crossings have risen dramatically since Brexit was implemented in 2020, according to Home Office figures. More than 33,000 people have arrived in the UK so far this year, a record since data was first reported in 2018.

“I would gently point out to Nigel Farage and others that before we left the EU, we had a returns agreement with every country in the EU and he told the country it would make no difference if we left. He was wrong about that,” Starmer told GB News.

He added that the government needed to “ramp up” its new returns agreement to send migrants who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for people with genuine asylum cases who have not attempted to cross.

Pressed for details about what was blocking deportations of foreign criminals, Starmer cited articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR, which ban torture and protect the right to private and family life respectively.

Ministers have expressed concerns previously that both articles are being interpreted too broadly by judges when deciding whether someone convicted of a crime can be deported to their country of origin.

Starmer was speaking following the conclusion of Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool, where he made a speech criticising Farage as someone who had never “liked or believed in Britain”.

He said the country was facing an “era-defining choice” between Labour and the populist right and questioned whether Reform UK loved “our beautiful, tolerant, diverse country” or simply wanted to “stir the pot of division because that’s worked in their interests”.

Speaking to broadcasters afterwards, Starmer said he did not think Farage was himself racist but reiterated that his latest immigration policy was.

Reform UK has pledged to scrap indefinite leave to remain, which would put hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants with that status at risk of deportation. Starmer told Sky News that the announcement had made minorities in the UK feel a “shiver down their throat”.

Farage attacked Starmer following his conference speech and said he was putting Reform UK activists at risk by accusing the party of championing a racist policy.

David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, rowed back on his claim on Tuesday that Farage had “flirted with Hitler Youth”, a statement apparently referring to allegations from 2013 that the Reform leader had sung Nazi songs as a schoolboy. Farage denied the allegations at the time.

Pat McFadden, the work and pensions secretary, said on Wednesday morning that Starmer had “shown real fightback” and “drawn a line” under the questions over his leadership that had overshadowed the lead-up to the conference.

“​There were plenty of them. I think it’s a different feeling at the end of the conference compared with the beginning,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live. “We had a couple of difficult stories and resignations in the early part of September in the run-up to the conference and I think the prime minister with his speech yesterday has drawn a line under that, shown real fightback and also importantly a real belief in what makes Britain great.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92324448aea49a85a5823791f1e2d4f3b37ae0f0/614_1417_4389_3511/master/4389.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b30d9cb238187c18dd8e70185411a73a",N,,2025-10-01 06:58:16.095900

Those laws employed seemingly neutral language, applying to individuals “ineligible for citizenship,” to target Asian immigrants and bar them from purchasing land.
Chin and others say Ohio’s “foreign adversaries” provision is another broad framing calibrated to achieve targeted ends.
In February last year, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals put Florida’s law barring foreign land ownership on hold.
She’s specifically concerned that the Ohio Secretary of State would regularly update the list of foreign adversaries.","This past weekend more than a hundred Ohioans demonstrated outside the Statehouse against a pair of bills that could effectively outlaw some immigrants from owning land in the state.

Ohio House Bill 1 and Ohio Senate Bill 88, prohibit citizens of countries designated “foreign adversaries” from owning land within 25 miles of “critical infrastructure.”

Although people from a variety of backgrounds spoke at the event, the effort is being led by people of Chinese descent. They note that the measure is meant to restrict their ability to own a home or a business.

Ying Wu described herself as a mother from Dublin, and “an Ohioan by choice.”

She explained that after her husband finished his medical training, they had several options on where they could live. They chose Ohio because they saw it as a good place to raise a family.

“This is not just where we live, it’s who we are,” she said. “But lately, this promise feels fragile.”

“Bills like HB 1 and SB 88 don’t see the life we built,” she went on. “They look at our family and see a label. They listen to our story, and they hear an accent. They send a message to us: You will always be other. You do not belong.”

The bills’ sponsors pitch their plan as a national security consideration, but critics like Wu say the proposals attempt to codify racism.

For instance, state law defines critical infrastructure so broadly — extending to power lines, telephone poles, and sewage pipes — that effectively the entire state would be off-limits.

Opponents see Ohio’s proposal, and similar efforts in states like Florida, as a return to the so-called alien land laws that sprung up in 1900s.

Those laws employed seemingly neutral language, applying to individuals “ineligible for citizenship,” to target Asian immigrants and bar them from purchasing land.

“While these laws did not explicitly target Asians, the purpose behind them was very clear,” explained Abby Chin, past president of the Asian Pacific American Bar Association of Central Ohio.

Chin and others say Ohio’s “foreign adversaries” provision is another broad framing calibrated to achieve targeted ends.

Although the restrictions would likely apply to citizens of Iran, North Korea, and Russia, the sponsors make no secret that their primary concern is immigrants from China.

“The People’s Republic of China, Communist China, has not hidden the fact that their goal is not just to compete and outperform the United States, it is to take over the world — they actually meant this,” the bill’s sponsor state Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, claimed in a February committee hearing.

The Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment restricts the government from discriminating based on several protected classes, including national origin and alienage.

In February last year, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals put Florida’s law barring foreign land ownership on hold.

In a concurrence, Judge Nancy Abudu specifically cited the Equal Protection Clause.

Rev. Dan Clark from the United Church of Granville called Ohio’s proposals “legalized xenophobia.”

“It is unconstitutional. It is un-American. It is unfaithful and it is immoral,” he said. “Our Constitution promises more than this. The Fifth Amendment guarantees due process. The 14th guarantees equal protection. The Fair Housing Act outlaws discrimination based on national origin. HB 1 and SB 88 tramples all of these protections.”

In addition to their dubious legality, Chin said the measures are misguided.

Taking a broadbrush approach ignores nuance. Immigrants in Ohio could be refugees or dissidents from a designated country, for instance, he noted.

“These bills equate innocent individuals with the governments of countries that they come from,” she said. “In other words, it sets restrictions without any evidence that the individual has done anything wrong.”

Because Bowling Green State University Professor Louisa Ha is a citizen, the proposals won’t affect her ability to own land. But she’s still worried about how the bills target immigrant communities.

She’s specifically concerned that the Ohio Secretary of State would regularly update the list of foreign adversaries.

“Depending on politics, any other country can be added to that list,” she said, “so all immigrants are vulnerable.”

Far from making the state more safe, Ha said, laws that single out specific communities breed mistrust and hostility.

“As an immigrant, I don’t want to live in a community that sees immigrants as enemies,” Ha said. “I don’t want my children, who grew up and (were) born here and speak English as their first language, (to) be seen as perpetual foreigners in their own country.”

Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian green-card holder and Columbia University student, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, have been fighting deportation proceedings since earlier this year.

Öztürk was arrested by masked federal agents on the streets of Somerville in March, and Mahdawi was detained in April in Vermont at a naturalization interview. Both were released on bail earlier this spring by a pair of federal district court judges in Vermont, who said it was likely their constitutional rights had been violated. Their deportation cases are ongoing in immigration courts.

At issue before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York is the federal government’s appeal of their release on bail by the lower court. In both cases, heard back-to-back Tuesday, the Justice Department argued that the district court did not have the right to weigh in on the detentions of Mahdawi and Öztürk, because Congress has tasked immigration courts with adjudicating immigration cases.

But the two students have argued that they were targeted for political speech in flagrant violation of their First Amendment rights. The government has cited an op-ed Öztürk signed criticizing Israel’s conduct in Gaza in arguing for her removal, and Mahdawi was a high profile pro-Palestinian activist at Columbia University. An attorney for Öztürk argued that it would have been futile to ask immigration authorities for relief, and that the student had no choice but to go to the district court instead.

“Asking the very executive branch that you allege is seeking to weaponize immigration detention to silence you, to release you, is not an adequate substitute for habeas,” ACLU attorney Esha Bhandari, who is representing Öztürk, told the appeals court.

All three Second Circuit judges who heard Tuesday’s appeals were Republican appointees, and two were nominated by President Donald Trump. But one, Steven Menashi, a former Trump White House official whose Senate confirmation stoked controversy, appeared particularly sympathetic to the government’s view.

His colleagues on the court, however — Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston, a George W. Bush appointee, and Judge William Nardini, who was also a Trump nominee — appeared much more skeptical.

Nardini repeatedly grilled Justice Department attorney Tyler Becker, at one point pressing him on whether it was reasonable to tell Öztürk not to ask the district court to intervene immediately and instead wait on the immigration courts, even if those courts did ultimately rule in her favor.

“If she hadn't been released here, or if she were to be returned to custody — well, you know that that could come after a year of detention,” he said. “To say to her, ‘Oh, guess what? You were right. You never should have been detained all along. Sorry about that, but I hope you had a good time for that year.’”

Trump officials have also repeatedly argued that Mahdawi is a threat to the public, citing a 10-year-old Windsor police report in which a local gun shop owner and nearby museum volunteer alleged Mahdawi made violent comments about Jewish people. Mahdawi has denied the allegations, and his lawyers have called them “cartoonishly racist hearsay.”

The incident was investigated by the F.B.I. at the time, but Mahdawi was never charged. His attorney, Michael Tan, also with ACLU, told the appeals court that the fact that the F.B.I. had dropped the matter vindicated his client.

“If the allegations are serious, they would have certainly continued an investigation,” he said.

But Nardini took issue with that, and argued that the F.B.I. dropped cases all the time it could not prove, but considered legitimate. He called it “the one dramatic overstatement, I think, on your side.”

The Mahdawi and Öztürk hearings took place on the same day as another district federal judge, in a separate but related civil case, ruled that the Trump administration was unconstitutionally chilling First Amendment rights on U.S. campuses by initiating deportation proceedings against pro-Palestinian student activists. The case was brought by a group of faculty associations and civil rights groups.

The judge in this case, William Young, began his 161-page ruling with the scan of an anonymous, handwritten note his office had received that asked: “Trump has pardons and tanks… what do you have?”

In remarks after Tuesday’s hearing, Mahdawi recited Young’s reply.

“Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty. Together, We the People of the United States — you and me — have our magnificent Constitution.”

Mahdawi said he urged “every American to sit with this quote.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04e2293/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3880x2037+0+391/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2Fb2%2Fc302c2114606bc85dbe75e96c840%2Fny-mahdawi.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 04:58:08.289918

Protesters filled part of a westbound lane on Wacker Drive near Michigan Avenue. Organizers include the Chicago Teachers Union, the Coalition Against the Trump Agenda, and United Working Families, who say the gathering was a direct response to the Trump administration’s deployment of federal agents to Chicago in recent weeks.

“I’m aghast about what is happening with immigrants and the way they’re being treated, being arrested without warrants. People not knowing what is happening to their loved ones, guns drawn. I’m horrified. That’s not America,” protester Teresa Exner said.

The protest comes as President Donald Trump announced federal troops would soon be sent to Chicago. ICE has also requested 100 National Guard troops to help manage demonstrations that have turned physical in recent weeks.

But the prime minister hasn’t taken anything off the table yet, which is good.
The prime minister is under pressure to go further in his efforts to bring down the number of migrants arriving in Britain via small boats.","Sir Keir Starmer has announced a dramatic U-turn over international human rights laws which have been criticised for making it harder to deport asylum seekers.

The prime minister said the government will review the way British courts apply the controversial European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which could mean asylum seekers are no longer able to avoid being sent back to their home country by claiming they could face torture as a result.

And they may be barred from demanding the right to stay in the UK on the grounds that it would separate them from their families.

The announcement marks another major policy reversal by Sir Keir, a former human rights lawyer, who has defended the ECHR in the past and comes as the prime minister steps up his attacks on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, dubbing the small boats he is trying to stop crossing the English Channel ""Farage boats"".

In an interview with the BBC, Sir Keir denied he is “tearing up” the ECHR but stated: “We need to look again at the interpretation of some of these provisions and we have already begun to do that work in some of our domestic legislation.”

He said the review concerns articles three and eight of the ECHR concerning “cruel and inhumane treatment” in an asylum seeker’s home country and the “right to a family life”.

The government is also reviewing other conventions relating to “refugees, torture and children’s rights”, he said.

“All international instruments have to be applied in circumstances as they are now,” the prime minister said. “We are seeing mass migration in a way we have not seen in previous years. Those genuinely fleeing persecution should be afforded asylum - that is a compassionate act, but we need to look again at the interpretation of some of those provisions - not tear them down but look at the interpretation.”

It comes after Sir Keir laid into Mr Farage’s claims yesterday, saying the Brexiteer had been ""wrong"" to claim that leaving the European Union would make no difference to migration policy, pointing to the Dublin Convention that allowed pre-Brexit Britain to return some asylum seekers to the continent.

Sir Keir told GB News: ""I would gently point out to Nigel Farage and others that before we left the EU, we had a returns agreement with every country in the EU and he told the country it would make no difference if we left. He was wrong about that.

""These are Farage boats, in many senses, that are coming across the Channel.""

The decision to review legislation is a major victory for new home secretary Shabana Mahmood, the Independent understands, who has been lobbying for such action since her appointment.

But it is understood that Ms Mahmood had been concerned by the influence of attorney general Lord Hermer who is very close to the prime minister and is strongly opposed to watering down these rights or changing the law.

A source close to her told The Independent: “She will know if she is successful or screwed on this by Christmas. But the prime minister hasn’t taken anything off the table yet, which is good. It is absolutely necessary to change the law on these four items.”

It came after the prime minister’s speech at Labour’s conference in Liverpool, in which he took the fight to Reform UK and said Nigel Farage, who advocates leaving the ECHR altogether, does not believe in Britain.

Kemi Badenoch is also expected to use the Conservative Party’s annual conference in Manchester to call for Britain to leave the ECHR.

Ministers have previously promised to review how human rights law is applied to immigration after a series of cases, including one in which an Albanian man was able to remain in Britain partly because of his young son’s aversion to foreign chicken nuggets.

The government’s review is focused on how the right to family life is applied.

The prime minister is under pressure to go further in his efforts to bring down the number of migrants arriving in Britain via small boats. Channel crossings are at record levels, with a single dinghy carrying 125 migrants into the UK on Saturday.

The number of migrant arrivals on small boats has topped 33,000 in 2025 so far, marking a record for this point in the year since data on Channel crossings was first reported in 2018. Saturday saw 895 people arrive in 12 boats.

Sir Keir followed his conference speech in Liverpool by insisting Reform leader Mr Farage and his supporters are not racist, despite branding the party’s immigration policy racist and immoral.

The PM told Sky News: “They’re concerned about things like our borders, they’re frustrated about the pace of change. I’m not for a moment suggesting that they are racist.”

And he insisted he was talking about a “particular policy”, claiming Reform’s plans would see migrants who live in the UK lawfully deported, saying “that to me would tear our country apart”.

Responding to the PM and Labour’s conference attacks on him, Mr Farage claimed Sir Keir had incited violence against Reform’s MPs and activists and is “unfit to be the prime minister of our country”.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/01/06/53f5367b40c1027e9169cc8c4cea2f13Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU5MzU2OTM2-2.81820152.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-10-01 04:58:13.009102

Minnesota would lose more than $6.5M if illegal cuts allowed to stand

September 30, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — Minnesota Attorney General Ellison and a coalition of 12 attorneys general today won a temporary restraining order that blocks the Trump Administration from unlawfully reallocating federal homeland security funding away from Minnesota or any state that refuses to comply with Trump's extreme political agenda. The order came in the context of an emergency lawsuit that Attorney General Ellison and the coalition filed yesterday against sudden, politically motivated cuts to homeland security funding to states. If these illegal cuts were allowed to stand, Minnesota would lose more than $6.5 million, or 44% of the dollars the state was slated to receive.

The Trump Administration's first attempt to deny previously nonpartisan homeland security funding to states that refuse to enact his extreme political agenda ended in failure last week. On September 24, Attorney General Ellison and a group of attorneys general secured a permanent injunction along with a court opinion holding that the administration violated the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by conditioning all federal funds from FEMA and DHS on states’ agreement to assist the federal government in enforcing federal immigration priorities.

Despite that permanent injunction, on Saturday, September 27 — without any notice or explanation, and just four days before the end of the federal fiscal year — the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency significantly cut funding to certain states, including Minnesota, that are unwilling to divert local and state law enforcement resources away from core public safety services that protect Minnesotans to enforce federal immigration law, which is a federal responsibility. DHS and FEMA reallocated those funds to other states.

In the lawsuit that Attorney General Ellison and the coalition filed yesterday, they argue that the reallocation of funds is unlawful and violates the federal Administrative Procedure Act.

""It’s outrageous and no longer surprising that the Trump Administration is once again playing politics with the safety of Minnesotans, and I’m grateful the court has once against blocked it,” said Attorney General Ellison. “The court has already permanently blocked Trump and his cronies from compelling Minnesota or any state to divert local law enforcement away from investigations, patrols, and community engagement to keep crime down in order to enforce federal immigration priorities instead. Now Trump is flouting that court decision and breaking the law again by cutting significant emergency preparedness funding from our state. I filed another lawsuit to halt this lawless act and protect the safety of Minnesotans. I will keep fighting to make sure Minnesotans get every federal dollar we need and deserve to respond to emergencies and keep our communities safe, regardless of politics.”

Many of the grant programs administered by DHS and FEMA were authorized by Congress in the wake of national emergencies, such as the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina, to strengthen the nation’s preparedness for and response to emergencies and major disasters. These grants fund first responders’ salaries, pay for the training they receive, and support the mutual aid networks that allow them to mobilize when tragedy strikes. They also support crucial efforts to prepare for and prevent disasters, such as computer network testing to identify cyberattack vulnerabilities.

For decades, administrations of both parties have operated these programs evenhandedly, supporting all 50 states in their efforts to prepare for and respond to emergencies and threats.

On Saturday, FEMA issued the award notifications for its single largest grant program, the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), which allocates approximately $1 billion in funds annually for state and municipal efforts to prevent, prepare for and respond to acts of terrorism. FEMA granted only $226 million to the states filing today’s lawsuit. This was a $233 million, or 51%, reduction from the total amount that FEMA had previously stated it would provide to these states. DHS then redistributed to other states the funds that it cut to Minnesota and states that refuse to endanger their residents’ safety by diverting state and local law-enforcement resources for Trump administration priorities.

Through its research, networking, and lobbying, IDC promotes more humane alternatives to detention. Questioning common narratives, and therefore public perception, is also an important part of their work.

Stories are powerful. The stories we tell ourselves – as individuals, societies and cultures – shape how we see the world. And when those stories become entrenched in our public discourse, they take on a life of their own – swaying policy decisions and impacting people’s lives.

That’s why it’s so important to challenge accepted narratives and ensure policy is based on evidence. And this is particularly the case for immigration detention – a contentious, politicised and profoundly misunderstood issue.

Immigration detention is the practice of imprisoning, detaining or otherwise restricting the freedom of a person while they await decisions on their right to stay and live in a country or before return. It exists in many countries around the world, affects huge numbers of people, and is often touted as a necessary evil to manage migration – but this is just one of the many myths surrounding immigration detention.

It’s time to demystify the misconceptions and shed light on the realities of immigration detention. Let’s take a look.

1. Myth: Immigration detention only affects a small number of people

We don’t know exactly how many people are in immigration detention around the world – this is an opaque policy area lacking accurate data. Many governments don’t share numbers, so there are no exact statistics. However, we do know that vast numbers of people are currently imprisoned, and millions more are at risk of being sent to immigration detention in any given year.

And detention doesn’t only affect the people who are detained; it also has consequences for families and communities who lose parents, children, breadwinners and friends.

2. Myth: People in immigration detention have done something wrong

There’s a widespread assumption immigration detention is a punitive measure for unlawful actions, but that’s not usually the case. Most people in immigration detention are simply caught in the complexities of immigration processes.

In most countries, people in immigration detention actually have fewer safeguards and protections than people in criminal detention. They have no lawyer, no trial and no idea when they’ll be released.

3. Myth: Children are never imprisoned in immigration detention

The detention of children in immigration facilities is a disturbing reality.

Thousands of children are detained annually, violating International Human Rights Law and child protection standards which state that immigration detention breaches children’s human rights and is never in the best interest of the child. These children are often separated from their parents and communities, and held in harsh conditions. IDC’s own research has shown the devastating impact of detention on children’s health, happiness and development.

4. Myth: People are never in immigration detention for long

Some people are held in detention for a short time, but others wait for much longer – sometimes months, sometimes years. In fact, many countries have no limit on how long people can be imprisoned in immigration detention.

If a person is stateless – meaning that no country recognises them as a citizen – or has no identity documents, in some countries they can languish in detention facilities indefinitely. And in some countries a lack of resources makes it hard to arrange deportations, so people can spend many years in detention with no prospect of freedom in sight.

5. Myth: Conditions are very comfortable

The idea that people in immigration detention live lavishly at the expense of the state is widespread; it’s also false. Repeated investigations into immigration detention facilities around the world have exposed the harsh conditions detainees face.

People are often held in prisons, police stations, airports, hotels, ships and makeshift camps.

In the United Kingdom, immigration detention centres have been criticised for their prison-like conditions, poor ventilation and inadequate mental health care. And in the United States, a class action lawsuit has brought attention to “horrific, inhumane, punitive, and unlawful conditions” in immigration detention centres, including the misuse of solitary confinement​.

6. Myth: It's the cheapest option for taxpayers

Immigration detention is extremely expensive – some governments spend billions of dollars propping up this inhumane and ineffective system. The work is often outsourced to private companies and is a multi-million dollar industry.

In both the UK and the US, the average daily cost to hold one person in immigration detention is currently between $130 and $150. Over the course of a year, that adds up to approximately $50,000 USD per person; and in Australia, that figure is $400,000 USD.

7. Myth: Immigration detention is a deterrent

There is little evidence to suggest that immigration detention acts as an effective deterrent. In fact, the Migration Policy Institute notes that factors such as war, persecution and poverty are simply more powerful motivators for migration than the threat of detention.

8. Myth: Immigration detention is totally legal

International law states that countries should use immigration detention only as a last resort and use alternatives instead. International law also prohibits the detention of children for immigration-related reasons, but many governments still choose to imprison migrants and refugees by default, instead of using non-custodial options.

9. Myth: Having migrants and refugees living in the community is bad for society

Migrants and refugees are often key contributors to economic growth and cultural diversity in their host countries.

An analysis of 30 years of data from Western Europe suggests that refugees and migrants benefit their host nations’ economies within five years of arrival. A separate report found that migrants in the U.S. paid over $400 billion in taxes and held substantial spending power. Meanwhile, research in South Africa found that immigrants have a positive impact on jobs and wages, with each immigrant worker generating two jobs for South African citizens.

10. Myth: There are no alternatives to immigration detention

It doesn’t have to be this way. There are practical, workable alternatives to detention that are kinder, cheaper and more effective. Instead of being imprisoned, people could simply live in the community while their case is processed. During this period, they could work or go to school, and access support services, such as legal aid or a dedicated case worker.

An independent study found that the United States could save over $1.44 billion of its $2 billion detention budget by using alternatives; meanwhile, in Australia, the daily per/person cost of immigration detention is 98% higher than alternatives.

And it’s not just about the money; research shows that people are less likely to abscond when their basic needs are met, and they’re more willing to accept the decision on their case, even if it’s not in their favour. This leads to fewer people appealing or trying to enter the country again, which helps reduce strain on immigration systems. A review of pilot programs in Bulgaria, Cyprus and Poland also found that community support and case management positively affected participants’ wellbeing and resilience.

There’s no question that alternatives to detention are better for everyone: from taxpayers, to policymakers, to migrants and refugees. It’s time to change the narrative around immigration detention. It’s time to close the gap between myth and reality.",https://www.fes.de/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=p&p=1190029&token=7207f79d48cc275124f66fd59075a4ead1e08dc0,N,,2025-10-01 04:58:22.757962

Taxpayer and Immigrant Advocates Sue ICE, IRS, and Social Security Administration to Stop Information Sharing

ICE data requests abused the privacy of more than one million taxpayers and their families, circumventing longstanding protections

BOSTON — Taxpayer and immigrants’ rights advocates today filed a lawsuit asking for a block of the receipt and use of tax-related data by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from both the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA). A newly- disclosed agreement between SSA and ICE reveals plans to share personal and financial information on 50,000 immigrants each month. This quota is the latest in a dangerous pattern of information-sharing uncovered by advocates over the past several months. Since February, ICE has requested information on millions of taxpayers, and the agencies have collectively released the home addresses of more than 100,000 people.

The case was filed by Asian Law Caucus, Greater Boston Legal Services (GBLS), and Keker, Van Nest, &Peters LLP in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of groups that provide taxpayer services and advocate for the rights and needs of immigrant communities: Community Economic Development Center of Southeastern Massachusetts (CEDC), National Korean American Service and Educational Consortium (NAKASEC), National Parents Union (NPU), and Undocublack Network (UBN).

Mass transfers of data violate strict privacy protections and signal an alarming centralization of executive powers

The lawsuit alleges that the IRS and SSA have violated strict privacy protections by handing over sensitive taxpayer data, and that ICE’s continued use of that data for civil immigration enforcement breaches clear privacy laws. Requests by ICE for the addresses of more than one million taxpayers also represent an attempt to circumvent legal requirements, which stipulate that data may be shared and used only for case-by-case criminal investigation and prosecution–not for immigration detention and deportation. The agreements also go against decades of repeated IRS commitments to taxpayer privacy, under which immigrant workers have submitted tax filings.

“The law is clear: the IRS has no business providing sensitive taxpayer information to ICE. The hasty agreements between ICE and both the IRS and SSA are an attempted end run by ICE to exploit protected data for the purposes of civil immigration enforcement,” said Josh Rosenthal, workers’ rights program director at Asian Law Caucus. “The agencies’ agreements broke a decades-long promise that immigrant workers have relied on to safely file their taxes. No agency has the power to act in defiance of the law, and we are fighting for all workers by holding these agencies accountable.”

Disregard of safeguards in information sharing agreements expose taxpayers and their families to wrongful arrest, detention, and deportation

The legal challenge builds on records obtained through a prior Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, which ALC and GBLS filed on behalf of CEDC. Those records detail the scope of taxpayer data sought by ICE, how ICE plans to use this information, and the lack of safeguards for non-citizen taxpayers. Taxpayer advocates warn of ICE wrongfully targeting individuals based on errors in identification documents and inconsistencies between government databases.

In February, SSA reportedly provided ICE the address information of tens of thousands of immigrant workers. In response to an April ICE request for 1.28 million taxpayer records, the IRS provided the addresses of nearly 47,000 taxpayers to ICE, or about 3.7% of the original request. While the agency limited its disclosure based on data limitations, the Trump administration has reportedly continued to press for more information.

“For decades, CEDC has helped immigrant families in Massachusetts file their taxes and contribute to their communities in good faith, with the understanding that their private information would remain protected,” said CEDC executive director Corinn Williams. “ICE’s misuse of taxpayer data betrays that trust and puts our neighbors at risk of wrongful detention and deportation. Families who come to us for help deserve safety and dignity, not fear that the information they provide to meet their obligations will be turned against them.”

GBLS senior attorney Luz Arévalo added that “while many are aware of the unlawful IRS-ICE agreement, it is a shocking revelation that the Social Security Administration has also agreed to send private taxpayer data to ICE for immigration enforcement. It is shocking because the SSA holds the earnings records for virtually every worker in the U.S. We had to file this case to remind both agencies that our confidentiality laws apply to them both and that their sharing is unlawful.”

This litigation comes amid the Trump administration’s warrantless arrests, workplace raids and unlawful detention of immigrant workers and U.S. citizens, including rapidly deporting people without hearings. Immigrants’ rights organizations are alarmed that the disclosures expose working families to unlawful arrests, detention, and removal without due process, and rupture long-standing trust between community members and organizations that provide tax-filing services.

“Taxpayer information is protected by strict privacy laws precisely so families can file taxes without fear. By ignoring those protections and funneling data to ICE for deportation purposes, the IRS and Social Security Administration put entire communities at risk,” Laurie Carr Mims, Managing Partner of Keker, Van Nest & Peters, said. “The rule of law requires better, and this lawsuit is about restoring those safeguards.”

Becky Belcore, co-director at NAKASEC, said, “There is no need for the IRS or SSA to share private information with ICE. The law has always protected this information, and there was always an expectation this data would be safeguarded. This is a significant breach of trust in the relationship between the government and American people, particularly when this information is used to target our communities – and without people’s consent. Furthermore, the use of a centralized executive power to reduce civil liberties signifies the alarming shifts toward authoritarianism and the dismantling of democracy. We demand an immediate end to the collusion between ICE and other government agencies and an end to the bullying by the administration for private information.”

“Families deserve to know that their most private financial and personal information is not being handed over without their consent, especially when immigrant parents are being treated differently under the law,” said National Parents Union president Keri Rodrigues. “Sharing sensitive information poses real risks to people’s safety, sense of belonging, and trust in public institutions. We call on policymakers to immediately halt this data sharing and put meaningful safeguards in place.”",https://cdn.craft.cloud/5cd1c590-65ba-4ad2-a52c-b55e67f8f04b/assets/media/Website-Templates/ALC_placeholder_plum.jpg?width=1200&height=630&format=baseline-jpeg&fit=cover&s=woOfT107-f8acD2KMhAyj-_TYpqLt8ieHdzA4TByNZU,N,,2025-10-01 06:58:25.150175

Sam FrancisPolitical reporter

Sir Keir Starmer has said his government will look again at international law to meet the challenge of ""mass migration"".

The prime minister gave the clearest sign yet the government is planning a major overhaul on the use of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in immigration cases, but insisted he would not pull the UK out of existing treaties.

His comments came after his home secretary set out plans to tighten rules for migrants seeking indefinite leave to remain during a Labour Party conference focused on how to beat an insurgent Reform UK.

Sir Keir told Radio 4's Today Programme ""we need to look again at the interpretation"" of a wide range of international laws by UK courts.

Sir Keir warned that laws must be ""applied in the circumstances as they are now"" before adding that countries were experiencing ""mass migration in a way that we have not seen in previous years"".

To meet this new challenge ""we need to look at again at the interpretation of some of these provisions, not tear them down"", he said.

On the issue of deportation, he was asked about the example of a Brazilian paedophile who successfully claimed he would be treated worse in a Brazilian prison than he would in a British prison.

The prime minister drew a line between deporting someone to ""summary execution"" and claims based on worse healthcare or prison conditions abroad.

""I believe that those genuinely fleeing persecution should be afforded asylum and that is a compassionate act,"" he added.

Pressed for details about what was blocking deportations of foreign criminals, Sir Keir cited Articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR - which ban torture and protect the right to private and family life respectively.

""But it's more than that,"" he said, pointing to the UN's Refugee Convention, Torture Convention and Convention on the Rights of the Child as potential barriers.

Ministers were already exploring ways to tighten the interpretation of some aspects of the ECHR to crack down on immigration.

In May, the government's immigration white paper promised legislation to ""clarify"" how the right to a family life in European human rights law should apply to immigration cases.

Before being made foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper ordered home officials to look into how courts used laws that halted deportations on torture grounds.

Sir Keir's comments come after a Labour conference dominated by efforts to confront Reform UK.

The prime minister used his keynote speech to cast Nigel Farage's movement as practising the ""politics of grievance"" and to position Labour as the party of ""tolerant, decent"" patriotism.

He stopped short in the speech of repeating his attack on Reform's deportation proposals as ""racist"" but vowed to fight racist rhetoric ""with everything we have"".

Sir Keir has also spent the conference contending with a provocative challenge to his leadership by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham who said Labour MPs had asked him all summer to return to Westminster and take over as prime minister.

Asked about internal challenges to his leadership, Sir Keir said he had ""been underestimated every time"" he had taken on a senior role.

Despite this, ""I pushed through the barriers,"" he said.

Sir Keir told the BBC: ""I didn't come into politics as some sort of popularity contest.

""I came in with one focus, which is changing my country for the better.

""I'm proud to be prime minister, getting on with that work.""

During a wide-ranging interview, Sir Keir also said it was ""wrong"" that thousands of young people remained out of work because of mental problems.

""I'm not saying you don't and shouldn't have benefits for mental health issues but I do think we need to examine this quite carefully,"" he added.

""I say it because if you are on benefits, in your 20s, it is going to be extremely difficult to get off benefits for the rest of your life.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9629/live/3e7051c0-9e86-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 01:57:28.277907

Earlier this month, the Eswatini government also told Reuters that the U.S. government never notified them of Abrego’s removal to that country.
Abrego’s attorneys write that the Trump administration’s zeal to make an example of their client makes his continued detention “unreasonable and unauthorized.” “The Government’s pattern of misconduct toward [Abrego] reveals detention maintained for purposes wholly divorced from legitimate administrative function,” the filing states.
She is now presiding over a separate habeas corpus lawsuit to protect Abrego’s rights as the government attempts to deport him.
Separately, Abrego faces criminal prosecution in Nashville, Tenn., if the government does not deport him before a trial currently scheduled for January.","The Trump administration botched its chance to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia “immediately” by insisting on sending him to countries where they could not guarantee his safety, the Maryland man’s attorneys wrote in a new filing.

“The Government’s attempts to shield its actions from judicial review reveal a troubling pattern that permeates the litigation surrounding petitioner Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia: the Government tries to deploy procedural hurdles to evade accountability for substantive violations of law,” Abrego’s attorney Jonathan Cooper wrote in a legal brief on Monday. “It is clear that the Government has violated statutory requirements governing removal, ignored [Abrego]’s designation of Costa Rica as his removal destination, and transformed both third-country removal and civil immigration detention into a punitive mechanism, all while engaging in gamesmanship to delay resolution of [Abrego]’s claims.”

The latest filing previews the arguments Abrego’s legal team might make in their habeas corpus before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis during a scheduled hearing on Monday.

“The Temerity to Seek to Vindicate His Rights”

After two judges ordered his release from pre-trial detention, Abrego faced an ultimatum from prosecutors: He could plead guilty to charges of smuggling immigrants and face deportation after serving his sentence to Costa Rica, a country that promised not to deport him back to El Salvador.

If Abrego did not plead guilty before his release on bail, prosecutors threatened to send him to human rights abusing countries in Africa — first Uganda, and then Eswatini, the last absolute monarchy on the continent.

“The Government explicitly linked Petitioner’s continued detention to his ongoing criminal proceedings, transforming civil immigration detention into a mechanism for criminal leverage,” the legal brief notes. “The Government refused to remove Petitioner to Costa Rica unless he accepted a plea deal in the criminal case. … The District of Maryland has been flooded with cases of Central Americans seeking to prevent third-country removal to Mexico; in not one other case has the government threatened to send a Central American across the Atlantic Ocean.”

Abrego’s lawyers noted that prosecutors could have “immediately” deported their client to Costa Rica, which their client lawfully designated as his preferred country of deportation.

“Instead, the Government says that it seeks to remove [Abrego] to other countries (first Uganda, now Eswatini) that have publicly indicated they would not accept [Abrego] and that otherwise flunk the legal test to serve as viable removal destinations for Petitioner,” the filing states.

Since his release from pre-trial criminal custody in August, Abrego has spent most of his time in immigration detention, first in a Virginia facility and then in Phillipsburg, Penn. Abrego’s lawyers say that the government is “content to let [him] languish in civil detention indefinitely, both as a punishment to [him], and as a warning to others, for having the temerity to seek to vindicate his rights in court.”

“A pattern of misconduct”

Abrego’s lawyers argue that this choice has backfired for the Trump administration because of public statements by Eswatini’s government.

Earlier this month, the Eswatini government also told Reuters that the U.S. government never notified them of Abrego’s removal to that country. The African nation also publicly announced that anyone deported there would be “repatriated to their respective countries.”

A U.S. court order blocks Abrego’s deportation to El Salvador, where he faces persecution.

The Supreme Court precedent of Zadvydas v. Davis limits the length of time the government can detain someone when there is no significant likelihood of removal.

“That is the exact situation here,” Abrego’s lawyers write, referring to the Zadvydas precedent.

Abrego’s attorneys write that the Trump administration’s zeal to make an example of their client makes his continued detention “unreasonable and unauthorized.”

“The Government’s pattern of misconduct toward [Abrego] reveals detention maintained for purposes wholly divorced from legitimate administrative function,” the filing states. “As the Court previously observed, the Government ‘ha[s] taken the presumption of regularity and [they’ve] destroyed [it] . . . because [the Court] can’t presume anything to be regular in this highly irregular case.’”

Judge Xinis presided over two of Abrego’s lawsuits. The first challenged his expulsion to El Salvador, where her order for his release from CECOT prison was affirmed by the Supreme Court. She is now presiding over a separate habeas corpus lawsuit to protect Abrego’s rights as the government attempts to deport him.

Separately, Abrego faces criminal prosecution in Nashville, Tenn., if the government does not deport him before a trial currently scheduled for January.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2X4_!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffeecbb96-b2a6-4e14-bd55-57251eb9ed83_1700x1015.jpeg",N,,2025-10-01 01:57:31.737615

Because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits, we can cut large numbers of people out.
Despite Trump’s claims, the ACA benefits set to expire are not available to immigrants lacking legal status.
“We cannot allow them to charge tremendous amounts of money for health care for people who aren’t even citizens,” Trump said.","President Trump suggested Tuesday that his administration can make cuts to programs during a potential government shutdown, warning that Democrats are taking a risk by not voting for the GOP continuing resolution to fund the government through Nov. 21.

“We don’t want it to shut down,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them. Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.”

“You all know [White House budget director] Russell Vought, he’s become very popular recently because he can trim the budget to a level that you couldn’t do any other way. So, they’re taking a risk by having a shutdown. Because of the shutdown, we can do things medically and other ways, including benefits, we can cut large numbers of people out. We don’t want to do that, but we don’t want fraud, waste and abuse,” Trump said.

The president did not elaborate on what benefits and programs would be cut. Earlier on Tuesday, he said there may be “a lot” of layoffs in the federal government during a shutdown after his budget office directed agencies to prepare for mass firings.

The president told reporters in the Oval Office that there will “probably likely” be a shutdown before funding lapses at the end of the day Tuesday, but said “nothing is inevitable.”

He claimed Democrats want to give health care to immigrants in the country illegally, a debate that Trump has sought to make central to the shutdown fight, though the only demands from Democrats have been centered on an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) benefits that are set to expire at year’s end.

Despite Trump’s claims, the ACA benefits set to expire are not available to immigrants lacking legal status.

“We cannot allow them to charge tremendous amounts of money for health care for people who aren’t even citizens,” Trump said. “We have a big fight over that.”

The Democratic stopgap measure includes a permanent extension of the expiring ACA subsidies, overturning cuts to Medicaid via the tax and spending megabill, and a restoration of rescissions cuts.

When pressed on the fact that the ACA subsidies at the center of the fight wouldn’t go to such immigrants, Trump said “we just, as a country, cannot afford to take care of millions of people.”

Later Tuesday, Democrats will bring up their proposal to fund the government through Oct. 31, to permanently extend the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced health insurance premium subsidies and to restore nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts.

That measure, which failed to advance in September, needs 60 votes and is expected to fail as well.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) will then move to the House-passed continuing resolution to fund the government through Nov. 21. That bill also failed in September, and will likely be blocked by a Democratic filibuster.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/AP25273576395853-e1759250418609.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-01 01:57:23.522343

In response to the lawsuit, Hanen imposed a nationwide injunction on new DACA applications in 2021.
The states concluded: ""Sympathy for DACA recipients, understandable though it may be, is no substitute for statutory text or constitutional command.
United We Dream has recorded at least 19 current DACA recipients detained by immigration agents in recent months.
In her view, the Department of Homeland Security's attitude toward DACA recipients lately has diminished the protections it offers.","For the first time in four years, the federal government plans to begin processing initial applications for DACA, the Obama-era program that grants deportation protection and work permits to immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

The move, outlined in a proposal Monday by the Justice Department, would reopen DACA to first-time applicants in every state except Texas. The proposal was filed in response to an ongoing lawsuit in U.S. district court in Brownsville, Texas.

According to the filing, Texas residents who already have DACA could continue receiving protection from deportation but would no longer qualify for employment authorization.

Lawsuits over DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, have been ongoing since President Trump moved to end the program during his first term.

Under the government's proposal, DACA recipients who move into Texas would risk losing their legal ability to work, while moving out of Texas could allow them to resume qualifying for a two-year work permit. Unlike beneficiaries in other states, those with DACA in Texas ""will not be considered lawfully present"" in the U.S., according to the proposal.

The proposal is pending a final decision by U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen.

""These proposals do not limit DHS from undertaking any future lawful changes to DACA,"" the filing states.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, deputy director of federal advocacy for United We Dream, said misinformation was circulating Tuesday on social media.

""We’ve seen a lot of folks saying initial applications will start right away. That’s not true,"" she said. ""The status quo stays. If you are a DACA recipient right now, even in Texas, if you can renew you should renew as soon as possible because then you have another two years.""

Other advocacy groups, such as the nonprofit Dreamers2gether, urged DACA recipients and applicants to leave Texas and file a change of address form with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

More than 525,000 immigrants are currently enrolled in DACA. Texas follows California in the ranking of states with the highest number of program enrollees, according to USCIS.

To qualify, applicants must prove they came to the U.S. before they turned 16 and have graduated from high school or were honorably discharged from the military. Applicants also cannot have serious criminal records.

But for years the program has sat in a state of uncertainty, stoking anxiety for many recipients, amid court battles that stopped applications from being processed and left many younger people who would have aged into qualifying for DACA instead vulnerable to deportation.

In his first term, Trump attempted to shut down the program, but the Supreme Court concluded in 2020 that his administration failed to explain its rationale as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. The court did not rule on the program’s legality.

But litigation continued after the Biden administration attempted to protect the program, and DACA was closed to new applicants in 2021, though current recipients could still renew their work permits.

Los Angeles resident Atziri Peña, 27, runs a clothing company called Barrio Drive that donates proceeds toward helping DACA recipients renew their applications.

Peña, who also has DACA, said she knows many people in Texas who are thinking about moving out of state. The latest news is another example of how the immigration system breaks families apart, she said.

""A lot of us who are DACA recipients, we don’t necessarily know what it was like to be undocumented before DACA, so most of us have careers that we won’t be able to continue,"" Peña said.

In a statement, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said he is glad the administration plans to follow the law, but he noted that federal officials have not abandoned efforts to terminate DACA. In June, Padilla and other Senate Democrats urged DHS to resume processing initial DACA applications.

""Hundreds of thousands of Dreamers who are our teachers, small business owners, nurses and so much more depend on these protections,"" he said. ""We must do everything we can to protect them against the indiscriminate attacks of the Trump Administration while we fight for a permanent legislative solution.”

The inconsistency between Texas and the rest of the U.S. exists because Texas, which is spearheading the Republican-led lawsuit against DACA, has convinced courts that the benefits offered to immigrants under DACA were harmful to the state.

In response to the lawsuit, Hanen imposed a nationwide injunction on new DACA applications in 2021.

The government's plan is intended to comply with a January order from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals — viewed as the nation's most conservative — which upheld Hanen's earlier finding that DACA is unlawful. But the appeals court ruled it only applies in Texas.

“It has been well established that DACA’s benefits provisions injure Texas by imposing social service costs,” Texas and the other Republican-led states argued in their own filing Monday.

The states concluded: ""Sympathy for DACA recipients, understandable though it may be, is no substitute for statutory text or constitutional command. Like all who reside within our borders, they must abide by the rule of law.""

Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which intervened in the GOP-led legal challenge to DACA, said in a statement that people should not interpret the government's proposal as a definitive indication of how the 5th Circuit decision will actually be implemented.

“While the federal government provides somewhat detailed indications of how it proposes to withdraw work authorization from DACA holders in Texas, and of how it proposes to adjudicate new applications for DACA from throughout the country, including Texas, all of these proposals are just that,"" he said.

United We Dream has recorded at least 19 current DACA recipients detained by immigration agents in recent months. In one case in Texas, immigration authorities have kept Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago detained despite an immigration judge saying she cannot be deported.

""It's a way of making sure she can't renew her DACA and then she becomes deportable,"" said Macedo do Nascimento. In her view, the Department of Homeland Security's attitude toward DACA recipients lately has diminished the protections it offers.

""The bigger picture here is DHS is moving on to a new policy on DACA anyway — without having to go through the courts, the rulemaking process or taking DACA away altogether,"" she said. ""They’re really trying to end the program piece by piece, recipient by recipient.""

Even so, immigrants across the country are looking forward to applying for DACA for the first time.

""While we could still get detained, it's a little bit of a sense of safety and hope,"" Peña said. ""I have heard of people who are just waiting for DACA to reopen. But let's see what happens and let's hope they don't use this as a way to catch more of us.""

The debate among Democrats about ICE is going to grow more intense.
“When you say things like ‘defund’ ICE or ‘abolish’ ICE — people who are not online hear that you are not for immigration enforcement.","When a shooter opened fire on an immigration facility in Dallas last week, killing at least one migrant detainee in the process, it fit into a recent pattern of escalating tension — and violence — that has increasingly defined President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

At the center of this growing strain is one agency in particular: the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which has been deputized to carry out Trump’s anti-immigrant directives across the nation.

The Republican response to the Dallas shooting was uniform: They condemned it as the latest example of left-wing inspired violence against law enforcement. Politicians, activists, and commentators rushed to count it as evidence that Democrats specifically were “inciting” aggression against ICE, aiding criminals, and hampering Trump’s agenda. “This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis,’” Trump posted on Truth Social. The White House then released a list of Democrats’ criticism of ICE, calling their words “a battle cry for violence.”

Democratic responses, meanwhile, were splintered. Most national Democrats have remained quiet — including candidates running in competitive battleground races like Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio and former Gov. Roy Cooper in North Carolina, and progressives in Congress. House and Senate leadership condemned violence against law enforcement, while Texas Democrats said, “no one — those in uniform, civilians, or immigrants — should be subject to the senseless violence.”

There are plenty of reasons more Democrats haven’t spoken up — many details are still unknown. But this split in reactions reflects a deeper divide between the parties and among Democrats. Republicans are all-in on ICE, while Democrats are coming to realize that they need to decide what to say, and what to propose to do, about the agency.

This debate stands to explode during the midterms and the run-up to 2028. Americans are growing more positive on immigration and more negative on ICE. Parts of the Democratic base are yearning for their leadership to fight Trump’s push for dramatic numbers of deportations. And it’s increasingly clear that the question of what to do about ICE, especially if and when Democrats regain power, is looming over the party’s leadership and prospective 2028 candidates.

The past few weeks have also seen a growing number of examples of apparent ICE agent overreach: viral videos of manhandling of civilians, arresting or harassing Democratic politicians themselves — such as those of a mayor and congresswoman in New Jersey and a mayor and congressional candidate in Illinois — and street patrols in major cities. The result? The debate among Democrats about ICE is going to grow more intense.

The case for avoiding the elephant-sized ICE agent in the room

Since Kamala Harris’s loss last year, the conventional wisdom has solidified: Americans backed Trump and the GOP over Democrats last year in part because of distrust and dissatisfaction with the incumbent party’s handling of the economy, but also because of its leftward drift on border policy and liberalizing of immigration policy during the Biden years.

Particularly during the 2020 presidential primary cycle, Democratic hopefuls tried to outflank each other on immigration from the left, embracing a series of reforms, like abolishing ICE, executive actions, and positions that were more welcoming and accepting of both legal and illegal immigration.

That more humanitarian and progressive Biden-era approach to immigrants, to asylum-seekers, and to the border ended up turning much of the country against high immigration levels. It also turned many toward the Trump campaign — which promised more aggressive border enforcement, increased deportations, and stricter restrictions on migration.

Seeing signs of this drift, Harris, once she became the nominee, and other Democratic candidates moved right, embracing additional funding for border enforcement, and less welcoming rhetoric on immigration.

It didn’t work. Post-election surveys and analyses all tend to find that aside from the economy, voters most concerned about immigration and the border sided with Trump over Harris. And some signs suggest this problem is lingering for Democrats.

“People still don’t trust Democrats on this issue,” Tré Easton, vice president for public policy at the newly launched center-left think tank Searchlight, told me, describing the common view among some on the center-left of the party that the Biden administration immigration policy ended up being an overcorrection to Trump’s first term. This camp of the coalition also views a focus on immigration politics in general (as opposed to tariffs, prices, or health care) as a risk for Democrats because of their unpopularity.

Some public data supports this stance: recent polls finding declines in Trump’s approval ratings or dissatisfaction with the status quo on immigration and the economy do not show the public siding with Democrats on these policies.

The most recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll from mid-September, for example, shows a 17 percentage point advantage for Republicans among registered voters when they’re asked which party they trust would do a better job in handling immigration. Forty-six percent of these voters trust the GOP, 29 percent trust the Democrats, and 24 percent say they distrust both parties.

The result is a hangover of 2020 and 2024: fear of too directly engaging ICE and Trump’s immigration policy, wariness of embracing too positive a message or position on immigration, and a desire to take border security and enforcement concerns seriously, while focusing on the kitchen-table issues that many Democratic leaders think they need more credibility to win back the working class and future elections.

Why some Democrats are itching for a fight

ICE is probably the most visible arm of the Trump administration’s growing executive power in this second term: Images of masked federal agents, aggressively detaining and manhandling people, are now commonplace.

It’s led to some Democratic elected officials seeming more comfortable in joining liberal activists in protesting the agency, calling out ICE as a “secret police” force that is “disappearing” people suspected of being in the country without documentation, and trying to conduct more oversight of the agency with the limited powers they have, over the last few months.

“ICE is not suddenly going to become more popular as it multiplies the atrocities it commits around the country. … And politicians right now that are refusing to stand up are going to look like they’re not leaders.”

— Ezra Levin, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible

Meanwhile, polls show Americans are turning on Trump’s immigration policy and warming toward immigration in general (especially Democrats). Democratic outrage at ICE specifically is growing. One recent analysis from CNN’s Aaron Blake found that ICE is now even more unpopular than it was during Trump’s first term, when progressive calls to “Abolish ICE” first picked up.

ICE is also playing a bigger role in progressives’ pushback to party leaders to be more confrontational. “No Kings” protests being organized by grassroots groups for later this month are planning to center ICE and Trump’s use of the National Guard and federal agencies as a “secret police” in American cities as a rallying cry against Trump’s “authoritarian” turn, for example.

“People are seeing what a mass deportation agenda looks like in real life…and [Democrats] are seeing what a police state looks like,” Vanessa Cardenas, the executive director of the pro-immigrant advocacy group America’s Voice, told me. “They can speak up and denounce what’s happening…but this is an opportunity for Democrats to take positions that, yes, call out the extreme tactics that ICE is deploying and present alternative ways, but don’t just allocate billions of dollars to the enforcement machine in this country.”

This fervor fits a recurring theme over the last few months: an anger from the progressive and liberal base that has been consuming the party over its perceived inability to resist Trump, obstruct his agenda, or “do something” as the White House takes an authoritarian turn.

“Things are bad now, and things are going to get much worse, and the question for politicians proposing that they’re the ones to lead into the future, [is] going to be to contend with that reality,” Ezra Levin, a co-founder and co-executive director of the progressive activist network Indivisible, told me. “ICE is not suddenly going to become more popular as it multiplies the atrocities it commits around the country. It’s only going to become less popular. And politicians right now that are refusing to stand up are going to look like they’re not leaders. It’s going to look like they’re followers, because they are. It’s an untenable position and it’s just going to become ridiculous pretty soon.”

So far Democratic resistance has meant a handful of protests at ICE offices or facilities by some within the party, visits by congressional delegations to detention centers, and statements and social media posts condemning agents’ mask-wearing and frequent lack of identification.

It’s not yet the kind of political risk some want them to take: Over the summer Axios reported that Democratic lawmakers were hearing demands from their constituents that they “fight dirty” and “not be afraid to get hurt” — including to be “willing to get shot” when visiting ICE facilities. That kind of escalation is starting, as ICE tackles bystanders, tear-gasses Democratic candidates, and arrests Democratic lawmakers.

Combined with the sheer amount of money that ICE is just starting to receive, the pressure for more Democrats to call out ICE abuses and pledge to do something about the agency will only grow, various activists and progressives told me. After the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE is set to receive more than $75 billion in funding over the next four years; its funding boost this year is already essentially triple its annual budget, and it’s earmarked primarily for these mass deportation efforts.

This all sets up two coming tests for Democrats striving to lead their party: to take the anti-ICE stance that many in the base are calling for during primaries and races in the 2026 midterms, and to stake out that ground in the future run-up to the 2028 Democratic primaries.

“I do not think any Democrat in a competitive primary [in 2026] should win that primary unless they commit to using the full power of a future Democratic Senate majority or House majority to provide oversight of these out-of-control federal agencies,” Levin said.

That’s likely to create some tension with those in the coalition who have been calling for the party to moderate, pick out other liabilities for the GOP (like on the economy, tariffs, affordability, and health care), and seriously engage immigration concerns that rose among the public during the Biden years.

“It’s coming — it’s going to be the hand-raising [on the debate stage] all over again,” Easton told me, referencing the infamous moment in the 2020 Democratic primary debates when presidential candidates pledged to decriminalize border crossings should they be elected. “But the thing is: Democrats should not mistake Trump losing support…as that being that Democrats are credible on this issue.”

The specter of another overcorrection looms

As this pressure from the party’s faithful builds, it will likely tear open another split within the coalition that has been fraying since 2024: the debate over the direction the party should take as it rebuilds.

“The images are not great, and we’re seeing visceral responses to that. …The Democratic base, depending on who or what that means — there’s a desire to showcase action. People want to see things happening,” Easton told me. “It’s absolutely going to become an issue,” he said, but emphasized it would be a misread to move too far to the left since “people still don’t trust Democrats on this issue.”

It’s obviously too early to tell whether calls for stronger anti-ICE posturing by Democrats — including potential calls to defund or abolish the organization in coming years — result in a similar Biden-era overcorrection, but this tension will build.

“People feel very burned by Biden’s overcorrection on immigration, and Democrats [in leadership] are still super aware that this is a salient issue,” Easton said. “[There’s a recognition that] as bad as Trump policies are, there cannot be a reversion to…not enforcing the law.”

Even some who are advocating for immigrant rights and stronger Democratic resistance concede this. Cardenas, for example, told me embracing the 2018-2020 era progressive calls for “abolishing” ICE would be foolhardy.

“Defunding” or “abolishing” are certainly catchy slogans, she told me, but Democrats should offer actual plans that balance real concerns about security and law enforcement, while also reforming the current system, instead of potentially muddling impressions of what the party stands for.

Easton struck a similar note: Those phrases and campaigns from the peak-woke, pre-Trump 2.0 era would worsen the problem of trust. “When you say things like ‘defund’ ICE or ‘abolish’ ICE — people who are not online hear that you are not for immigration enforcement. It can be true that they need to be gutted or reformed or restructured, but Democrats need to understand that they are not trusted — it sounds like you are calling for lawlessness.”

The coming months may end up seeing Democrats debate and craft solutions or proposals that strike this middle ground. Some, including those in the party’s New Democrats Coalition in Congress, are already offering suggestions.

But as ICE actions continue to gain attention, Democratic lawmakers ramp up confrontation, and the agency receives more funding and discretion to operate across the country — it launched more show-of-force and enforcement operations in Chicago over the weekend — one side will probably have most of the momentum.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2235754894.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-10-01 02:56:32.821087

New York and Illinois, states that Mr. Trump has repeatedly targeted over policy disagreements, had their grants cut by 79 percent and 69 percent, totaling over $100 million.

FEMA did not provide a specific reason for the cuts, but the plaintiffs argued in their filings that the reason was apparent: “The current administration is taking money from its enemies.” They quoted Kristi Noem, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, who has argued that states that do not comply with Mr. Trump’s policies “should not receive a single dollar of the department’s money.”

Judge Mary S. McElroy ruled for the plaintiffs in a Tuesday afternoon hearing, approving a proposed temporary restraining order that would force the government to make the full grants available to the District of Columbia and the 11 states: Illinois, California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Vermont and Washington State.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/13/multimedia/30dc-disaster-funds/13trump-news-funding-cuts-lawsuits-fkmh-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 23:57:16.509126

Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian green-card holder and Columbia University student, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, have been fighting deportation proceedings since earlier this year.

Öztürk was arrested by masked federal agents on a Somerville street in March. Mahdawi was detained in April in Vermont at a naturalization interview. Both were released on bail earlier this spring by a pair of federal district court judges in Vermont, who said it was likely their constitutional rights had been violated. Their deportation cases are ongoing in immigration courts.

At issue before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York is the federal government’s appeal of their release. In both cases, the Justice Department argued that the district court did not have the right to weigh in on the detentions of Mahdawi and Öztürk, because Congress has tasked immigration courts with adjudicating immigration cases.

But the two students have argued that they were targeted for political speech in violation of their First Amendment rights. The government has cited an op-ed Öztürk signed criticizing Israel’s conduct in Gaza in arguing for her removal, and Mahdawi was a high profile pro-Palestinian activist at Columbia University.

An attorney for Öztürk argued that it would have been futile to ask immigration authorities for relief, and that the student had no choice but to go to the district court instead.

“Asking the very executive branch that you allege is seeking to weaponize immigration detention to silence you, to release you, is not an adequate substitute for habeas,” ACLU attorney Esha Bhandari, who is representing Öztürk, told the appeals court.

All three Second Circuit judges who heard Tuesday’s appeals were Republican appointees, and two were nominated by President Trump. Judge Steven Menashi, a former Trump White House official whose Senate confirmation stoked controversy, appeared particularly sympathetic to the government’s view.

His colleagues on the court, however — Chief Judge Debra Ann Livingston, a George W. Bush appointee, and Judge William Nardini, who was also a Trump nominee — appeared much more skeptical.

Nardini repeatedly grilled Justice Department attorney Tyler Becker, at one point pressing him on whether it was reasonable to tell Öztürk not to ask the district court to intervene immediately and instead wait on the immigration courts, even if those courts did ultimately rule in her favor.

“If she hadn't been released here, or if she were to be returned to custody — well, you know that that could come after a year of detention,” he said. “To say to her, ‘Oh, guess what? You were right. You never should have been detained all along. Sorry about that, but I hope you had a good time for that year.’ ”

Trump officials have also repeatedly argued that Mahdawi is a threat to the public, citing a 10-year-old Windsor, Vermont police report in which a local gun shop owner and nearby museum volunteer alleged Mahdawi made violent comments about Jewish people. Mahdawi has denied the allegations, and his lawyers have called them “cartoonishly racist hearsay.”

The incident was investigated by the FBI at the time, but Mahdawi was never charged. His attorney, Michael Tan, also with ACLU, told the appeals court that the fact that the FBI had dropped the matter vindicated his client.

“If the allegations are serious, they would have certainly continued an investigation,” he said.

But Nardini took issue with that, and argued that the FBI dropped cases all the time it could not prove, but considered legitimate. He called it “the one dramatic overstatement, I think, on your side.”

The Mahdawi and Öztürk hearings took place on the same day as another district federal judge, in a separate but related civil case, ruled that the Trump administration was unconstitutionally chilling First Amendment rights on U.S. campuses by initiating deportation proceedings against pro-Palestinian student activists. The case was brought by a group of faculty associations and civil rights groups.

The judge in that case, William Young, began his 161-page ruling with the scan of an anonymous, handwritten note his office had received that asked: “Trump has pardons and tanks … what do you have?”

In remarks after Tuesday’s hearing, Mahdawi recited Young’s reply.

“Alone, I have nothing but my sense of duty,"" he said. ""Together, We the People of the United States — you and me — have our magnificent Constitution.”

Mahdawi said he urged “every American to sit with this quote.”

Attorneys for Mahdawi and Öztürk said Tuesday that while the appeals court had fast-tracked a decision in their cases, they had not given a precise timeline for their ruling.",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ny-mahdawi-1000x726.jpg,N,,2025-10-01 00:56:20.860006

Citizenship and Immigration Services, in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, conducted ""Operation Twin Shield"" over nine days and looked at more than 1,000 cases for ""fraud or ineligibility indicators,"" said Joseph Edlow, director of USCIS.
Ana Pottratz Acosta, a visiting professor at the University of Minnesota Law School teaching at the Immigration and Human Rights Clinic, said immigration fraud does happen, but it's rare.
When asked why the Twin Cities was the first city for such an operation, Edlow pointed to data showing ""concerning"" patterns of fraud, but declined to share more specifics.
""And I think it also is reflected in the very small number of notices to appear and arrests that resulted from an investigation of what they say is over 1,000 cases.""","Federal officials on Tuesday announced they completed what they called a ""first-of-its kind"" operation earlier this week targeting immigration fraud in the Minneapolis and St. Paul metro area, leading to four people in custody.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, conducted ""Operation Twin Shield"" over nine days and looked at more than 1,000 cases for ""fraud or ineligibility indicators,"" said Joseph Edlow, director of USCIS.

That yielded 275 cases of ""suspected fraud."" But it narrowed to 42 case referrals to ICE and just four arrests so far. Nobody has been charged.

""This is what the government should be doing,"" Edlow told reporters Tuesday in a press conference. ""We have a responsibility to keep this system legitimate, and when you see what has been uncovered by these diligent officers over the past two weeks, less than two-week period, that's only the tip of the iceberg to what we're actually dealing with when it comes to immigration fraud.""

Edlow cited examples of what federal officers uncovered during the investigation like sham marriages, including one where a person took advantage of an elderly U.S. citizen. Another case involved a man admitting to fabricating a death certificate to falsely claim the end of a marriage, though the spouse who is the mother of his five children is alive in Minneapolis.

""What they found should shock all of America,"" Edlow said.

Ana Pottratz Acosta, a visiting professor at the University of Minnesota Law School teaching at the Immigration and Human Rights Clinic, said immigration fraud does happen, but it's rare.

She believes the numbers released by federal officials on Tuesday underscore that.

""There were 275 cases where there was some sort of flag raised during those investigations, but only 42 cases out of approximately 900 or 1,000 where they commenced deportation or removal proceedings, and only four of them were arrested,"" Pottratz Acosta said. ""So if you look at the actual numbers, 42 cases out of 900 or 1,000, that's less than 5%. And four cases out of 1,000, that's like half a percent, so it's a very small number and they're completely blowing it out of proportion.""

When asked why the Twin Cities was the first city for such an operation, Edlow pointed to data showing ""concerning"" patterns of fraud, but declined to share more specifics.

The announcement comes one day after the U.S. Department of Justice said it filed a lawsuit against the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul for their so-called ""sanctuary city"" policies.

Pottratz Acosta added that there is a presumption ""baked into our immigration laws"" that a person getting married to a U.S. citizen or pursuing that relationship is doing so solely for immigration purposes so there is a high burden on the applicant to prove it's legitimate.

Similarly, there are strict requirements for H-1B visas for foreign workers and student visas, she said.

""Our immigration system is very unforgiving, so even if you make a mistake, it's often hard to fix it or correct the record, which is why it's very important to be very careful before anything even gets submitted,"" she said. ""And I think it also is reflected in the very small number of notices to appear and arrests that resulted from an investigation of what they say is over 1,000 cases.""

USCIS said the agency expects ICE referrals to increase as more investigations stemming from this operation are completed. The operation began Sept. 19 and ended Sunday.

Edlow added that the Twin Cities is just the first area to be targeted in this way, though he did not say what other cities may be next on the list.

""I would say any city should be prepared to be the next site for an operation of this magnitude,"" he said.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/30/77fecef9-eb20-45e0-9d52-96b6cad01a3b/thumbnail/1200x630/812ea5d121a1d8cd09b4ad8046c7a9bd/twin-cities-immigration-raid-operation-twin-shield.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 23:57:24.722308

""President Trump opposes a government shutdown, and strongly supports the enactment of H.R.

""The reality is that the Trump Administration wants to keep the government open so HHS, including the CDC, can fully safeguard the public's health and well-being.","The Trump administration is blaming Democrats for the likely government shutdown in internal federal agency communications as well as on at least one public website, in what experts say could be a violation of federal ethics laws.

A bright red banner and pop-up message that appeared Tuesday on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's website warns: ""The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands. The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.""

Staffers at multiple agencies and Cabinet departments received emails on Tuesday from the White House Office of Management and Budget. Many shared screenshots of those emails with NPR, or confirmed the text of the message they received. The messages said any lapse in government funding would be ""forced by Congressional Democrats.""

""President Trump opposes a government shutdown, and strongly supports the enactment of H.R. 5371, which is a clean Continuing Resolution to fund the government through November 21, and already passed the U.S. House of Representatives,"" the message says. ""Unfortunately, Democrats are blocking this Continuing Resolution in the U.S. Senate due to unrelated policy demands. If Congressional Democrats maintain their current posture and refuse to pass a clean Continuing Resolution to keep the government funded before midnight on September 30, 2025, federal appropriated funding will lapse.""

The message continues: ""The agency has contingency plans in place for executing an orderly shutdown of activities that would be affected by any lapse in appropriations forced by Congressional Democrats.""

Similar messages were received by staff at the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, Labor, State, Treasury, Justice, Agriculture and Health and Human Services, the Social Security Administration, the General Services Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of Personnel Management and the National Labor Relations Board, according to screenshots shared with NPR.

Republicans control both chambers of Congress but need Democratic support in the Senate to approve any government funding deal.

A statement from the Department of Veterans Affairs also used sharply partisan language, saying ""radical liberals in Congress"" would be to blame for services not being available during a shutdown, such as career counseling activities and the closure of regional benefits offices.

""Radical liberals in Congress are trying to shut down the government to achieve their crazy fantasy of open borders, 'transgender' for everybody and men competing in women's sports,"" VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in a statement sent to the media. ""If they succeed, they will stop critical Veterans care and assistance programs.""

Health care for veterans will not be affected and the VA's contingency plan notes that about 97% of its employees will not be furloughed.

Alarm bells for ethics experts

The inclusion of overtly political messages in federal agency communications raised immediate alarm bells for some federal workers and ethics experts. They said it could violate the Hatch Act, which prohibits civil servants in the executive branch from engaging in most political activity inside federal buildings or while on duty.

""This correspondence from Federal Government Officials could be considered a violation of the Hatch Act,"" Michael Fallings, a partner at Tully Rinckey, an employment law firm, said in a statement. ""The Hatch Act prohibits engaging in political activity while in an official capacity, including communication that contains advocacy in opposition to a political party. Here, while the reference to Democrats alone likely does not constitute a violation, the explicit blaming of the Democratic Party for the shutdown and 'reference to radical left' may constitute a violation.""

""The code of ethics requires that federal employees serve the American public impartially, without regard to their political views. This message may not technically violate the Hatch Act--since it does not advocate for particular candidates or weigh in on elections, but it certainly violates the spirit of that law,"" said Donald Sherman, executive director and chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal nonprofit ethics watchdog group.

""A shutdown will cause stress for the public regardless of political affiliation. Agency leadership's job in this moment is to provide nonpartisan service to their constituents, not politicize the situation and blame political enemies,"" Sherman said.

""We just all accept that the Hatch Act is null and void,"" one federal worker, who requested anonymity because they fear retaliation from the Trump administration for speaking out, told NPR. ""Nothing matters.""

Sent at the behest of the White House

The highly partisan language from the Trump administration also differs from that used by other administrations during previous shutdowns.

Ahead of a government shutdown that lasted more than two weeks in 2013, then-President Obama penned a letter to federal employees that thanked them for their service and chided a Congress that ""has failed to meet its responsibility"" to approve a spending plan, without mentioning Republicans.

""This shutdown was completely preventable,"" he wrote. ""It should not have happened. And the House of Representatives can end it as soon as it follows the Senate's lead, and funds your work in the United States Government without trying to attach highly controversial and partisan measures in the process.""

""This type of email informing us of a potential shutdown is not new, but the tone and blaming one political party is definitely unusual,"" said a Office of Personnel Management staffer who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal.

Tuesday's messages were sent by agency leadership, but in several cases made clear that they were sent at the behest of the White House.

""The Office of Management and Budget has requested that we send the attached message to you regarding a potential lapse in funding,"" the email to NLRB staff read. The National Labor Relations Board declined to comment.

""This message was issued under the guidance of the Office of Management and Budget and in alignment with their protocols,"" an Interior Department spokesperson said in a statement to NPR.

""The reality is that the Trump Administration wants to keep the government open so HHS, including the CDC, can fully safeguard the public's health and well-being. By contrast, Congressional Democrats are threatening a shutdown that would impact care to millions of Americans. We will refer you to OMB for additional comment,"" HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.

The Office of Management and Budget didn't respond to a request for comment.

The message to Labor Department employees was unsigned by leadership and was sent from a generic department email address that doesn't accept replies, said one department employee who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisal.

At the Social Security Administration, the email came from Commissioner Frank Bisignano, according to a staffer who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.

""It basically read like a campaign email,"" the staffer said.

The Departments of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Justice, Agriculture and Treasury, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Social Security Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management did not respond to requests for comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.

Federal employees are on edge amid this week's funding negotiation, as the White House has threatened to fire some federal workers during a shutdown rather than temporarily furloughing workers as is usually done.

KCCI also asked what could lead to a delay in general when it comes to immigration cases.

""Immigration judges have very full dockets and sometimes cases can take a long time to come to a conclusion, not unlike civil litigation,"" said Tetzeli. ""This is a form of civil litigation. It's administrative.""

She also says timing for immigration cases are dependent on scheduling between attorneys.

The League of United Latin American Citizens identified the victim as Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, 32, who they said died after being removed from life support following the Sept. 24 sniper attack.

García-Hernández leaves behind four young children and his wife, who is expecting their fifth child.

""His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered. I do not know how to explain to our children that their father is gone,"" she added.

García-Hernández was originally from Mexico and in the U.S. illegally. He was arrested by police in Arlington, Texas, on Aug. 8 and charged with driving while intoxicated, evading arrest with a vehicle and fleeing police. That same day, ICE officials filed an immigration detainer against him.

Records show García-Hernández had also been charged with failure to identify himself to law enforcement officers in 2011 and 2017. After the 2017 arrest, ICE lodged a detainer, but he was released before immigration authorities could take custody.

The attack also killed detainee Norlan Guzmán-Fuentes, 37, of El Salvador and wounded Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, an illegal immigrant from Venezuela.

The shooting happened while ICE officers were bringing detainees into the agency’s Dallas facility. ICE sources told Fox News the detainees were inside a law enforcement van when the gunfire erupted. Federal officials said anti-ICE messaging was engraved on rounds found near Jahn’s body.

FBI Director Kash Patel said Jahn downloaded a document before the attack titled ""Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management,"" which listed DHS facilities.

Between Aug. 19 and Aug. 24, Jahn also searched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents, Patel said. In the hours before the shooting, he looked up ballistics information and the ""Charlie Kirk Shot Video.""

A visual journalist identified as L. Vural Elibol of the Turkish news agency Anadolu hit his head on the floor at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pushed one journalist off a public elevator and shoved another journalist to the floor, according to video and witnesses.

A bystander held Elibol’s head and a nurse treated him until an ambulance arrived, witnesses said. Video showed him in a neck brace as paramedics wheeled him out of the building on a stretcher. The other journalists, amNewYork police bureau chief Dean Moses and Olga Fedorova, a freelance photographer whose clients include The Associated Press, were not seriously injured.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin defended the agents’ actions, saying they were being “swarmed by agitators and members of the press, which obstructed operations.”

“Officers repeatedly told the crowd of agitators and journalists to get back, move, and get out of the elevator,” McLaughlin said in a statement. “Rioters and sanctuary politicians who encourage individuals to interfere with arrests are actively creating hostile environments that put officers, detainees and the public in harm’s way.”

A message seeking comment was left for the Anadolu news agency.

Moses said the situation escalated when masked agents grabbed him and shoved him from an elevator on the 12th floor as he was attempting to photograph them arresting a woman who had just left immigration court.

“I walked into the elevator behind them, and they started screaming at me,"" Moses told amNewYork. “Then they pushed me, grabbed me by my arms, and started pulling me out of the elevator. I tried to hold on, but I got shoved out.”

Video taken by photographer Stephanie Keith showed that during the struggle, another agent shoved Fedorova, who fell backward toward where Elibol lay on the floor.

Fedorova said photographers had worked in the hallway outside immigration court for months without incident. The agents making arrests Tuesday, she said, didn't announce any limits where journalists could go, and they hadn't made it clear they were making an arrest when they got on the elevator.

“If they tell us to get out, to not cross a certain line, we follow their orders,” Fedorova said. “In this case, it was not clear to anyone that this was a detention at all.""

The episode happened just days after a federal agent at the Manhattan immigration court was captured on video shoving an Ecuadorian woman into a wall and onto the floor after her husband was arrested.

Both confrontations took place in a part of the federal building that is open to the public, and is routinely filled with immigration on their way to and from court hearings, agents waiting to make arrests, activists there to protest the arrests, and journalists documenting the confrontations.

Elected Democrats, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, denounced the agents’ use of force and the Republican administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement.

“This abuse of law-abiding immigrants and the reporters telling their stories must end,” Hochul wrote in a social media post. “What the hell are we doing here?”

In the cross-examination, Song’s attorney asked whether Wiethorn could decisively say whether the responding Alvarado officer shot his gun or had his gun out before the suspects shot their weapons.
Daniel Roland Sanchez Estrada was arrested days after the attack, accused of conspiring with the other suspects.","JOHNSON COUNTY, Texas — A judge ruled there's probable cause to refer the cases of eight people suspected of participating in an ""ambush"" of a North Texas ICE detention facility in July to a grand jury after they appeared in court on Tuesday.

On July 4, a group of 10-12 people wearing all black shot fireworks toward the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, about 30 miles south of Fort Worth, according to an affidavit.

An Alvarado police officer who responded to the scene was shot in the neck, taken to an area hospital, treated, and released. No employees at the detention center were hurt, officials say.

Eleven of the suspects fled the scene after the incident but were later arrested by responding officers.

Among those who participated in the first hearing on Tuesday was Benjamin Hanil Song, who prosecutors describe as the leader of the group and who was arrested more than a week after the attack at a Far North Dallas apartment complex after a manhunt.

Police body-worn camera video shown during the court hearing on Tuesday showed the Alvarado officer approaching a group of suspects dressed in all black with their faces concealed. In the video, a person, whom prosecutors alleged is Song, could be heard yelling, ""Get the rifles."" Eleven rounds were fired at the officer, and the officer was able to fire three rounds in response before he was shot at the base of the neck near the shoulder.

Prosecutors allege Song was the sole shooter who fired rounds during the attack, despite several guns and gunshot residue being found on the other suspects' property and bodies.

Investigators alleged that Song was the lone shooter because they say his DNA matched that of DNA found on a mask near the one weapon used in the attack, FBI Special Agent Clark Wiethorn said during cross-examination.

Prosecutors also presented evidence that they allege shows the group had an anarchist and socialist ideology, including messages pulled from the encrypted messaging app Signal and materials produced by two of the suspects. Prosecutors also cited group members' participation in several organizations, including a book club characterized by prosecutors as ""anarchist,"" and the Socialist Rifle Association, which is a leftist organized group that supports firearm training. Song was a member and leader in that group, but was removed from his position, the prosecution said.

The SRA is a national organization that says it does not support violence or political violence, according to Wiethorn.

Prosecutors also tied the group to ANTIFA, a loosely organized group with anarchist goals, an FBI official said.

""They truly believe in the overthrow of the American government,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Smith.

Investigators allege that the defendants participated in two primary group chats through Signal: A larger chat with a broader group of people with similar ideologies and a smaller, more focused group of individuals who they say discussed and planned the group’s actions at the Alvarado detention facility.

Police obtained a portion of the group’s Signal messages through the phone of one of the suspects. No other evidence was gleaned from any of the defendant’s mobile devices, officials said.

“Blue lives don’t matter,” one of the suspects allegedly wrote in the group message, according to investigators.

A prosecutor alleged that the group believes that they were opposing a fascist government and that the detainees in the detention facility are political prisoners.

“We are literally at war with a fascist dictatorship,” one of the defendants allegedly said in the Signal chat.

Investigators also described how they say the suspects were arrested after the shooting. Firearms were found in various suspects' cars and backpacks, but none of the guns were fired during the incident, prosecutors said.

Body-worn footage shown at the hearing showed an Alvardo police officer stopping and arresting a group of suspects that officials say included Elizabeth Soto, Ines Soto, Maricela Rueda, and others, after they were seen walking away from the scene on foot.

Prosecutors also provided more details on how Song was able to evade police for several days after the shooting. In the hours after the shooting, officials say police picked up sporadic pings from Song’s phone in the woods surrounding the detention facility. He remained in the woods for 24 hours before crawling to a meet-up spot, where he was picked up by two people now facing charges for hindering the arrest of Song, John Phillip Thomas and Lynette Read Sharp.

Song was later taken to an apartment in North Dallas, where he was arrested by law enforcement officials days later.

""This isn't some band of thugs out here to cause harm,"" argued Song's attorney Phillip Hayes. ""Right or wrong, they thought they could make a difference for thousands of detainees.""

During cross-examination, all eight of the suspects' lawyers took the podium to ask Wiethorn questions. The suspect's lawyers asked Wiethorn how investigators knew that their client was near the gun that injured the officer, or what their motives were.

The defense attorneys said that the investigators' inability to conclusively identify the suspects in body-worn footage and CCTV images made it impossible to determine where they were and how they may have participated in the incident.

In the cross-examination, Song’s attorney asked whether Wiethorn could decisively say whether the responding Alvarado officer shot his gun or had his gun out before the suspects shot their weapons.

Wiethorn responded that he couldn't conclusively say whether the officer had his gun out when approaching the suspects or whether he shot his gun first.

Federal Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Cureton remanded the eight suspects into custody and denied efforts by one to seek release in a detention hearing.

Shortly after the hearing's conclusion, vehicles taking the defendants to jail left the Downtown Fort Worth federal courthouse under police escort and under the watch of law enforcement snipers on rooftops overhead.

Zachary Evetts, of Waxahachie; Joy Gibson, of Dallas; Bradford Morris, of Dallas; Rueda, of Fort Worth; Seth Sikes, of Kennedale; Elizabeth Soto, of Fort Worth; and Ines Soto, of Fort Worth, all face charges, including attempted murder of a federal officer, discharging a firearm during a violent crime, terrorism and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon against a peace officer in connection with the attack, as WFAA previously reported.

Daniel Roland Sanchez Estrada was arrested days after the attack, accused of conspiring with the other suspects. Song was arrested more than a week after the attack and charged with three counts of attempted murder of federal agents and another three counts of discharging a firearm during a violent crime. Law enforcement has accused Song of buying four of the guns used in the shooting, including two AR-style rifles.

Thomas and Sharp were arrested and face charges in connection with allegedly hindering the arrest of Song.",https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/35836957-a14c-4ea4-ad1e-1efbf65c37df/20250716T233611/35836957-a14c-4ea4-ad1e-1efbf65c37df_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 23:57:32.087167

I haven’t received much. I have in the past received criticisms about politics, but not particularly, no. For us in the church, it’s part of morality and the social teaching of the Catholic Church, and so when people are suffering, we have to speak to that question. Major political issues often have moral dimensions.

Nick Iannelli:

You used words that are very unusual to hear from an archbishop when talking about political matters. It was striking to hear some of these words from you. You called the immigration policies a “crackdown,” and you said that it was a “profound injustice,” and you also called it “a governmental assault.” Did you have reservations in using some of that strong language?

Cardinal Robert McElroy:

No, I didn’t have reservations because the types of words you are pointing to are two different dimensions. One is words that describe reality. For example, the word of crackdown and assault. Those are questions of what is going on.

The second dimension of it, the justice and moral issues, are the evaluative issues. How do we say that these actions do not represent what we as people, as a nation historically, have stood for, and we must stand up for that.

Nick Iannelli:

When you knew that you were coming to Washington to become Archbishop, did you have that in your mind that you may have to be more political than if you were to go to other communities given the nature of Washington?

Cardinal Robert McElroy:

There will be other moral issues that arise in the political actions, both Democratic and Republican actors in Washington, in the years that I’m here, I’m sure. But the focus I have at this moment is really on the issue of immigrants, the undocumented, who have lived here for so many, often generations, and have built up wonderful lives and contributed to our society; and now find themselves uprooted and being tossed out of our society and separated from their families.

Nick Iannelli:

Over the weekend, there was yet another attack at a church, this time in Michigan. Just weeks ago, there was an attack at a church in Minneapolis, people worshipping and then being attacked during this time of crisis in the United States. What do you say to worshippers who are lost right now when they hear that people can’t go to church without fear of something violent happening?

Cardinal Robert McElroy:

Well, it’s part of the larger question of violence in our society and of guns in our society. We have been facing the terrible moral reality for so many years that children in our schools can’t go to school and be safe, and now we face it in our churches.

It’s a terrible moment for us as a society to step back and face it on the questions of violence and what propagates it, and the question of guns and how they are utilized in our society to kill people, and this anger in our society. We are in a moment of great political, divisive anger, and we need to come to a way of dialoguing on these issues, because that road we’re headed on is very dangerous.

In 2019, Congress passed a bill enshrining into law the requirement that furloughed employees get retroactive pay once operations resume.

That’d be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when furloughed federal workers returned to their jobs once Congress approved government spending.
— Smithsonian Institution: “The Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, like all Smithsonian museums, receives federal funding.","Washington is hours away from another federal government shutdown, with prospects looking bleak for a last-minute compromise in Congress to avoid closures beginning at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.

Republicans have crafted a short-term measure to fund the government through Nov. 21, but Democrats have insisted the measure address their concerns on healthcare. They want to reverse the Medicaid cuts in President Trump’s mega-bill passed this summer and extend tax credits that make health insurance premiums more affordable for millions of people who purchase through the marketplaces established by the Affordable Care Act. Republicans call the Democratic proposal a nonstarter.

Neither side shows any signs of budging, with the House not even expected to have votes this week.

Here’s a look at how a shutdown would occur:

What happens in a shutdown?

When a lapse in funding occurs, the law requires agencies to cease activity and furlough “non-excepted” employees. Excepted employees include those who work to protect life and property. They stay on the job but don’t get paid until after the shutdown ends.

During the 35-day partial shutdown in Trump’s first term, 340,000 of the 800,000 federal workers at affected agencies were furloughed. The remainder were “excepted” and required to work.

What government work continues during a shutdown?

A great deal, actually.

FBI investigators, CIA officers, air traffic controllers and agents operating airport checkpoints keep working. So do members of the Armed Forces.

Those programs that rely on mandatory spending also generally continue during a shutdown. Social Security payments continue going out. Seniors relying on Medicare coverage can still see their doctors and healthcare providers, submit claims for payment and be reimbursed.

Veteran healthcare also continues during a shutdown. Veterans Affairs medical centers and outpatient clinics will be open, and VA benefits will continue to be processed and delivered. Burials will continue at VA national cemeteries.

Will furloughed federal workers get paid?

Yes. In 2019, Congress passed a bill enshrining into law the requirement that furloughed employees get retroactive pay once operations resume.

While they’ll eventually get paid, the furloughed workers and those who remain on the job may have to go without one or more of their regular paychecks, depending upon how long the shutdown lasts, creating financial stress for many families.

Service members would also receive back pay for any missed paychecks once federal funding resumes.

Will I still get mail?

Yes. The U.S. Postal Service is unaffected by a government shutdown. It’s an independent entity funded through the sale of its products and services, not by tax dollars.

What closes during a shutdown?

All administrations get some leeway to choose which services to freeze and which to maintain in a shutdown.

The first Trump administration worked to blunt the impact of what became the country’s longest partial shutdown in 2018 and 2019. But in the selective reopening of offices, experts say they saw a willingness to cut corners, scrap prior plans and wade into legally dubious territory to mitigate the pain.

Each federal agency develops its own shutdown plan. The plans outline which agency workers would stay on the job during a shutdown and which would be furloughed.

In a provocative move, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget has threatened the mass firing of federal workers in a shutdown. An OMB memo said those programs that didn’t get funding through Trump’s mega-bill this summer would bear the brunt of a shutdown.

Agencies should consider issuing reduction-in-force notices for those programs whose funding expires Wednesday, that don’t have alternative funding sources and are “not consistent with the President’s priorities,” the memo said.

That’d be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when furloughed federal workers returned to their jobs once Congress approved government spending. A reduction in force would not only lay off employees but eliminate their positions, which would trigger another massive upheaval in a federal workforce that’s already faced major rounds of cuts this year due to efforts from the White House’s cost-cutting team the Department of Government Efficiency, and elsewhere in Trump’s Republican administration.

Shutdown practices in the past

Some agencies have recently updated plans on their websites. Others still have plans that were last updated months or years ago, providing an indication of past precedent that could guide the Trump administration.

Here are some excerpts from those plans:

— Health and Human Services will furlough about 41% of its staff out of nearly 80,000 employees, according to a contingency plan posted on its website. The remaining employees will keep up activities needed to protect human life and property.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will continue monitoring for disease outbreaks. Direct medical services through the Indian Health Service and the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center will remain available. However, the CDC communications to the public will be hampered and NIH will not admit new patients to the Clinical Center, except those for whom it’s medically necessary.

At the Food and Drug Administration, its “ability to protect and promote public health and safety would be significantly impacted, with many activities delayed or paused.” For example, the agency would not accept new drug applications or medical device submissions that require payment of a user fee.

— The Education Department will furlough about 1,500 of 1,700 employees, excluding federal student aid workers. The department will continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans. Student loan borrowers will still be required to make payments on their outstanding debt.

— National Park Service: As a general rule, if a facility or area is inaccessible during nonbusiness hours, it’ll be locked for the duration of the lapse in funding, said a March 2024 plan. At parks where it’s impractical or impossible to restrict public access, staffing will vary by park: “Generally, where parks have accessible park areas, including park roads, lookouts, trails, campgrounds, and open-air memorials, these areas will remain physically accessible to the public.”

— Transportation Department: Air traffic controller hiring and field training would cease, as would routine personnel security background checks and air traffic performance analysis, a March update says.

— Smithsonian Institution: “The Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, like all Smithsonian museums, receives federal funding. Thus, during a government shutdown, the Zoo — and the rest of the Smithsonian museums — must close to the public.”

Impact on the economy

Phillip Swagel, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said a short shutdown doesn’t have a huge impact on the economy, especially since federal workers, by law, are paid retroactively. But “if a shutdown continues, then that can give rise to uncertainties about what is the role of government in our society, and what’s the financial impact on all the programs that the government funds.”

“The impact is not immediate, but over time, there is a negative impact of a shutdown on the economy,” he added.

Markets haven’t reacted strongly to past shutdowns, according to Goldman Sachs Research. At the close of the three prolonged shutdowns since the early 1990s, equity markets finished flat or up even after dipping initially.

A governmentwide shutdown would directly reduce growth by around 0.15 percentage points for each week it lasted, or about 0.2 percentage points per week once private-sector effects were included, and growth would rise by the same cumulative amount in the quarter following reopening, writes Alec Phillips, chief U.S. political economist at Goldman Sachs.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f024ce6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4500x2363+0+319/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6d%2F91%2F6ffcc18b4be5a0f842b10096156f%2Fcebfaafb42844c2cbad5a0664527206e.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 22:56:32.015331

According to a state department spokesperson, “Human trafficking affects human beings, not ideologies.
Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey who wrote the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, released a statement praising Trump.","The US Department of State has released a long-delayed, legally required report on human trafficking after an investigation by the Guardian and bipartisan pressure from Congress.

The 2025 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report, which details conditions in the United States and more than 185 countries, was initially scheduled for release at an event in June featuring the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, the Guardian has reported, but the event was scrapped and staff at the state department office charged with leading the federal government’s fight against human trafficking were cut by more 70%.

The US Trafficking Victims Protection Act requires that the state department provide the report to Congress each year no later than 30 June. The delay in the release of the report this year raised fears among some anti-trafficking advocates that the 2025 document had been permanently shelved.

The report was published quietly on the agency’s website on Monday without a customary introduction from the secretary of state or the ambassador tasked with monitoring and combating human trafficking, a position Donald Trump has not filled.

The state department did not answer repeated questions from the Guardian about why the report had been delayed, but said it was subject to “the same rigorous review process as in years past”.

The Guardian highlighted the report’s delay in a 17 September article reporting that the Trump administration has aggressively rolled back efforts across the federal government to combat human trafficking. White House officials called the Guardian’s findings “nonsense” and said the administration remains committed to anti-trafficking efforts.

Representative Sarah McBride, a Democrat from Delaware, who won unanimous approval from the House foreign affairs committee for an amendment that added additional oversight of federal anti-trafficking efforts hours after the Guardian’s investigation was published, expressed a mix of relief and frustration. “Let’s be clear: this report should never have been delayed in the first place,” she said in a statement.

McBride said she would “be reading it closely, alongside advocates and survivors, to ensure that it lives up to its mission – shining a light on trafficking and pressing governments to act”.

Current and former state department officials told the Guardian that unlike the department’s annual human rights report, which was significantly weakened amid reports of political interference, the human-trafficking report largely appears to represent an honest assessment of agency experts on anti-trafficking work abroad. There was a notable exception. Earlier this year, an effort to draft a section on LGBTQ+ victims, written in coordination with two trafficking survivors, was terminated.

Jose Alfaro, one of the survivors invited to draft the now-excised section, said he was told that Trump’s executive order banning references to diversity, equity and inclusion was the reason he and the rest of the team were pulled off the project.

The term “LGBTQ” doesn’t appear in the 2025 report, and Alfaro says this is a mistake. Without “critical context” about what makes some groups vulnerable to trafficking and how to identify potential victims, “we only contribute to the problem rather than solving it”, he said.

According to a state department spokesperson, “Human trafficking affects human beings, not ideologies. The 2025 TIP report focuses on human trafficking issues directly, as they affect all people regardless of background.”

A state department spokesperson said the US had made significant strides in ending forced labor in the Cuban export program and working with the Department of Treasury in imposing sanctions on entities using forced labor to run online scam centers.

As for shifts in anti-trafficking strategy, the state department provided a statement from Rubio saying the agency is “reorienting our foreign assistance programs to align directly with what is best for the United States and our citizens. We are continuing essential lifesaving programs and making strategic investments that strengthen our partners and our own country.”

The report names Cambodia a “state sponsor” of trafficking for the first time, a designation that can lead to sanctions. It alleges senior Cambodian government officials profit from human trafficking by allowing properties they own to be “used by online scam operators to exploit victims in forced labor and forced criminality”.

Afghanistan, China, Iran, North Korea and Russia – which the report says forcibly has transferred “tens of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia, including by forcibly separating some children from their parents or guardians” – are also listed among the state sponsors of trafficking.

Representative Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey who wrote the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, released a statement praising Trump. “The president is absolutely right to spotlight and criticize those countries that are not only failing to stop human trafficking, but in many cases, are actively profiting from it,” he said.

Brazil and South Africa were put on a state department “watchlist” of countries that show insufficient efforts to combat human trafficking and may face sanctions for the first time, with the department citing failures of both countries to demonstrate progress on the issue, with fewer investigations and prosecutions.

The document is also critical of Israel, describing as “credible” reports that “Israeli forces forcibly used Palestinian detainees as scouts in military operations in Gaza to clear booby-trapped buildings and tunnels and gather information”.

The allegations were first raised by Palestinian sources and confirmed by Israeli soldiers in testimony gathered by Breaking the Silence, an organization of current and former members of the Israeli military. They have since been substantiated in investigations by Israeli media.

Joel Carmel, a former IDF officer who serves as Breaking the Silence’s advocacy director, said he hoped the report “would be used to be sure Israel is held accountable” and “doesn’t end up sitting on a shelf somewhere”. He said despite a ruling by the Israeli supreme court that declared the use of human shields to be illegal, “there’s certainly the fear that this is the new norm for the IDF”.

Under previous administrations – including Trump’s first – the TIP report was released with great fanfare. The secretary of state typically hosts a “launch ceremony” featuring the TIP ambassador and anti-trafficking “heroes” from around the world.

​​The delayed report release is part of an ongoing retreat in the Trump administration’s support of anti-trafficking measures, including the impending lapse of more than 100 grants from the Department of Justice, which advocates say could deprive thousands of survivors from access to services when funding runs out today.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7af8193298a5c0f7846b49969dad9dd919f1a67f/428_0_4259_3409/master/4259.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7fab340d4f39c420b89f1c1ad8955287",N,,2025-09-30 18:58:09.382394

After a four-year hiatus, immigration officials could resume processing new applications for the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA, which protects qualifying immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children from deportation.

The lift on reviewing new applications was outlined in a court filing late Monday by the Trump administration as part of a years-long legal battle over the legality of DACA in a federal court in Brownsville.

The proposal will still need to be approved by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen, a George W. Bush appointee who initially ruled that DACA was illegal in 2021.

Even if Hanen accepts this proposal, the lawsuit would continue and the program could still end altogether when the lawsuit is finally settled.

Still, to comply with the appeals court ruling, the Trump administration’s proposal to process new DACA applications will apply to all 49 states, while Texas residents will get a watered-down version of the program.

As part of the proposal, potential DACA enrollees will get deportation protection and a two-year work permit. But those in Texas will only get protection from deportation, without a work permit, according to the court filings. And any current DACA recipient who moves to Texas could be stripped of their work permit.

In 2018, Texas sued the Biden administration to scrap the program officially called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, arguing that the program is illegal.

After years of back-and-forth in federal courts, Hanen ruled that the program was illegal. However, his order allowed DACA recipients to continue renewing, while halting enrollment for new applicants.

However, in January, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a mixed decision, ruling that the federal government can legally protect immigrants from deportation, but that the two-year work permit is most likely illegal. The order, however, was narrowed to Texas, the leading state suing to scrap the program.

There are currently more than half a million immigrants enrolled in DACA and more than 89,000 reside in Texas, the state with the second-largest share of DACA recipients after California.

The Obama administration created the program in 2012, following Congress' repeated failure to pass a comprehensive overhaul of the country’s immigration laws that would allow people to apply to legalize their status and eventually qualify for U.S. citizenship. The program was also created in response to intense pressure from immigrant advocates who had pleaded with President Obama to grant legal status to immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

Thirteen years after its creation, Congress has not overhauled the nation’s immigration laws and the Trump administration has prioritized cracking down on undocumented immigrants during his second term, including targeting DACA recipients.

“[T]he National Defense Areas are slim, noncontiguous extensions of existing military bases,” a task force spokesperson said in an email.
The border task force totals 7,600 active-duty personnel, including 250 who regularly patrol the southwest border, the Defense Department official said.
But in his second term, Trump expanded his use of the National Guard beyond the border.
Project 2025 called for a different approach – which the Trump administration has embraced.","In arguing for “a creative and aggressive approach” to border patrol, Project 2025 suggested the possible “use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border—something that has not yet been done.”

The Trump administration has done just that, designating strips of land along the border as extensions of military bases, among other actions.

On his first day in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border and issued an executive order “clarifying” the use of the military to protect the “territorial integrity” of the U.S., giving him broad powers to unilaterally direct more federal funding and resources to border security.

A day after the national emergency was declared, Acting Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses met with top military officials to develop plans to implement Trump’s directive, which included sending 1,500 active-duty service members to San Diego and El Paso, Texas. (At the time, there were about 2,500 U.S. National Guard members and Reserves at the border, but there were no active-duty members.)

“This is just the beginning,” Salesses said in a Jan. 22 statement. “In short order, the Department will develop and execute additional missions in cooperation with DHS, federal agencies, and state partners to address the full range of threats outlined by the President at our nation’s borders.”

A day later, Gen. Steven Nordhaus, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said that the guard “is increasing its support and closely coordinating emergent requirements with USNORTHCOM and U.S. Transportation Command for additional personnel, military airlift, barrier construction and other capabilities to meet Presidential and Secretary of Defense directives.”

Since then, the Trump administration has significantly escalated military use to help crackdown on illegal immigration at the border and in the interior of the U.S., and drug smuggling via boats.

In March, the Defense Department activated a Joint Task Force-Southern Border to help ICE with transportation maintenance and operations, including air support, and detection and monitoring of “suspicious activity,” among other things.

The Joint Task Force-Southern Border established four National Defense Areas in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas “to protect the U.S. southern border from unlawful entry,” according to the U.S. Northern Command. The four zones span approximately 515 miles along the southern border, a spokesperson for the Northern Command told us in an email.

“[T]he National Defense Areas are slim, noncontiguous extensions of existing military bases,” a task force spokesperson said in an email. “In the case of the New Mexico National Defense Area, the land width ranges from 60 feet to a mile across approximately 170 noncontiguous miles.”

After Trump issued a memo in April on guidance to the Defense Department on “sealing” the border and “repelling invasions,” the U.S. Northern Command authorized soldiers in the New Mexico National Defense Area to search and detain trespassers “until an appropriate law enforcement entity can assume custody.”

Mark Nevitt, an associate professor at Emory University School of Law, wrote in April that turning “a strip of federal land along the U.S. southern border into a massive ‘National Defense Area'” effectively bypasses the Posse Comitatus Act, which “prohibits federal military forces from being used in a law enforcement capacity.”

There is an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act known as the “military purpose doctrine,” Elizabeth Goitein and Joseph Nunn at the Brennan Center for Justice wrote in April.

“The doctrine, conceived by the executive branch and endorsed by the courts, holds that an action taken primarily to further a military purpose does not violate the Posse Comitatus Act even if it provides an incidental benefit to civilian law enforcement,” they wrote.

The border task force totals 7,600 active-duty personnel, including 250 who regularly patrol the southwest border, the Defense Department official said.

The Justice Department has filed trespassing charges against hundreds of migrants, but a federal judge in May dismissed cases for about 100 defendants because they did not knowingly enter military property. “[T]he United States provides no facts from which one could reasonably conclude that the Defendant knew he was entering the NMNDA,” the judge wrote.

In July, Trump signed a reconciliation bill that provided “$1 billion to support military activities at the southern border, including the temporary detention of migrants on DoD installations and operating and building infrastructure in ‘national defense areas,’” the Federal News Network wrote.

As for the National Guard, there is a long history of the guard being deployed to the southern border, including under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Trump during his first term.

But in his second term, Trump expanded his use of the National Guard beyond the border. In May, DHS requested 20,000 National Guard troops to help with the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the interior of the country — not at the southern border – to comply with Trump’s “mandate from the American people to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens.”

In response, the Defense Department has asked 20 states – all run by Republican governors – to activate National Guard troops to support ICE operations, according to several news reports.

The governors of Tennessee and Wyoming were among the first to activate National Guard troops to help ICE, while the governor of Vermont declined the Defense Department’s request.

The guard members were activated under Title 32 status, which means they would “fall under the command and control of their state or territory governor, but their duty is federally funded and regulated,” as explained in a fact sheet on National Guard duty statuses.

The Christian Science Monitor wrote that experts “aren’t aware of prior use of the National Guard under what’s called Title 32 status to assist ICE in the nation’s interior.”

Chris Mirasola, an assistant law professor at the University of Houston Law Center, told the Christian Science Monitor that the decision is a “serious escalation” in the use of National Guard troops for immigration enforcement.

Trump’s crackdown at the southern border appears to have significantly reduced the number of people trying to cross the border illegally. The U.S. Border Patrol, which is responsible for illegal entries between ports of entry, reported 49,620 enforcement encounters at the southwest border from February through August, down 93% from the same seven-month period in 2024.

The military has also been used to work with the U.S. Coast Guard on drug interdiction missions in the Gulf and carrying out deadly air strikes on Venezuelan boats in the Caribbean that the administration said were transporting drugs.

(Style note: On Sept. 5, Trump issued an executive order to rebrand the Defense Department as the “Department of War.” A formal name change would require an act of Congress, so the president’s order directed federal agencies to use the “secondary Department of War designation” when referring to the Department of Defense.)

In October 2021, Mayorkas, the DHS secretary, issued a memo directing top immigration officials to “cease mass worksite operations” that sometimes result “in the simultaneous arrest of hundreds of workers.” Instead, they should focus enforcement efforts “on unscrupulous employers who exploit the vulnerability of undocumented workers,” the memo said.

Project 2025 called for a different approach – which the Trump administration has embraced. The document urged ICE to use “civil search warrants” at worksites to arrest “illegal aliens.”

“The use of Blackies Warrants should be operationalized within ICE. These civil search warrants are commonly used for worksite enforcement when agents have probable cause that illegal aliens are employed at a business,” Project 2025 said.

Search warrants are generally sealed, so we don’t know how many times ICE has executed Blackie’s warrants at worksites. But we know that it has, because a federal magistrate in Texas rejected the government’s application for a Blackie’s warrant because, he said, it violated the U.S. Constitution.

A Blackie’s warrant – named after the 1981 ruling Blackie’s House of Beef Inc. v. Castillo – is a controversial law enforcement tool because it allows ICE agents to obtain a search warrant with only providing “the places to be searched and time and scope of the search,” according to ICE’s Search and Seizure Handbook, which describes a Blackie’s warrant as a “civil/administrative warrant.”

“The major advantage of the Blackie’s warrant is that there is no need to specifically name the aliens being sought,” the handbook said. “Rather, the Blackie’s warrant and accompanying affidavit need only set forth a plausible basis for believing that there are unnamed illegal aliens present at the location to be searched.”

Gelatt, at the Migration Policy Institute, told us that once ICE enters a place of employment “they can question everybody about their immigration status. And if someone tries to leave the worksite, that would give a probable cause to interview them … or to arrest them, potentially.”

But civil rights advocates say Blackie’s warrants violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects individuals from “unreasonable searches and seizures” and bars the execution of a warrant unless it names “the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”

Jessica Hahn, a senior attorney for the National Immigration Law Center, told the Washington Post that ICE is using Blackie’s warrants “to make an end run around the legal requirements that bind law enforcement.” In an email, Hahn told us that she could only confirm the application for a Blackie’s warrant in Texas, “because the government files these requests under seal.”

In Texas, U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew M. Edison rejected the government’s application for a civil/administrative search warrant, in part, because such a search would be “inherently criminal.”’

In his order, Edison cited a 1986 law that made it a criminal offense to knowingly hire workers living in the U.S. illegally, and federal rule that “requires ‘probable cause to search for and seize a person.’”

“Although the Government bills this search as civil, it is inherently criminal because the owner(s) of the target business face criminal penalties for employing aliens without work authorization,” he wrote. “Moreover, the vehicle for obtaining a warrant to search for a person—an alien is a person—is Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(d)(1), not an administrative warrant.”

Edison issued his opinion on May 27. Even after that ruling, ICE continued its mass worksite enforcement efforts, as it seeks to meet Trump’s promise of “mass deportation.”

In one week in June, ICE announced the arrest of more than 70 workers at a meatpacking plant in Nebraska and more than 80 workers at a racetrack in Louisiana.

In September, ICE and other law enforcement agencies detained 475 workers at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia. According to CNN, the search warrant executed in Georgia identified “four people specifically to be searched, but authorities arrived with substantial personnel and equipment, suggesting an intention to conduct a broader sweep.” The raid resulted in the detention of 317 South Koreans, although that country’s government said the workers were in the U.S. to train Americans to work at the plant. Trump later offered to allow them to remain in the U.S. to complete the training, but only one stayed, according to Reuters.

ICE said it has carried out dozens of “worksite enforcement operations” that have resulted in the arrests of more than 1,000 workers, as of April. (ICE has not responded to our request for updated arrest numbers.)

The overall number of ICE arrests under Trump is up significantly. In Trump’s first full seven months, from February through August, ICE has made 158,766 arrests — up from 55,383 arrests during that same seven-month period last year under Biden, according to ICE detention statistics for “initial book-ins by arresting agency” in fiscal years 2025 and 2024. However, U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrests are significantly down, so total arrests by both agencies are up only 9.3%.

As for deportations, at least 180,000 people have been deported by ICE under Trump, the New York Times reported, citing data through July 29 from the Deportation Data Project at the University of California, Berkeley. The article noted that ICE “is on track to deport more than 400,000 people” in Trump’s first year – which would be short of Trump’s goal of 1 million a year.

Temporary Protected Status, which was created by the Immigration Act of 1990, extends work authorization and deportation protection to nationals from countries suffering from armed conflicts, natural disasters, or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions,” as DHS explains.

As of March 31, there were approximately 1.3 million foreign nationals living in the U.S. from 17 countries designated for TPS by the DHS secretary, according to an Aug. 28 Congressional Research Service report. Close to half of them – 605,015 – were from Venezuela under two separate TPS designations, the CRS report said.

Without elaborating, Project 2025 called on Congress to “repeal” TPS designations. Only Congress can “repeal” an immigration program created by statute. But the Trump administration has been trying for months to terminate protected status for hundreds of thousands of migrants from several countries.

The Department of Homeland Security terminated TPS designations for citizens of Venezuela on Feb. 5, Afghanistan on May 13, Cameroon on June 4, Nepal on June 6 and Haiti on July 1, as well as Nicaragua and Honduras on July 8. In Venezuela’s case, DHS said it was seeking to terminate the designation made in October 2023, which isn’t set to expire until October 2026, but not the 2021 designation of Venezuela, which expired Sept. 10.

There have been court challenges to every termination notice, with mixed results.

On July 1, U.S. District Judge Brian M. Cogan temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating TPS status for Haitians.

On July 31, U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson halted the TPS termination from taking effect for Honduras, Nicaragua and Nepal. “In totality, Plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence demonstrating racial and discriminatory animus in support of their Fifth Amendment claim,” Thompson wrote in her July 31 ruling. “Color is neither a poison nor a crime.”

But an appeals court on Aug. 20 stayed Thompson’s order, allowing Homeland Security to terminate TPS for all three countries while the litigation process continued. The protections ended for people from Nepal on Aug. 20, when the court order was issued, and Sept. 8, as originally scheduled, for Hondurans.

In the cases of Cameroon and Afghanistan, a federal appeals court allowed the legal challenges to move forward but gave only Afghans a brief reprieve from the termination dates set by DHS. In compliance with the court ruling, DHS ended the temporary protections for Afghans on July 21, rather than July 14. The designation ended for Cameroonians on Aug. 4, as scheduled.

All the rulings came after the Trump administration won a key Supreme Court victory in May. In an unsigned order, the justices allowed the Trump administration to end the program for Venezuelans, while the lower court rules on the merits of the case. But after considering the merits of the administration’s case, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Chen on Sept. 5 granted the plaintiffs request for summary judgment, meaning the protections for Haitians and Venezuelans will remain in place.

In his Sept. 5 ruling, Chen wrote that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s “actions in vacating the orders of the prior administration and terminating TPS exceeded the Secretary’s statutory authority and were arbitrary and capricious, and thus must be set aside under the Administrative Procedure Act,” which oversees the process for developing and issuing regulations.

DHS has taken no steps to terminate TPS designations – which can range from six to 18 months — for 10 other countries. Here is a list of those countries and the expiration dates for each: Ukraine and Sudan (Oct. 19, 2026), El Salvador (Sept. 9, 2026), Lebanon (May 27, 2026), Somalia (March 17, 2026), Yemen (March 3, 2026), Ethiopia (Dec. 12), South Sudan (Nov. 3), Myanmar (Nov. 25) and Syria (Sept. 30).

Project 2025 called for “an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,” referring to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. The document blamed the need for a “curtailment” on the Biden administration’s handling of the southern border.

“The State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, which administers USRAP, must shift its resources to challenges stemming from the current immigration situation until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored,” the document said.

Trump, who sharply reduced refugee admissions during his first term, went further than just curtailing the program.

On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order calling for a “realignment” of the refugee program, including an indefinite suspension of refugee admissions until the program “aligns with the interests of the United States.” The program has yet to resume, although Trump made an exception for refugees from South Africa’s white minority Afrikaner ethnic group.

Three nonprofit organizations involved in U.S. refugee admissions — the International Refugee Assistance Project (on behalf of Church World Service), HIAS and Lutheran Community Services Northwest — filed for a preliminary injunction on Feb. 10 to prevent the ban from taking effect while the case moves forward.

The court filing said the impact of the ban was “immediate and severe.” On its website, the Church World Service said that more than 12,000 refugees “completed security screenings” and had their flights to the U.S. cancelled because of the refugee ban. For example, “Pacito,” the lead plaintiff, “was scheduled to travel on January 22 with his wife and baby and had sold all of the family’s possessions and given up their rental house in preparation; he then learned that their travel was canceled,” according to the lawsuit, which uses pseudonyms to protect the identity of all the named plaintiffs.

After months of judicial rulings and appeals, an appeals court ruled (in a clarifying opinion issued April 21) that refugees who had an “approved refugee application” and “had arranged and confirmable travel plans” on or before Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order can enter the country.

About 70 of the 160 refugees affected by the ruling have been resettled in the U.S., IRAP spokesman Spencer Tilger told us in an Aug. 8 email. That includes “Pacito,” the lead plaintiff, who arrived in July. Asked if any of the other 110 refugees have been resettled, Tilger told us in a Sept. 18 email that “unfortunately there haven’t been any changes in the numbers since we last spoke.”

Project 2025 recommended that ICE, working with the State Department, “eliminate or significantly reduce the number of visas issued to foreign students from enemy nations.”

The Trump administration seems to have accomplished that – and not always for just students from “enemy nations.”

Although the administration’s actions directed at foreign students have sometimes been rejected by the courts or rescinded or modified by the administration itself, delays and uncertainties caused by the administration could mean a 30% to 40% decline in foreign student enrollment nationwide this fall, according to modeling by NAFSA: Association of International Educators.

In a July 29 report, the NAFSA attributed the projected decline in the issuance of new visas to four things, including a delay in student visa interviews and a full or partial ban on the issuance of visas for students from 19 countries.

The pause in student visa interviews lasted from May 27 to June 18, which NAFSA called “the peak issuance season for students seeking to enroll in a U.S. institution this fall.” The pause was lifted on June 18, but only after the State Department issued a new policy that “directed U.S. consulates [to] implement new social media vetting protocols.”

The visa ban, which Trump issued June 4, covers students in all 19 countries – the 12 countries that are covered by the full ban (Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen) and seven that are covered by the partial ban (Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.)

NAFSA said F-1 visas, which are for academic students, were down 12% from January to April and declined 22% in May 2025 compared with May 2024, citing State Department data. The State Department hasn’t released monthly data for June, July or August.

But noncitizens must fill out an I-94 form to enter the U.S., and the U.S. International Trade Administration’s monthly data show that the arrival of F and M visa holders (for academic and vocational students and their dependents) declined 25.7% in June, 28.3% in July, and 19.1% in August from last year.

Although Project 2025 refers to China as a “malign influence,” a “geopolitical threat” and an adversary, Chinese students – for now – seem welcome in the U.S.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement May 28 saying, “Under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.” But two weeks later, Trump reversed course.

In a June 11 social media post announcing a tentative trade deal with China, Trump said: “WE WILL PROVIDE TO CHINA WHAT WAS AGREED TO, INCLUDING CHINESE STUDENTS USING OUR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES (WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD WITH ME!).”

But, under the Trump administration, no foreign students are welcome at Harvard University.

Harvard had its Student and Exchange Visitor Program Certification revoked by the Department of Homeland Security on May 22. Court rulings temporarily (May 23) and then indefinitely (June 20) blocked the visa revocation order from taking effect.

In between those rulings, Trump issued a proclamation on June 4 that suspended visas for “any new Harvard student as a nonimmigrant under F, M, or J visas” and directed Rubio “to consider revoking existing F, M, or J visas for current Harvard students.” Trump’s proclamation was also blocked by the June 20 court order, but the order “does not affect the DHS’s ongoing administrative review of Harvard’s F-1 international student program,” the university said.

In response to Trump’s proclamation, Rubio announced a new investigation on July 23 “into Harvard University’s continued eligibility as a sponsor for the Exchange Visitor Program,” referring to Harvard’s J-1 international exchange visitor program. “The investigation will ensure that State Department programs do not run contrary to our nation’s interests,” Rubio said.

For now, Harvard continues to enroll foreign students – although it is unclear what impact the Trump administration’s policies have had on the university’s enrollment for this academic year. The university has not released any enrollment figures, and it did not respond to our request for that data.",https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/P2025-Immigration-720-x-307.png,N,,2025-09-30 19:58:03.667917

Should government funding lapse on October 1 without a deal, the impact will be felt differently across the government agencies that play a role in the immigration system.

Democratic members of the Senate have rejected House Republicans’ plan for a continuing resolution, calling for two major changes in the bill: an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire in December, and a reversal of nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year. While negotiators are still set to meet at the last moment, a shutdown is looking increasingly likely.

In previous years, the broad impact of a shutdown on immigration has been clear ahead of time. But with the Trump administration threatening to use a shutdown to enact further changes on the federal service, as well as the unprecedented sum of $150 billion for immigration enforcement provided in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that is separate from the annual appropriations the immigration agencies already receive, there may be key differences this year.

Here’s what we know so far — with the important caveat that the Trump administration has not released any public agency-specific shutdown plans.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement

The Trump administration has made expanding the work of ICE one of its top national priorities, and since taking office has poured personnel and resources into boosting the agency’s operations and ramping up arrests and deportations. Because most of ICE’s work is deemed “essential” law enforcement work, enforcement and deportation operations would continue without significant impact during a shutdown. That means that throughout the shutdown, ICE would continue the current trends and levels of immigration enforcement including arrests and raids, expansion of the rapidly growing detention system, and deportations.

Separately, the agency typically continues to maintain the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), ensuring no disruption in foreign student enrollment and maintenance of status.

In 2022, ICE estimated that during a shutdown it would have to furlough just 17% of its employees. But the impact of a shutdown on ICE in 2025 may be even more minimal. When Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, it provided ICE with $29.9 billion for enforcement and $5 billion for detention to be spent through September 2029. This unprecedented level of funding can continue even if the broader federal government shuts down, including hiring and expansion of its workforce.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services

USCIS is almost entirely funded by fees paid by immigrants, U.S. citizens, and employers paying for applications. This largely insulates USCIS from shutdowns and permits most of the agency to continue to operate as normal. Application interviews, naturalization ceremonies, biometrics processing, and similar parts of the legal immigration system should remain unchanged during a shutdown.

In 2022, USCIS estimated that only around 1% of its staff would be put on leave during a shutdown. But because USCIS is already facing high backlogs and the diversion of resources from normal adjudication to immigration enforcement, determining the direct impact of a shutdown may be challenging.

The 1% that would be put on leave would still be consequential. The Conrad 30 program, which helps bring doctors to rural America, could be suspended. But the biggest impact would be a shutdown of the E-Verify system, which is funded by Congress and provides one method for determining whether a prospective employee is legally authorized to work in the U.S.

During a shutdown, employers would be unable to access the system and would be required to manually verify I-9 documents, although USCIS may permit alternate verification processes as they have done in the past. While USCIS usually extends the period in which E-Verify compliance is required during shutdowns, there may still be impacts for federal contractors who are required to use E-Verify and employers in states which require the specific use of the E-Verify system.

Executive Office for Immigration Review

By contrast to USCIS, immigration courts—which are housed under EOIR—are almost entirely funded by Congress. They must pause most “non-essential” functions during a shutdown. During previous shutdowns, all non-detained immigration court hearings were deemed “non-essential” and suspended.

Should a shutdown drag on, this could lead to tens of thousands of cases being rescheduled, as with a previous shutdown in 2019 that caused between 80,000-94,000 cases to be put on hold. However, that shutdown came at a time when there were only 1 million pending cases and hundreds fewer immigration judges. With over 3.4 million cases currently pending, a shutdown of the non-detained docket would likely lead to even more cases paused on a daily basis than in 2019.

Detained immigration court hearings are likely to continue as normal, as they have during previous government shutdowns. With the Trump administration detaining a record number of immigrants, this suggests that they may use the opportunity to divert as many judges as they can to hearing detained cases. It is also possible that the Trump administration will deem the non-detained immigration courts “essential” as well, given their mass deportation push.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection

CBP’s law enforcement functions are deemed “essential” and will continue unaffected during a shutdown, although some support staff may be furloughed. In 2022, CBP estimated that only 8% of its employees would be put on leave during a shutdown. Despite the minimal impacts, this could lead to some delays in adjudication of certain applications filed at the border, including L-1 visas.

Like with ICE, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act funding may also provide CBP some cushion to continue operating and paying federal law enforcement officers even during a shutdown. Congress gave the agency $7 billion for Border Patrol hiring and vehicle procurement, $6.2 billion for border technology, and $2.1 billion for border processing.

U.S. Department of State

As with USCIS, State Department visa adjudication and consular services are primarily fee-funded and generally remain operational during government shutdowns. However, if there are insufficient fees to support consular services at a particular consulate or embassy, the post may limit services only to diplomatic visas and adjudication of standard applications only in “life or death” emergency situations.

Shutdown predictions

Should a shutdown occur tonight, the immigration system will be impacted significantly less than other federal agencies. Trump’s signature mass deportation efforts will proceed, perhaps taking even less of a hit than during previous shutdowns given the separate source of funding Congress gave ICE for enforcement. The legal immigration system may see minor impacts in a few areas as support staff are furloughed, but most adjudications and interviews will continue unchanged.

The largest impact of a shutdown would be on the daily operation of the nation’s non-detained immigration courts, which may be put on hold. This could have a secondary impact on ICE, as it would reduce courthouse arrests, but the agency could shift those officers to other duties such as carrying out arrests in communities — or direct officers to call in those who had scheduled court hearings for ICE check-ins and carry out arrests there.

Even if Congress does eventually reach a deal on a continuing resolution, the battle over funding for immigration will continue with the Fiscal Year 2026 funding bill, which could increase ICE funding despite the money included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/immigration-impact-government-shutdown-2025.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 17:57:20.729107

Employees are usually temporarily furloughed during a shutdown, except for exempted workers, and receive back pay after a shutdown ends. But Trump and the White House budget office have suggested permanent firings could be on the table if government funding expires at midnight.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in San Francisco, alleges the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) misinterpreted federal law governing shutdowns when it issued a memo suggesting agencies should “use this opportunity” to consider layoffs for programs with lapsed funding and that aren’t priorities of the president.

“OMB’s Lapse Memorandum is a partisan attempt to pressure members of Congress to accede to the Trump administration’s demands in negotiations over a CR, and to punish federal employees and the labor unions that represent them if those members of Congress do not surrender to the President’s demands,” the lawsuit states.

The Hill has reached out to OMB for comment.

The lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), two of its local units and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

“Announcing plans to fire potentially tens of thousands of federal employees simply because Congress and the administration are at odds on funding the government past the end of the fiscal year is not only illegal – it’s immoral and unconscionable,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.

The unions are represented by San Francisco-based law firm Altshuler Berzon and two left-leaning legal organizations that frequently sue the Trump administration: Democracy Forward and Democracy Defenders Fund.

Still, in an exhaustive and winding 161-page opinion, Judge Young struck out at Mr. Trump’s government across multiple fronts.
Judge Young was the latest in a series of district court judges who have been highly critical of the administration’s actions.

Mr. Rubio, who personally signed off on memos revoking each student’s legal status, has made similar generalizations.","A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled on Tuesday that the Trump administration had used the threat of deportation to systematically silence noncitizens in academia who protested in support of Palestinians, as part of a broader strategy of stamping out campus activism.

The remarkable ruling was a hard-fought win for a coalition of academic and civil rights organizations that had sued to block future deportations of students, arguing that the government has used the threat of “ideological deportation” to punish people for criticizing Israel’s government and its war in Gaza.

Describing the question before him as “perhaps the most important ever to fall within the jurisdiction of this district court,” Judge William G. Young, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, released a scathing rebuke of President Trump, whose administration he said had worked outside the law to curtail First Amendment protections for noncitizens.

Despite finding that the Trump administration had unlawfully trampled noncitizens’ constitutional rights, Judge Young did not immediately block the government from attempting further deportations. Sticking with his usual process, he wrote that he would weigh in on remedies and settle on a way to respond to the government’s policy against student demonstrators at a later date.

Still, in an exhaustive and winding 161-page opinion, Judge Young struck out at Mr. Trump’s government across multiple fronts. Judge Young was the latest in a series of district court judges who have been highly critical of the administration’s actions. The administration has appealed a series of such adverse rulings, in some cases winning success in the appeals courts or at the Supreme Court.

Judge Young cataloged the combative attempts this year by the president and top officials such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio to make examples of visible student demonstrators on campuses such as Columbia, Tufts and Georgetown. He assailed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in general for wearing masks, which he assessed was a tactic “to terrorize Americans into quiescence.”

And he introduced his thinking in the opinion with a scanned image of an anonymous threat that had been sent to his chambers in June, as he considered the case, ominously reading “Trump has pardons and tanks. … What do you have?”

The case, Judge Young wrote, “squarely presents the issue whether noncitizens lawfully present here in United States actually have the same free speech rights as the rest of us. The court answers this constitutional question unequivocally, ‘Yes, they do.’”

He added that the Trump administration’s strategy of scapegoating a few prominent leaders of pro-Palestinian demonstrations was a calculated move, designed to force like-minded academics from abroad into self-censorship.

“The First Amendment does not draw President Trump’s invidious distinction and it is not to be found in our history or jurisprudence,” he added. “No one’s freedom of speech is unlimited, of course, but these limits are the same for both citizens and noncitizens alike.”

The case, which played out over an emotional two-week trial in Boston in July, focused on what the suing coalition described as an altered academic climate in the United States after the arrests of five students in March.

Lawyers for the groups argued that the government’s moves to detain the students, Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi, Badar Khan Suri and Yunseo Chung, had ushered in panic and an intellectual retreat on American campuses, which in turn diminished the output and quality of scholarship focused on the Middle East this year.

They focused primarily on a narrow provision of immigration law that allows the secretary of state to initiate the removal of people whose presence in the United States jeopardizes the country’s foreign policy goals.

In laying the groundwork to deport the students, Mr. Rubio invoked that provision, officially concluding that their role in the student protests that swept the country went beyond antisemitism or hate speech and in fact constituted support for Hamas, the de facto governing authority in Gaza, which the United States has designated a terrorist group.

At the trial, the government argued that it had followed no unified policy of deporting students based on their viewpoint, calling the notion “creative conjuring” during closing arguments. Lawyers for the Justice Department maintained that the State Department was within its rights to single out individual students who had expressed support for forces opposing Israel, which President Trump has held up as a close ally.

The coalition includes two national academic associations that represent faculty across the country. They called faculty members from several universities to testify about instances in which they or their colleagues felt compelled to tone down work that the Trump administration might label hostile toward Israel.

Their testimony was intended to support the lawsuit’s broader claims: that the Trump administration had abused Mr. Rubio’s limited authorities, claiming that its aim was fighting antisemitism while in fact working to undermine pro-Palestinian protests in violation of the First Amendment.

After the trial, lawyers for the groups submitted as additional evidence a list of online posts, media appearances and speeches in which Mr. Trump, Mr. Rubio and various homeland security officials spoke of the arrests as part of a coordinated approach.

“To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: Come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” Mr. Trump declared in a fact sheet in January, accompanying two executive orders related to foreign students.

Mr. Rubio, who personally signed off on memos revoking each student’s legal status, has made similar generalizations.

Throughout the trial in July, Judge Young hammered both sides about potential flaws in their arguments.

Minutes into opening arguments, he interjected to ask a lawyer from the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, which helped argue the case for the academic coalition, how the Trump administration could be in violation of the law when Congress gave Mr. Rubio power to enforce the provision.

“Congress has empowered the secretary personally to revoke visas if, in the secretary’s determination, the presence of the individual embarrasses the foreign policy of the United States,” the judge said. “Now — and from my preparation for the trial, it appears that at least in some cases, if not all, the public officials have relied upon that provision to take action.”

Judge Young fumed at times that the lawsuit seemed to demand that he second-guess the administration’s motives. And he expressed some reluctance to infer from a handful of arrests alone that the government had set out to crush dissent or snuff out a particular viewpoint.

But particularly toward the end of the trial, he appeared equally skeptical that the government and its witnesses had demonstrated that Mr. Rubio used his power to remove lawful residents of the United States appropriately or coherently.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/13/multimedia/00dc-speech-wtlh/00dc-speech-wtlh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 16:57:43.312352

JB Pritzker said on Monday, after police bodycam videos of the incident emerged.

“Two weeks ago, a man was shot and killed by ICE in Franklin Park, Illinois. Shortly after, ICE issued a statement justifying the killing, saying the federal agent was ‘seriously injured,’’’ Pritzker said, referring to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security.

Bodycam videos from Franklin Park police officers showed the hurt ICE agent describing his own injuries as ""nothing major.”

Pritzker on Monday focused on that comment, saying the video “has brought to light that the injuries were — in the agent’s own words — ‘nothing major.’ A man is dead. A community is shaken up. And we are yet again left with more questions than answers.”

The Sept. 12 shooting death of Silverio Villegas González, 38, is at the center of growing tensions over President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration crackdown, more recently the surge in immigration enforcement in the Chicago area this month as part of “Operation Midway Blitz.” The administration said the effort is necessary due to the city’s sanctuary policies that restrict local officials’ ability to aid federal immigration authorities in detainment operations.

At the same time, Trump administration officials have repeatedly said increased immigration enforcement is resulting in ICE agents facing more assaults. A shooter who last week fired at a Dallas ICE facility was targeting ICE agents, according to authorities, citing evidence found at the scene and in the shooter’s devices. Two immigrant detainees died as a result of the shooting and one was injured.

Villegas González was shot and killed on Sept. 12 after two ICE agents pulled him over, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The federal agency said Villegas González dragged one of the ICE officers “a significant distance with his car” after he resisted arrest and attempted to flee — injuring the agent, who “fearing for his own life,” opened fire.

No videos show the actual shooting or the ICE agent being dragged and injured, making it difficult to corroborate DHS’s account of what happened. The agents themselves were not wearing body cameras, a DHS official told NBC News.

To piece together the timeline of events, officials and the community are relying on footage, including surveillance and body cameras from local police who responded to the scene.

The body camera footage from Franklin Park police officers obtained by NBC News through a Freedom of Information Act request captured the ICE agents’ actions in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.

The FBI opened an investigation into Villegas González’s death. DHS and ICE officials have said they believe the ICE agents followed their training and used appropriate force in their interaction with Villegas González while some policing experts have said the agents used tactics that put them and others around them in unnecessary risk.

A traffic stop turns fatal

Villegas González, a single father of two boys, was driving to work after having dropped off his sons, who are 6 and 3, at school and day care on the morning of Sept. 12, according to relatives and friends.

As Villegas González was driving his car, a silver Subaru, a white unmarked Jeep pulled in front of him, according to surveillance footage from a nearby nail salon broadcast by a local CBS News TV station. Two ICE agents are seen getting out of the Jeep. One agent approached Villegas González on the passenger side of his Subaru and the other agent on the driver’s side.

The nail salon’s surveillance footage shows the ICE agents interacting with Villegas González, who had his car’s windows down. As the agents leaned into the car through the windows, Villegas González began to back up his vehicle.

“They tried to get him, but he reversed,” said a truck driver who witnessed the traffic stop and whose trailer was later hit by Villegas González’s car, according to body camera footage from Franklin Park police officers who interviewed him at the scene.

“I didn’t know what was going on,” the truck driver told officers, adding he decided to pull over on the side of the road in an attempt to get out of the way.

As Villegas González then drove his car forward, the ICE officer standing by the passenger side attempted to go after Villegas González. But the other officer on the driver’s side is not visible in the video anymore, the nail salon’s surveillance footage shows.

ICE agents told police Villegas González “attempted to flee in his vehicle while dragging an agent alongside the car,” the incident report states.

Then Villegas González attempted to drive around the truck. “He lost control and crashed into the driver side of the trailer,” the police incident report of the crash states.

The truck driver said he heard at least one gunshot, but was not sure if Villegas González crashed into his trailer as a result of being shot.

Surveillance footage from a nearby auto shop appear to have captured the sounds of at least two gun shots.

A DHS news release following the shooting said ICE agents were after Villegas González because he was an undocumented immigrant “with a history of reckless driving.” An NBC News review of publicly available records found that Villegas González had never been criminally charged, but pleaded guilty to four traffic violations, including speeding in 2013.

After Villegas González crashed into the truck driver’s trailer, the two ICE officers removed him from his car, according to video from a bystander. In that witness video, Villegas González appears to be unconscious and with a bloody wound in the neck area.

ICE officers then began providing first aid to Villegas González on the side of the road and attempted to cover his wound with gauze, according to video shot by the truck driver and obtained by Telemundo Chicago.

This is the scene Franklin Park police first encountered when they arrived.

What police first saw at the scene

“One subject shot,” one of the Franklin Park police officers can be heard saying on his radio, body camera footage shows. Villegas González is seen on the ground, unresponsive, as the ICE agents performed chest compressions.

“He tried to run us over,” one ICE agent told the Franklin Park police officers.

About three minutes later, emergency medical personnel arrived at the scene and took over performing CPR on Villegas González.

Franklin Park police asked the ICE agents if they were OK, according to body camera footage. The ICE agent who was previously seen on the passenger side of Villegas González’s car during the traffic stop appeared not to be injured and put one thumb up.

The other ICE agent, who had been on the driver’s side when Villegas González began moving his car and was apparently dragged, said, “I got a cut.” That agent can be seen moving around with part of his jeans ripped and his left knee bleeding.

Video from one Franklin Park police officer captured a brief conversation between the ICE agents. The injured agent can be heard telling his partner about Villegas González’s children.

“We gotta let them know,” the injured ICE agent said, since they had been following Villegas González before pulling him over, The New York Times reported. “I know he’s got one minor in the day care down here to the left and another one down at the elementary school here.”

A still unresponsive Villegas González is then seen being placed on a stretcher, his right arm dangling off, and put into an ambulance, body camera footage shows.

‘Nothing major’

Video from two Franklin Park police officers captured the ICE agents speaking to federal immigration officials through their radio.

When asked whether they had been injured, ICE agents said, ""left knee injury, some lacerations, elbow,"" referring to the ICE agent who told police he had been dragged. The injured officer then added, ""nothing major,"" putting his arms slightly up to seemingly shrug off concerns following those remarks. His partner then repeated, ""nothing major"" through his radio.

One Franklin Park police officer told the ICE agents he suggested getting them to the hospital, according to the bodycam footage. Both ICE agents agreed.

The injured ICE agent walked to the ambulance to be transported to the hospital. The other ICE agent got on the Jeep to follow the ambulance to the hospital.

Villegas González was pronounced dead at the hospital. A medical examiner later determined he died of multiple gunshot wounds in a homicide.

The ICE agent who was hurt was released from the hospital after receiving care for back injuries, lacerations to the hand and knee tears, according to DHS.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin had said the agent was “in serious condition“ during a TV appearance on “Fox & Friends” a day after the shooting.

When asked for clarification, McLaughlin told NBC News in an email Thursday, “Why is the media smearing our brave ICE law enforcement officer who was dragged by an illegal alien with his car leaving him seriously injured?”

“Despite his injuries, the officer and his partner immediately started administering emergency medical care to the illegal alien,” McLaughlin said, adding that ICE officers are facing growing assaults against them.

McLaughlin had previously told NBC News that the fatal shooting was under review by DHS. On Thursday, she did not comment on the status of that review process.

McLaughlin said the officer who shot Villegas González has been with ICE since 2021 and previously served in another federal law enforcement agency. He also worked as an EMT and served in the military. “This was his first time firing his weapon in a use of force incident,” she said in a news release.

The family of Villegas González in Mexico received his remains on Thursday and mourned him at a funeral in his hometown of Irimbo, Michoacán over the weekend.

“We are in a lot of pain,” Jorge Villegas, Silverio’s older brother, told Reuters through tears. “At least my brother is here now. We can finally give him a Christian burial.”

“He was a good father. He didn’t deserve what happened to him,” Jorge said.

The Mexican Consulate in Chicago is involved in assisting Villegas González’s family with custody matters of his two surviving children.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250925-franklin-park-chicago-emergency-responders-snip-ac-606p-72955f.jpg",N,,2025-09-30 17:57:30.033849

Lawsuits for funding Illinois and other states have also fought the Trump administration’s immigration actions in court in relation to federal funding.","Illinois cannot yet file suit against the federal government for an apparent plan to send federal troops to Chicago, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said, but if boots hit the ground, President Donald Trump “should expect a legal challenge here.”

It would be the latest in a bevy of lawsuits that the state has filed against the Trump administration in relation to immigration.

That includes two lawsuits — one of which Raoul filed Monday — against the administration’s plan to withhold funding from states that don’t cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“None of this chaos, and none of these acts make us safer,” Raoul said Monday, referring to the administration’s efforts to federalize National Guard troops and withhold funding for states that limit law enforcement collaboration with ICE.

House Republicans, meanwhile, called a news conference Tuesday saying they want to “bring down the tension” and once again called for repealing the state’s TRUST Act that prohibits local law enforcement agencies from assisting ICE with civil immigration enforcement.

Legality of troop deployment

Thus far, Illinois officials know little about the federal government’s plan — or if one will even be executed — to send troops to Chicago. Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday the Illinois National Guard learned of a memo from the Department of Homeland Security that requested the Department of War send 100 troops to the city.

Pritzker said DHS sought the activation of troops to protect “ICE personnel and facilities.” He also said he didn’t know whether the troops requested would be Illinois National Guard or from another state.

Over the weekend, armed Customs and Border Patrol officers paraded through the streets of Chicago arresting people, while ICE shot chemical projectiles and rubber bullets at protesters in Broadview, including allegedly at a TV news reporter’s car. As of Monday, the Chicago Tribune reported that federal prosecutors had charged five people in relation to recent protests, including two who were apparently armed.

Raoul noted it is illegal to prevent federal agents from doing their jobs, including trying to block vehicles. But he also said the 10th Amendment “preserves state sovereignty to enforce state laws as they see fit,” previewing his legal arguments should troops arrive.

“The militia clauses of the United States Constitution give Congress sole authority to decide what factual circumstances allow the presidents to federalize the National Guard. They don't exist here,” Raoul said.

In August, a federal judge ruled the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles to engage in law enforcement was illegal. The Trump administration has since appealed. The attorney general of Oregon is also challenging a recent troop deployment.

But it’s unclear whether a judge would deem the apparent purpose of this deployment — to protect ICE and federal buildings, according to Pritzker — as permissible.

“Clearly, this deployment of the Federal officers into our well-policed central business district is meant to provoke Chicagoans,” Raoul said. “What the President is hoping to do is foment chaos by inciting out-of-control protests. So I urge Illinoisans: Don't take the bait. There is no emergency in Chicago. Don't help him create one.”

GOP blames Pritzker

None of the three House Republican leaders who called a news conference Tuesday expressed concerns about the potential deployment of federal troops to Chicago or the actions of ICE and Border Patrol agents in the city.

The Biden administration’s lax border policies made Illinois “unable to keep up with the flood of illegal immigrants coming into the country,” Rep. CD Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said. That affected crime rates and the state budget, he said.

Rep. Jeff Keicher, R-Sycamore, said he believed ICE agents were on Michigan Ave. because of Pritzker’s actions. He criticized Pritzker’s comment, made in Los Angeles last March, that Democrats need to become “street fighters” in the political arena.

“I haven't seen reporting of our governor saying what is occurring with ICE is illegal,” Keicher said. “He just feels it's wrong, and that's the premise of the issue. He should be addressing this through legal challenges. He's choosing not to, because the actions of ICE are legal.”

Pritzker agreed with the premise that everyone should tone down their rhetoric, but he again criticized Trump at an unrelated Tuesday news conference.

“The president of the United States is trying to label the Democratic Party as if it's some terrorist organization,” Pritzker said. “Who is inciting people? It's usually the Republicans and Donald Trump, who are accusing other people of the very thing they are guilty of.”

Keicher said he filed House Bill 4142 to make protestors subject to a Class A misdemeanor if an officer tells them to get at least 14 feet away and the protestor does not comply.

In relation to protests in Broadview, House Minority Leader Tony McCombie criticized Pritzker for calling on Illinoisans to record interactions with ICE and Border Patrol and to seek badge numbers from the masked agents.

“It again goes back to Gov. Pritzker calling people to go there, show up and record, be present,” she said. “If there is something going on there, why is the governor sending citizens to this site? Why is he not sending law enforcement?”

Asked about the CBS-Chicago journalist who said her car was hit by a pepper ball, McCombie responded: “I would highly doubt that ICE was targeting anybody from the media. They're doing their job, trying to protect themselves, the facility and the detainees.”

The reporter said there were no protests happening when her car was hit; the Broadview Police Department said it was investigating.

U.S. citizens allegedly detained

In a new court filing, advocates for immigrant rights allege ICE detained at least three U.S. citizens earlier this month in raids on several suburban communities as part of “Operation Midway Blitz” in the Chicago area.

Lawyers for the National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois allege the citizens were among more than two dozen people arrested since May without warrants or probable cause, which violates a federal consent decree.

Since 2022, ICE has been under a consent decree that stipulates immigration agents cannot arrest people without warrants in the Chicago area unless there’s reason to believe someone is in the U.S. illegally and would flee before a judge could issue an arrest warrant.

The settlement was in response to a 2018 class-action lawsuit during the first Trump administration, which challenged the use of traffic stops to make arrests without warrants. It required ICE to adopt a nationwide policy on warrantless arrests.

The consent decree was set to expire in May, but NIJC and the ACLU petitioned the court earlier this spring to extend it another three years. While a federal judge in Chicago weighs the matter, he ordered that ICE continue refraining from arresting people without warrants. But attorneys argue the Trump administration has gone back on that policy since the president came back into power in January.

Court documents detailed

The court documents, filed Friday and first reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, detail the arrests of 27 people in Chicago and eight suburbs. Among the accounts were arrests of a father driving to church, a grandmother with no criminal history who takes care of her grandchildren, and many people on their way to work.

On Sept. 21, ICE allegedly arrested a man outside his family member’s home in Mount Prospect while he was packing his popsicle cart into his minivan. ICE agents, wearing jackets that allegedly said “POLICE,” asked the man about someone they were looking for. When the man, who has been in the U.S. for more than 20 years, said he didn’t know the person, agents asked for his ID and then arrested him, according to the filing.

In one instance in June, ICE agents showed a warrant to a man outside his home in Chicago. But the name and photo on the warrant did not match the man’s identity. The officers allegedly suggested the man’s driver’s license and state ID were fake and then arrested him. He’s remained in custody for more than three months.

According to the filing, the 27 arrestees in question were not told why they were being detained, and in some cases, ICE officers were masked, did not identify themselves or even display a badge. The filing alleges NIJC has received reports of more than 70 additional arrests that may constitute violations of the consent decree.

On Monday, the Chicago Tribune reported on a family of undocumented immigrants arrested over the weekend at Chicago’s Millennium Park while ICE ramped up its presence downtown. According to the report, federal agents took the family into custody without warrants despite the mother demanding to see one. She and her children, ages 3 and 8, are being held at O’Hare Airport awaiting transfer to Texas before deportation to Guatemala. Her husband is at the ICE processing center in Broadview.

Lawsuits for funding

Illinois and other states have also fought the Trump administration’s immigration actions in court in relation to federal funding.

Last week, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that the federal government cannot withhold emergency funding from Illinois and other states based on those states’ refusal to participate in immigration enforcement.

The judge ruled that the order violates the Constitution because Congress controls spending.

Since then, Illinois learned of another attempt to divert funding, Raoul said.

He’s leading a coalition of 12 attorneys general challenging the reallocation of $100 million in public safety and disaster relief funds “away from Illinois and other states around the country.” Illinois’ cut is worth $30 million, Raoul estimated.

Raoul said DHS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency made the cuts with four days remaining in the fiscal year “without any notice or explanation.” The attorneys general also filed that lawsuit in Rhode Island.

“These funds under the Homeland Security grant program help states protect against acts of terrorism and are a critical source of money for networks of police departments, fire departments, emergency services and public works departments across the country,” Raoul said.

An FBI raid of a residence linked to a suspect accused of pointing a laser at a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) helicopter led to the detention of four individuals found to be in the U.S. illegally.

The individuals have since been taken into ICE Seattle custody. FBI Portland, the field office that carried out the raid, told Fox News Digital that the U.S. Attorney’s Office would likely file charges on Tuesday.

""The federal government will not tolerate violence against federal officers, nor will we tolerate assaults on personal, commercial, or government aircraft,"" FBI Portland wrote in a post on X.

FBI Director Kash Patel spoke out about the incident, warning those who target U.S. law enforcement that they will face consequences.

""Targeting law enforcement will never be tolerated. In Portland, FBI agents and our federal partners swiftly took into custody four individuals here illegally who allegedly aimed lasers at a CBP aircraft. Let this serve as a warning: if you come after the men and women who protect this nation, we will come after you, and you will be put away,"" Patel told Fox News Digital.

The announcement of FBI Portland’s search comes one day after Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo on ending political violence against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

In the memo, Bondi issued a directive to the ATF, DEA, FBI and U.S. Marshals Service to ""immediately direct all necessary officers and agents to defend ICE facilities and personnel whenever and wherever they come under attack, including in Portland and Chicago.""

PORTLAND MAYOR CONDEMNS FEDERAL INTERVENTION, CLAIMS VIDEOS OF ANTI-ICE RIOTS WERE FROM YEARS AGO

Portland has recently seen major protests outside the city’s ICE facility. President Donald Trump said Saturday morning he planned to send troops to Portland at the request of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem.

Trump also said he directed Secretary of War Pete Hegseth to provide ""all necessary troops to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists."" Trump said he was authorizing full force, if necessary.

However, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson dismissed Trump’s plan, claiming there is no lawlessness or violence in the city.

""This is an American city,"" Wilson said. ""We do not need any intervention. This is not a military target.""

The Federal Aviation Administration warns that while laser pointers seem harmless, when pointed at the sky they pose a ""serious threat"" to pilots and their passengers. The FAA said pilots reported 12,840 laser strikes in 2024.

""Pointing a laser at an aircraft is a federal crime. U.S. law enforcement agencies and the Federal Aviation Administration may seek criminal and civil prosecution against violators,"" the FAA’s website reads.

Individuals who shine lasers at aircraft can face FAA fines of more than $32,000 per violation. In 2021, the FAA issued $120,000 in fines for laser strikes.

Lawsuits for funding Illinois and other states have also fought the Trump administration’s immigration actions in court in relation to federal funding.","CHICAGO — Illinois cannot yet file suit against the federal government for an apparent plan to send federal troops to Chicago, Attorney General Kwame Raoul said, but if boots hit the ground, President Donald Trump “should expect a legal challenge here.”

It would be the latest in a bevy of lawsuits that the state has filed against the Trump administration in relation to immigration.

That includes two lawsuits — one of which Raoul filed Monday — against the administration’s plan to withhold funding from states that don’t cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“None of this chaos, and none of these acts make us safer,” Raoul said Monday, referring to the administration’s efforts to federalize National Guard troops and withhold funding for states that limit law enforcement collaboration with ICE.

House Republicans, meanwhile, called a news conference Tuesday saying they want to “bring down the tension” and once again called for repealing the state’s TRUST Act that prohibits local law enforcement agencies from assisting ICE with civil immigration enforcement.

Legality of troop deployment

Thus far, Illinois officials know little about the federal government’s plan — or if one will even be executed — to send troops to Chicago. Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday the Illinois National Guard learned of a memo from the Department of Homeland Security that requested the Department of War send 100 troops to the city.

Read more: Pritzker says feds seeking Chicago troop deployment. ‘What I have been warning of is now being realized’

Pritzker said DHS sought the activation of troops to protect “ICE personnel and facilities.” He also said he didn’t know whether the troops requested would be Illinois National Guard or from another state.

Over the weekend, armed Customs and Border Patrol officers paraded through the streets of Chicago arresting people, while ICE shot chemical projectiles and rubber bullets at protesters in Broadview, including allegedly at a TV news reporter’s car. As of Monday, the Chicago Tribune reported that federal prosecutors had charged five people in relation to recent protests, including two who were apparently armed.

Raoul noted it is illegal to prevent federal agents from doing their jobs, including trying to block vehicles. But he also said the 10th Amendment “preserves state sovereignty to enforce state laws as they see fit,” previewing his legal arguments should troops arrive.

“The militia clauses of the United States Constitution give Congress sole authority to decide what factual circumstances allow the presidents to federalize the National Guard. They don't exist here,” Raoul said.

In August, a federal judge ruled the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles to engage in law enforcement was illegal. The Trump administration has since appealed. The attorney general of Oregon is also challenging a recent troop deployment.

But it’s unclear whether a judge would deem the apparent purpose of this deployment — to protect ICE and federal buildings, according to Pritzker — as permissible.

“Clearly, this deployment of the Federal officers into our well-policed central business district is meant to provoke Chicagoans,” Raoul said. “What the President is hoping to do is foment chaos by inciting out-of-control protests. So I urge Illinoisans: Don't take the bait. There is no emergency in Chicago. Don't help him create one.”

GOP blames Pritzker

None of the three House Republican leaders who called a news conference Tuesday expressed concerns about the potential deployment of federal troops to Chicago or the actions of ICE and Border Patrol agents in the city.

The Biden administration’s lax border policies made Illinois “unable to keep up with the flood of illegal immigrants coming into the country,” Rep. CD Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, said. That affected crime rates and the state budget, he said.

Rep. Jeff Keicher, R-Sycamore, said he believed ICE agents were on Michigan Ave. because of Pritzker’s actions. He criticized Pritzker’s comment, made in Los Angeles last March, that Democrats need to become “street fighters” in the political arena.

“I haven't seen reporting of our governor saying what is occurring with ICE is illegal,” Keicher said. “He just feels it's wrong, and that's the premise of the issue. He should be addressing this through legal challenges. He's choosing not to, because the actions of ICE are legal.”

Pritzker agreed with the premise that everyone should tone down their rhetoric, but he again criticized Trump at an unrelated Tuesday news conference.

“The president of the United States is trying to label the Democratic Party as if it's some terrorist organization,” Pritzker said. “Who is inciting people? It's usually the Republicans and Donald Trump, who are accusing other people of the very thing they are guilty of.”

Keicher said he filed House Bill 4142 to make protestors subject to a Class A misdemeanor if an officer tells them to get at least 14 feet away and the protestor does not comply.

In relation to protests in Broadview, House Minority Leader Tony McCombie criticized Pritzker for calling on Illinoisans to record interactions with ICE and Border Patrol and to seek badge numbers from the masked agents.

“It again goes back to Gov. Pritzker calling people to go there, show up and record, be present,” she said. “If there is something going on there, why is the governor sending citizens to this site? Why is he not sending law enforcement?”

Asked about the CBS-Chicago journalist who said her car was hit by a pepper ball, McCombie responded: “I would highly doubt that ICE was targeting anybody from the media. They're doing their job, trying to protect themselves, the facility and the detainees.”

The reporter said there were no protests happening when her car was hit; the Broadview Police Department said it was investigating.

U.S. citizens allegedly detained

In a new court filing, advocates for immigrant rights allege ICE detained at least three U.S. citizens earlier this month in raids on several suburban communities as part of “Operation Midway Blitz” in the Chicago area.

Lawyers for the National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois allege the citizens were among more than two dozen people arrested since May without warrants or probable cause, which violates a federal consent decree.

Since 2022, ICE has been under a consent decree that stipulates immigration agents cannot arrest people without warrants in the Chicago area unless there’s reason to believe someone is in the U.S. illegally and would flee before a judge could issue an arrest warrant.

The settlement was in response to a 2018 class-action lawsuit during the first Trump administration, which challenged the use of traffic stops to make arrests without warrants. It required ICE to adopt a nationwide policy on warrantless arrests.

The consent decree was set to expire in May, but NIJC and the ACLU petitioned the court earlier this spring to extend it another three years. While a federal judge in Chicago weighs the matter, he ordered that ICE continue refraining from arresting people without warrants. But attorneys argue the Trump administration has gone back on that policy since the president came back into power in January.

Court documents detailed

The court documents, filed Friday and first reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, detail the arrests of 27 people in Chicago and eight suburbs. Among the accounts were arrests of a father driving to church, a grandmother with no criminal history who takes care of her grandchildren, and many people on their way to work.

On Sept. 21, ICE allegedly arrested a man outside his family member’s home in Mount Prospect while he was packing his popsicle cart into his minivan. ICE agents, wearing jackets that allegedly said “POLICE,” asked the man about someone they were looking for. When the man, who has been in the U.S. for more than 20 years, said he didn’t know the person, agents asked for his ID and then arrested him, according to the filing.

In one instance in June, ICE agents showed a warrant to a man outside his home in Chicago. But the name and photo on the warrant did not match the man’s identity. The officers allegedly suggested the man’s driver’s license and state ID were fake and then arrested him. He’s remained in custody for more than three months.

According to the filing, the 27 arrestees in question were not told why they were being detained, and in some cases, ICE officers were masked, did not identify themselves or even display a badge. The filing alleges NIJC has received reports of more than 70 additional arrests that may constitute violations of the consent decree.

On Monday, the Chicago Tribune reported on a family of undocumented immigrants arrested over the weekend at Chicago’s Millennium Park while ICE ramped up its presence downtown. According to the report, federal agents took the family into custody without warrants despite the mother demanding to see one. She and her children, ages 3 and 8, are being held at O’Hare Airport awaiting transfer to Texas before deportation to Guatemala. Her husband is at the ICE processing center in Broadview.

Lawsuits for funding

Illinois and other states have also fought the Trump administration’s immigration actions in court in relation to federal funding.

Last week, a federal judge in Rhode Island ruled that the federal government cannot withhold emergency funding from Illinois and other states based on those states’ refusal to participate in immigration enforcement.

The judge ruled that the order violates the Constitution because Congress controls spending.

Since then, Illinois learned of another attempt to divert funding, Raoul said.

He’s leading a coalition of 12 attorneys general challenging the reallocation of $100 million in public safety and disaster relief funds “away from Illinois and other states around the country.” Illinois’ cut is worth $30 million, Raoul estimated.

Raoul said DHS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency made the cuts with four days remaining in the fiscal year “without any notice or explanation.” The attorneys general also filed that lawsuit in Rhode Island.

“These funds under the Homeland Security grant program help states protect against acts of terrorism and are a critical source of money for networks of police departments, fire departments, emergency services and public works departments across the country,” Raoul said.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WQAD/images/c85260e3-1dae-4d1b-9782-f99e9fd4b368/20250930T193529/c85260e3-1dae-4d1b-9782-f99e9fd4b368_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 16:58:02.827613
,Agencies,2025-09-30 19:37:16+00:00,www.aspentimes.com,"In Colorado mountain communities, some sheriffs are informed of ICE operations - Aspen Times","Ryan Spencer, rspencer@summitdaily.com",,,,,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/colorado-mountain-communities-some-sheriffs-are-informed-of-ice-operations-u-s-immigration-and-customs-enforcement/,"As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts operations in Colorado mountain communities this summer, the federal agency has notified some local law enforcement agencies of its activities — but not others.
“This shift represents a major change, carries new risks, and requires us to adapt,” the Summit County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.
“Our role, as it relates to ICE operations, is community focused.
“As local law enforcement we have no legal mechanism to stop ICE operations in real time.
“As such, it is not standard practice for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to notify local law enforcement of their operations within our jurisdiction.”","As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement conducts operations in Colorado mountain communities this summer, the federal agency has notified some local law enforcement agencies of its activities — but not others.

Sheriffs in Summit, Pitkin and Garfield counties said that they consider it a matter of public safety for federal law enforcement agencies to notify local authorities of operations that are planned in their jurisdictions.

“What we don’t want is a blue-on-blue incident. That’s why you would want to communicate; for that reason more than any reason,” Pitkin County Sheriff Michael Buglione said, noting that ICE has alerted his office of its operations in the county this summer.

Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario agreed that there is “absolutely” a public safety reason why local authorities would want to know about federal law enforcement operations going on in their jurisdictions. In an email, Vallario said that ICE has “usually” notified his office when it conducts an operation in the county.

But in Summit County, Sheriff Jaime FitzSimons said that while ICE has previously notified local law enforcement about its operations in the county, the federal agency didn’t notify his office about its operations there last week .

“This shift represents a major change, carries new risks, and requires us to adapt,” the Summit County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the sheriff’s offices in Grand and Routt counties have said they have no contact with ICE — including notification of operations — due to a Colorado state law that bars local law enforcement from collaborating with the federal agency.

A spokesperson for the ICE Denver Field Office did not respond to questions a reporter sent by email Friday about whether the agency has policies related to notifying local law enforcement about its operations. Instead, they provided a statement saying the federal agency is executing its mission to identify and remove those who have violated the nation’s immigration laws.

“For operational security and for the safety of our law enforcement personnel, ICE does not confirm, deny, or otherwise discuss ongoing or future operations,” the spokesperson said. “The agency publicly announces operational results when appropriate.”

‘Common courtesy’

How ICE notifies the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office of an operation can vary, according to Vallario. It can be a phone call, text or email serving as a “heads up” or a request for support “for public safety purposes,” he said.

If the sheriff’s office knows about a federal operation, Vallario said it can let members of the public who call with questions know that the operation is legitimate. If a threat to public safety should arise from the operation, he said the local sheriff’s office is also more knowledgeable about the Garfield County area.

“If we assist, it’s to let the public know that the operation is legit and legal so they have no worries,” Vallario said. “Also, if someone flees, creating a public safety issue, we usually know the locations better.”

Buglione said it is a “common courtesy” for federal agencies to notify local law enforcement of their operations. If a federal law enforcement agency is conducting an operation, he said it is important for the sheriff’s office to know so that local authorities don’t confuse federal agents for criminals.

Earlier this summer, Buglione said he met with the director of the ICE Denver Field Office, who agreed to let the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office know about any federal operations happening in its jurisdiction.

“We agreed at least three times during that meeting that any ICE activity that takes place in Pitkin County, I will get a call or my dispatch center will get a call notifying us of the operation,” Buglione said. “As far as I know, they’ve kept that promise.”

‘Deconfliction’

For decades law enforcement agencies at every level have typically practiced “deconfliction,” according to FitzSimons, or alerting one another before conducting operations in another’s jurisdiction.

Federal agencies like ICE will issue a deconfliction notification anywhere from days to seconds before an operation begins, according to a statement from the Summit County Sheriff’s Office. The practice has “consistently produced safer outcomes for officers, deputies, and the communities they serve,” the statement reads.

“Deconfliction has always been about safety,” FitzSimons said. “When agencies know who is where and what they are doing, everyone is safer.”

When federal agents conducted operations in Frisco and Dillon Valley on Sept. 16 , FitzSimons said that he was made aware of the operations through dispatch when the agents arrived.

But last week, when ICE conducted another operation in the Dillon Valley area , FitzSimons said the sheriff’s office did not receive any notification from the federal agency that it was in the county.

Local law enforcement cannot do anything to stop an ICE operation, but if they know about it, FitzSimons said they can help inform members of the public about what is going on to help ensure public safety.

“Our role, as it relates to ICE operations, is community focused. To the extent possible, we work to keep the peace and prevent escalation,” FitzSimons said. “As local law enforcement we have no legal mechanism to stop ICE operations in real time. Those checks and balances belong to lawmakers, lawyers, and the courts.”

But if local law enforcement doesn’t know that a federal agency is conducting an operation in the county, FitzSimons said his office can’t assure the public that the operation is legitimate — creating a gray area that could be exploited.

“If ICE chooses not to coordinate, the public may be left questioning who is really at their door or who is approaching them on the street,” FitzSimons said. “That opens the door for criminals to impersonate law enforcement in ways that puts everyone at risk.”

Deputies at the Summit County Sheriff’s Office and local law enforcement agencies are usually identifiable because of their uniforms and badges. FitzSimons said community members can ask to see a deputy’s identification at any time if they are uncertain.

The Summit County Sheriff’s Office enforces state laws, not federal immigration laws, and does not ask about immigration status when someone reports or is accused of a crime, FitzSimons said. State law prevents the sheriff’s office from sharing information with ICE in most situations, he said.

“We continue to encourage everyone to understand their rights,” FitzSimons said. “We are navigating this time with community safety as our foremost objective.”

No notification

Despite local law enforcement in other communities sometimes receiving notification about ICE activities, the sheriff’s offices in Grand and Routt counties have said that they do not receive notification from ICE.

As reports of ICE activity swirled last week , Routt County Sheriff Doug Scherar told the public that his office could not confirm whether any federal law enforcement operations were ongoing in the county.

“Neither the Steamboat Springs Police Department nor the Routt County Sheriff’s Office can confirm these operations, as we do not have any communication with immigration enforcement officials at this time,” Scherar said in a statement at the time.

The Grand County Sheriff’s Office has said Colorado state law prevents it from working with ICE, so local authorities have not received any notification when there have been federal law enforcement activities in the county.

“It is important to clarify that due to Colorado state laws, the Grand County Sheriff’s Office is legally unable to work with, collaborate with, or support federal immigration authorities for civil immigration enforcement actions,” Grand County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Aaron Trainor wrote in a response to a records request from Sky-Hi News. “As such, it is not standard practice for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to notify local law enforcement of their operations within our jurisdiction.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2025/09/26162204/ICE1-scaled-1-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 17:57:40.310869

Jesus & Justice conference march

After asking God to be with the attendees and “all who wander,” Shutt prayed: “Lord, you know the names on my heart today, but there are so many unnamed. There are so many people who are part of Jesus' story that we don't know, and we remember them as we remember all who are in fear” due to enforcement actions. “May we be witnesses to your love.”

Shutt, a former summer fellow for the Presbyterian Office of Public Witness, was one of about 30 people who took part in a silent march and brief vigil on the final day of the Jesus and Justice Young Adult Advocacy Conference in Lansing, Michigan.

The Sept. 28 social justice action served as an opportunity to stand in solidarity with immigrants and refugees amid increased immigration enforcement and to speak out against the violence targeting immigrant communities.

The federal crackdown has included sending National Guard troops to Los Angeles; deporting people to dangerous and sometimes unfamiliar countries; restricting due process; conducting massive workplace raids; enacting travel bans; and confounding people’s efforts to receive permanent legal status or maintain work permits, and to live without fear.

In brief remarks at the Capitol steps, the Rev. Jimmie Hawkins, advocacy director of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), spoke about the importance of not remaining silent about hurtful policies and practices, such as targeting people because they have a particular skin color or language.

“Church, this is wrong and we stand opposed to it,” said Hawkins, adding, “We have been called to do what we do, as ministers, as elders, as deacons, as choir members, as those who work in the kitchen, as those who sweep the floor, as those who have a strand of Christian dignity, to say that this is not of God.”

Prior to the march and vigil, OPW’s the Rev. Christina Cosby led a time of prayer and reflection at the First Presbyterian Church of Lansing that included visiting stations of the cross and a send-off by the Rev. Jihyun Oh, who expressed her gratitude to those gathered, who included some church members as well as some conference participants. Witnessing and advocating in different places where justice needs to happen is part of “the sheer goodness that we can do together,” said Oh, Stated Clerk of the General Assembly of the PC(USA) and interim executive director of the Interim Unified Agency.

Along with remarks, hymns, scripture, singing and prayers, participants were given the opportunity to place flowers on the steps.

The flowers served as symbols of compassion and love and as connectors to prayer vigils around the country being led by grandmothers, mothers and aunties seeking the return of their disappeared loved ones, said Amanda Craft, manager for Immigration Advocacy in the Interim Unified Agency.

“We stand here today and remember siblings,” she said. “The siblings who have been kidnapped, the siblings who have been disappeared, the siblings who have been taken violently, the siblings who have been stripped from their families, the siblings who have been deprived of their legal, civil and human rights, the siblings who have been sent to countries they have no ties to, the siblings who live in constant fear.”

In an interview with the Presbyterian News Service after the vigil, Shutt explained why advocating for immigrants and refugees is important to her.

“The question of immigration is the question of what do we want our community to look like moving forward and who are the people that we want to be surrounded by?” Shutt said. “For a lot of us, including myself, immigrants have been formative and have loved me into being, as Mr. Rogers says, and so making sure that's a possibility for future generations is really important to me.”

Sam Putt, a sophomore at Michigan State University, spoke briefly about his motivation during the vigil.

“As someone who is an international relations major, I think that it's so, so important that we interact with people different than ourselves, to be educated about their culture and their language and even their religion,” he said. “I am a big supporter of interfaith groups. I think that means a lot, and I really hope that we can do more as a country and also as a community” and in all denominations to “make people feel welcome.”",https://pcusa.org/sites/default/files/styles/seo/public/2025-09/Marchers%20main_YAAC%20Sunday_Alex%20Simon_0.JPG?itok=l6Z3K122,N,,2025-09-30 16:57:50.991687

In a statement shared by the League of United Latin American Citizens, the family confirmed that Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, 32, succumbed to his injuries after being removed from life support.

The Mexican man was one of three detainees shot in the Sept. 24 attack on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas. That attack left one man dead and two other detainees critically wounded. Officials previously identified the man who was killed in the attack as Norlan Guzman-Fuentes.

Authorities have said the gunman, 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, fired indiscriminately from a nearby rooftop. They said he hated the U.S. government and wanted to incite terror by killing federal agents. No ICE personnel were hurt in the shooting, and Jahn fatally shot himself following the assault.

The attack happened as heightened immigration enforcement has generated a backlash against ICE agents and stirred fear in immigrant communities across the country.

“My husband Miguel was a good man, a loving father, and the provider for our family,” Stephany Gauffeny said in the statement. “We had just bought our first home together, and he worked hard every single day to make sure our children had what they needed. His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered. I do not know how to explain to our children that their father is gone.”

It also claimed the authority to deport non-citizens who have committed no crimes but whose presence it deems poses a threat to US foreign policy.

In the ruling, Young appeared to also offer a broader critique of the Trump administration.","A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration’s policy to detain and deport foreign scholars over their pro-Palestinian views violates the US constitution and was designed to “intentionally” chill free speech rights.

The case was brought by the national American Association of University Professors (AAUP); its Harvard, Rutgers and New York University chapters; and the Middle East Studies Association (Mesa), following the arrest and detention of several non-citizen students and scholars who have spoken out for Palestinian rights.

In a 161-page ruling issued on Tuesday, the judge, William G Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, called the case “perhaps the most important ever to fall within the jurisdiction of this district court”.

“This case … squarely presents the issue whether non-citizens lawfully present here in United States actually have the same free speech rights as the rest of us,” Young wrote in the ruling. “The Court answers this Constitutional question unequivocally ‘yes, they do’.

“‘No law’ means ‘no law’,” Young continued – a reference to the first amendment’s stipulation that Congress “shall make no law” abridging the freedom of speech. “No one’s freedom of speech is unlimited, of course, but these limits are the same for both citizens and non-citizens alike.”

The plaintiffs had accused the government of running an illegal “ideological-deportation policy” after Trump signed two executive orders in January targeting non-citizens who “espouse hateful ideology” and to combat antisemitism.

The government denied such a policy existed, declaring in court filings that it was the product of plaintiffs’ “imagination” and that officials had made determinations about each individual on a case-by-case basis. It also claimed the authority to deport non-citizens who have committed no crimes but whose presence it deems poses a threat to US foreign policy.

During the trial, the government’s attorneys sought to block the release of documents detailing its processes and reasons for revoking student visas and issuing determinations of removability for green card holders. Several state department officials testified in court that they had been instructed by higher-ups to compile allegations about the individuals targeted, sometimes relying on dossiers from the rightwing Canary Mission, a secretive, pro-Israel group dedicated to doxing thousands of pro-Palestinian scholars.

The case was filed in March and went to trial in July. During two weeks of testimony, both citizen and non-citizen scholars spoke of the “chilling effect” caused on campuses across the country by the arrests of Mahmoud Khalil, Mohsen Mahdawi, Rümeysa Öztürk and Badar Khan Suri. The scholars have since been released while their immigration cases proceed in court.

In a statement, Todd Wolfson, the president of the AAUP, called the Trump administration’s attempted deportation of students over their political views “a betrayal of American values”.

“This trial exposed their true aim: to intimidate and silence anyone who dares oppose them,” he added. “If we fail to fight back, Trump’s thought police won’t stop at pro-Palestinian voices – they will come for anyone who speaks out.”

Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, which represented the plaintiffs, hailed the ruling as “historic”.

“If the first amendment means anything, it means the government can’t imprison people simply because it disagrees with their political views,” he said in a statement. “We welcome the court’s reaffirmation of this basic idea, which is foundational to our democracy.”

The US Department of Justice declined to comment. The state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ruling is widely expected to be appealed, possibly all the way up to the US supreme court.

In the ruling, Young appeared to also offer a broader critique of the Trump administration.

“I fear President Trump believes the American people are so divided that today they will not stand up, fight for, and defend our most precious constitutional values so long as they are lulled into thinking their own personal interests are not affected,” he wrote. “Is he correct?”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a1d9769d20052426bd9b608bb750d2f7df38493/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cf438a0cc0a1c1bd58b7fa13a15baf93",N,,2025-09-30 15:58:18.738070

A Coast Guard plane carrying several dozen people in immigration custody landed in Alaska in early June.

Several of the men said that they didn’t have bathroom access on the plane — or even seats. They flew shackled in the cargo area of the plane.

They’d been transferred from the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington, to the Anchorage Correctional Complex, a facility run by the state Department of Corrections.“From that moment on, I personally felt dehumanized,” said one man who kept a journal from the experience.

Capital & Main is not identifying him or several other people in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement due to retaliation concerns.

Transfers of people in ICE custody between facilities are becoming more and more common under the Trump administration. According to an ICE Flight Monitor report from Human Rights First, transfer flights from January through August increased 43% compared with the same time period last year.

“These frequent transfers not only disorient individuals but also make it significantly harder for them to access legal counsel and maintain contact with family,” the report says.

ICE and the Alaska Department of Corrections did not respond to requests for comment. GEO Group, the private prison company that runs the Tacoma facility, deferred to ICE.

Luis Peralta, who was transferred from Miami to Tacoma, told Capital & Main that officers did not allow him to bring his personal documents with him when they moved him. That meant that he didn’t have access to any phone numbers for family members — his mother’s had been written on a piece of paper in his belongings at the Miami facility.

That also meant he hadn’t been able to reach the attorney that his family found for him, he said. Peralta, who has been in the U.S. since he was a child and was arrested by ICE outside his home in Miami, said he hoped to fight to stay in the U.S. because he has several children here and provides for them.

“Hopefully we don’t get transferred again,” Peralta said. “Being transferred is like the worst experience that anybody could go through.”

He said that during the transfer, officials didn’t tell the group where the plane was headed until they had been flying for several hours. Each man received a piece of bread and cheese and a bottle of water as the only sustenance for the entire day, he said.

Their wrists, ankles and waists were shackled together, he said.

“If something malfunctions in the air, there’s nothing you can do about it,” he said. “It’s very, very, very scary.”

Another man transferred from Miami said that ICE transferred him after a judge approved his request for bond so that he could get out of custody.

“It was like a strategic move,” the man said. “I went to court. The judge approved me for a bond, and literally two days later I was here.”

He said a judge in Tacoma later denied him bond.

“I don’t see like it’s fair to us as human beings to just be shipping us around the country like this,” the man said. “I’m on the other side of the country away from my family. My family can’t come visit me.”

When guards informed men in one of the housing units at Northwest ICE Processing Center that they were being transferred to Alaska, some at first refused to go, according to accounts from several men in the unit.

One man who was waiting to be deported said an ICE officer saw his name on the list and took it off, along with several others, so he stayed in Tacoma. He said other people who were sent to Alaska were also waiting for deportation.

“If I’m waiting to get deported, why would I go to Alaska?” he said. “It makes zero sense.”

After several of the men refused to leave the Tacoma facility, officials threatened them with federal criminal charges, according to multiple accounts. Then officials arrived in riot gear, according to the detainees. Some people used sheets to hold their doors closed, according to the detainees, while others watched, worried that they would be swept up in whatever violence might come, even though they weren’t participating.

Before the officials in riot gear entered the unit, those on the list negotiated with ICE, according to the detainees.

“They’d rather go rather than be hurt and then go,” one man recalled other detainees saying.

The men sent to Alaska said their transfer there meant they spent several weeks in conditions even worse than those they had previously complained about at the Tacoma facility run by GEO Group — conditions that contradict ICE’s own policies and standards.

“I felt frustrated,” José Alvarez recalled in Spanish of his transfer to Alaska. “I felt powerless.”

Several of the men told Capital & Main that they were not allowed to make phone calls for days, so they were unable to inform their families or their attorneys what had happened to them or where they were. Under the ICE detention standards, facilities are required to provide phone access to detainees during waking hours.

When, after several days, one man asked for access to his belongings so he could get a phone number to make a call, a guard at the facility left and returned with other guards who launched pepper spray, according to several of the men.

“You are completely unable to breathe for two days, and you’re coughing every 10 seconds because all the residue is stuck to the walls and the floor,” one man recalled.

The men were held in overcrowded cells, with one sleeping on a mattress on the floor, they said. In another violation of ICE detention standards, they weren’t given daily access to the yard, they said.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska wrote a letter to the Alaska Department of Corrections and ICE about the conditions that the men were held in, including the incident involving pepper spray, which the letter calls a “particularly egregious and excessive use of force.”

The letter says that the facility staff did not follow ICE guidance which would require a consultation with medical staff prior to using pepper spray.

“If they had, they would have been made aware that one of the individuals whom they pepper sprayed was diagnosed with borderline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that exposure to such an irritant could be deadly,” the ACLU of Alaska wrote in the letter.

In the letter, the ACLU noted that it had already sued over conditions in the facility in the state criminal system before ICE moved people in its custody there, and it said that multiple people have died in the facility this year.

“In other words, ACC currently does not safely house those charged with or convicted of crimes,” the ACLU wrote in the letter (emphasis in original). “And immigrant detainees are entitled to even greater protections.”

That’s because people in ICE custody are in civil detention rather than criminal custody, meaning that they cannot be held as punishment and the standards for what custody looks like for them are supposed to be different.

“On June 4, 2025, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) agent asked how many immigrant detainees the Anchorage Correctional Complex (“ACC”) could safely house for longer than 72 hours,” the letter says. “Given the inability of ACC to meet federal standards of care, the answer should have been zero.”

A few of the men were deported while in Alaska. The rest returned to Northwest ICE Processing Center after a few weeks at the Alaska facility.

But as ICE transfers continue to increase, the detainees do not know how long they might remain there.

“We’re not animals,” Peralta said. “Animals are treated better than the way we are being treated in here.”

What we know:

The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) announced Tuesday the death of Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, a 32-year-old Mexican national, who was shot during the attack.

FOX 4 spoke with his wife, Stephany Gauffeny, on Saturday after she received the devastating news that he had been shot. Gauffeny was expecting a call from her husband, but the one she received was not the one she was prepared for.

""They called me, 'Your husband is in the hospital and he’s alive. That's all we know. Go to the hospital,'"" Gauffeny said.

After days on life support, García-Hernández died from his injuries.

He is the second victim to die in the attack. Norlan Guzmán-Fuentes, 37, died shortly after the shooting.

García-Hernández is survived by his wife, four young children, and a fifth child his wife is expecting.

""He was really excited to meet the baby,"" Gauffeny said.

A man with so much to live for, García-Hernández had been in the final stages of fixing his immigration status before the attack.

What they're saying:

His wife pleaded for justice and greater protection for detainees.

""For this to not happen again. These types of attacks… and for this to be prevented. For detainees to have more protection if they're under their custody,"" Gauffeny said.

""I just want people to know. To put a face to a name. You hear about, 'Oh victim,' but he was more than just a victim. He was a real person. He is a real person,"" Gauffeny said, adding, ""A human being. Just because he was a detainee doesn’t mean he was a criminal.""

The family is currently raising money to cover hospital expenses and support García-Hernández’s family, as he was their sole provider.

The Department of Homeland Security told FOX 4 that García-Hernández has a criminal history of giving fictitious information, evading arrest, driving while intoxicated, and fleeing police.

Dallas ICE Facility Attack

The backstory:

The FBI is investigating the shooting at the Dallas ICE facility last Wednesday morning as an act of targeted violence.

Officials said a sniper on the roof of a nearby building fired indiscriminately at the detention center, hitting three detainees who were arriving in a transport van. One of those detainees was killed, and two others were critically injured. No law enforcement officers were hurt.

Sources identified the shooter as Joshua Jahn, 29, who had ties to North Texas and Oklahoma. Investigators said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound as agents approached him.

“Our thoughts are with his family, and this tragedy underscores the terrible cost of dangerous rhetoric and violence against the men and women of ICE who are simply carrying out their sworn law enforcement mission,"" said Emily Covington, ICE spokesperson.

García leaves behind his wife, who is expecting their fifth child, and four young children, LULAC said in a statement. The family had recently moved into their first home.

""My husband Miguel was a good man, a loving father, and the provider for our family,"" García's wife, Stephany Gauffeny, said. ""We had just bought our first home together, and he worked hard every single day to make sure our children had what they needed. His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered. I do not know how to explain to our children that their father is gone.""

The shooting took place last Wednesday when authorities say the shooter fired from the rooftop of a building across the street from an ICE enforcement operations building that's located along Stemmons Freeway in Dallas.

The attack also claimed the life of another detainee, 37-year-old Norlan Guzmán-Fuentes, and left García gravely wounded. The third victim, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, was released from the hospital, according to officials.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the shooter began firing “indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport,” a secure and gated entryway. The detainees were in the van. No ICE personnel were injured.

The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, from Fairview. Jahn used a bolt-action rifle before taking his own life.

Speaking at a meeting of hundreds of U.S. military officials he’d summoned to Washington, Hegseth explained that he wanted to shift training standards to improve retention. Doing that would involve “drastically reducing the ridiculous amount of mandatory training that individuals and units must execute,” he said.

“We’ve already ended the most egregious, now we’re giving you back real time. Less Powerpoint briefings, and fewer online courses. More time in the motor pool, and more time on the range,” Hegseth said.

It’s not entirely clear what online training Hegseth hoped to skip, but he seemed intent on getting officers off the computer and outside. But even in the military, learning is done in a classroom.

For example, Army mandatory training requires trainees to complete virtual courses on anti-trafficking and anti-terrorism, threat awareness, and information security and awareness. But it shouldn’t be all that surprising that Hegseth may be willing to skip out on a course teaching Operational Security, after he shamelessly sent war plans into a group chat with a civilian journalist.

The Army previously reduced the mandatory training standards in April, making it optional for officers to learn the law of war, including what Hegseth termed Tuesday as “the politically correct rules of engagement,” as well as the soldiers’ code of conduct.

If virtual classes won’t teach recruits, what will? Hegseth has an answer: hazing.

“Basic training is being restored to what it should be: scary, tough, and disciplined. We’re empowering drill sergeants to instill healthy fear in new recruits, ensuring future war fighters are forged,” Hegseth said.

“Yes, they can shark attack, they can toss bunks, they can swear, and yes they can put their hands on recruits. This does not mean they can be reckless, or violate the law, but they can use tried and true methods to motivate the troops, to make them the warriors they need to be,” Hegseth continued.

“The tougher and the higher the standards in our units, the higher the retention rates in those units. Warriors want to be challenged, troops want to be tested. When you don’t train and you don’t maintain, you demoralize,” he said.

In fact, combat-deployed soldiers who experience hazing are statistically more likely to experience mental health problems and thoughts of suicide.

While working to improve morale on one end by making training more hands-on, Hegseth plans to remove safeguards preventing trainees from targeted violence from their superiors, as part of his sweeping efforts to transform the U.S. military into a mindless, lawless militia.

Women can say goodbye to combat opportunities in the U.S. military.

Speaking to hundreds of America’s top military commanders at a mandatory in-person assembly in Quantico Tuesday morning, War Secretary Pete Hegseth unveiled his latest efforts to de-woke the country’s armed forces. Unfortunately for half of the population, that included resetting military combat requirements to the “highest male standard only.”

“When it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral,” Hegseth said. “If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it.”

Women made up 17.3 percent of America’s active-duty force in 2021, with more than 231,000 members. That same year, they composed 21.4 percent of the National Guard, according to a demographics report from the War Department.

“But in many ways it’s not their fault, as foolish and reckless as the ‘woke department’ was, those officers were following elected political leadership,” Hegseth said. “An entire generation of generals and admirals were told that they must parrot the insane fallacy that ‘our diversity is our strength.’

“They had to put out dizzying DEI and LGBTQI+ statements. They were told males and females are the same thing. Or that males who think they’re females are totally normal,” he continued.

Despite fearmongering over the supposed rampant encroachment of transgenderism, an August study by UCLA’s Williams Institute found that less than 1 percent of the country actually identifies as transgender. Their representation among those in uniform is even lower—about 0.2 percent of the country’s military has received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, according to February figures from the military.

But fueling the culture wars was at the forefront of Hegseth’s mind. The former Fox News host’s new policies will also discriminate against enlisted people of color by nixing medical beard waivers, a decision that will disproportionately affect Black service members due to the potentially injurious effects of frequently shaving their faces, given the curl pattern of their hair.

“No more beardos,” Hegseth said. “Calling someone to shave, or work hard, is exactly the kind of work force we want.”

(The military has a long and strange history with beards, changing its hygiene requirements and regulations every few decades.)

Any service member who disagreed with the order was welcome to resign, according to Hegseth.

“If the words I’m speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,” Hegseth said. “We would thank you for your service.”

Hegseth has openly said before that he does not believe women should serve in combat roles. During a November interview on the Shawn Ryan Show, Hegseth said, “I’m straight-up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn’t made us more effective. Hasn’t made us more lethal. Has made fighting more complicated.”

The leader of America’s armed forces risked U.S. national security Tuesday in order to taunt the Trump administration’s perceived foreign enemies.

Speaking to the country’s top military commanders during an unprecedented mandatory in-person assembly, Pete Hegseth emphasized that the recently renamed War Department was reimagined for a reason.

“To our enemies: FAFO,” Hegseth said, using an acronym that translates to “Fuck around and find out.”

Hegseth ordered hundreds of U.S. military officials around the globe to meet him at a spontaneous assembly in Virginia, keeping the details of the gathering extremely hush-hush.

There are approximately 800 U.S. generals and admirals in total. Hegseth’s order applied to “all senior officers with the rank of brigadier general or above, or their Navy equivalent, serving in command positions and their top enlisted advisers,” insiders told The Washington Post. It does not apply to military officers who hold staff positions.

The message shocked members of the U.S. military, who could not recall another instance in which a defense secretary summoned so many commanders for a sudden in-person meeting—especially without a clear rationale. Some warned that having so many integral military leaders in one place could pose a national security risk.

As it turns out, the rationale was to rail against the culture wars. Hegseth, pacing back and forth onstage, also leveraged his time in front of America’s military to criticize “woke” ideology. He ordered the armed forces to reset its combat requirements to the “highest male standard only,” a decision that would effectively force women out of the military.

“If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is,” Hegseth said.

The Pentagon chief also nixed medical beard waivers, a decision that will disproportionately affect Black service members due to the curl pattern of the hair on their face.

“No more beardos,” Hegseth said. “Calling someone to shave, or work hard, is exactly the kind of workforce we want.”

New reporting from MSNBC thickens the Tom Homan bribery plot.

Earlier this month, the outlet revealed that Homan was caught accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover agents in September 2024, as part of an FBI investigation that’s since been closed by the Trump administration. The soon-to-be border czar had reportedly promised the agents, who posed as businessmen, he’d help them secure federal contracts once Trump won the election and he assumed his post.

On Monday, MSNBC reported that the FBI investigation into Homan began after Julian Calderas—a former ICE official, who worked under Homan during the Obama administration—allegedly told the undercover agents that Homan could help them eventually score contracts if they coughed up $1 million.

Calderas, who, like Homan at the time, ran his own private government contracting consulting firm, allegedly brought the plan to the undercover agents in May 2023—which ultimately led to the meeting in which Homan accepted the $50,000, and during which Calderas also reportedly accepted $10,000.

According to “sources familiar with the probe,” MSNBC reports, the FBI felt it must initiate an investigation into Homan “after Calderas told agents in an unrelated investigation that Homan was willing to influence which companies would win federal contracts in a second Trump administration in exchange for money.”

When asked if he knew about the criminal investigation, Calderas told MSNBC “I know nothing about this,” and, “If this is the case, I’m going to need to talk to my lawyer.”

That the Homan investigation branched off of an existing investigation into Calderas—an associate and supporter of Homan, per his digital footprint—cuts against the Trump administration’s already fatuous argument that Homan was the victim of a “blatantly political investigation” by the Biden administration “to target President Trump’s allies.”

Democratic Illinois Governor JB Pritzker once again used his bully pulpit to rebuke President Trump after federal agents marched through downtown Chicago, kidnapped people, shot a pepper ball (essentially a paintball full of pepper spray) at a journalist’s vehicle, and fired tear gas at peaceful protesters.

“In any other country, if federal agents fired upon journalists and protesters, when unprovoked, what would we call it? If federal agents marched down busy streets, harassing civilians and demanding their papers, what would we say? I don’t think we’d have any trouble calling it what it is: authoritarianism,” Pritzker said at a press conference Monday afternoon. “So let’s not pretend it’s something else when it happens in our American cities.”

This weekend, there was a surge in federal immigration enforcement in Chicago as armed agents patrolled the city. Pritzker on Monday said that Trump is also planning to deploy 100 military troops to Illinois.

Chicago has been on Trump’s hit list since Trump announced his federal takeover of Washington, D.C., in August, along with multiple other mostly Black cities like Baltimore and Memphis. Earlier this month, Trump posted an AI-generated image of himself dressed as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore—Robert Duvall’s character from Apocalypse Now—with Chicago burning in the background.

Pritzker—along with California’s Gavin Newsom—has been among the loudest voices as governors across America prepare to have their power and state sovereignty stripped. Only time will tell how much they’ll be able to stop Trump, as any resistance to the president’s draconian federal invasions will require cohesion from state leaders, local leaders, businesses, and neighbors. A fight is certainly coming, and Pritzker and Chicago seem up for it.

One of MAGA’s most outspoken proponents is turning on the White House over its handling of the Epstein files.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene—a longtime ally of the president and a standout feature of his sweeping national ideology—was reportedly infuriated by the Trump administration’s hostility toward legislation supporting the unfettered release of the files. But it was a direct threat from the White House over her own support for their release that prompted her to phone a West Wing official.

“I told them, ‘You didn’t get me elected. I do not work for you; I work for my district,’” Greene recalled to The New York Times. “We aren’t supposed to just be whipped on our votes because they’re telling us what to do … or saying, ‘We’ll primary you,’ or that we won’t get invited to the White House events.”

“Me personally? I don’t care,” Greene continued. She explained to the Times that, these days, when the Trump team attempts to corral or control her, she’s “like, ‘[expletive] you.’”

Greene has publicly broken with Donald Trump several times since his inauguration, differing from her “favorite president” on issues ranging from artificial intelligence to Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Viewed as something of a joke when she first arrived on Capitol Hill in 2021, the renowned conspiracist has since become a powerful independent agent, apparently beholden to no party and no man.

“I didn’t get elected with a President Trump endorsement,” Greene told the Times. “It felt really bad at the time, but honestly it’s been the best thing for me. I get to be very independent.”

Meanwhile, the botched rollout of the Epstein files has continued to plague Trump. Instead of simply disclosing the contents of the files, the Trump administration has expended vast resources to reportedly strip the president’s name from the documents. The White House also tapped Epstein’s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell to produce a new list of the deceased financier’s associates, which presumably already exists in the Epstein files. The plot granted Maxwell improved living conditions, moving her to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas, and gave her time on the national stage to ask Trump for a pardon.

The Epstein story has remained an anomaly in Trump’s political career. For the better part of a decade, the MAGA leader became adjusted to an undyingly loyal base that rarely skews from or challenges his political vision. But Trump’s proximity to Epstein and his heinous crimes has been an outlier, prompting doubts that have undercut Trump’s influence with large swaths of his followers.

President Trump’s sweeping new national security memorandum will likely double the FBI’s domestic terrorism watchlist from 5,000 people to 10,000, according to journalist Ken Klippenstein.

Trump issued the National Security Presidential Memorandum 7, or NPSM-7, titled “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence” last week. The memo directs the federal government to investigate and prosecute any person, nonprofit, or entity displaying what Trump calls “indicia” of political violence: anti-capitalism, anti-Americanism, anti-Christianity, and “extremism” on race, gender, and migration.

The memo continues:

This political violence is not a series of isolated incidents and does not emerge organically.... It is a culmination of sophisticated, organized campaigns of targeted intimidation, radicalization, threats, and violence designed to silence opposing speech, limit political activity, change or direct policy outcomes, and prevent the functioning of a democratic society. A new law enforcement strategy that investigates all participants in these criminal and terroristic conspiracies—including the organized structures, networks, entities, organizations, funding sources, and predicate actions behind them—is required.

These broad categorizations would incriminate millions of people, hence the doubling of the domestic terrorism watchlist. The watchlist was created directly after the attacks on September 11, 2001, and also includes the no-fly list.

“Individuals, including U.S. persons (i.e., U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents), may be nominated for inclusion in the terrorist watchlist if they are known or reasonably suspected to be engaged in terrorism or terrorist activities, or are associated with known or suspected terrorists, among other criteria,” the Government Accountability Office wrote in a study just last month. Now President Trump has greatly expanded the parameters, allowing the government to label everyone from George Soros to a few leftists with a Signal chat as domestic terrorists.

In that same study, the GAO acknowledged that “some U.S. persons (i.e., U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents) have been misidentified as being on the watchlist or remained on the watchlist when no longer warranted.” It’s unfortunately likely that this unfortunate, authoritarian trend will only increase tenfold now.

There’s no other way around it—McCarthyism is so back.

President Donald Trump on Monday once again showed his inability to think about geopolitics in terms of anything other than real estate, as he unveiled a shocking Gaza peace plan.

“Let us not forget how we got here,” he said at a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where he touted the new proposed peace plan. “Hamas was elected by the Palestinian people. Israel withdrew from Gaza, thinking they would live in peace. Remember that? A long time ago, they withdrew.”

Trump was referring to Israel’s 2005 removal of its ground troops and settlements from the Gaza Strip (which, contrary to Trump’s telling, occurred before Hamas won legislative elections in 2006).

Israel’s withdrawal, Trump opined, had been a mistake, relinquishing prime real estate along the Mediterranean Sea: “They pulled away. They let them have it. And I never forgot that because I said, ‘That doesn’t sound like a good deal to me.’ As a real estate person, I mean, they gave up the ocean, right?” he said. “They gave up the ocean. I said, ‘Who would do this deal?’”

Notably, Israel did not “[give] up the ocean” in 2005, but retained control over Gaza’s shore, borders, and airspace. And after Hamas seized power in 2007, Israel imposed an indefinite land, sea, and air blockade that remains in place, restricting Gazans’ freedom of movement and access to natural resources.

But, per Trump’s telling Monday, Israel was “very generous” in giving up “the most magnificent piece of land, in many ways, in the Middle East.”

It’s not the first time the president has approached Gaza with this sociopathic lens. In July, Trump (after bizarrely implying he coined the term “the Gaza Strip”) called Israel’s 2005 withdrawal “one of the worst real estate deals ever made,” because Israel “gave up the oceanfront property.”

Israel and the U.S. are “beyond very close” to achieving a peace deal regarding Gaza, according to Donald Trump.

Delivering a slurred speech beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House Monday, the U.S. president claimed it was a “historic day for peace” in the Middle East, underscoring that the two countries were on the cusp of brokering a deal to end Israel’s assault on the West Bank.

“At least we’re at a minimum very, very close, and I think we’re beyond very close,” Trump said.

“Prime Minister Netanyahu was very clear about his opposition to a Palestinian state,” he continued, “and I understand and respect his position on many things, but what he’s doing today is so good for Israel.”

The Trump administration’s plan proposed to end the conflict after Hamas returns the remaining Israeli hostages, living and dead. The militant Palestinian faction will have 72 hours to comply after Israel accepts the agreement, according to Trump.

The plan would additionally have Israeli forces slightly withdraw and exchange their own Palestinian hostages, including 250 Palestinians serving life sentences and 1,700 Gazans who have been in Israeli detention since the war began nearly two years ago.

Trump’s breathless and rambling interpretation of the deal was contradicted by Netanyahu moments later, when the Israeli leader made it clear that he was already on board with the White House’s plan.

“I support your plan for ending the war in Gaza which achieved our war aims,” Netanyahu said.

It was not clear if Hamas agreed to the peace terms, but their consent is apparently not necessary. Trump said Monday that Israel has the “full backing” of the U.S. to defeat Hamas if it refuses the proposed arrangement.

And although Mr. Trump said he was confident that other drugmakers would fall in line, it remains uncertain whether they will make similar concessions.
It was not the first time Mr. Trump has played with this formulation.
During the gathering on Tuesday, Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke about getting rid of political correctness in the military.
Mr. Hegseth defended his firing of more than a dozen military leaders, many of them people of color and women.","In an Oval Office news conference, the Trump administration’s top health officials also announced the launch of a new website, TrumpRx, where Americans will be able to buy drugs directly from manufacturers.

The website is still under construction, and, officials said, it will include products from many major pharmaceutical companies, in keeping with demands the president laid out in an executive order in May.

“We’re ending the era of global price gouging at the expense of American families,” Mr. Trump said.

But the scope of the deal remains unclear. Pfizer has not agreed to cut the prices it currently offers to employers, private insurers and other government programs, like Medicare. And although Mr. Trump said he was confident that other drugmakers would fall in line, it remains uncertain whether they will make similar concessions.

Brand-name drug prices in the United States are three times as high, on average, as those in peer nations. Drug companies already give Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income Americans, significantly lower prices than American employers and other U.S. government programs.

The deepfake video superimposed a cartoon mustache and sombrero over Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who was pictured standing silently while Mariachi music played and the voice of Senator Chuck Schumer was distorted to deliver expletive-laden remarks that included the line, “Nobody likes Democrats anymore.”

Mr. Jeffries responded on Monday night by posting a photograph of Mr. Trump smiling alongside Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

“This is real,” the post said.

In a separate post, Mr. Jeffries wrote, “Bigotry will get you no where.”

As of midday Tuesday, there were no signs that congressional leaders planned to meet again to try to reach a spending agreement.

“We have less than a day,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor, “and Donald Trump is tweeting deep fakes.”

Democrats and Republicans both stuck to their respective demands on Tuesday, and they appeared set to spend the day blaming each other for the impasse and the resulting shutdown that appeared more likely with each passing moment. Republican leaders have insisted that Democrats accept a House-passed bill that would simply extend federal funds at current levels through Nov. 21.

Democrats are demanding more than $1 trillion to extend Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year and roll back cuts to Medicaid and other health program that Republicans included in their marquee tax cut and domestic policy law that was enacted over the summer.

If the Obamacare tax credits are allowed to lapse, about four million people are projected to lose coverage starting next year, and prices would go up for an additional 20 million people. The Congressional Budget Office has projected that 10 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 as a result of the health cuts in the new tax law.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, has said he would be willing to negotiate separately on extending the tax credits. Many of his senators who are up for re-election next year have endorsed the move. But Democrats were taking government funding “hostage,” Mr. Thune said.

“The Democrats’ far-left base and far-left senators have demanded a showdown with the president,” he said on Tuesday. “And the Democrat leaders have bowed to their demands. Apparently, the American people just have to suffer the consequences.”

Mr. Trump and other Republicans continued to hammer at the misleading accusation that Democrats were shutting down the government in order to give health care to unauthorized immigrants.

Mr. Trump’s fake video falsely quoted Mr. Schumer as saying Democrats “have no voters left” because of the party’s positions on social policies and wanted to give “illegal aliens” free health care. The fabricated voice adds that it is a ploy to get undocumented immigrants to vote for them, a claim that embraces a debunked conspiracy theory about noncitizens voting.

“We can’t let people throw around that word,” the president said. “I call it the n-word. There are two n-words, and you can’t use either of them.”

“You can’t use either of them,” he said again.

It was not the first time Mr. Trump has played with this formulation. In past interviews and in a social media post, he has referred to nuclear as “the n-word.” But in those instances, he did not go so far as to refer to the other more commonly understood usage of the phrase.

The context and setting for the remark was also striking. During the gathering on Tuesday, Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke about getting rid of political correctness in the military. Mr. Hegseth defended his firing of more than a dozen military leaders, many of them people of color and women.

He fired the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., who is Black; the first woman to command the Navy, Adm. Lisa Franchetti; and the U.S. military’s representative to the NATO military committee, Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/30/multimedia/live-blog-20250930-trump-government-shutdown-hegseth-header-hjvf/live-blog-20250930-trump-government-shutdown-hegseth-header-hjvf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 13:56:30.297320

Employee furloughs and potential layoffs would halt some government activities. Other functions — like NASA's space missions, Trump's immigration crackdown and certain public health work at FDA and the USDA — would continue.

Here is a look at some of what agencies are planning:

Homeland Security, immigration enforcement would proceed mostly as-is

Most Department of Homeland Security employees would continue to work, reflecting the fact that so much of the department’s workforce is connected to law enforcement or works in areas funded by user fees as opposed to Congressional appropriations.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a plan published on its website that about 14,000 of the agency’s roughly 271,000 employees would be furloughed in the event of a government shutdown. That would include maintaining the vast majority of officers and employees at Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation and Security Administration, Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, among other divisions.

Department activities such as providing Secret Service protection for President Donald Trump, processing cargo and passengers coming into the country and carrying out the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations would continue, the plan said.

Medicare and Medicaid payments would continue — with likely delays

Medicare and Medicaid programs and services will also continue uninterrupted, though staffing shortages could mean delays for some services, like the mailing of Medicare cards. The government has enough money to fund Medicaid for the first quarter of the next fiscal year, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Also, eligible states will continue receiving payments from the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.

FEMA fallout could block some new mortgages

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

While FEMA's core disaster relief functions would not be affected, at least in the short term, other aspects of the agency's work would be impacted. Some grant approvals would be paused, and no new policies could be written under the National Flood Insurance Program, halting new mortgages that require flood insurance.

Still, an extended shutdown could, in a worst-case scenario, exhaust FEMA's existing Disaster Relief Fund, which stands at about $10 billion. House Speaker Mike Johnson warned Monday at the White House that FEMA “won't be funded” during a shutdown.

Plans to address air traffic controller shortage would be upended

Air traffic controllers already certified and on the job would be among the essential workers who would continue during any shutdown but their pay could be affected.

National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels has said that having to work without a paycheck adds stress to controllers who already do a difficult job. He said that in past shutdowns some controllers have even had to get side jobs to help pay bills while the shutdown drug on.

Capt. Jason Ambrosi, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, urged Congress to reach an agreement. “A shutdown threatens the stability of the safest aviation system in the world,"" Ambrosi said.

However, the school that aspiring air traffic controllers attend in Oklahoma City would shut down and students would be sent home, hurting the administration's efforts to address critical shortages in the profession. The disruption in training would likely prompt some to pursue a different career, making it that much harder to eliminate the shortage of 3,000 controllers nationwide.

Also, a shutdown could set back the multibillion-dollar effort to overhaul and modernize air traffic control equipment.

CDC plans widespread furloughs

At the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than half the agency’s workers will be furloughed. Those still working include people who deal with infectious disease outbreaks and care for research animals and maintain laboratories. Federal officials said CDC would continue to monitor disease outbreaks.

Activities that will stop include research into health risks and ways to prevent illness, communications with the public, and work to help state and local officials prevent overdose deaths or other health problems, according to a federal planning document.

NIH research would stall, with patients immediately affected

Research and patient care at the National Institutes of Health would be upended.

Patients currently enrolled in studies at the research-only hospital nicknamed the “house of hope” will continue to receive care during a government shutdown. Additional sick patients hoping for access to experimental therapies can’t enroll except in special circumstances, and no new studies will begin.

Scientists face the prospect of costly laboratory research going to waste because most of the sprawling campus of the nation’s premier medical research agency will empty out.

About three-quarters of NIH’s employees will be furloughed. Those still working include hospital staff and those needed for security or animal care. There’s also a ripple effect because NIH funds basic research and clinical trials at universities and other institutions across the country — and while existing grants aren’t affected, the agency can’t approve any pending applications.

Most core FDA missions would continue

Most of the Food and Drug Administration’s core responsibilities would continue, including responding to public health threats and managing product recalls and drug shortages.

Some routine activities, including previously scheduled inspections of company manufacturing plants, will be halted. But the agency will continue to conduct inspections when it has reason to suspect a problem that could endanger consumers.

Government activities that ensure the immediate safety of the food supply will continue, including food recalls, investigations and inspections of imports. But longer-term food safety efforts, including initiatives aimed at reducing foodborne illnesses, would be paused.

About 86% of the agency’s staff would remain on the job because their work is deemed essential or they are funded by non-federal sources, according to the administration’s shutdown plan. FDA scientists who review drugs, medical devices and tobacco products are mostly or entirely funded by company fees, not the federal government.

State Department plans stateside furloughs, while keeping foreign services open

The State Department expects to furlough more than half of its remaining direct-hire personnel in the U.S., although embassies and consulates abroad will remain open and provide services to American citizens. No permanent layoffs are foreseen.

According to a 71-page plan posted to its website on Monday, the department said that only 10,344 of 26,995 domestically employed staffers whose work has been deemed essential will be exempted from the shutdown furloughs. Employees deemed to “excepted” from shutdown plan are those whose jobs are necessary to respond to emergencies and national security.

‘Significant’ EPA activities would continue

The Environmental Protection Agency says a contingency plan for a possible government shutdown would leave more than 10% of its staff in place to handle “significant agency activities” that are required by law or necessary to protect life and property.

Activities that would continue include protection of EPA land, buildings, equipment and ongoing research, as well as law enforcement and criminal investigations and emergency and disaster assistance, according to a contingency plan. Response work on certain Superfund clean-up sites also would continue, especially in cases where a failure to maintain operations would pose an imminent threat to human life, the memo says.

More than 1,700 employees would be required to go to work if a shutdown begins on Wednesday, the memo said. The agency had about 15,000 employees when Trump began his second term in January but has laid off hundreds of employees and offered voluntary retirement or deferred resignations to thousands more as part of a broader effort by Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to downsize the federal workforce.

Trump’s proposed budget for EPA says 12,856 employees are expected in the budget year that starts Wednesday.

“Our federal government is abusing its power to access American’s personal information, and several states are using that private data to harm voters and our individual right to privacy.
“Yet this administration is trampling on our privacy at the grandest scale, illegally hoarding our sensitive personal information and threatening our most cherished rights.
Together we’ll put a stop to this in court.” “News reports have repeatedly identified ways in which this administration is mishandling sensitive information and putting Americans’ data privacy at risk.
“Pooling sensitive personal records from across the government not only violates the law, it threatens Americans’ privacy, voting rights, and civil liberties.","Washington, DC — The League of Women Voters, League of Women Voters of Virginia, League of Women Voters of Louisiana, and Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), along with five individual plaintiffs, filed a class action lawsuit today challenging the Trump-Vance administration’s unlawful creation of massive government databases consolidating sensitive and legally protected personal information on millions of people in America to unlawfully open investigations and purge voter rolls.

The coalition is represented by Democracy Forward, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), and Fair Elections Center. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, details how the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Social Security Administration (SSA), and other agencies have secretly merged personal data from across the federal government into centralized “Interagency Databases” in direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 and the U.S. Constitution.

The complaint alleges that the administration has unlawfully:

Transformed the DHS’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system into a national citizenship database pooling SSA data known to be unreliable, now being used by some states to purge voter rolls and open criminal investigations.

Built a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) “Data Lake” that combines records from the IRS, SSA, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of Labor, and state voter registration databases — containing Social Security numbers, tax information, medical records, biometric data, and children’s case files.

“Virginians have a right to privacy in their data and protection from unlawful investigations and purges,” said Joan Porte, President of the League of Women Voters of Virginia. “The League is disturbed by this unlawful collection of our data, and we are proud to push back on behalf of our members because every Virginian deserves the assurance that their right to privacy and right to vote will be protected.”

“The consolidation and unlawful use of Louisianans’ sensitive data without our knowledge is alarming and terrifying,” said M. Christian Green, President of the League of Women Voters of Louisiana. “The League is proud to join this fight and stand up for Louisianans’ right to privacy and right to vote.”

“The federal government’s secretive and unlawful collection and consolidation of Americans’ personal data is a clear example of the constitutional crisis we are living through,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters. “Our federal government is abusing its power to access American’s personal information, and several states are using that private data to harm voters and our individual right to privacy. The League is proud to be heading to court to protect voters, our members, and historically disenfranchised communities from illegal government abuse.”

“This country was founded on the principle that government has no business arbitrarily intruding in our private affairs,” said John Davisson, Director of Litigation for the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). “Yet this administration is trampling on our privacy at the grandest scale, illegally hoarding our sensitive personal information and threatening our most cherished rights. The law is clear: no national data bank. Together we’ll put a stop to this in court.”

“News reports have repeatedly identified ways in which this administration is mishandling sensitive information and putting Americans’ data privacy at risk. And now, yet again, this administration is playing fast and loose with our personal information – building exactly the kind of ‘Big Brother’ databases Congress has repeatedly outlawed more than 50 years ago,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “Pooling sensitive personal records from across the government not only violates the law, it threatens Americans’ privacy, voting rights, and civil liberties. We’re in court to stop it.”

“The government’s creation of massive, secret databases of Americans’ personal information, in violation of the law, poses serious privacy and data-security risks and threatens to disenfranchise eligible voters,” said Noah Bookbinder, President and CEO of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “States are already reportedly using these databases to open criminal investigations and to purge state voter rolls based on citizenship information that the government itself has admitted is unreliable. This illegal overreach is unacceptable, and we are proud to represent these plaintiffs as they take action to stop it.”

“The administration’s unlawful consolidation of sensitive data poses an unprecedented threat to naturalized voters’ right to participate in our democracy,” said Jon Sherman, Litigation Director of Fair Elections Center. “Relying on outdated and incomplete data to assess voters’ citizenship status in the present day is completely illogical. This is precisely why Congress enacted safeguards on the use of such information without public notice and input.”

The administration’s unlawful data consolidation threatens to disenfranchise eligible voters and subject Americans to unwarranted investigations, and creates unprecedented security risks by placing sensitive, personal information in a single target-rich system. The lawsuit asks the court to block the administration’s efforts to operate these systems and to order the deletion of unlawfully collected data.

The case is League of Women Voters v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the team at Democracy Forward in this case includes Aman George, Mark Samburg, Hanna Hickman, Sophie Gelber, and Robin Thurston.

This allegation was made on the basis of an interview that was found to be in breach of the basic requirements of procedural fairness.

Mamun Ahmed came to the United Kingdom to work as a skilled worker, but stated that when he arrived he found that his employer was not ready for him to start work. As a result, he spent time visiting his family, including his uncle who owned a takeaway shop.

A few weeks after his arrival, Home Office officers were carrying out a random operation in Birmingham New Street station, and saw Mr Ahmed. One of the officers felt that he looked nervous and so stopped to question him about his leave to remain. Officers interviewed him to see if his leave to remain could be curtailed, whilst Mr Ahmed was sitting on a chair in front of the entire station.

The officer decided that Mr Ahmed was working for his uncle, instead of in the care home that had sponsored him, in breach of the conditions of his visa. They curtailed his leave and detained him for removal.

His Honour Judge Simon accepted the Claimant’s submission that the interview, which had been carried out without an interpreter, without warning him of the risk that he faced, and without a solicitor, in full view of passers by, was in breach of the basic requirements of procedural fairness.

The decision noted that the Claimant had been simply “going about his business” and there was no evidence of measures taken “to ensure that the Claimant’s dignity was preserved, that he was enabled to concentrate on listening to and answering questions in a second language”.

There was no evidence, “let alone compelling evidence”, that he had done anything wrong in the first place when the decision was made to interview him.

HHJ Simon held that in the very specific circumstances of the case, it had been a breach of the requirements of procedural fairness to interview him without affording him “sufficient knowledge and understanding of the gravity of the situation, and the opportunity to reflect on, and communicate clearly, whether he wished someone to be informed and to request this (whether legal advice and/or a responsible individual such as his uncle)”.

Moreover, the fact that he was questioned in a train station sitting on a chair in full view of the public itself made the interview unfair:

“To conduct questioning of the centrality and importance to the Claimant’s immediate and long-term future without any regard to the physical surroundings and their impact on the process created, in my judgment, procedural unfairness.”",https://gardencourtchambers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1694.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 14:57:51.289547

WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed the arrest of 24 illegal aliens in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, with suspected ties to a transnational human trafficking and drug trafficking ring. This was an intelligence driven operation following information received from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) while interviewing victims—including children—of the trafficking and drug ring. The operation took place on September 25, 2025.

The joint operation brought together ICE, the FBI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

“While interviewing victims—many of whom were children— of a human trafficking and drug trafficking ring, ICE identified multiple illegal aliens. In total, ICE arrested 24 illegal aliens including those convicted of sexually assaulting a child, hit and run, DUI, identity theft, and possession of narcotic equipment,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “President Trump and Secretary Noem are dismantling transnational criminal networks and putting the safety of American children FIRST.”

Some of the worst of the worst arrested are below:

Mr. García-Hernández, 32, was taken off life support nearly a week after he was shot four times on Wednesday, including in the neck, while shackled in the back of a government transit van, according to the League of United Latin American Citizens, an advocacy organization.

His wife, Stephany Gauffeny, who is nearing delivery of their third biological child, said in a statement released by the organization that her husband was “a good man, a loving father and the provider for our family.” He had lived in the Dallas area for around 20 years when he was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on a traffic stop.

“We had just bought our first home together, and he worked hard every single day to make sure our children had what they needed,” Ms. Gauffeny said. “His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered. I do not know how to explain to our children that their father is gone.”

She said they were raising funds to help support his family.

In interviews with The Times on Saturday, Ms. Gauffeny and her sister spoke of how Mr. García-Hernández had bought food for the homeless and recently shared his money with other detainees in federal custody.

Garcia-Hernandez had been on life support after a sniper shot at the facility from a rooftop in what authorities called a targeted act of violence towards federal immigration agents. However, all of the victims were detainees.

He had lived in the U.S. for two decades but did not have legal status. He was detained at the facility after being arrested on August 8 for driving under the influence.

In a statement, his wife Stephany Gauffeny described Garcia-Hernandez as a ""good man, a loving father, and the provider for our family.""

""We had just bought our first home together, and he worked hard every single day to make sure our children had what they needed,"" Gauffeny said. ""His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered. I do not know how to explain to our children that their father is gone.""

Garcia-Hernandez was a father of four kids, ages 3, 8, 12 and 14. The couple was expecting a fifth child — Gauffeny can give birth anytime now since she's 39 weeks pregnant, she said.

In an interview with NPR on Saturday, Gauffeny said, ""before he got arrested … he had told me, 'OK, my next paycheck, you know, we're gonna go out and buy the baby all this stuff.'""

""And, you know, it never happened,"" she said, with tears in her eyes.

Under President Donald Trump's nationwide immigration crackdown federal agents are on orders to aggressively go after people they believe are in the country illegally.

The increasingly violent arrest encounters have resulted in multiple, multi-million-dollar tort claims by people – including American citizens – who say they were severely harmed or wrongfully detained during ICE operations.

Department of Homeland Security leaders have accused alleged use-of-force victims of resisting arrest, assaulting agents or impeding law enforcement operations.

""If you lay a hand on our law enforcement, we will prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Sept. 19 post on the social media site X.

Business owner says he wanted to show agents employee paperwork

Shouhed, the owner of Valley Car Wash in Van Nuys, California, filed a $50 million tort claim Sept. 26 against DHS and its component agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, claiming agents ""illegally and unlawfully assaulted and battered"" him during their operation.

A DHS spokesperson said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY that agents arrested ""five illegal aliens from Guatemala and Mexico who broke our nation's immigration laws"" and that Shouhed ""impeded the operation and was arrested for assaulting and impeding a federal officer.""

ICE detained Shouhed for nearly 12 hours, according to the tort claim; he was not charged with a crime.

James DeSimone, the attorney representing Shouhed in his claim said the car wash owner told agents to let him show his employees' work authorization paperwork. DeSimone said surveillance video clearly shows Shouhed ""isn't engaging in threatening conduct.""

""Instead of talking to him, they just immediately resort to force and force that was very brutal,"" DeSimone said.

Rebecca Shouhed said she ""went crazy"" after seeing the video. ""He has had a heart attack. He has three stents in his heart.""

Shouhed, the father, said in a news conference after the Sept. 9 incident, that agents only repeated: ""You do not f— with ICE. You do not f— with ICE.""

Other recent claims against DHS for 'excessive force'

Shouhed's isn't the first tort claim against DHS this year.

In another, in August, the wife and daughter of a farmworker who died following an ICE raid on a California cannabis greenhouse claim ICE agents clad in battle gear used ""excessive force"" that resulted in the fatal fall that killed Jaime Alanís, 56.

Alanís died of blunt-force head and neck injuries two days after the raid, according to family and the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office. His widow and daughter are each seeking $47 million.

Separately, in August, U.S. citizen and Iraq War veteran George Retes filed a tort claim against DHS seeking unspecified damages after ICE agents allegedly broke his car window and arrested him at an ICE roadblock in Southern California and held him for three days without access to an attorney.

All three claims were filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which can precede a lawsuit in federal court.

The FTCA was created to allow people to sue the federal government when they are harmed by government employees, according to the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit law firm representing Retes in his claim. The legislation requires plaintiffs, before suing in court, to first submit claims to the responsible federal agencies.

In its fiscal 2025 budget report, ICE said its litigation division was defending, as of fiscal 2023, more than 350 administrative tort claims seeking over $55.5 billion in damages. The agency had paid out just $813,565 in completed claims, according to the report.

""It appears to be the pattern of these agents to resort to force at any time when they are questioned or confronted,"" DeSimone said.

What DHS guidelines say about using force

A 2018 policy memo – written and distributed during the first Trump administration – provides detailed guidance on when and how Homeland Security law enforcement officers may use force.

They may use force ""to control subjects in the course of their official duties as authorized by law, and in defense of themselves and others."" To meet the standards of the 4th Amendment, the DHS guidelines require use of force to be ""objectively reasonable"" in a given situation.

The guidelines also recognize that law enforcement officers ""are often forced to make split-second judgments, in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving."" Use of physical force must stop ""when resistance ceases or when the incident is under control.""

There have been few public consequences this year for ICE and other federal agents captured on video manhandling immigrants, protestors or bystanders.

But an unnamed ICE agent was ""relieved of current duties"" in September after video circulated showing him slamming a distraught woman to the floor inside an immigration court building in New York City.

Rebecca Shouhed said she is concerned for what's to come, as Trump's crackdown widens.

""Nobody is able to rein this in,"" she said. ""It’s like a free for all.""

Immigrants' Rights.
For Jane, Andrew, and Thomas, this fight may be long, but they hope to see it won, for their children’s sake.","*Some names have been changed to protect identities.

When Jane* learned that the Supreme Court greenlit President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship, she immediately panicked. The order was slated to take effect July 27. Jane’s first child was due just 10 days later.

Jane was filled with desperation and confusion. She wanted her son to be protected and to have the constitutional rights guaranteed to someone born in the U.S. She just wanted to do whatever was best for him. Fueled by fear, she went so far as to ask her doctor if she could be induced early so that her son would be born before July 27.

“Of course, they were like, ‘No, it’s not medically advised,’” Jane says. “I felt incredibly guilty for even bringing it up.”

Parents like Jane have been faced with fear and uncertainty since Trump signed the executive order on his first day in office. The ACLU and partners sued in January, taking swift action to block Trump’s cruel and lawless attempt to deny babies their constitutional rights. A complex legal battle followed. The Trump administration took several other challenges by states and other groups to the Supreme Court, asking it to limit lower courts’ ability to block his unlawful executive order using universal injunctions. The Supreme Court ruled in Trump’s favor, but families like Jane’s stood with the ACLU and our partners in immediately filing a second lawsuit, this time a class action, Barbara v. Donald J. Trump. The court then certified tens of thousands of U.S.-born babies as a class and blocked the executive order from impacting this class while the case proceeded.

While this was a victory for families like Jane’s, the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict constitutional rights turned what should have been the happiest moments into a time of stress and uncertainty.

""It’s not easy being an immigrant because there’s just so many hoops you have to jump through,” says Jane, who will soon obtain lawful permanent residence. “One of my biggest joys of giving birth here was knowing my son would never have to go through any of the issues that we’ve been through as immigrants.”

""One of my biggest joys of giving birth here was knowing my son would never have to go through any of the issues that we’ve been through as immigrants.”

Jane now has hope. She’s found it in the fact that her son’s passport, which is only issued to citizens, recently arrived in the mail. Her son even stayed still for his photo.

For others, months of fear around birthright citizenship has instead sowed feelings of doubt and hopelessness. When Thomas* and his wife arrived in the U.S. six years ago, he saw America as a land of hope, possibility and community. Thomas was thrilled to reunite with his wife’s father, a U.S. citizen who had lived in the country for close to two decades, and build their family.

Now, Thomas is preparing to leave the U.S. with his newborn son.

“It’s sad — I feel like I don’t really have a choice,” he says. “I would like my baby to grow up in the country where he was born, experiencing the good the U.S. has to offer. But right now, I can barely see those good things anymore.”

“I would like my baby to grow up in the country where he was born, experiencing the good the U.S. has to offer. But right now, I can barely see those good things anymore.”

Thomas’s son was born in the shadow of Trump’s executive order. Thomas has feared for his son since before he was born, worried that Trump would find a way to override the 14th Amendment and further terrorize his family.

“The Constitution says my son has the same rights as every American born here. It shouldn’t matter who his parents are,” he says. “He deserves the same life as other American kids.”

Thomas fears being “disappeared” by ICE and separated from his family. Simple routines — going to work, buying groceries — now carry risk. “Since police have been working with ICE, I don’t feel safe when I see a police car,” he says. “I feel like I’m in a place that’s not safe, and that’s the opposite of how I felt when I first came here.”

The decision to leave has not been easy. Thomas and his family spent years learning the culture, rules, and laws in the U.S. Just when they started to feel like they belonged, everything changed. Thomas has been ridiculed for speaking a foreign language in public and told to “go back to Mexico,” a place he’s never even been.

“The way people look at us, the way they talk to us — it’s changed. And now we have a president saying that kind of behavior is okay?” Thomas says, dismayed. “We’re planning to move back to our home country to make sure our son is safe,” he says. “Leaving is hard, but we have to do what’s best for our baby.”

Andrew*, another father facing the same uncertainty, insists he and his wife will stay and fight for their daughter’s constitutional rights.

“I remember I read the 14th Amendment and thought: if you’re born here, you’re a citizen,” Andrew says. “When the executive order came out, I thought it was just a political move.”

When Andrew first came to the U.S., Trump’s narrative was aimed at immigrants without legal status. Andrew didn’t worry for his family because he and his wife are here lawfully, albeit on a temporary status. But when the executive order targeted families with status as well, and the Supreme Court handed the Trump administration a procedural win, he realized that lawful status may not be enough to protect them. His daughter was still in danger.

“What if my daughter is considered American until she’s six and then her rights are revoked?” he wonders. “How will I tell her that her citizenship has been denied? Citizenship is not my right, but it is her right.”

Like his daughter, Andrew’s siblings also have birthright citizenship. They have been free to leave the U.S. when they wanted and to seek out various employment opportunities, without ever having to think about contingency plans. The contrast between his experience and his siblings’ has shown him what’s at stake if his daughter loses status. For Andrew, this fight is not only legal, but deeply personal.

“It makes me sad that this harms babies because they don’t have a voice yet, they don’t have legal resources,” he says. But Andrew is determined, and he wants his daughter to know that her rights are worth defending. “As a parent I am always going to protect my child.”

“My child is now a political debate,” Andrew says. “In 10 years, if she loses citizenship, she will know that despite the consequences, a lot of people fought for her.”

“My child is now a political debate,” Andrew says. “In 10 years, if she loses citizenship, she will know that despite the consequences, a lot of people fought for her.”

Right now, the class action win ensures that all children are protected from the order, and there is no reason for families to fear whether they need to move, give birth in another state, or take other drastic steps to secure their children’s citizenship. But the fight is not over. The government has asked the Supreme Court to hear the birthright citizenship issue in the coming months. The court will have to decide whether to hear the appeals — and if it does, more written legal briefs and oral arguments will follow, likely next year.

At the ACLU, we know that no one should ever be subject to a total erasure of their rights and, beyond the law, birthright citizenship is and has always been central to who we are as a nation. For Jane, Andrew, and Thomas, this fight may be long, but they hope to see it won, for their children’s sake.

“I don’t want my son to have to worry about any of those things,” Jane says. “Eventually, it’ll be a story. And yes, he’ll know his family story”

After his meeting on Monday with the Democrats, Trump shared a crude post on Truth Social that showed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., with fake AI-generated audio, saying Democrats “have no voters anymore, because of our woke, trans bulls---” and that if they give undocumented immigrants health care, they would vote for his party.

The post depicted Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also of New York, wearing a sombrero and a mustache as he stood silently by Schumer's side. Mariachi music played in the background.

The video referenced a Trump talking point that Democrats are demanding health care for undocumented immigrants in exchange for their votes to keep the government open. Democrats have called that a lie. They have pushed to extend expiring Obamacare subsidies and to undo Trump's Medicaid cuts, not to pay for health care for people who are in the country illegally.

Schumer responded to the video on X, writing: “If you think your shutdown is a joke, it just proves what we all know: You can’t negotiate. You can only throw tantrums.”

Jeffries had tough words for Trump during a news conference on the steps of the Capitol on Tuesday morning. ""Mr. President, next time you have something to say about me, don’t cop out through a racist and fake AI video,"" Jeffries said, surrounded by dozens of rank-and-file Democrats. ""When I’m back in the Oval Office, say it to my face.""

The House leader also shared a photo on X of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender. ""This is real,"" Jeffries wrote above the photo, which was taken at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in 1997. (Trump has said he and Epstein had a falling out, and he was unaware of the financier's crimes.)

The personal insults at this late stage suggest the two sides are nowhere close to an agreement to keep the government's lights on past Tuesday's deadline. The government is set to shut down at 12:01 a.m. unless the two sides can reach a short-term stopgap funding deal.

“It looks to me like we’re headed for a shutdown,"" said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. ""And you know me, I’m the most optimistic person you know.”

Federal agencies, including the Defense and State departments, have already posted their plans for how they will operate in the event of a shutdown.

The impacts of a shutdown would be felt by many. In that scenario, none of the millions of federal workers would be paid, and hundreds of thousands of them would be furloughed. In recent days, White House officials had tried to allow military personnel to continue receiving pay during a shutdown, according to a source familiar with the discussions, but those efforts were unsuccessful. So service members wouldn’t be paid during a shutdown, either.

And the White House has threatened to fire federal workers in a shutdown as well. Asked Tuesday morning how many government employees his administration would lay off, Trump responded: ""Well, we may do a lot, and that’s only because of the Democrats.""

With the two parties trading insults rather than serious proposals, political theater has taken over the Capitol.

Democrats filed onto the House floor during a pro forma session Tuesday as the party's top appropriator, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, attempted to offer her party's plan to keep the government open. But Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., who was presiding, did not acknowledge her and quickly adjourned.

“Shame on you!"" some Democrats jeered at Griffith.

Democrats on the floor had a poster with Speaker Mike Johnson’s face on it and the words: “Missing Person.” Johnson, R-La., was in the Capitol on Tuesday and attended the Trump meeting a day earlier. But the House left town Sept. 19 after passing a seven-week funding bill and is not set to return until Oct. 7.

On Tuesday evening, just hours before the shutdown deadline, the GOP-controlled Senate will hold votes on competing Democratic and Republican plans to avert a shutdown. Both bills are expected to fail, just like they did when they were brought to the floor earlier this month and failed to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass.

The GOP bill had cleared the House on a party-line 217-212 vote but was rejected 44-48, far short of the 60 votes needed to break a Democratic filibuster.

Republicans have said Democrats can avert a shutdown by simply voting for the House-passed continuing resolution, or CR, which would fund the government at current levels through Nov. 21.

But Democrats said they are trying to stave off a looming health care ""crisis."" Specifically, Democrats want any CR to include an extension of Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. They have also pushed for rolling back some of the cuts and changes to Medicaid that were enacted in Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" earlier this year.

Speaking to reporters in the Capitol after Monday's meeting with Trump, Schumer said Trump appeared to be ""not aware"" of the impacts of expiring Obamacare subsidies on everyday Americans. And he urged Trump to try to convince GOP leaders on Capitol Hill to back a deal to extend those subsidies.

""It’s now in the president’s hands,"" Schumer said, with Jeffries at his side.

September 30, 2025 (Sacramento) -- California Attorney General Rob Bonta, as part of a multistate coalition, yesterday sought emergency relief from the U.S. District Court for the District Court of Rhode Island to stop the unlawful reallocation of hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Homeland Security Grant Program funding away from states like California.

President Donald Trump has said he plans to eliminate FEMA completely as early as December and return responsibility for disaster prevention, response and relief for survivors entirely to states. “""We want to wean off of FEMA, and we want to bring it back to the state level,"" the president said in JUNE, NPR reported, adding that the agency would immediately ""give out less money"" to states recovering from disasters.

For decades, California has relied on this funding to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorism and other catastrophes such as wildfires, floods and earthquakes. In each presidential administration, this funding had been allocated even-handedly on the basis of need and risk. On Saturday, however, California and other states received award notifications that were significantly lower than anticipated — without justification and seemingly based on their states’ decision to use their law enforcement resources to protect public safety rather than assist in federal immigration enforcement, Bonta’s office advises.

In filing the lawsuit, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition assert that this reallocation exceeds FEMA’s statutory authority, is arbitrary and capricious, and violates the U.S. Constitution.

“The Trump Administration is setting a record as one of the most anti-law enforcement, anti-public safety administrations in America’s history,” said Attorney General Bonta. “Tell me, how does defunding California’s efforts to protect against terrorism make our communities safer? President Trump doesn’t like that we won’t be bullied into doing his bidding, ignoring our sovereign right to make decisions about how our law enforcement resources are best used to protect our communities. We secured a permanent injunction last week blocking the Trump Administration’s illegal efforts to condition this funding, and today, we’re seeking emergency relief to keep them from unlawfully diverting Congressionally-appropriated Homeland Security funding away from our state without justification and apparently because they don’t like our commitment to public safety. Unlike this President, I will always step up and defend California’s safety.”

The Trump Administration seeks to reduce California’s funding for two Homeland Security Grant Programs. The State Homeland Security Program assists state, local, and tribal efforts in building, sustaining, and delivering capabilities necessary to prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond to acts of terrorism. The Urban Area Security Initiative assists high-threat, high-density urban areas in addressing terrorism threats. Specifically, these program grants enhance cybersecurity, support infrastructure security enhancements, and fund trainings and exercises designed to test and improve emergency preparedness and terrorism prevention. These funds are also utilized to procure specialized equipment including detection systems for chemical and biological agents, specialized response vehicles, personal protective equipment for first responders, security cameras, and warning systems, among other uses. Congress created these federal grant programs and appropriates billions of dollars each year to ensure they are fully funded to meet the nation’s needs. And for decades, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its sub-agency, FEMA have operated these programs evenhandedly — until the Trump Administration.

On January 20, 2025, his first day in office, President Trump directed DHS to “ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions do not receive access to Federal funds.” The President deemed certain states and jurisdictions in “lawless insurrection,” despite the fact that courts have upheld laws like California’s SB 54 as constitutional and consistent with federal immigration law and firmly rebuked the Trump Administration’s attempts to condition federal funds on assistance with immigration enforcement. Just last week, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a permanent injunction in California’s lawsuit blocking the Trump Administration’s effort to unlawfully impose immigration enforcement requirements on billions of dollars in annual DHS grants. Yet, DHS and FEMA remain undeterred from continuing to attempt to carry out the President’s directive.

On Saturday, September 27, FEMA issued award notifications for its single largest grant program — the Homeland Security Grant Program, which totals approximately $1 billion in funds annually. Consistent with federal law, FEMA has previously issued notices of funding opportunity preliminarily allocating the funding among state recipients based on each jurisdiction’s “relative threat, vulnerability, and consequences from acts of terrorism.”

According to that notice, California could expect to receive approximately $165 million in grant funding. However, when California received the grant notification, the award was only $110 million, reflecting a 33% reduction.

Some states saw even sharper cuts: Illinois received a 69% reduction in funding, and New York received a 79% reduction. At the same time, many other states saw increases to their allocation upwards of 100%. While the states are still gathering information, a defining factor appears to be whether a state was a so-called “sanctuary” jurisdiction or not. In short, the current Administration appears to be taking money from its perceived “enemies” and reallocating it to its “friends.”

In their lawsuit, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition argue that the reallocation of this grant funding is unlawful and should be vacated and set aside. The Homeland Security Act requires DHS and FEMA to allocate Homeland Security Grant Programs funds using objective, risk-based criteria. Instead, the reallocation appears to rest on another factor: California and other states’ domestic policies about how to best utilize their domestic law-enforcement resources. The reallocation also is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, withdrawing hundreds of millions of dollars from states like California with no explanation and based on factors Congress did not intend DHS to consider. Finally, the reallocation violates the Constitution, by baselessly treating California differently from other states.

In their motion for a temporary restraining order, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition ask the court for immediate, emergency relief requiring FEMA to rescind the award notifications and blocking FEMA from disbursing funding that would then potentially be unavailable to California and other states if they are successful in the litigation.

Government barrels toward shutdown as the blame game heats up

and

Reporting from The U.S. Capitol

The federal government is barreling toward a shutdown tonight, with President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders engaged in a fierce blame game and trading insults about each other online.

After his meeting on Monday with the Democrats, Trump shared a crude post on Truth Social that showed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., with fake AI-generated audio, saying Democrats “have no voters anymore, because of our woke, trans bulls---” and that if they give undocumented immigrants health care, they would vote for his party.

Schumer and Jeffries face a big leadership test in the shutdown fight

+2

, and

House and Senate Democratic leaders Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer may be at very different stages in their leadership careers. But both New York Democrats have a lot to prove — and a lot to lose — in the high-stakes government shutdown battle.

For the 55-year-old Jeffries, this is his first real shutdown fight since taking the House reins from Nancy Pelosi 2 ½ years ago. While he was gearing up for a funding fight back in March, Schumer was not on board and ultimately helped Republicans keep the government open. Now, Jeffries — who has sometimes faced internal criticism for being too scripted and cautious — is fully leaning into the spending showdown with Trump and the GOP.

And the House Democratic caucus seems to be relishing in the shutdown swagger from their leader. At a closed-door caucus meeting Monday night, rank-and-file Democrats rallied behind Jeffries, giving him a pair of standing ovations as he reiterated that any deal with Republicans must include more health care funding, three members told NBC News.

Trump says his administration plans to 'fully embrace' the Department of War

Trump said in his speech that his administration plans to make ""more historic announcements"" in the coming months to ""fully embrace the identity of the Department of War.""

""I love the name. I think it’s so great. I think it stops wars,"" Trump said, without elaborating on the plans. ""The Department of War is going to stop wars.""

Trump signed an executive order earlier this month to rebrand the Defense Department as the Department of War, but it's a secondary title. Congress would have to pass legislation to formally change the department's name.

Trump says Hegseth will announce 'major reforms' to boost military sales

Trump said that Hegseth would soon be announcing ""major reforms to streamline military acquisitions and expedite foreign military sales.""

""We have tremendous numbers of countries that want to buy our equipment, and you know, many cases, it takes too long. They’re backlogged,"" Trump said.

The president said defense companies needed to make military equipment faster, adding that he told them, ""you better get your ass going,"" because ""we're getting countries to buy your equipment.""

Trump says he told Hegseth to use U.S. cities as military 'training grounds'

Trump characterized the country as being at war at home, explaining he was refocusing the military to help law enforcement domestically. He praised the National Guard troops in D.C. and railed against other Democrat-led cities such as San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles.

""They're very unsafe places, and we're going to straighten them out one by one,"" Trump said. ""And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room. That's a war, too. It's a war from within. Controlling the physical territory of our border is essential to national security. We can't let these people in.""

Trump said he told Hegseth ""we should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military — National Guard, but our military, because we’re going into Chicago very soon.""

The president also argued that the country was ""under invasion from within.""

""After spending trillions of dollars defending the borders of foreign countries, with your help, we’re defending the borders of our country from now on,"" Trump said.

Trump says Portland, Oregon, 'looks like a war zone'

Trump said in his remarks that Portland, Oregon, ""looks like a war zone"" and that ""this place is a nightmare.""

""It looks like a war zone, and I get a call from the liberal governor. 'Sir, please don't come in. We don't need you.' I said, 'Well, unless they're playing false tapes, this looks like World War II, your place is burning down,'"" he said.

Trump mocked the governor of Oregon, who he said claimed his law enforcement personnel had Portland under control. The president said he told the governor that the city is a ""nightmare.""

Trump has authorized the deployment of the National Guard to Portland, but Oregon and the city have sued the administration over the move.

Trump revives idea of making Canada the 51st state

During his speech before the military brass, Trump revived his previous idea of making Canada the 51st state of the United States.

He said Canada called him a couple of weeks ago and Trump claimed its leaders expressed interest in being part of the missile defense shield Trump has dubbed the Golden Dome.

""They want to be part of it, to which I said, 'Why don't you just join our country? You become 51, become the 51st state, and you get it for free,"" he said. ""So I don't know if that made a big impact, but it does make a lot of sense ... because they're having a hard time up there in Canada now, because, as you know, with tariffs, everyone's coming into our country.""

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has emphatically said that his country would never join the U.S.

Trump: 'The purposes of American military is not to protect anyone’s feelings'

and

Trump said that the military would be ""bringing back a focus on fitness, ability, character and strength.""

""That's because the purposes of American military is not to protect anyone's feelings,"" he said. ""It's to protect our republic, and it's the republic that we dearly love. It's to protect our country.""

The comments mirrored Hegseth's speech, who emphasized that the military would focus on issues like fitness standards and ensure promotions were based on merit, not other factors.

Trump says he thought a peace deal between Putin and Zelenskyy would be 'the easiest one of them all'

Trump said in his remarks that he thought he would be able to strike a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

The president said it's been ""such an honor"" to play a role in ending conflicts around the world during his second term.

""And then we have Putin and Zelenskyy, the easiest one of them all, I said, that one, I'll get done. I thought that was going to be first,"" he said.

Despite months of negotiations and a summit with Trump and Putin in Alaska, the two sides don't appear to be any closer to ending the war.

Trump criticizes autopens, praises 'beautiful paper'

Trump dedicated part of his speech to criticizing Biden's use of the autopen.

""How would you like to have your thing signed by an autopen?"" Trump said. ""You know, when I have a general and I have to sign for a general, because we have beautiful paper. They're gorgeous paper. I said, 'Throw a little more gold on it. They deserve it. Give me — I want the A paper, not the D paper.'""

Later, Trump praised his own signature, saying, ""I love my signature, I really do. Everyone loves my signature.""

""I always think to myself, 'How can you have an autopen sign this?'"" he said. ""It's just so disrespectful to me. It's just totally disrespectful.""

Biden's use of an autopen is a favorite attack of Trump's, although it's not clear how often Biden used an autopen. Trump has previously used an autopen, too.

Trump discusses nuclear weapons: 'Frankly, if it does get to use, we have more than anybody else'

Trump referred to deploying nuclear submarines near Russia earlier this year after a Russian official referenced nuclear weapons.

""We were a little bit threatened by Russia recently, and I sent a submarine, nuclear submarine, the most lethal weapon ever made,"" Trump said. ""Number one, you can't detect it. There's no way. We're 25 years ahead of Russia and China in submarines.""

""Frankly, if it does get to use, we have more than anybody else,"" Trump said, referring to the U.S. nuclear arsenal. ""We have better, we have newer, but it's something we don't ever want to even have to think about.""

Trump says 'there are two N-words and you can't use either of them'

Trump addressed the U.S.' nuclear capabilities and noted the power of nuclear weapons.

""You don't have to be that good with nuclear. You could have one-twentieth what you have now and still do the damage that would be, you know, that'd be so horrendous,"" he said.

Trump said that people shouldn't ""throw around"" the word nuclear. ""I call it the N-word. There are two N-words, and you can't use either of them.""

Trump takes the stage to silence from military officials: 'I've never walked into a room so silent before'

The audience was quiet when Trump walked onstage, which is typical for a military event.

Trump, though, began his remarks by noting that he has ""never walked into a room so silent before.""

Some in the audience laughed, prompting Trump to joke, ""Don't laugh, you're not allowed to do that.""

""Just have a good time,"" he added. ""And if you want to applaud, you applaud. And if you want to do anything you want, you can do anything you want. And if you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room. Of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.""

People laughed, and Trump told the audience to ""feel nice and loose.""

Trump says U.S. could go after cartels 'by land'

Asked on his departure to Quantico whether he was preparing to take military action against Venezuela, Trump responded: “We’ll see what happens,” adding that drug trafficking into the U.S. by sea had stopped since the U.S. carried out several strikes on boats.

“We had a lot of drugs coming in through water — we call water drugs, just a simple term,” Trump said. “We don’t have any boats on the water. There are no boats. There are no fishing boats. There are no anything. So we hit a number of boats. You probably saw that, and since we did that, we have absolutely no drugs coming into our country via water, because it was lethal.”

Trump said the U.S would now shift its attention to cartels. “We’re going to look very seriously at cartels coming by land,” he said.

NBC News has reported that the U.S. military is drawing up plans to target drug traffickers inside Venezuela, and that drone strikes could begin in a matter of weeks.

Trump says Hamas has 3 to 4 days to respond to Gaza peace plan

Trump said this morning that Hamas will have three to four days to respond to the Gaza peace plan he outlined yesterday.

There is “not much” room for negotiation on the proposal, Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for Quantico.

The president repeated the remark he made during the unveiling of the plan yesterday that if Hamas rejects the deal, he would let Israel “go and do what they have to do.”

Hegseth says he's overhauling the watchdog and equal opportunity programs

Hegseth said in his speech that he is issuing new policies that will overhaul the Defense Department inspector general and equal opportunity programs.

""I call it the 'no more walking on eggshells' policy,"" he said. ""We are liberating commanders and NCOs. We are liberating you.""

""We are overhauling an inspector general process — the IG that has been weaponized,"" he said.

""We’re doing the same with the equal opportunity and military equal opportunity policies,"" he said. ""No more frivolous complaints, no more anonymous complaints, no more repeat complaints, no more smearing reputations. No more endless waiting, no more legal limbo. No more side-tracking careers, no more walking on eggshells.""

Hegseth said that being racist in the military has been illegal since 1948, an apparent reference to President Harry Truman's order banning segregation and discrimination. ""The same goes for sexual harassment. Both are wrong and illegal. Those kinds of infractions will be ruthlessly enforced.""

""But telling someone to shave or get a haircut or to get in shape or to fix their uniform or show up on time to work hard, that’s exactly the kind of discrimination we want,"" he said.

Hegseth said officers should leave the service if they don't agree with him

Hegseth told officers that if they don’t like what they're hearing from him, they should leave the service.

“If the words I’m speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,” he said.

In his remarks, the defense secretary ticked off 10 new directives for the military, including new physical fitness standards for all troops and the hundreds of officers in the audience, and touted his efforts to rid the military of “wokeness” and “dudes in dresses.”

Some officers may disagree with the direction he is taking the military, Hegseth said. He aded that they may be so inculcated with what he called the culture of previous administrations — led by “foolish and reckless political leaders” that created the “Department of Woke” — that as a result they should leave the service. Others, he said, want to be warriors and will stay.

“We may lose good people,” he said.

Trump threatens to fire military leaders he dislikes 'on the spot'

Trump threatened to fire military leaders he disliked ""on the spot.""

""I'm going to be meeting with generals and with admirals and with leaders, and if I don't like somebody, I'm going to fire them right on the spot,"" he said.

His remarks to reporters came shortly before traveling to address military officials in Virginia.

Hegseth says 'no more beards, long hair, superficial individual expression'

Hegseth said the Pentagon would crack down on ""grooming standards.""

""No more beards, long hair, superficial individual expression,"" he vowed. ""We’re going to cut our hair, shave our beards and adhere to standards.""

Hegseth said if someone wants a beard, then ""join special forces.""

""We don’t have a military full of Nordic pagans, but unfortunately, we have had leaders who either refuse to call BS and enforce standards or leaders who felt like they were not allowed to enforce standards,"" he said.

Hegseth said if someone cannot meet male physical standards for combat, cannot pass a physical test or does not want to adhere to grooming standards, ""it’s time for a new position or a new profession.""

Hegseth decries 'fat troops,' says they're 'tiring to look at'

In his remarks, Hegseth launched into cultural and standards changes within the military, including criticizing ""fat"" military personnel during his address.

""Frankly, it's tiring to look out at combat formations or really any formation and see fat troops,"" he said. ""Likewise, it's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon.""

""It's a bad look,"" he added.

Hegseth said troops will be required to hit height and weight requirements and take fitness tests twice a year. He added that all troops will be required to perform physical fitness activity every day on duty.

""Most units do that already, but we’re codifying,"" he said.

Hegseth says if new military standards prevent women from serving in combat, 'it is what it is'

Hegseth said in his remarks that his new policies aren't meant to block women from serving in the military, but then he detailed physical ability standards that could ultimately prevent them from serving.

""This is not about preventing women from serving,"" he said. ""We very much value the impact of female troops. Our female officers and NCOs are the absolute best in the world. But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral.""

He continued, ""If women can make it, excellent. If not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result. ... It will also mean that we mean that weak men won't qualify because we're not playing games. This is combat. This is life or death.""

His comments come after announcing last week that he had eliminated an advisory committee that has provided advice on polices related to women in the military for nearly 75 years. Hegseth's press secretary, Kingsley Wilson, said that the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services advanced “a divisive feminist agenda.”

Hegseth faced heat during his confirmation process for comments he had made in the past suggesting women shouldn't serve in combat positions.

Hegseth says the Pentagon will review its definitions of 'toxic leadership,' 'bullying' and 'hazing'

Hegseth said that upholding and enforcing high standards was ""not toxic.""

""Leading war fighters toward the goals of high, gender neutral and uncompromising standards in order to forge a cohesive, formidable and lethal Department of War is not toxic,"" he said.

He continued, asserting that it would be ""toxic leadership"" to endanger ""subordinates with low standards"" or promote people on a nonmerit basis.

""That’s why today at my direction, we’re undertaking a full review of the department’s definitions of so-called toxic leadership, bullying and hazing to empower leaders to enforce standards without fear of retribution or second guessing,"" he announced.

He clarified that people cannot ""do nasty bullying and hazing.""

Words like ""bullying,"" ""hazing"" and ""toxic"" have ""been weaponized and bastardized inside our formations, undercutting commanders and NCOs,"" he said, referring to other enlisted leaders.

Hegseth assails 'wokeness' in the military: 'If that makes me toxic, so be it'

Hegseth is speaking at Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia, and announced a series of steps he is taking to restore what he has called the “warrior ethos” to hundreds of senior officers he summoned to Washington, lecturing them on how they must adhere to grooming and physical fitness standards, leading with an eye on more lethality and less “wokeness.”

Standing on a stage in an auditorium at the base, Hegseth told the officers how they should lead, and explaining to them that they must adhere to merit-based standards, maintain better grooming standards for themselves and their troops and keeping up their physical appearance and fitness.

“We’re not talking hot yoga and stretching,” he said.

If the new standards don’t go over well, that’s because standards must be high.

“No more setting, achieving and maintaining high standards is what you all do and if that makes me toxic, so be it,” he said.

Hegseth is repeating many of his routine talking points but announcing other new initiatives, restructuring how troops

“No more frivolous complaints, no more anonymous complaints, no more repeat complaints, no more smearing reputations, no more endless waiting, no more legal limbo, no more sidetracking careers, no more walking on eggshells,” he said.

'We are done with that s---': Hegseth says U.S. military is done with DEI policies

Hegseth began his speech by outlining how the Trump administration is ending DEI-related policies.

""For too long, we’ve promoted too many uniform leaders for the wrong reasons — based on their race, based on gender quotas, based on historic so-called firsts,"" he said. There are no gender quotas in the military, according to the 19th.

Hegseth said that the Defense Department became ""the woke department."" He said the administration has ""done a great deal from day one to remove the social justice, politically correct and toxic ideological garbage that had infected our department, to rip out the politics.""

""No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses, no more climate change worship, no more division, distraction or gender delusions,"" he said. ""As I’ve said before and will say again, we are done with that s---.""

U.S. extends funding for Cambodia demining amid foreign aid cuts

The U.S. is providing $675,000 for demining programs in Cambodia, the U.S. Embassy said, after foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration raised fears for the future of the lifesaving work in the Southeast Asian nation.

“The United States is proud to be the largest demining donor to Cambodia, contributing over $220M since 1993, including $12M this year to enable Cambodian families to live and thrive in peace,” the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh said in a post on X.

The U.S. is estimated to have dropped 500,000 tons of bombs on Cambodia during the Vietnam War, remnants of which still dot the countryside. From 1979 to 2024, landmines and unexploded ordnance killed nearly 20,000 people and injured more than 45,000 others in Cambodia.

The announcement follows a visit to Cambodia by several members of Congress.

Trump’s Gaza peace plan met with support, and skepticism, as world awaits Hamas response

Trump‘s peace plan was met with cautious optimism today by leaders across the Middle East and the world, but others were more skeptical about the proposal — and whether it would be welcomed by Hamas.

The plan was unveiled by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after talks that appeared to exclude Hamas, with the militant group saying “not a single Palestinian” had seen the plan before it was announced.

As the world awaited Hamas’ response, global powers lined up behind the U.S.-backed plan to end the Israeli assault and free hostages still held in the devastated Palestinian enclave.

Trump and Hegseth will both deliver remarks this morning at an unusual gathering of hundreds of military leaders at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia.

Hegseth called the meeting to highlight the U.S. military's accomplishments and discuss the the future of the Defense Department under his leadership, an official who knew of the plans said.

That includes prioritizing homeland defense over threats from China, Russia, Iran and terror groups, as will be outlined in the coming National Defense Strategy, the official said.

A major Democratic demand in the shutdown fight could help the GOP in the midterms

Reporting from Washington

On the brink of a shutdown, the top two Democratic leaders met with Trump in the White House yesterday and urged him to agree to extend Obamacare subsidies that expire at the end of the year in a bill to keep the government open.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said they had to explain the imminent consequences of inaction to Trump. People who get health insurance through Obamacare will begin getting notices in the coming days warning that their premiums will soon go up unless Congress extends the funds.

It has become the central demand of Democrats in exchange for their votes to fund the government, which will shut down at midnight tonight unless there is a deal.

Do federal employees get back pay after a shutdown ends?","WASHINGTON — Congress’ failure to pass a short-term government funding bill before midnight Tuesday will lead to the first shutdown in nearly seven years and give President Donald Trump broad authority to determine what federal operations keep running — which will have a huge impact on the government, its employees, states and Americans.

A funding lapse this year would have a considerably wider effect than the 35-day one that took place during Trump’s first term and could last longer, given heightened political tensions.

The last shutdown didn’t affect the departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs, since Congress had approved those agencies’ full-year funding bills.

Lawmakers had also enacted the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, exempting Capitol Hill from any repercussions.

[RELATED: As government shutdown looms, CT Dems push for ACA subsidies]

That isn’t the case this time around since none of the dozen government spending bills have become law. That means nearly every corner of the federal government will feel the pain in some way if a compromise isn’t reached by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.

States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau offers you a quick guide to what could happen if Republicans and Democrats don’t broker an agreement in time.

How does the White House budget office determine what government operations are essential during a shutdown?

Generally, federal programs that include the preservation of life or property as well as those addressing national security continue during a shutdown, while all other activities are supposed to cease until a funding bill becomes law.

But the president holds expansive power to determine what activities within the executive branch are essential and which aren’t, making the effects of a shutdown hard to pinpoint unless the Trump administration shares that information publicly.

Presidential administrations have traditionally posted contingency plans on the White House budget office’s website, detailing how each agency would shut down — explaining which employees are exempt and need to keep working, and which are furloughed.

That appears to have changed this year. The web page that would normally host dozens of contingency plans remained blank until late September, when the White House budget office posted that a 940-page document released in August calls for the plans to be “hosted solely on each agency’s website.”

Only a few departments had plans from this year posted on their websites as of Friday afternoon.

The White House budget office expects agencies to develop Reduction in Force plans as part of their shutdown preparation, signaling a prolonged funding lapse will include mass firings and layoffs.

While the two-page memo doesn’t detail which agencies would be most affected, it says layoffs will apply to programs, projects, or activities that are “not consistent with the President’s priorities.”

Trump will be paid during a shutdown since Article II, Section 1, Clause 7 of the Constitution prevents the president’s salary from being increased or decreased during the current term.

No one else in the executive branch — including Cabinet secretaries, more than 2 million civilian employees and over 1 million active duty military personnel — will receive their paycheck until after the shutdown ends.

Are federal courts exempt from a shutdown since they’re a separate branch of government?

The Supreme Court will continue to conduct normal operations in the event of a shutdown, according to its Public Information Office.

The office said the court “will rely on permanent funds not subject to annual approval, as it has in the past, to maintain operations through the duration of short-term lapses of annual appropriations,” in a statement shared with States Newsroom.

As for any impact on lower federal courts, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said the federal judiciary was still assessing the fiscal 2026 outlook and had no comment.

The office serves as the central support arm of the federal judiciary.

During the last government shutdown from late 2018 into early 2019, federal courts remained open using court fee balances and “no-year” funds, which are available for an indefinite period.

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has said that if those funds run out, they would operate under the terms of the Anti-Deficiency Act, which “allows work to continue during a lapse in appropriations if it is necessary to support the exercise of Article III judicial powers.”

Supreme Court justices and appointed federal judges continue to get paid during a government shutdown, as Article III of the Constitution says the judges’ compensation “shall not be diminished” during their term.

What happens to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid?

The three programs exist largely outside of the annual appropriations process, since lawmakers categorized them as “mandatory spending.”

This means Social Security checks as well as reimbursements to health care providers for Medicare and Medicaid services should continue as normal.

One possible hitch is the salaries for people who run those programs are covered by annual appropriations bills, so there could be some staffing problems for the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, depending on their contingency plans.

The first Trump administration’s shutdown guidance for the Social Security Administration showed 54,000 of 63,000 employees at that agency would have kept working. The CMS plan from 2020 shows that it intended to keep about 50% of its employees working in the event of a shutdown. Neither had a current plan as of Friday.

Will the Department of Veterans Affairs be able to keep providing health care and benefits?

Veterans can expect health care to continue uninterrupted at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics in the event of a shutdown. Vets would also continue to receive benefits, including compensation, pension, education and housing, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs contingency planning for a funding lapse that is currently published on the department’s website. It’s unclear if the plan will be the one the Trump administration puts into action.

But a shutdown would affect other VA services. For example, the GI Bill hotline would close, and all in-person and virtual career counseling and transition assistance services would be unavailable.

Additionally, all regional VA benefits offices would shutter until Congress agreed to fund the government. The closures would include the Manila Regional Office in the Philippines that serves veterans in the Pacific region.

All department public outreach to veterans would also cease.

Will Hubbard, spokesperson for Veterans Education Success, said his advocacy organization is bracing for increased phone calls and emails from veterans who would normally call the GI Bill hotline.

“Questions are going to come up, veterans are going to be looking for answers, and they’re not going to be able to call like they would be able to normally, that’s going to be a big problem,” Hubbard said.

“Most of the benefits that people are going to be most concerned about will not be affected, but the ones that do get affected, for the people that that hits, I mean, it’s going to matter a lot to them. It’s going to change the direction of their planning, and potentially the direction of their life,” Hubbard said.

The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for current VA shutdown guidance.

What happens to immigration enforcement and immigration courts?

As the Trump administration continues with its aggressive immigration tactics in cities with high immigrant populations, that enforcement is likely to continue during a government shutdown, according to the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance for operating in a government shutdown.

Immigration-related fees will continue, such as for processing visas and applications from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

And DHS expects nearly all of its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees to be exempt — 17,500 out of 20,500 — and continue working without pay amid a government shutdown.

That means that ICE officers will continue to arrest, detain and remove from the country immigrants without legal status. DHS is currently concentrating immigration enforcement efforts in Chicago, known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Other employees within DHS, such as those in Transportation Security Administration, will also be retained during a government shutdown. There are about 58,000 TSA employees that would be exempt and continue to work without pay in airports across the country.

DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for a contingency plan if there is a government shutdown.

Separately, a shutdown would also burden the overwhelmed immigration court system that is housed within the Department of Justice. It would lead to canceling or rescheduling court cases, when there is already a backlog of 3.4 million cases.

The only exceptions are immigration courts that are located within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detention centers, but most cases would need to be rescheduled. The partial government shutdown that began in December 2018 caused nearly 43,000 court cases to be canceled, according to a report by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC.

And 28 states have an immigration court, requiring some immigrants to travel hundreds, or thousands, of miles for their appointment.

States that do not have an immigration court include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

Will people be able to visit national parks or use public lands during a shutdown?

Probably, but that may be bad for parks’ long-term health.

During the 2018-2019 shutdown, the first Trump administration kept parks open, with skeleton staffs across the country struggling to maintain National Park Service facilities.

Theresa Pierno, the president and CEO of the advocacy group National Parks Conservation Association, said in a Sept. 23 statement the last shutdown devastated areas of some parks.

“Americans watched helplessly as Joshua Trees were cut down, park buildings were vandalized, prehistoric petroglyphs were defaced, trash overflowed leading to wildlife impacts, and human waste piled up,” she wrote. “Visitor safety and irreplaceable natural and cultural resources were put at serious risk. We cannot allow this to happen again.”

The National Park Service’s latest contingency plan was published in March 2024, during President Joe Biden’s administration. It calls for at least some closures during a shutdown, though the document says the response will differ from park to park.

Restricting access to parks is difficult due to their physical characteristics, the document said, adding that staffing would generally be maintained at a minimum to allow visitors. However, some areas that are regularly closed could be locked up for the duration of a shutdown.

But that contingency plan is likely to change before Tuesday, spokespeople for the Park Service and the Interior Department, which oversees NPS, said Sept. 25.

“The lapse in funding plans on our website are from 2024,” an email from the NPS office of public affairs said. “They are currently being reviewed and updated.”

Hunters and others seeking to use public lands maintained by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service, which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will likely be able to continue to do so, though they may have to make alternative plans if they’d planned to use facilities such as campgrounds.

Land Tawney, the co-chair of the advocacy group American Hunters and Anglers, said campgrounds, toilets and facilities that require staffing would be inaccessible, but most public lands would remain available.

“Those lands are kind of open and they’re just unmanned, I would say, and that’s not really gonna change much,” he said. “If you’re staying in a campground, you’ve got to figure something else out.”

As with national parks, access to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service refuges and other hunting and fishing sites will differ from site to site, Tawney said. The Fish and Wildlife Service doesn’t require permits for hunting on its lands, but access to some refuges is determined by a staff-run lottery drawing. If those drawings can’t be held, access to those sites will be limited, Tawney said.

What happens to the Internal Revenue Service?

How the Internal Revenue Service would operate during a government shutdown remains unclear.

When Congress teetered on letting funding run out in March, the nation’s revenue collection agency released a contingency plan to continue full operations during the height of tax filing season.

The IRS planned to use funds allocated in the 2022 budget reconciliation law to keep its roughly 95,000 employees processing returns and refunds, answering the phones, and pursuing audits.

Ultimately Congress agreed on a stopgap funding bill to avoid a March shutdown, but much has changed since then.

The new tax and spending law, signed by Trump on July 4 and often referred to as the “one big beautiful bill,” made major changes to the U.S. tax code.

Additionally, the agency, which processes roughly 180 million income tax returns per year, has lost about a quarter of its workforce since January. Top leadership has also turned over six times in 2025.

Rachel Snyderman, of the Bipartisan Policy Center, said workforce reductions combined with a string of leadership changes could factor into how the agency would operate during a funding lapse.

“It’s really difficult to understand both what the status of the agency would be if the government were to shut down in less than a week, and also the impacts that a prolonged shutdown could have on taxpayer services and taxpayers at large,” said Snyderman, the think tank’s managing director of economic policy.

Do federal employees get back pay after a shutdown ends?

According to the Office of Personnel Management — the executive branch’s chief human resources agency — “after the lapse in appropriations has ended, employees who were furloughed as the result of the lapse will receive retroactive pay for those furlough periods.”

The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 requires furloughed government employees to receive back pay as a result of a government shutdown.

That law does not apply to federal contractors, who face uncertainty in getting paid during a shutdown.

What role does Congress have during a shutdown?

The House and Senate must approve a stopgap spending bill or all dozen full-year appropriations bills to end a shutdown, a feat that requires the support of at least some Democrats to get past the upper chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster.

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., control their respective chambers’ calendars as well as the floor schedule, so they could keep holding votes on the stopgap bill Democrats have already rejected or try to pass individual bills to alleviate the impacts on certain agencies.

Neither Johnson nor Thune has yet to suggest bipartisan negotiations with Democratic leaders about funding the government. And while they are open to discussions about extending the enhanced tax credits for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, they don’t want that decision connected to the funding debate.

Democratic leaders have said repeatedly that Republicans shouldn’t expect them to vote for legislation they had no say in drafting, especially with a health care cliff for millions of Americans coming at the end of the year.

Members of Congress will receive their paychecks regardless of how long a shutdown lasts, but the people who work for them would only receive their salaries after it ends.

Lawmakers must be paid under language in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the Constitution as well as the 27th Amendment, which bars members of Congress from changing their salaries during the current session.

Lawmakers have discretion to decide which of their staff members continue working during a shutdown and which are furloughed.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Capitol Police, which is tasked with protecting members amid a sharp rise in political violence, said a shutdown “would not affect the security of the Capitol Complex.”

“Our officers, and the professional staff who perform or support emergency functions, would still report to work,” the spokesperson said. “Employees who are not required for emergency functions would be furloughed until funding is available.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0118_SR_PeoplesMarch_990.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 11:58:29.696216

September 30, 2025 9:58 am

NEW YORK — Last night, legal organizations across the ideological spectrum filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit supporting the American Association of University Professors’ (AAUP) lawsuit against the Trump administration’s unprecedented interference in university governance and academic freedom.

The brief has been filed by five organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the Cato Institute, the Rutherford Institute, and the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC). The organizations argue that the administration violated the First Amendment by coercing Columbia University to censor and reshape its teaching, research, and faculty hiring in line with the government’s preferred ideology. Using the threat of canceling hundreds of millions of dollars in federal research funding, federal officials pressured Columbia to restructure entire academic departments, impose speech restrictions on student protest, and adopt government-approved definitions of contested political terms.

“This case isn’t about one university or one ideological disagreement,"" said Vera Eidelman, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “If the government can punish professors and universities for viewpoints it dislikes, then no field of research, no classroom discussion, and no scholar’s speech is safe. That is precisely what the First Amendment forbids.”

By joining together, the amici underscore that this case is not about politics of “left vs. right,” but rather about preventing the government from weaponizing funding to impose ideological litmus tests on scholars. The coalition spans groups that disagree on many issues but share a commitment to defending constitutional protections against viewpoint discrimination.

“The Trump administration’s use of federal funding to restrict Columbia University’s academic independence, scholarship, and discourse is a dangerous intrusion into academic freedom,” said Arthur Eisenberg, Executive Counsel at the NYCLU. “The First Amendment protects against this kind of abuse of power by prohibiting the government from using the power of the purse to dictate curriculums, research, or free inquiry. We urge the Court to move this case forward so the government is held accountable and the freedom once enjoyed by Columbia’s academic community is restored.”

The brief stresses that retaliating against professors for their speech — whether directly or by coercing their universities into doing the silencing — violates core First Amendment protections. The organizations urge the Second Circuit to reverse the district court’s dismissal and allow the case to proceed, warning that upholding the administration’s actions would open the door to ideological bullying of universities and faculty across the country.

U.S. authorities had “planned to deport about 400 Iranians currently living in the United States, most of whom entered illegally,” the Iranian foreign ministry’s director general for parliamentary affairs, Hossein Noushabadi, told the semiofficial Tasnim news agency.

“Out of this number 120 have been selected for deportation and will return to Iran within the next one or two days,” he added, attributing the deportation to the U.S.’ “new anti-immigration policy.”

The identities of the Iranians and their reasons for attempting to immigrate to the U.S. were not immediately clear. The U.S. has not acknowledged any deal and the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that “the Trump Administration is committed to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation of illegal aliens in history, using all the tools at our disposal.”

The news was first reported by The New York Times.

The planned deportation marks a rare instance of cooperation between the U.S. and Iran, which faced new criticism this week for its human rights record as it cracks down after a wave of protests and conflict with Israel.

United Nations human rights experts said Monday they were appalled by a “dramatic escalation” in the number of executions in Iran, after more than 1,000 people were killed in the first nine months of 2025.

President Donald Trump came into office promising the largest mass deportation in U.S history, targeting the more than 10 million unauthorized migrants living in the United States.

However, his administration has struggled to increase deportation levels despite pursuing deals with a number of countries.

119 people of different nationalities were deported to Panama in February as part of an agreement between the Trump administration and the Central American nation.

That’s a very different world.” The high stakes will likely lead Democrats to back down, Fagan predicted.","WASHINGTON — Chicago-area Democrats in Congress, many of them spoiling for a fight with President Donald Trump, are preparing for a high-stakes showdown with Republicans that could indefinitely halt most of the day-to-day work of the federal government starting Wednesday.

The combative stance toward the Trump administration is familiar ground for Illinois progressives, but now U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, a longtime Senate institutionalist who regularly praises bipartisanship in the upper chamber, seems ready to join them.

Durbin could be key to how long a shutdown lasts or whether it happens at all. Illinois’ senior senator reluctantly sided with Republicans on a spending bill this spring, saying shutting down the government would do more damage than agreeing to the GOP’s demands. That vote outraged many liberal activists and the 80-year-old Durbin announced weeks later that he would not seek reelection.

But with Republicans needing seven Senate Democratic votes to avoid a filibuster, Durbin this time around — just days before the shutdown would begin Wednesday — seems unlikely to accept Republicans’ take-it-or-leave-it approach.

“I stand ready to negotiate in good faith with my Republican colleagues to keep our government running and to address the rising cost of health care, but I will not rubber-stamp the president’s extreme cuts to the essential programs that Americans rely on,” Durbin said when voting against the Republican spending plan earlier this month.

Like many Democrats, Durbin wants a new spending agreement to stave off a series of changes in federal law that could soon increase the cost of health insurance for millions of Americans, particularly those in the middle class who use Obamacare insurance marketplaces, and lead to as many as 7 million people losing health coverage outright.

“Republicans have now pushed us to the brink of a government shutdown by proposing (legislation) that increases health care costs for millions of Americans,” he said. “Yet again, Republicans have shown that their loyalty is to President Trump and billionaires, not the constituents they represent.”

Illinois’ other Democratic senator, U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, also called for Republicans to address health insurance costs in their spending plan.

“Millions are set to be kicked off their coverage completely as a direct result of Republicans’ actions,” she wrote in a statement. “Our bill is a life-raft for millions of Americans, but Republicans still care more about what Donald Trump wants than what’s best for our nation.”

“Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House,” Duckworth added. “If they choose to keep going at this alone, they will only have themselves to blame for any shutdown they cause.”

Poisoned partisan atmosphere

But even with a dramatic shutdown, there’s no telling how much — if anything — Democrats will be able to win from the GOP majorities who control Congress.

Budget negotiations have all but stalled on Capitol Hill ahead of the new fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1. Congressional Republicans are pushing a temporary measure that would keep federal agencies operating at current funding levels until mid-November. But Democrats balked in part because Trump’s team has flouted long-standing rules on spending.

Republicans have, in fact, made little effort to gain Democratic support for their temporary budget fix.

The distrust between the parties goes back to the spending package Republicans passed this spring with the help of Durbin and other Democratic leaders.

After it passed, Republicans have used several tactics to back out of financial commitments spelled out in that law. They eliminated money for public radio and TV and billions of dollars in foreign aid, using a procedure that did not require Democratic support. And the Trump administration — with the support of the conservative majority of the Supreme Court — proposed further foreign aid cuts just weeks before the end of the federal fiscal year, giving Congress virtually no time to object.

Republicans also passed a massive long-term budget policy law this summer that includes major cuts for top Democratic priorities such as Biden-era clean energy incentives, food stamps and Medicaid health insurance coverage for lower-income Americans. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” also extends tax breaks for wealthy people and includes funding for a massive expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In the current budget standoff, the House passed a GOP spending plan late last week with no intention of returning until after the shutdown deadline had passed.

The first bipartisan meeting of legislative leaders to address the spending deadline was Monday, but no apparent progress was made with Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota dismissing Democratic calls for health care changes.

“As of right now,” the Republican leader said at the White House, “this is a hijacking of the American people, and it’s the American people who are going to pay the price.”

Before the meeting Monday, Trump repeatedly attacked Democrats, writing on social media that “the Minority Radical Left Democrats” were making “unserious and ridiculous demands.” In a rambling post, the president characterized the Democratic demands to preserve health care coverage to “continue free healthcare for Illegal Aliens” (even though undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid) and “and essentially create Transgender operations for everybody” (although the Democratic proposal doesn’t address transgender medical treatment).

The president’s budget office drew up plans to institute mass layoffs at federal agencies in the event of a shutdown, an unprecedented move that could violate civil service laws.

Outside of budget negotiations, Trump has shown little interest in the traditional give-and-take that leads to bipartisan agreements on major issues such as the federal budget.

In recent weeks, as Trump’s approval ratings have slid, the president repeatedly ratcheted up pressure on Democratic officials and their constituents.

He deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., while promising to send troops to Memphis and Portland, Oregon. His administration stepped up immigration enforcement nationwide, particularly in the Chicago area. After a shooter killed ICE detainees in Dallas last week, the Department of Homeland Security blamed several Democrats by name — including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and three Illinois members of Congress — for “inciting” a “surge in assaults on agents and a wave of Radical Left terror.”

Meanwhile, Trump targeted many of his political opponents.

The president is trying to remove a governor on the Federal Reserve, has already ousted members of the Federal Trade Commission and cheered efforts by his political appointee to knock comedian Jimmy Kimmel off the air.

Most brazenly, Trump publicly ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue criminal charges against the president’s political enemies. Shortly afterward, a new U.S. attorney in Virginia secured an indictment accusing former FBI Director James Comey of lying to Congress five years ago.

“The Department of Justice has become a political tool of a vengeful president,” said Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. “Is there one Republican left in Washington who gives a damn?”

That leaves many top Democrats and liberal groups calling for a shutdown to stymie Trump’s power grabs.

“This Trump regime is tearing down our institutions,” said Kathy Tholin, chair of the Indivisible Chicago Alliance, a grassroots progressive group. “It’s destroying the supports that people count on to live their lives, to pay for their food, to pay for their health care, to have basic freedom. What we need from our elected representatives is for them to recognize that crisis and to fight like hell to protect us.”

“We’re in the middle of a hostile takeover of government,” she added, “and we need our elected officials — and that means our senators in Illinois — to draw a line and refuse to fund a war against Americans.”

Political positioning

Many elected Democrats, including those vying to replace Durbin in the Senate, seem eager for a budget fight.

Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton has been especially vocal on the matter. She opposed Durbin’s vote to support the Republican spending package in March and said she does not support U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York remaining as the leader of the Senate Democratic caucus because of his support of the March spending bill.

Earlier this month, Stratton called for congressional Democrats to “shut the place down” because she said Trump was a “wannabe dictator” and congressional Republicans could not be trusted.

“Democrats cannot give a single vote to a budget that fails to include simple asks to protect healthcare and end Trump’s illegal pocket recissions,” she explained in a follow-up email to the Tribune, referring to the last-minute cuts the president is trying to make. “If they do, they’re complicit.”

“Republicans have the ability to end this showdown, but they would rather cause more harm to American families and capitulate to Donald Trump — who said up front there should be no negotiations — than step up and govern. It’s not up to Democrats to bail them out,” she added.

The other two major Democratic candidates for Durbin’s seat, both members of the U.S. House, also urged their colleagues to take a hard line in negotiations.

“Donald Trump and Republicans control every single branch of government,” said U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, “Come to the table and propose a budget that doesn’t hurt our state. It’s that simple.”

U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, who represents a district that sprawls from Chicago into the south suburbs, said, “I won’t write blank checks to Donald Trump while he is gutting health care, raising costs at the pharmacy and grocery store, and waging war on our cities.”

A shutdown and then what?

Congressional Democrats are demanding a high price for a short-term deal, but that approach is rarely successful, said E.J. Fagan, a political science professor at the University of Illinois Chicago.

In 2013, for example, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, led an effort that shut down the federal government for 16 days in a long-shot gambit to defund President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. It didn’t work.

Trump himself demanded funding for a “border wall” in 2018, but congressional Democrats did not relent. Trump gave in after a 35-day standoff that became the longest federal shutdown in history.

“Every time this happens, there are essentially intraparty reasons that one side is demanding a shutdown knowing that they’re not going to win, knowing they’re going to have to settle, and that clean (continuing resolution) is almost certainly the outcome,” Fagan said.

Many factors, he said, are working against the Democrats’ approach.

The first is that the legislation Republicans have advanced is a relatively innocuous bid to give Congress more time to reach a larger agreement. It has fewer “poison pills” in it than the March spending package that Durbin and other top Democrats ultimately supported, Fagan noted.

Democrats are trying to make the current debate about health care costs, but the changes they’re worried about won’t take effect until the beginning of 2026, well after the short-term spending bill expires, Fagan said. In other words, Congress will have to have another spending debate before the year ends when Democrats can bring up this issue again.

Meanwhile, other complaints Democrats have about the budget process are lost in the public messaging.

“The idea that the Trump administration is running rampant, ignoring law, letting things be tied up in court for a year or longer before the Supreme Court says anything about it and (Democrats) are not going to vote for an appropriations bill unless there’s some language in there to force (the administration to follow the law), I think is a coherent argument that they could make,” Fagan said. “They’re just not doing it. It’s a hypothetical that’s not occurring.”

But there are also negative repercussions that Democrats could face if their shutdown strategy fails to move Republicans.

If the Democrats hold out too long, Senate Republicans could opt to end the filibuster for appropriations bills. That would mean it would only take 51 votes to pass the Senate instead of the current 60 votes, which in practice gives Democrats a say on spending-related matters. Both parties have weakened the filibuster — particularly as it comes to confirming presidential nominees — over the last decade, but eliminating it for spending bills would have major consequences, Fagan said.

“Democrats are out of power,” Fagan said. “It would be a massive strategic mistake to give up that power. Once that filibuster is gone, you’re just a minority party and you don’t have veto power over appropriations bills.”

If Republicans go it alone on spending bills, they can insert provisions that, for example, coerce states and cities to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, Fagan said.

But they could also wipe out all sorts of bipartisan agreements that are carried over from year to year to make sure spending bills pass the Senate.

If Democrats support a spending agreement that keeps those longstanding provisions, it could help their constituents in case the Trump administration tries to flout the law, Fagan said.

“The Trump administration is going to do what they’ve been doing, which is breaking the law and not spending money selectively,” Fagan said. “But if I’m the Democrats, that’s better than giving the other side the authority to make new laws, right? That’s a very different world.”

The high stakes will likely lead Democrats to back down, Fagan predicted.

“Fast-forward two weeks from now, the government has been shut down. Lots of people aren’t getting paid. National parks are closed. Democrats are making a weird, nongermane ask that isn’t really playing in the media, and then they have to cave,” he said. “That’s going to be demoralizing.”

“There are real harms to overasking,” Fagan said, “and I think that, ultimately, they’re going to look stupid after the shutdown. They would be smart to do what they did in March: find some votes, quietly stomach a deal, negotiate with Republicans for what they can get and go beat them in the next election.”

SOX 806 specifically notes that its remedies are designed “to make the employee whole,” 18 U.S.C.","On September 23, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a decision dismissing constitutional challenges to Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) adjudication of whistleblower claims under Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A (SOX). This District Court’s narrow reading of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Jarkesy may prove critical to agency enforcement of federal whistleblower and other employment laws.

For context, on June 27, 2024, the Supreme Court issued its decision in S.E.C. v. Jarkesy, in which the Court threw out a $300,000 penalty awarded to the SEC because the decisionmaker was an agency Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), and not a federal judge and jury. The Jarkesy decision’s interpretation of the Seventh Amendment – guaranteeing a right to a jury trial for “Suits at common law” – and Article III of the Constitution sent shockwaves throughout labor and employment law. A dizzying array of challenges sprang up almost immediately in every conceivable forum as employers started raising Jarkesy arguments before ALJs, agency appellate bodies and in federal district and circuit court, claiming the ALJs in the DOL and NLRB could no longer decide whether employees were entitled to relief under federal labor laws.

The Jarkesy Court’s Seventh Amendment analysis first looked at whether the cause of action brought and remedies sought resemble those historically available in courts of common law. If so, then the Seventh Amendment presumptively applies and requires a jury trial. In the case of the SEC’s enforcement action, the cause of action resembled common law fraud actions, and the remedies – monetary penalties – were an example of a quintessential legal remedy. The Court then went on to discuss the “public rights” exception to the Seventh Amendment. Whereas Article III of the Constitution vests “[t]he judicial Power of the United States” in Article III courts (Art. III § 1), such that only Article III courts could adjudicate federal law disputes involving “private rights,” the Supreme Court has historically allowed executive or legislative adjudication of disputes involving “public rights.” Under a 1977 Supreme Court decision, Atlas Roofing Co. v. OSHA, this exception had been read broadly to allow Congress to delegate enforcement under almost any statutory scheme to ALJs. However, in Jarkesy, the Court rejected the broad reading of Atlas Roofing and made clear that the public rights exception would be applied narrowly to those matters that “historically could have been determined exclusively by the executive and legislative branches,” such as cases involving “the collection of revenue; aspects of customs law; immigration law; relations with Indian tribes; the administration of public lands; and the granting of public benefits.”

Comcast Corp. v. DOL arose from a dispute over executive compensation. Complainants Lawrence Gloss and Travis Rosiek alleged that Comcast promised them a lucrative incentive compensation deal as part of a corporate acquisition, and that Comcast was required under applicable securities laws and regulations to disclose the incentive compensation to shareholders. During the course of their employment, Gloss and Rosiek contend they complained about Comcast’s failure to pay the incentive comp as well as its failure to report the incentive comp, leading to a series of retaliatory actions culminating in their constructive discharge. Gloss and Rosiek filed administrative complaints under Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX 806), seeking to recover the alleged incentive compensation payments only. SOX 806 protects employees of publicly traded companies (like Comcast) from retaliation if they complain, either internally or to the government, about what they reasonably believe is a violation of a securities law, criminal wire, bank, or mail fraud, any rule or regulation of the SEC, or any other federal law related to fraud against shareholders. The statute requires complainants like Gloss and Rosiek to file complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and proceed through administrative investigation and adjudication before they have a right to proceed before a jury in federal court. As Gloss and Rosiek did not opt for a jury trial, Comcast found itself stuck in the DOL administrative process.

Instead of proceeding with this administrative adjudication process, Comcast chose a different route. It sued the DOL before the ALJ could hold a hearing, arguing in part that under the Supreme Court’s decision in Jarkesy, the Seventh Amendment and Article III of the Constitution requires SOX 806 claims to be tried in federal court before a jury, and that the ALJ proceedings were thus unconstitutional.

The District Court ruled for the Government on the merits of Comcast’s Jarkesy arguments, holding that the payments sought by Gloss and Rosiek would be payments “awarded for lost compensation . . . or in lieu of reinstatement,” and thus akin to equitable monetary payments under Supreme Court case law. SOX 806 specifically notes that its remedies are designed “to make the employee whole,” 18 U.S.C. § 1514A(c)(1), which the Court relied on to conclude the remedies were equitable in nature. The Court further noted the SOX 806 cause of action, a retaliation claim for an unlawful termination, was not a claim available at 18th-century common law, but rather a creature of the 20th century. Accordingly, the Seventh Amendment did not apply.

Turning to the Article III “public rights” question, the Court discussed the importance of whistleblower protections in Congress’s efforts to “safeguard public investors and restore trust in financial markets,” which thus “impl[ied] a broader public right.” The District Court did not grapple at all with Jarkesy’s suggestion that the public rights doctrine should be cabined to those areas historically within the complete control of the legislative or executive branch. Nor did the District Court question why the SEC’s enforcement actions at issue in Jarkesy, which were also designed to safeguard public investors and the financial markets, were “private” in nature, while whistleblower claims, brought by private individuals, can involve “public rights.” Sidestepping these issues, the District Court reasoned that SOX 806 was “self-consciously novel” in both “concept and execution,” and could not trace “its ancestry to the common law,” making it a matter of public right that could be adjudicated by an ALJ.",https://www.bipc.com/assets/images/thumbnails/post-social-L_and_E-district-court-rejects-constitutional-challenge-to-dol-adjudication-of-whistleblower-claims.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 11:59:21.384078

After Ms. Sagoo failed to pay the penalty, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit seeking to reduce the assessed penalty to judgment.
First, the district court concluded that a jury trial occurring after the IRS has assessed the FBAR penalty – what it called an “after-the-fact jury trial” – does not protect the taxpayer’s constitutional right to a jury trial.
Third, the district court noted that Ms. Sagoo only has access to an Article III court with a jury after the penalty has been assessed.
Until Sagoo, no court had held that the Seventh Amendment was implicated by the IRS’s administrative assessment of FBAR penalties.","A district court in Texas has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department to collect an FBAR penalty, concluding for the first time that the Internal Revenue Service’s administrative assessment of an FBAR penalty violates the right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment. See United States v. Sagoo, 2025 WL 2689912 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 19, 2025). This decision, which is sure to send shock waves through the halls of the IRS and Justice Department and will undoubtedly be appealed, equips FBAR litigants with a powerful new defense to fight lawsuits seeking to collect FBAR penalties.

United States v. Sagoo

The defendant in the case, Sharnjeet K. Sagoo, had several bank accounts in Kenya, India, and England, but failed to annually disclose those accounts as required by law to the Internal Revenue Service on the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts reporting form (commonly referred to as the FBAR). The IRS therefore assessed a $1 million penalty against Ms. Sagoo for willfully failing to file FBARs in 2011, 2012, and 2013. After Ms. Sagoo failed to pay the penalty, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit seeking to reduce the assessed penalty to judgment.

Ms. Sagoo filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on several grounds, including on the ground that the government violated her Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial by assessing the willful FBAR penalty. In response, the government acknowledged that Ms. Sagoo was entitled to a civil jury trial (based upon the Supreme Court’s recent decision in SEC v. Jarkesy, 603 U.S. 109 (2024)), but denied that any Seventh Amendment had occurred yet, because Ms. Sagoo was entitled to a post-assessment de novo jury determination of her liability for any willful FBAR penalty. Ms. Sagoo countered that the Seventh Amendment violation occurred when the IRS assessed the willful FBAR penalty against her, and that she was entitled to a jury trial before any such assessment could be made. The district court agreed with Ms. Sagoo, following the Fifth Circuit’s recent decision in AT&T, Inc. v. FTC, 135 F.4th 230 (5th Cir. 2025), holding that a jury trial following an agency’s assessment of civil penalties violates the Seventh Amendment.

First, the district court concluded that a jury trial occurring after the IRS has assessed the FBAR penalty – what it called an “after-the-fact jury trial” – does not protect the taxpayer’s constitutional right to a jury trial. The district court found that the Secretary of the Treasury and the IRS improperly “acted as prosecutor, jury, and judge” in investigating the taxpayer, determining that she was liable, and assessing a FBAR penalty.

Second, the district court found that an “after-the-fact jury trial” does not protect an individual’s Seventh Amendment rights because the underlying penalty assessment has “real world impacts,” including “the threat to either pay or get sued, reputational harm, and administrative offsets.” Indeed, the district court noted that the IRS could attempt to collect Ms. Sagoo’s FBAR penalty through administrative offsets before a jury ever determined whether she was in fact liable for the penalty.

Third, the district court noted that Ms. Sagoo only has access to an Article III court with a jury after the penalty has been assessed. And she only has the right to a jury if she refuses to pay the penalty and the Justice Department chooses to file a lawsuit to reduce the assessment to judgment. If the government elects not to file suit, a taxpayer like Ms. Sagoo would have no opportunity for a jury determination of her liability, yet she would remain liable for the underlying assessment.

Implications for FBAR Litigants

Since the IRS started enforcing the FBAR filing obligation in earnest about 15 years ago, the Justice Department has filed hundreds of federal court lawsuits nationwide seeking to reduce FBAR assessments to judgment. Until Sagoo, no court had held that the Seventh Amendment was implicated by the IRS’s administrative assessment of FBAR penalties. While the decision is Sagoo is only a district court decision, and is sure to be appealed by the government, its holding provides an additional defense to FBAR penalties that can — and should — be asserted in all pending FBAR cases, whether they are still before the IRS or being litigated in federal court. Individuals facing FBAR penalties should immediately take advantage of this favorable decision and assert their rights to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15673_4521.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 14:58:02.564367

“Certainly there are some Democrats meeting the moment, but I don’t know anyone who would count congressional leadership among them,” Mr. Orton said.
But when the Demand Justice executive director, Brian Fallon, left to work for Ms. Harris, the group’s activities slowed to a crawl.
Aides to Mr. King and Mr. Welch declined to provide additional comment.
And Mr. Orton said he would seek to build a grass-roots organizing vehicle able to enact public pressure on senators.","At a moment when Democrats in Congress are under pressure to oppose President Trump at every turn, a liberal advocacy group that fought his first-term efforts to remake the federal judiciary is back, with the intent to pile on.

The organization, Demand Justice, went dormant at the tail end of the Biden administration. It was revived recently by Josh Orton, whose career in Democratic politics has included working with Senators Russ Feingold and Harry Reid and serving as policy director to the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign and as a senior aide to Kamala Harris during her vice presidency.

Mr. Orton, 44, intends to use the Demand Justice megaphone to push Democrats to not just oppose Mr. Trump’s judicial nominees, but “demonstrate steadfast opposition to the dismantling and corruption of our legal system, courts and the rule of law,” according to a memo from Mr. Orton to the group’s board of directors.

The task for Mr. Orton may be steep. The legal system that Democrats had hoped would serve as guardrails against some elements of the Trump agenda is now stocked with his appointees. A conservative majority on the Supreme Court, cemented by his picks, has frequently given his agenda the green light as he asserts broad presidential authority.

And now, Mr. Trump is using the legal system to attack those he considers political enemies, directing the prosecutions of James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James, among others.

“Certainly there are some Democrats meeting the moment, but I don’t know anyone who would count congressional leadership among them,” Mr. Orton said. “One of the most common phrases in D.C. these days is, ‘I miss Harry Reid.’”

Demand Justice was formed in 2018 as an attempt to rebalance the political terrain over courts that had tilted following decades of Republican organizing without much response from Democrats. The group led protests against two of Mr. Trump’s nominees to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

After President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected, Demand Justice spurred calls for Justice Stephen Breyer to retire so he could be replaced by a Biden nominee. But when the Demand Justice executive director, Brian Fallon, left to work for Ms. Harris, the group’s activities slowed to a crawl.

Mr. Orton intends to make his first examples out of Senators Angus King of Maine and Peter Welch of Vermont, who in recent months voted to confirm federal judges nominated by Mr. Trump.

Mr. King in July broke with the rest of the Senate Democratic caucus to confirm Josh Divine, a 35-year-old abortion rights opponent who had been an aide to Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, for a lifetime appointment to a District Court seat in Missouri.

Mr. King later explained in the comments of an Instagram post he made remembering Representative John Lewis, the voting rights advocate and icon of the civil rights movement who died in 2020, that his vote for Judge Divine was a mistake.

“I was not aware of his anti-choice positions,” Mr. King wrote. He said he was “influenced by a conversation with Senator Hawley (who knows him personally) immediately before the vote.”

This month, Mr. Welch cast the lone Democratic vote for Kyle Dudek, who was confirmed for a federal judgeship in Florida.

Mr. Dudek, in his answer to a question from senators, declined to say whether the Capitol was “attacked by a violent mob” on Jan. 6, 2021.

“The question draws a legal conclusion about the events of January 6, 2021,” Judge Dudek wrote. “The legal import of pardons issued to those prosecuted for involvement in events at the Capitol is a matter of ongoing litigation. Thus, as a current judicial officer, it would be improper to offer any further comment beyond that I condemn violence of any kind.”

Mr. Welch defended his vote for Judge Dudek.

“I had a chance to vote for a qualified nominee, so I did,” he told Bloomberg Law.

Aides to Mr. King and Mr. Welch declined to provide additional comment.

In the memo to the Demand Justice board of directors outlining the group’s strategy, Mr. Orton described a three-pronged approach to holding Democrats accountable for how strongly they resist Mr. Trump’s efforts to transform the legal system. Voting no on judges, Mr. Orton said, is not enough on its own.

“With targeted paid media and grass-roots organizing, we will hold everyone, including Senate Democrats, accountable if they fail to meet this moment and demonstrate steadfast opposition to the dismantling and corruption of our legal system, courts and the rule of law,” Mr. Orton wrote. “Our credibility depends on showing that Democrats who shrink from this fight will face consequences.”

Demand Justice will also aim to make an economic case against Mr. Trump’s judges, tying them to a broader judicial trend of what Mr. Orton called “oligarchy in the courts” — siding with America’s corporations on issues like workers’ rights and the economy. And Mr. Orton said he would seek to build a grass-roots organizing vehicle able to enact public pressure on senators.

“Josh was the architect of both finding interesting, compelling ideas and merging them with compelling communications that would actually reach real people,” said Faiz Shakir, who was the campaign manager for the 2020 Bernie Sanders presidential campaign when Mr. Orton was its policy director.

And as Democrats begin their campaigns for the 2028 presidential nomination, Mr. Orton said that Demand Justice would push them to seek to expand the Supreme Court beyond its current nine members as a means to mitigate the 6-to-3 conservative supermajority that exists now.

“What seemed like a marginal idea at the time it was proposed, now is mainstream and has been proven reasonable by the Supreme Court actions ever since,” Mr. Orton said. “The question facing all of us Democrats, given where the court is and the power it is handing over to Trump unilaterally, is what does reform look like now.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/30/multimedia/30pol-demand-justice1-wqmj/30pol-demand-justice1-wqmj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 11:59:26.984727

(WGN) — Five people are facing federal charges following weekend protests outside an ICE processing center in Broadview, with all of them appearing before a judge on Monday.

The group is accused of forcibly assaulting or resisting federal agents during Saturday’s demonstration. Three were released, while two remain in federal custody.

Tensions flared during the protest as demonstrators clashed with federal agents. Among those arrested were 31-year-old Ray Collins and his 30-year-old fiancée, Jocelyne Robledo.

“His wife was being arrested, he went to his wife’s rescue and that’s why he was charged,” defense attorney Richard Kling said. “I don’t care what ICE says. ICE is doing horrible things right now. They have armed soldiers in the streets, arresting people. ICE originally said they were only going after convicted felons and people who had criminal histories.”

Both Collins and Robledo were accused of carrying loaded handguns, but the pair are licensed to conceal carry and neither displayed nor used the weapons during the protest.

ICE later posted photos on social media, labeling the pair “armed rioters.”

Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino also posted on the social media platform X saying, “Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Two protesters thought they’d spice things up by bringing loaded handguns. Instead of making their point, they now have to make bail.”

U.S. District Judge Gabriel Fuentes released Robledo but ordered Collins to remain in custody.

“I can only think of one other instance where it’s been this close. This is a close call for me,” Fuentes said.

He ultimately came to his decision based partially on allegations that Robledo pushed back against federal agents while Collins charged at them, injuring an ATF Special Agent’s thumb.

Despite Kling’s argument that Collins carries a firearm at all times for personal protection, Fuentes said, “Engaging in a physical confrontation and scuffle with agents while carrying a loaded firearm injects a great amount of danger not just to the people right there, but to a whole group of individuals at the protest.”

Kling maintains the judge’s ruling was a mistake.

“I am very disappointed by he judge’s decision. My client had a gun, which he had lawfully, he did not use it,” Kling said.

Another defendant, 26-year-old Paul Ivery, a food service worker at Oak Park and River Forest High School, was also detained. Prosecutors allege he threatened to kill Border Patrol officers, challenged them to act on his threat, and attempted to flee by running and jumping onto a vehicle.

Court documents allege Ivery attended the protest because he believed ICE agents were disrespectful toward Broadview police and military veterans. Over 15 people were in the courtroom to support him, including friends, family and educators.

“He is such a wonderful young man and to see these charges try to imply that he is a terrorist is so unfounded, and I want to make sure that that is spoken,” Ivery’s neighbor, Tara Gerou, said. “He is a beloved member of our community who was wrapped up in something very heated.”

Dana Briggs, a 70-year-old man, was released following his hearing, while 21-year-old Hubert Mazur, who faces a misdemeanor charge of forcibly resisting, was also released.

Collins had his detention hearing on Monday, while Ivery’s is scheduled for Wednesday. He sobbed on his attorney’s shoulder after learning he would have to wait to find out if he could be released.

“We believe in the first amendment and fourth amendment, but don’t come to a protest ready to fight or shoot Border Patrol agents, it won’t work out well for you,” Bovino said.",https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/09/snapshot-2025-09-29T185505.960.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-30 14:57:55.976494

By Vanguard Staff

LOS ANGELES – Attorneys for Venezuelan and Haitian Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders filed a detailed opposition brief with the U.S. Supreme Court, urging justices to reject the Trump administration’s request for an emergency stay of a federal ruling that blocked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem from stripping TPS protections. The case, National TPS Alliance v. Noem, could determine the fate of more than 600,000 Venezuelan immigrants currently shielded from detention and deportation.

Judge Edward M. Chen of the Northern District of California held that Noem’s attempt to revoke TPS for Venezuelans and Haitians violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The government’s petition now before the high court seeks to reinstate Noem’s actions against Venezuelan TPS holders, a move that advocates say would inflict immediate harm on families and communities. While Haitians are not directly targeted in the pending stay application, the administration is appealing the district court’s order covering Haiti as well.

The opposition brief argued that the administration has failed to demonstrate any emergency that would justify extraordinary intervention by the Supreme Court. The plaintiffs warned that granting a stay would devastate families, destabilize communities, and contradict both the district court and the Ninth Circuit’s findings that the secretary acted unlawfully. Amicus briefs were also filed in support of TPS holders by 137 legislators, along with groups of law scholars and economists.

M.H., a Venezuelan plaintiff and member of the National TPS Alliance, said, “I am married to a U.S. citizen and the mother of two children, one of whom is a U.S. citizen. I rely on TPS to be able to care for my family. I cannot overstate the pain and fear my family is suffering with the government trying to cancel my legal status, and the legal status of my young daughter. Our presence here is not an emergency, no matter what the government says.”

Jose Palma, coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, said, “TPS holders work hard to take care of our families and contribute to this country. The administration’s attack on our community is wrong. Two courts have now found it is also illegal. Today, we call on the Supreme Court to uphold the law and deny the stay.”

The plaintiffs’ legal team, which includes the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the ACLU of Northern and Southern California, the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance, stressed that Noem exceeded her authority by vacating an extension of Venezuela’s TPS designation.

The brief explained that the statute governing TPS, 8 U.S.C. § 1254a, sets out “explicit guidelines, specific procedural steps, and time limitations” that the secretary must follow. Nowhere does the law authorize the secretary to retroactively cancel or “vacate” a TPS extension after it has been lawfully issued.

The opposition brief noted that former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas had extended Venezuela’s TPS designation on January 17, 2025, after a full review of country conditions and agency consultations, citing the nation’s “complex, serious and multidimensional humanitarian crisis.”

More than 600,000 Venezuelans qualified for protections under the extension. Just three days after taking office, Noem vacated the extension, citing supposed concerns about the registration process.

On February 1, she terminated the designation outright, stating that extension was “contrary to the national interest.”

Plaintiffs argue that both the vacatur and termination were unlawful because they ignored statutory requirements for consultation, country condition review, and adherence to deadlines.

Jessica Bansal, counsel at the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said, “Stripping the lawful immigration status of 600,000 people on 60 days notice is unprecedented. Doing it after promising an additional 18 months protection is illegal. The government claims its inability to violate the law is an emergency, but the only emergency here is that lawfully present immigrants are being fired from their jobs, detained in immigration jails, torn from their families, and deported to a country where the U.S. government says it is unsafe to even travel.”

Ahilan Arulanantham, faculty co-director at the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at UCLA, said, “During the Biden administration, the Supreme Court repeatedly ruled that federal agencies must act within the constraints Congress has imposed, including in immigration cases. Here, DHS Secretary Noem obviously flouted that principle when she tried to take away the protections for Venezuelan TPS holders that had already been granted to them. We hope the Supreme Court will apply the law in an even-handed way, rather than allowing the Trump administration to ignore it.”

Emi MacLean, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, said, “Secretary Noem acted illegally to strip TPS from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans based on pretext and invented authority she does not have. The DHS secretary does not have free rein to ignore the law. The Supreme Court should not endorse the cruel actions of an administration, which seeks to circumvent the law and demolish the humanitarian protections Congress enacted 35 years ago.”

Erik Crew, staff attorney at the Haitian Bridge Alliance, said, “TPS holders are lawfully here because they have done what U.S. laws and the Constitution have asked of them. The Supreme Court should affirm what the lower courts have made clear: TPS holders have followed the law, but the Trump administration hasn’t.”

The plaintiffs’ opposition brief underscored that the administration has already caused harm while previous stays were in effect. When the Supreme Court allowed Noem’s actions to take effect temporarily earlier this year, families were separated, people lost jobs, and some were detained and deported to Venezuela. “Disturbing it now will cause massive injuries to Plaintiffs and their loved ones, including many American children,” the brief stated.

Immigration law scholars echoed those arguments in their amicus filing. They traced the history of TPS to decades of ad hoc, discretionary relief programs such as Extended Voluntary Departure, which allowed certain groups to remain in the United States temporarily but lacked transparency and statutory criteria.

Congress created TPS in 1990 to replace that system with clear, rule-based protections.

As the scholars explained, “Congress sought to regulate the process of providing humanitarian relief to ensure that the Executive exercised its authority to grant temporary protection on the basis of enumerated and consistent criteria, rather than unfettered discretion or political considerations.”

They added that TPS was designed to “constrain the executive branch’s discretion” and prevent arbitrary decision-making.

The scholars argued that the government’s position before the Court—that TPS decisions are effectively unreviewable and that the secretary can rescind extensions without following statutory procedures—runs directly counter to Congress’s intent.

They wrote that the legislative history shows TPS was enacted “to replace the current ad hoc, haphazard regulations and procedures” of earlier executive practices, ensuring transparency and consistency in protecting individuals who cannot safely return home.

Both the plaintiffs and supporting amici stressed that the equities strongly favor leaving protections in place while litigation continues. The government, they argued, cannot claim irreparable harm from being temporarily prevented from terminating TPS, while TPS holders would face immediate life-altering consequences if the stay is granted.

As the opposition brief stated, “A temporary pause in implementing a policy change—even an important one—cannot by itself constitute irreparable harm.”

As your Member of Congress, I want to ensure you have the information you need regarding any potential 2025 federal government shutdown and how it might affect you. Below are some frequently asked questions about a shutdown and key information you need to know.

In the event of a government shutdown, my district and D.C. offices will remain available to assist you. You can write to me and the team through this site or call 833-643-6114 with any questions.

FAQ:

What is a federal government shutdown? And who will be affected?

Each year, Congress must pass bills to approve funding for government agencies and services. If those bills aren’t passed on time, Congress can pass a short-term fix called a continuing resolution (CR) to keep money flowing until funding levels are ready.

If there’s no funding bill and no CR, the government shuts down because no funding has been approved.

Every agency has its own plan for shutdowns. Many agencies will have to stop or reduce the essential services they provide and furlough employees until the end of the shutdown. Other “essential” employees in agencies must keep working without pay until funding is passed.

I have an issue with a federal agency, can I still call them for help? Can you help me instead?

During a shutdown, many federal departments and agencies furlough workers, so their help desks may have little or no staffing.

You can contact my office to open a case for you, and we can contact an agency on your behalf and provide you with updates if they are open or when they re-open at the conclusion of a shutdown.

My office will continue to engage with federal agencies, including requesting updates on constituents’ behalf, submitting paperwork, and opening new cases. We will provide you with any updates as soon as it is available. Despite that, some agencies may not be able to process our requests until the government is funded.

Do furloughed federal employees get back pay?

Almost always. Under federal law (specifically, The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act), employees who are furloughed or made to work during a shutdown must be paid after it ends for the time the government was closed.

Will I continue to receive my Social Security?

A shutdown should not impact Social Security benefit payments.

New benefit verification and the issuing of new cards pause during a shutdown, so new recipients may see delays in processing their claims.

I rely on food programs like WIC and SNAP — will I keep getting my payments?

Funding for WIC (The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) will run out of remaining funding quickly and may be unable to provide food for children and parents in need.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits may also be affected in the case of a prolonged shutdown.

Does USPS still deliver mail?

Yes. The U.S. Postal Service should operate normally during a shutdown.

Will Medicare or Medicaid be interrupted?

Medicare and Medicaid should continue during a federal shutdown.

Communications from the agencies or reaching out for assistance may be difficult or impossible due to the temporary staff furloughs. Messages, updates, or support could be stalled or outdated.

Do military personnel continue working?

Yes, the Department of Defense will continue defending our nation and all military personnel will continue in their duties as usual, but servicemembers will not receive pay during a government shutdown.

Can veterans still get treatment at VA or access other services?

Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities should not be seriously impacted, and almost all employees are expected to remain on the job. Employees performing medical and prosthetic research would be furloughed.

Access to benefits under the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) should continue.

The National Cemetery Administration’s (NCA) burial, scheduling of burials, first notice of death, and headstone processing functions should continue. Oversight and direct administration of the NCA program offices (Veterans Cemetery Grants Program, Engagement and Memorial Innovations, Cemetery Development and Improvement Service, Finance, Legislative and Regulatory Service, etc.) would pause until the end of the shutdown.

What will be the impact on federal housing loans?

The Federal Housing Administration will stop approving applications for housing loans. This will create major delays for approval of development, rehabilitation, and refinancing of properties that will likely persist in the period following the shutdown.

What is the impact on small businesses?

The shutdown will impact federal loans to small businesses. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) will not accept, review or approve any new business loans for small businesses.

Should I cancel my upcoming travel plans?

Probably not — you can and should continue to enjoy your travel plans. TSA officers and air traffic controllers are considered essential, but please have extra patience as both will be working without pay during the shutdown.

Passport applications should continue to be processed during a shutdown. All passport services, including agencies and the National Passport Information Center, should remain open during a federal government shutdown.

All services at international embassies and consulates should continue during a shutdown. If you are abroad and need help, you should contact the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.

Will immigration applications still be processed?

Visa and passport operations are fee-funded and not normally impacted by a shutdown.

Immigration court cases on the detained docket should still proceed during a shutdown, while non-detained docket cases will be rescheduled to a later date once funding resumes.

The Department of Homeland Security estimates that Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should retain most of their employees and continue their work during a shutdown.

Will I receive my tax refund? Do I still need to file my taxes if I got an extension?

If you filed for a six-month extension for your tax returns in April, you are still required to file by October 15.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is expected to maintain normal operations during a shutdown, meaning tax refunds and support should remain available.

What does this mean for disaster relief efforts?

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) staff should still respond to emergencies, but all long-term projects will be delayed due to a lack of funding in the Disaster Relief Fund.

Will student loans continue to be disbursed?

Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans should continue until remaining funding runs out.

Free Applications for Student Aid (FAFSA), Pell Grant, and Federal Direct Student Loans, and servicing of federal student loans should continue for a limited time during a shutdown.

In the case of a prolonged shutdown, school districts, colleges, and universities may begin to experience funding shortages due to lapsed federal funding.

I'm traveling to Washington, D.C. — will my tours still take place?

Unfortunately, no. The tour guides and visitor centers of federal government buildings are considered non-essential and will be closed during a shutdown. This means that all tours of the U.S. Capitol, White House, and FBI Building will be canceled during a shutdown.

Do national parks and monuments close?

While official guidance has not been published as of the time of writing, in past shutdowns it has depended on the site. Some parks and open-air memorials may remain open without staffing, but services — including visitor centers, restrooms, trash pickup, and road maintenance — can be limited or unavailable.

There would also likely be limited emergency rescue services and safety updates would not be published. Please keep this in mind when planning any visits.

Federal agents searched Des Moines Public Schools Superintendent Ian Roberts' home and seized items, hours after his arrest by immigration authorities, according to neighbors and federal officials.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives confirmed to the Des Moines Register it executed a federal search warrant Friday, Sept. 26, in the vicinity of Roberts’ southeast Des Moines residence near Easter Lake.

Neighbors told the Register that officers forced their way inside and carried out evidence from Roberts' home around 8 p.m., about 12 hours after Roberts was arrested.

“They broke into the door, took some of the stuff from his house,” said neighbor Suresh Gazmer, who lives next door with his family. “They were like, banging the doors. And, you know, my daughters were crying. I mean, what’s going on here? It was a scary moment.”

Videos shared with the Register show agents with flashlights moving through the property in tactical gear while emergency lights reflected off the house.

On Monday, Sept. 29, damage from forced entry remained visible on the front door, and at least three exterior cameras appear to have been knocked down or disconnected.

Gazmer said there were no sirens as officers moved in and out of the house, and that many neighbors didn’t even realize what was happening.

“I only saw the flashing lights, and then, I believe that they turned the flashing light off because they just don’t want a lot of people to know what’s going on in the neighborhood,” he said. Several neighbors also said they were unaware of any law enforcement activity that night or even that Roberts lived on their street.

Federal officials said Roberts, 54, fled from a traffic stop Friday morning before abandoning a district-issued vehicle. Inside, agents said they found a loaded handgun, about $3,000 in cash and a hunting knife. He was taken into custody later that morning in what Department of Homeland Security officials described as a “targeted enforcement” action.

“The investigation into how Roberts acquired the handgun is being turned over to the ATF,” DHS said in a news release. “It is a violation of federal law for those in the U.S. without legal status to possess a firearm and ammunition.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Roberts posed a public safety threat.

“This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement,” said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson in a news release.

ICE also thanked the Iowa State Patrol for its role in the arrest, and neighbors said they saw troopers on the scene during both the arrest and the nighttime raid. Des Moines Police also provided two detectives to assist the ATF, according to DMPD Public Information Officer Sgt. Paul Parizek.

Roberts, a native of Guyana, has lived in the United States since arriving on an F-1 student visa in 1999, according to ICE.

Federal officials said a court issued a final order of removal in May 2024, making him subject to deportation.

Community response to his arrest has been divided, with some officials framing him as a safety risk. “He should be deported immediately,” U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson wrote on X soon after the arrest.

Others, like Gazmer, said the raid and the allegations do not match the neighbor they knew.

“Never had any problem,” he said. “He’s very kind to my kids. He would always wave as soon as he pulled up to the neighborhood, he slows down his car. He’s a very, very nice guy.”

Gazmer said he was confident Roberts mostly lived alone. “I have never, ever, ever seen anyone going in and out of his house,” he said. “This is completely surprised for me. There is never, ever nothing suspicious, none of that. He’s a business guy. We felt very safe to be his neighbor. Very safe.”

The arrest has become one of the highest-profile cases in the country and sent shockwaves through Iowa’s largest school district.

DMPS placed Roberts on paid administrative leave Sept. 27. On Monday, the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked his administrator license, prompting the board to prepare action to move him to unpaid leave.

Board Chair Jackie Norris said Roberts had been an “integral part of our school community since he joined two years ago,” but acknowledged, “there is much we do not know.”

Back in February, I outlined how the party has shifted markedly leftward on the former topic in recent years, shedding the more moderate, balanced approaches of presidents like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of one that was more in vogue with advocacy groups. Many high-profile Democrats essentially endorsed, tacitly or explicitly, an open-borders policy.

But as the country faced an unprecedented surge in migration under Joe Biden’s presidency, Americans swiftly rebelled against this thinking. Polling showed that after decades of growing support for increasing immigration levels and waning support for decreasing them, each trendline reversed—hard—during Biden’s term. His handling of immigration was ultimately a key reason why Trump won last year, and voters today say they overwhelmingly trust Republicans over Democrats on the issue.

Though Americans typically do not consider crime and public safety to be as big a problem as immigration, it has become yet another albatross for Democrats under Trump’s reign. As he has ramped up an anti-crime push in cities and states across the country, they have found themselves in the position of defending relatively lower levels of crime—levels that still are not acceptable to many people. Americans today trust Republicans over Democrats to handle crime to an even greater degree than they do immigration.

All this points to a broader issue for team blue: they’ve lost the confidence of the public on issues related to social order. This reflects a similar struggle in recent years for governing parties in Europe. New analysis from political economist Laurenz Guenther suggests that while voters and mainstream politicians have often been aligned on tax-and-spend economic issues—favoring more spending and broadened public programs—there has been a growing gap on sociocultural issues like criminal justice and immigration. According to a review of the research from the Financial Times’ John Burn-Murdoch:

Western publics have long desired greater emphasis on order, control and cultural integration. Their politicians have tilted in the opposite direction, favouring more inclusive and permissive approaches.

The result is the opening up of a wide “representation gap”—a space on the political map with large numbers of voters but few mainstream politicians or parties—into which the populist right is now rapidly expanding as cultural issues rise in salience.

Burn-Murdoch notes that his own updated analyses of this question shows these same dynamics at play in the United States, “where the average voter’s preferences on immigration are close to those of Republican politicians, but far more conservative than those of Democratic party elites.” He adds, “A similar pattern is clear with crime, where rates of arrest and prosecution have fallen in several countries and lower-level disorder is on the rise. Sustained failure to curb these trends under governments of both the centre left and centre right has signalled to the public that the political class either doesn’t see this as a problem or is incapable of addressing it.”

This perception is a big problem for Democrats, as these issues strike at the core of voters’ anxieties about the state of the country and their communities in what feels to many of them like an increasingly unstable time. If Democrats aren’t willing or able to offer more reassuring answers, they can’t be surprised by Americans’ continued openness to supporting Trump and others like him.

The party is thus in urgent need of a new approach to issues like immigration and crime. And there are some good examples from the recent past of what this path forward could look like.

Denmark

Two weeks after my February immigration piece came out, the estimable David Leonhardt published a lengthy treatise examining how Denmark has managed to avoid the fate of other European countries where a populist, nativist right is surging. Leonhardt he zeroed in on a clear cause: the Danish center-left party, the Social Democrats, chose to use their power to tackle the immigration issue before the right could weaponize it.

Leonhardt notes that Denmark’s liberals have succeeded in pursuing much of their domestic agenda, including continuing to provide a generous welfare state for its people, expanding worker protections, combatting climate change, and more. But simultaneously, they took a very different approach to immigration:

Nearly a decade ago, after a surge in migration caused by wars in Libya and Syria, [Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen] and her allies changed the Social Democrats’ position to be much more restrictive. They called for lower levels of immigration, more aggressive efforts to integrate immigrants and the rapid deportation of people who enter illegally. While in power, the party has enacted these policies. Denmark continues to admit immigrants, and its population grows more diverse every year. But the changes are happening more slowly than elsewhere.

These policies made Denmark an object of scorn among many progressives elsewhere. Critics described the Social Democrats as monstrous, racist and reactionary, arguing that they had effectively become a right-wing party on this issue. To Frederiksen and her aides, however, a tough immigration policy is not a violation of progressivism; to the contrary, they see the two as intertwined…[S]he described the issue as the main reason that her party returned to power and has remained in office even as the left has flailed elsewhere.

Leftist politics depend on collective solutions in which voters feel part of a shared community or nation, she explained. Otherwise, they will not accept the high taxes that pay for a strong welfare state…High levels of immigration can undermine this cohesion, she says, while imposing burdens on the working class that more affluent voters largely escape, such as strained benefit programs, crowded schools and increased competition for housing and blue-collar jobs.

Frederiksen added, as if speaking directly to the Democrats, “Working-class families know this from experience. Affluent leftists pretend otherwise and then lecture less privileged voters about their supposed intolerance.”

Burn-Murdoch’s data confirms that mainstream parties in Denmark have remained much closer to the public’s views on immigration—specifically, its desire for migrants to “adapt to the customs of this country”—than they have in other countries that have witnessed the rise of a populist right.

Finally, Leonhardt offers this important observation:

Immigration has often been chaotic, extralegal and more rapid than voters want. The citizens of Europe, the United States and other countries were never directly asked whether they wanted to admit millions more people, and they probably would have said no if the question had appeared on a ballot. Instead, they revolted after the fact…

For progressives in the United States, Denmark may not be an especially comfortable exemplar. The cruel aspects of Trump’s immigration policy have understandably outraged many people. But…Denmark offers a glimpse at what a different version of the left can look like—more working-class, more community-focused and more restrictive on immigration. Frederiksen and her Social Democrats have confronted their peers elsewhere with a question: In the modern age, is a restrictionist border policy a prerequisite for successful modern progressivism?

Though Denmark continues to admit a modest level of immigrants each year, it is clear that the ruling Social Democrats believe their rethinking of immigration policy is not just be a matter of good politics—though it is certainly one consideration—but also the right thing to do by the nation’s citizens.

Poland

Since Denmark set the example for how center-left parties in Western democracies can responsibly tackle the immigration issue, others have begun to follow suit, including Poland. Like other European countries, Poland has experienced a severe backlash over its immigration levels. Writing recently for

, Leo Greenberg examined how the country’s centrist governing coalition has tried to navigate this moment:

The new liberal coalition faced two border crises, public sentiment that had moved sharply against non-Western migrants, the ever-present threat of the [populist-right party] PiS’s return to power, and the need to repair Poland’s relationship with European institutions. Their response was the 2025–30 Migration Strategy, issued in late 2024. The Strategy outlined a points-based system to attract economic migration and promised to construct integration centers to help immigrants learn Polish and navigate social services…

Poland’s former Justice Minister, Adam Bodnar, justifies the policy by arguing: “if you are not controlling the border, it means that you are not effective…the effectiveness of the government should be cherished in defending liberal democracy, or you create a chance for voices against liberal democracy to create a fully illiberal project.” The government’s limitation of human rights, in his eyes, was a necessary tool to keep populists out of power.

Crucially, though, Duszczyk does not see the moves solely as concessions to political necessity. Rather, he sees them as part of the necessary work of statecraft to preserve a sense of social cohesion. Change that is too fast or too unpopular—especially for a country with a history of foreign exploitation, painful lockdowns during COVID, and a war on its border—risks failing the first test of government: providing people with a strong sense of security.

Sound familiar?

Poland’s Danish-like approach highlights two core pieces of any sensible immigration policy in the West. The first is measures supporting the assimilation and integration of new migrants to help bolster social cohesion. The desire for such a policy is illustrated in Burn-Murdoch’s survey data, which shows that no less than 60 percent of people in six different European countries said this should be a requirement. And the second is an affirmative belief that controlling a country’s borders and the flow of people across them is good.

Representative Jake Auchincloss

There are certainly some notable Democrats, like Senator Ruben Gallego, who have vocally urged the party to pivot to the center on issues like immigration and crime and promoted reasonably tenable reform plans to achieve this. But one who seems to be grappling with the bigger picture—with the broader stakes of social disorder—is Congressman Jake Auchincloss, who represents Massachusetts’ Fourth District.

At the core of Auchincloss’s theory is what he calls “cost disease,” the seemingly never-ending rise of costs in sectors like housing, utilities, and healthcare. As certain routine expenses become more difficult for Americans to pay, many feel that their lives—and perhaps by extension the world the round them—are becoming less stable and more disorderly. Auchincloss identified the inflation that plagued the second half of Biden’s presidency as a driver of Americans’ sense of social disorder and has argued that Democrats lost because “we were not perceived as upholding social order.”

Auchincloss has also chastised his party for its action (or inaction) on recent, related issues, such as some Democratic-run cities and states keeping schools closed during the Covid pandemic even after public health authorities said it was safe to re-open them. He believes these decisions were “too focused on process, not enough on outcomes that mattered, which was getting kids back in schools. And there was a condescending attitude to parents who were rightfully frustrated watching kids atrophy at home.” The pandemic itself precipitated a stronger sense of social disorder for many people, and the indefinite restrictions on public life did not seem to make them feel otherwise but may have in fact achieved the reverse.

Additionally, the congressman has taken to task public officials who tolerate other forms of public disorder as a fact of life, including homelessness and crime, criticizing his party for not being “muscular” enough on these issues and arguing that, for example, cities “should be able to clear…open air encampments.” It wasn’t long ago that such sentiments were not only uncontroversial but widely shared in the Democratic Party.

At present, Americans don’t seem to buy that Democrats have substantively shifted in a new direction on these issues, likely a lingering effect of Biden’s tenure. Take immigration. During his term, voters sensed an apparent lack of desire to crack down on the surge of border crossings until it became a political liability. At the eleventh hour, Biden and Kamala Harris pushed for a legislative fix, but even after Trump derailed bipartisan congressional negotiations and Democrats cried foul, voters still blamed Biden more for the border woes than they did Trump.

Moreover, as my colleague Ruy Teixeira highlighted last week, the writer Josh Barro recently observed that while some in the party have sought much-needed fixes to broken aspects of the immigration system such as the asylum process, there still isn’t much of an appetite for addressing harder questions about deportations and illegal immigration other than denouncing Trump. And this likely adds to the public’s continued skepticism that the party has really changed.

On crime, the decision of several “progressive prosecutors” in major American cities to begin decriminalizing certain offenses toward the end of the previous decade also seems to have turned some voters off to the Democratic Party, especially after the subsequent rise in violent crime during the early years of the pandemic. Though research suggests a complicated causal link between these prosecutorial changes and the crime trends, voters nonetheless delivered swift blowback to those politicians and continue to view crime as a serious problem—and trust Republicans more.

Democrats needn’t align themselves wholly behind Trump’s policies or rhetoric to show they take Americans’ concerns seriously and are making real changes to address them. Indeed, voters have issues with some of his policies as well. But the party also can’t avoid hard conversations or remain uncritical of certain shibboleths if it wishes to regain voters trust.

Any path forward must demonstrate convincing evidence of a shift from the past, including a clear intolerance for social disorder, an acknowledgement that Americans have a right to be concerned about their borders and the pace of immigration without being labeled as xenophobic, and an understanding that building a more progressive society requires high levels of trust—and order.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!adTx!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F876f19f5-3e5e-42ee-8193-228d0e8da749_1024x698.jpeg",N,,2025-09-30 12:58:14.977138

""These individuals will return to the country within the next one or two days,"" Iranian foreign ministry official Hossein Noushabadi told Iran's Tasnim state news agency.

He said most of those being flown to Iran, via Qatar, had entered the US illegally - mainly through Mexico.

There has been an increased number of Iranians entering the US in recent years, including many who fear persecution at home.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told the BBC: ""The Trump administration is committed to fulfilling President Trump's promise to carry out the largest mass deportation operation of illegal aliens in history, using all the tools at our disposal.""

Noushabadi said some of those being deported held valid US residency permits, adding that US officials had sought their consent for their return.

He called on the US government ""to respect the rights of Iranian migrants and their citizenship rights under international law"".

The New York Times, citing two senior Iranian officials familiar with the matter, said the flight of deportees was expected to arrive in Iran later on Tuesday.

Iran has been working with the US on a deal to remove the Iranian nationals through its US Interests Section at the Pakistani embassy in Tehran.

It is a rare instance of cooperation between Iran and the US, who do not have formal diplomatic ties.

Noushabadi said as part of the deal some 400 Iranian nationals are expected to be deported from the US, with this flight considered the first phase.

The US has already reached bilateral deportation agreements with a number of countries.

Earlier this year, Panama and Costa Rica agreed to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants from the US.

President Trump has repeatedly pledged to cut the flow of immigration to the US and plans to deport a record number of people living in the country without legal status - including to countries with controversial human rights records.

He has promised to ""launch the largest deportation programme of criminals in the history of America"" - but it is not known whether the Iranian nationals being deported have criminal records.

Trump's moves have drawn strong criticisms from human rights groups in the US and abroad, who say migrants face the risk of being sent to countries where they could be harmed.

In Iran, the regime's human rights record has been strongly criticised by rights groups, with UN experts also warning on Monday that there has been a ""dramatic escalation"" in the use of the death penalty this year.

Some 15% of non-citizen healthcare workers originate from nations under temporary protected status.
“This is why it’s so laughable on its face, that the Trump administration equates TPS with gang activity, because these are all people who have undergone background checks.
“It’s obvious the Trump administration is using the language of criminality as a justification to target and punish the innocent.” Newman also represents the family of Kilmar Ábrego García, a father of three in Maryland whom the Trump administration wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March.
“Americans will pay the price if the health care workforce crisis is worsened by President Trump’s TPS terminations,” the letter added.","The US healthcare system faces a “perfect storm”, more than 100 members of Congress warn today, as Donald Trump’s administration risks exacerbating pressure on its workforce by stripping nearly one million US immigrants of work authorization and legal protection.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) has granted about 570,000 US workers protection from deportation, as their home countries are regarded as dangerous, due to factors like war and natural disaster.

Under Trump, the federal government has sought to cancel this status for people from eight countries – Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria, and Venezuela – raising concerns about the impact on key sectors of the US workforce.

In a letter sent today to senior Trump officials, seen by the Guardian, an array of Democratic lawmakers led by the veteran senator Elizabeth Warren caution that the US healthcare system “cannot withstand yet another blow” after broader cuts since Trump return to office. “The most vulnerable Americans in need of healthcare will pay the price,” they warn.

Signatories of the letter – sent to Kristi Noem, US homeland security secretary; Robert F Kennedy Jr, health and human services secretary; and Lori Chavez-DeRemer, labor secretary – include Warren, senators Chris Van Hollen, Ed Markey, Cory Booker, Tammy Duckworth, andKirsten Gillibrand, as well as ongresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Pramila Jayapal, and Jasmine Crockett.

Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, also signed the letter.

Immigrants make up between 32 to 40% of workers in US home care settings, they note in the letter, 24% in residential care, and 21% in nursing facilities. Some 15% of non-citizen healthcare workers originate from nations under temporary protected status.

“The TPS terminations, together with the massive cuts to Medicaid from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), will combine to create a perfect storm for Americans’ health care,” the lawmakers write. “While the termination of TPS will remove thousands of health care workers from the workforce, the OBBBA will make deep cuts to Medicaid, force hospital and nursing home closures, and trigger health care workforce layoffs.”

The revocations could result in tens of thousands of immigrants reverting to being undocumented, and place them at risk of arrest and removal by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). They also raise questions about the administration’s claims that they are only focused and targeting “criminals” and the “worst of the worst” in deportation efforts.

“The revocation of TPS belies the claim that they’re going after criminals on its face, because everyone who has TPS has undergone rigorous and ongoing background checks,” said Chris Newman, legal director and general counsel for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), told the Guardian. “This is why it’s so laughable on its face, that the Trump administration equates TPS with gang activity, because these are all people who have undergone background checks. It defies reality to make that claim.

“It’s obvious the Trump administration is using the language of criminality as a justification to target and punish the innocent.”

Newman also represents the family of Kilmar Ábrego García, a father of three in Maryland whom the Trump administration wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March. A federal court later ordered his return to the US. The administration has continued in court to try to have Ábrego García deported again. He is being held in an immigration detention center in Pennsylvania.

In their letter, the lawmakers warn the TPS cancellations will result in significant staff losses that healthcare facilities across the US will struggle to replace, as the industry struggles to meet the growing demand for home healthcare and nursing workers for an ageing populace.

“Americans will pay the price if the health care workforce crisis is worsened by President Trump’s TPS terminations,” the letter added. “As research on nursing home staffing shows, fewer nurses mean more medication errors, more falls, more delayed diagnoses, and increased patient mortality.

“Fewer nursing and home health professionals also have a ripple effect across the health care system, contributing to discharge backlogs in many other care settings – from post-acute rehabs to hospitals.”

The fine print: ICE's own directives suggest using solitary confinement on people with mental health conditions only as a last resort.
Yet almost half of solitary confinement placements in the New England detention centers involved people with reported mental health conditions, according to the report.
Caveat: The federal government started requiring more rigorous documentation of solitary confinement placements starting in December 2024, so the number of incidents before may be severely undercounted.","Massachusetts jails that have held immigrant detainees have isolated people for weeks at a time, a new report states.

The big picture: An increasing number of solitary confinement placements in the U.S. drag on for 15 days or longer, which the United Nations says constitutes psychological torture, according to the report by Harvard University researchers and Physicians for Human Rights.

Harvard researchers focused on immigrant detention centers, which experts say are primarily focused on holding immigrants to ensure they make their court hearings and check-ins — not to punish them for immigration violations.

Driving the news: Researchers found that nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers nationwide between April 2024 and August 2025, per data provided exclusively to Axios.

This often happened in state and county jails that contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold detainees, including in Massachusetts jails.

There were 117 instances of detainees being separated from the general population at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility, the lone jail in Massachusetts with active ICE detention contracts.

What they're saying: ""We are torturing people simply because they want a better life in the U.S.,"" says Sam Zarifi, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights.

It's not only horrific treatment of people, he added, but it violates U.S. and international law.

The other side: Karen Barry, director of external affairs for the Plymouth County Sheriff's Office, says correction officers practice ""administrative segregation,"" not solitary confinement, meaning those detainees still interact with staff, mental health clinicians and sometimes other inmates daily.

Barry declined to comment on the report, but she cited state regulations that say officers may segregate a detainee who poses a substantial threat to safety, a threat of damaging property, or a threat to ""the operation of a state correction facility.""

Segregation can only happen for administrative, not disciplinary, reasons, per state regulations.

Yes, but: A 2024 report by the advocacy group Prisoners' Legal Services says inmates reported little differences between solitary confinement and administrative segregation practices at Plymouth County Correctional Facility.

Zoom in: The report also analyzed solitary confinement placements in New England between 2018 and 2023, finding 186 placements across six facilities lasting well over 15 days.

The reasons for solitary confinement ranged from ""seemingly trivial violations"" like kicking a cell door or smoking to filing grievances, requesting basic needs like showers, or reporting sexual assault, the report states.

Barry also said detainees in Plymouth County are never isolated in retaliation for filing grievances or reporting incidents.

By the numbers: Between 2018 and 2023, Plymouth reported 82 placements lasting on average 25 days.

Bristol County Correctional Facility, which ended its contract in 2021, reported 47 placements, lasting on average 36 days.

Suffolk County Corrections, which ended its contract in 2019, reported nine placements, lasting on average 27 days.

Representatives of Suffolk and Bristol county jails did not respond to inquiries from Axios.

The fine print: ICE's own directives suggest using solitary confinement on people with mental health conditions only as a last resort.

Yet almost half of solitary confinement placements in the New England detention centers involved people with reported mental health conditions, according to the report.

Caveat: The federal government started requiring more rigorous documentation of solitary confinement placements starting in December 2024, so the number of incidents before may be severely undercounted.

But researchers say even the estimates after 2024 may be undercounted because ICE has historically published incomplete data.",https://static.axios.com/img/axios-site/axios-placeholder-16x9.png,N,,2025-09-30 08:57:18.367313

Citing two senior Iranian officials involved in the negotiations and a US official with knowledge of the plans, the report said a US-chartered flight took off from Louisiana on Monday night and was scheduled to arrive in Iran via Qatar on Tuesday.

The deportees, including men and women -- some couples -- were either long in detention or had asylum requests denied, Iranian officials told the Times. Some had volunteered to leave after months in US custody, while others had not yet appeared before a judge.

The deportation marked one of the most direct efforts yet by the Trump administration to remove migrants even to countries with severe human rights conditions, the Times said.

The Times described the deportation as a rare moment of cooperation between Washington and Tehran, after months of negotiations.

Iranian officials said the country’s foreign ministry was coordinating the deportees’ return and that they had been assured of their safety. Still, they said, many were disappointed and some frightened.

Iran confirms 120 nationals to be deported

Later on Tuesday, Iran’s Foreign Ministry confirmed that 120 Iranian migrants are being deported from the United States and will return home in the coming days, saying they will receive full consular support.

Hossein Noushabadi, the ministry’s parliamentary director, told Tasnim news agency that US immigration authorities had decided to expel about 400 Iranians, mostly those who entered the country illegally, “with the first 120 to be deported soon, most of them having crossed through Mexico.”

“Some of those now returning even had residency permits, but the US authorities decided to include them in the list,” he said. “Their consent for repatriation has been obtained.”

Noushabadi said Iran had lodged diplomatic notes via the US Interests Sections in Tehran and Washington, urging Washington to respect the rights of Iranian migrants.

“We asked the US government to ensure Iranian migrants are not deprived of consular services, fair trial rights, and protections under international law,” he said.

He stressed that Tehran would support returnees. “Iran will definitely host its nationals who migrated for any reason,” Noushabadi said. “These people are Iranians, they left Iran legally, and there is no obstacle to their return.”

He added that if other Iranians on the US list are deported, they will also be accepted, and that the first group will arrive via Qatar within one to two days.

Deported by US, Iranian Christian convert stranded in Panama jungle camp

Earlier this year, groups of Iranians, including converts to Christianity who face possible persecution at home, were flown to Costa Rica and Panama. Advocates have challenged the flights in court.

For decades, the United States has provided refuge to Iranians fleeing persecution, including women’s rights activists, dissidents, journalists, lawyers, religious minorities and members of the LGBTQ community.

The Times added that the US has historically struggled to carry out deportations to Iran due to a lack of diplomatic ties and travel documents, deporting only about two dozen Iranians in 2024.

“Iran is the homeland of all Iranians, and our compatriots can freely return to their homeland and travel,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said in February in response to earlier deportations, calling US treatment of migrants “harsh and inhumane.”

The deportations follow a broader crackdown. In June, Fox News reported that more than 130 Iranian nationals were arrested across the United States in a nationwide enforcement operation, citing federal sources.

Officials said those detained included individuals with suspected ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Hezbollah, as well as people with criminal records for drugs, weapons, and domestic violence.

One former Iranian army sniper was arrested in Alabama, while another man in Minnesota admitted past ties to Hezbollah, Fox News said.

The deportation also comes amid Iran’s worsening domestic crisis, with the economy battered by inflation, currency depreciation, and power and water shortages.

Trump has called the expansion of federal immigration agents and National Guard troops into American cities necessary, blasting Democrats for crime and lax immigration policies. Following a crime crackdown in the District of Columbia and immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, he’s referred to Portland as “war-ravaged” and threatened apocalyptic force in Chicago.

“Whether it takes place here in the city or the suburbs, it’s all the same to us,” Border Patrol agent Gregory Bovino, known for aggressive tactics in Los Angeles, said Sunday as he walked Chicago streets with dozens of agents.

Here’s a snapshot of where things stand with federal law enforcement activity in Chicago, Portland and Memphis.

Chicago raises discrimination claims

Many Chicagoans were already uneasy after an immigration crackdown began earlier this month. Agents have targeted immigrant-heavy and largely Latino areas.

Trump has waffled on sending the military, but Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday it appeared the federal government would deploy 100 troops. Pritzker said the Illinois National Guard received word that the Department of Homeland Security sent a memo to the Defense Department requesting troops to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel and facilities.

An immigration processing center outside Chicago has been the site of frequent protests and aggressive tactics by federal agents.

The enforcement recently escalated, with agents using boats on the Chicago River and marching Sunday on Michigan Avenue and in upscale neighborhoods.

Among the biggest concern from activists and elected leaders is discriminatory stops, particularly after the Supreme Court lifted restrictions on roving patrols in LA. The court cleared the way for immigration agents to stop people based on race, language, job or location.

“ICE is running around the Loop, harassing people for not being white,” Pritzker said, describing the city’s core business district.

Activists said a Latino family of four was led away by federal agents Sunday near the popular “Cloud Gate” sculpture, commonly called “The Bean.” Construction workers and bicyclists were also targeted.

“The downtown operation of being racially profiled and kidnapped by immigration in broad daylight represents a major escalation by the Trump administration,” said Veronica Castro with Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Bovino told The Associated Press that agents will go after “anyone who is here illegally,” an approach that fell under immigration authority, known as Title 8. He told the Chicago Sun-Times that a person’s appearance goes into the calculation.

“It would be agent experience, intelligence that indicates there’s illegal aliens in a particular place or location,” he told the newspaper. “Then, obviously, the particular characteristics of an individual, how they look.”

DHS did not return messages Monday.

Chicagoans trail Border Patrol

As Border Patrol agents marched near downtown, a few onlookers nodded in approval and shouted praise while a trail of activists and others urged agents to leave.

Shirley Zuniga was celebrating her 24th birthday when she saw agents. Still wearing a pink birthday sash, she left brunch to follow them.

Zuniga, among the first in her family of Honduran immigrants to be born in the United States, said she forgot all about her birthday plans as she yelled at them to go home.

“This is much more important to me,” she said as she grew emotional. “I’m celebrating my people.”

Portland goes to court

In Oregon, Democratic Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion in federal court Monday seeking to temporarily block the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard.

The motion is part of a lawsuit Rayfield filed Sunday, after state leaders received a Defense Department memo that said 200 members of the state’s National Guard will be placed under federal control for 60 days to “protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur.”

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson and Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek are among local leaders who object to the deployment.

“Putting our own military on our streets is an abuse of power and a disservice to our communities and our service members,” Rayfield said in a statement Monday.

The ICE building outside Portland has been the site of nightly protests that peaked in June, with smaller clashes occurring since then.

A larger crowd demonstrated at the building Sunday. Two people were arrested for assault, according to authorities. That followed a peaceful march earlier in the day that drew thousands to the city’s downtown and saw no arrests, police said.

Some residents are already frustrated.

The building manager of the affordable housing complex adjacent to the ICE building said “the impacts of violent tactics, including tear gas and late-night altercations, are traumatizing for residents,” including the veterans who live there.

“Sending federal troops will only escalate the situation. The last thing we need is an escalation,” Reach Community Development said in statement.

Memphis residents worry

Memphis was in wait-and-see mode Monday, the first day of a planned federal law enforcement surge ordered by Trump to help fight crime. There were no immediate reports of large-scale federal law enforcement operations.

Still some residents, including Latinos, expressed concerns that immigration agents will detain people regardless of immigration status.

“We know the presence of the National Guard will lead to our neighbors being afraid to seek help when they need medical care, need to report crimes, or require social services, because of this military presence,” said Sandra Pita, a community organizer.

The city has experienced high numbers of violent crimes such as carjackings and homicides in recent years, but both Democratic and Republican officials have noted that the majority-Black city is seeing decreases this year in some categories.

The Minnesota cities of Minneapolis, St Paul and Hennepin county join the ranks of Los Angeles, New York, Boston, and the states of New Jersey and Colorado: Democratic led jurisdictions which are facing similar lawsuits over their sanctuary city policies.

A Trump administration court filing in June – amid demonstrations against immigration raids – called Los Angeles’s sanctuary city ordinance “illegal” and asked that it be blocked from being enforced to allow the White House to crack down on what it calls a “crisis of illegal immigration”.

Over the summer, the justice department sent letters to 13 states it classified as “sanctuary jurisdictions”, including California and Rhode Island, and 22 local governments, from Boston to Seattle, informing their leaders that they could face prosecution or lose federal funding for “undermining” and “obstructing” federal immigration agents.

Last month, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to 34 “sanctuary cities” and counties, according to an executive order Donald Trump signed at the beginning of his second term.

“He wants to provoke conflict so that he can use this as a pretext to send even more federal agents into our city.","After more than a month of threats from President Donald Trump, Gov. JB Pritzker on Monday said the Department of Homeland Security is seeking the deployment of 100 military troops to Illinois “for the protection of ICE personnel and facilities.”

The governor delivered the news surrounded by Mayor Brandon Johnson, Attorney General Kwame Raoul, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and other local leaders as he spoke out about border patrol agents patrolling downtown Chicago with guns — and arrests outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in west suburban Broadview.

Pritzker said the Illinois National Guard obtained a memo that DHS sent to the Defense Department which sought to request 100 military personnel for Illinois. It’s unclear what type of troops would be deployed or when. But Pritzker likened the memo to one sent by the Defense Department to Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek on Sunday, which called 200 members of the Oregon National Guard into federal service for a 60-day deployment, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting.

“What I have been warning of is now being realized,” Pritzker said. “One thing is clear: None of what [President] Trump is doing is making Illinois safer.”

The governor’s office is preparing for the possibility of an imminent arrival of troops. Christian Mitchell, Pritzker’s running mate and his former deputy governor, is an active member of the Illinois National Guard.

Pritzker said the feds are “claiming a need for the protection of ICE personnel and facilities” for the deployment.

It’s unclear what prompted the memo’s directive — but two people were each charged with forcibly assaulting and resisting federal officers during protests last weekend outside the Broadview facility. Ray Collins and his partner, Jocelyne Robledo, each allegedly carried a loaded 9 mm semiautomatic pistol Saturday, but authorities confirmed they had “lawful permits.”

At the same time, Broadview police have opened an investigation into federal agents after an allegedly unprovoked attack on a CBS News Chicago reporter’s vehicle Sunday. In a report Sunday night, CBS said reporter Asal Rezaei was alone, driving her truck to the facility early Sunday when a masked federal agent shot pepper balls at her from about 50 feet inside the detention facility’s fence. There were no protests or protesters in the area at the time.

Federal officers have fired rubber pellets and chemical irritants into crowds of protesters outside the ICE facility where immigrants are being held in suburban Broadview. The compound has been ground zero for protests since the Trump administration announced the launch of “Operation Midway Blitz” on Sept. 8, bringing a flood of federal immigration officers to the Chicago area to conduct raids and arrests.

“In Broadview, people non-violently holding signs and chanting against brutality, expressing their First Amendment rights have been regularly attacked with chemical agents like tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and flash bangs,” Pritzker said on Monday. “Agents reportedly unholstered their guns and pointed them at protesters. In their own words, ICE intended to unleash ‘a s*** show’ in the Broadview community without provocation and acting like jack-booted thugs.”

The governor learned of the memo “minutes before” he planned to step before media to respond to a weekend of increased ICE activity across Chicago.

Trump has threatened to send troops to Chicago for more than a month, citing the city’s crime rate — which has seen a decline in both violent crime and its murder rates. But DHS and Attorney General Pam Bondi have amplified their messaging that ICE agents are under attack.

Pritzker urged Chicagoans to record any interactions with ICE agents on their phones, and “narrate what you see, put it on social media.

“With one voice, we are telling this unwarranted and unconstitutional occupation by ICE and potentially by military troops to get out of Chicago,” Pritzker said. “You are not helping us.”

Pritzker called the need to protect ICE facilities a “pretext, again, for bringing troops into the city, for normalizing the militarization of our cities. And we just won’t allow that.”

Johnson called armed border agents in downtown Chicago a “stunt that has nothing to do with public safety.

“This is about politics, money and power. The president is using his militarized force the exact way he intended — to advance his political goals. He wants to militarize our cities, whether that’s through ICE or through the National Guard or the United States Army or armed forces,” Johnson said. “He wants to provoke conflict so that he can use this as a pretext to send even more federal agents into our city. What we saw yesterday was an absolute disgrace.”

Both Raoul and Pritzker said a memo was not enough to spark a legal challenge, “but I know that there are actions in waiting and a lawsuit potentially,” the governor said.

Raoul said his office was “prepared” to file a suit should troops be deployed.

Raoul said Illinois would file a lawsuit against the Trump administration “if the evidence follows, the pattern follows what we’ve seen in Oregon.” The state of Oregon and the city of Portland have already filed a federal suit, calling the deployment of National Guard troops unlawful.

“Clearly, this deployment of the federal officers ... is meant to provoke Chicago,” Raoul said. “What the president is hoping to do is foment chaos by inciting out-of-control protests. So I urge Illinoisans, don’t take the bait.”

American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois spokesperson Ed Yohnka said the federal government has offered few details about which “troops” could be sent, meaning “it’s impossible to assess the legality of an order the president has not yet issued.

“That said, the most important thing to recall is that there is no emergency that justifies sending additional force into Chicago,” Yohnka said. “It is just not necessary. It is important to recall that there is a legal prohibition on using U.S. military personnel to conduct routine police activities domestically.”

Over the summer, the Justice Department sued the cities of New York and Los Angeles over similar immigration policies. It also sued Boston earlier this month.

The administration has argued that sanctuary laws, which restrict the extent to which local law enforcement and government agencies can cooperate with federal immigration efforts, impede Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

Brett Shumate, the assistant attorney general at the Justice Department’s Civil Division, said shielding undocumented migrants from federal law enforcement is “a blatant violation of the law that carries dangerous consequences.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250929-minneapolis-skyline-2019-ac-1013p-95cb23.jpg",N,,2025-09-30 03:56:24.617450

That had forced American officials to either hold migrants in detention for long periods or release them into the United States.
The United States deported just more than two dozen Iranians back to the country in 2024, the highest total for years, over the course of several commercial flights.
The two Iranian officials said the deportees included men and women, some of them couples.","The Trump administration is deporting a planeload of around 100 Iranians back to Iran from the United States after a deal between the two governments, according to two senior Iranian officials involved in the negotiations and a U.S. official with knowledge of the plans.

Iranian officials said that the plane, a U.S.-chartered flight, took off from Louisiana on Monday night and was scheduled to arrive in Iran by way of Qatar sometime on Tuesday. And the U.S. official confirmed that plans for the flight were in the final stages. All the officials spoke to The New York Times on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details publicly.

The deportation is one of the most stark efforts yet by the Trump administration to deport migrants no matter the human rights conditions they might be sent into. Earlier this year, the U.S. deported a group of Iranians, many of them converts to Christianity who face persecution at home, to both Costa Rica and Panama. The expanding deportation campaign has sparked lawsuits by immigrant advocates who have criticized the flights

For decades, the United States had given shelter to Iranians fleeing their homeland, which has one of the harshest human rights records in the world. Iran persecutes women’s rights activists, political dissidents, journalists and lawyers, religious minorities and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, among others.

The identities of the Iranians and their reasons for trying to immigrate to the United States were not immediately clear. In the past several years, there has been an increase in Iranian migrants arriving at the southern U.S. border and crossing illegally, including many who have claimed fear of persecution back home for their political and religious beliefs.

The United States had long hesitated or had trouble deporting migrants to certain countries like Iran because of a lack of regularized diplomatic relations and an inability to get travel documents in a timely manner. That had forced American officials to either hold migrants in detention for long periods or release them into the United States. The United States deported just more than two dozen Iranians back to the country in 2024, the highest total for years, over the course of several commercial flights.

The two Iranian officials said the deportees included men and women, some of them couples. Some had volunteered to leave after being in detention centers for months, and some had not, they said. The officials said that in nearly every case, asylum requests had been denied or the people had not yet appeared before a judge for an asylum hearing.

The deportation is a rare moment of cooperation between the United States and the Iranian government, and was the culmination of months of discussions between the two countries, the Iranian officials said.

One of the officials said that Iran’s foreign ministry was coordinating the deportees’ return and that they had been given reassurances that they would be safe and would not face any problems.

He encouraged people to ask federal agents for badge numbers and identification and to speak up for neighbors, saying public documentation is key to protecting civil rights and countering intimidation.","DOWNTOWN — After months of back and forth from President Donald Trump, the military could be deployed in Illinois after all — to help the Department of Homeland Security with immigration enforcement, Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday.

The Illinois National Guard received word Monday that troops were being requested “for the protection of ICE personnel and facilities,” Pritzker said during a Monday news conference.

“Moments ago, the Illinois National Guard received word that the Department of Homeland Security has sent a memo to the Department of War seeking the deployment of 100 military troops to Illinois, claiming a need for the protection of ICE personnel and facilities,” Pritzker said.

The governor said he does not know when troops could be deployed to Illinois. State and city officials have vowed to take legal action if Trump sends the National Guard, and Attorney General Kwame Raoul said that while a memo alone is not enough to trigger a lawsuit, he will be ready to act if troops arrive.

“We are prepared,” Raoul said at the news conference.

According to Tribune, who obtained a copy of the memo, Homeland Security Secretary Andrew Whitaker alleges that ICE and Federal Protective Service agents “have come under coordinated assault by violent groups intent on obstructing lawful federal enforcement actions.” It claims the groups are “actively aligned with designated domestic terrorist organizations.”

The memo requests deployment of Department of War “personnel, trained and equipped for mission security in complex urban environments,” adding that the troops would serve “in direct support of federal facility protection, access control, and crowd control measures,” the Tribune reported.

The move follows a tense weekend in Chicago. On Sunday, U.S. Border Patrol agents armed with rifles marched through Downtown, arresting several people in the Gold Coast, Millennium Park and along the Magnificent Mile.

“All of this has been aimed at causing chaos and mayhem in the hopes of creating a pretext to deploy military troops against Chicago,” Pritzker said.

On Saturday, protests at the ICE processing facility in Broadview turned violent as ICE officers used tear gas, flash-bang grenades and other weapons against protesters and journalists.

“Agents reportedly unholstered their guns and pointed them at protesters. In their own words, ICE intended to unleash quote, ‘a shit show in Broadview’ without provocation and acting like jack-booted thugs,” Pritzker said.

At least five people are facing federal charges related to weekend protests in Broadview.

On Monday, Attorney General Pamela Bondi released a memo directing multiple federal agencies, including the FBI, to defend ICE facilities, specifically in Portland and Chicago.

“Our officers will suppress all unlawful rioting and arrest every person suspected of threatening or assaulting a federal law enforcement officer or interfering with federal law enforcement operations. I am further directing the U.S. Attorney’s Offices for the District of Oregon and Northern District of Illinois to charge all such persons with the highest provable offense available under the law,” the memo said.

While Homeland Security officials described people protesting there as “violent rioters,” those who have been monitoring the protests said federal agents have been the real aggressors.

“The incidents were all provoked by federal agents on the scene, and the force that was used was excessive,” said Brad Thompson, a spokesperson for the National Lawyers Guild Chicago. “It’s very easy for federal agents to initiate charges.”

By Monday afternoon, the Riverwalk was busy again, but traces of the weekend’s tension lingered. Federal patrol boats were seen floating down the Chicago River Monday morning, according to a video posted on X.

Chris Molitor, 64, of Edgewater, stood on the Michigan Avenue Bridge holding a sign that read “F— Trump.” Passersby offered fist bumps, snapped pictures or gave a silent thumbs-down.

Molitor said he was working when Border Patrol agents swarmed Downtown on Sunday and called the display of force “racist.”

“I was disgusted. I was embarrassed. I was extremely mad,” he said.

Border Patrol boats were first spotted on the Chicago River on Thursday. Since then, Chris Evans, a tour guide with Urban Kayaks, said he has seen agents ride by several times, their large guns unsettling guests.

“It was unexpected and it was very off-putting,” Evans said, adding, “I literally just think that it’s just kind of a showing off their muscles.”

Ashtar, a Downtown worker and refugee who asked not to give her last name, said the show of force “creates fear” among immigrants and refugees and diverts resources from programs that would “help build the city to be a better city.” While she does not feel personally unsafe, she worries for friends and family who might feel targeted.

According to Pritzker, 60 percent of the 1,500 people detained by ICE in Chicago and the suburbs have no criminal record. Immigrant advocates sounded the alarm at Monday’s press conference, calling Broadview’s detention center a “black hole” where people “go missing for days.”

Although Broadview is not built to be a holding facility, about 200 people are believed to be held there currently, said Ere Rendón, chief program officer for The Resurrection Project. Rendón described the Broadview facility as overcrowded and poorly equipped, as people are being held without basic necessities.

The facility has no beds, no showers and limited food, with detainees given only childrens’ meals from Subway. Attorneys and families have been barred from speaking with detainees, and some people are allegedly pressured to sign voluntary departure forms, Rendón said.

Additionally, ICE has been accused of unlawfully arresting people without warrants or probable cause. Civil rights and immigrant justice groups filed a notice in federal court Friday representing 27 people, including United States citizens, who were unlawfully arrested since May.

Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois and the National Immigrant Justice Center said federal agents have continued to violate a consent decree that limits ICE from making arrests without a warrant or probable cause, according to the court notice.

The groups have identified over 27 people who were illegally detained without probable cause since May, the groups’ lawyers said in the court notice.

“What this President is doing has certainly stepped outside the bounds of the Constitution. You either support the Constitution or you do not, and it’s clear that this president has eroded the very fundamental rights of who we are as a democracy, and we’re going to use every single tool that’s available to ensure that justice prevails,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said.

Pritzker urged Illinois residents to protest peacefully and document federal activity as reports of aggressive immigration enforcement continue.

“Get out your cell phones, record and narrate what you see, put it on social media peacefully,” Pritzker said.

He encouraged people to ask federal agents for badge numbers and identification and to speak up for neighbors, saying public documentation is key to protecting civil rights and countering intimidation.

Raoul, however, warned residents to not let protests get out of control, saying he believes the Trump administration is trying to bait Illinoisans.

“Clearly, this deployment of the federal officers is meant to provoke Chicago,” Raoul said. “What the president is hoping to do is foment chaos by inciting out of control protests. So I urge Illinoisans, don’t take the bait.”

The ruling came roughly two hours before news broke that the Department of Homeland Security is seeking the deployment of 100 military troops to Illinois, citing the need to protect ICE agents and facilities.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Fuentes said he struggled with the personal judgment of Ray Collins, 31, of Chicago in “bringing a loaded firearm to a public protest — a public protest in this particular time and space.”

“Who brings a loaded firearm to an ICE protest?” Fuentes asked in court.

Collins is among five people now facing federal criminal charges after Saturday’s clash between protesters and federal agents — one of the most volatile since DHS launched its “Operation Midway Blitz” deportation campaign. The feds have used the arrest of Collins and his partner to argue that ICE agents have been endangered by the ongoing protests.

Another man was accused Monday of threatening the life of Border Patrol agents at the Saturday protest.

The allegations follow last week’s shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, which left one detainee dead and two others wounded.

Neither Collins nor his partner, 30-year-old Jocelyne Robledo of Chicago, face criminal charges directly related to the 9 mm semiautomatic pistols they were allegedly carrying Saturday. Authorities confirmed in a criminal complaint the couple had “lawful permits.”

They are instead charged with forcibly assaulting and resisting federal officers. Still, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Havey argued that Collins poses a danger to the community because he “brought a loaded pistol to a volatile situation.”

Defense attorney Richard Kling argued that Collins lives in Englewood and routinely carries a gun for protection. Kling said Collins had a Firearm Owner’s Identification card and a concealed carry license.

“Like you carry your keys, he carries a gun,” Kling told the judge.

Fuentes eventually sided with prosecutors when it came to Collins’ detention. The judge found Robledo ineligible for a detention hearing and ordered her release, though. While records suggest the couple is married, Kling referred to Robledo as Collins’ fiancee in court.

The criminal complaint alleges that Collins and Robledo “refused to retreat” Saturday when agents sought to widen a perimeter around the ICE facility in Broadview. When agents began to push people away, Robledo allegedly pushed back.

That apparently prompted a struggle. As agents tussled with Robledo, they allegedly found the pistol she was carrying in a band around her waist. Then, Collins allegedly yelled at agents to get away from his wife and charged toward them, leading to another struggle and the discovery of his gun, according to the complaint.

Criminal charges have also been filed against Paul Ivery, 26, of Oak Park; Hubert Mazur, 21, of Medinah; and Dana Briggs, 70, of Rockford. Mazur is charged with forcibly resisting a federal officer, a misdemeanor.

The others are charged with felony assault of a federal officer.

Prosecutors did not seek detention for Mazur or Briggs. Ivery is being held in custody pending a later detention hearing.

The complaint against Ivery alleges that he shouted something akin to “I’ll f---ing kill you right now” at Border Patrol officers while standing about 6 inches away from them and told the officers to “do something” before running away and jumping on a vehicle.

A supervisory border patrol agent ran after Ivery and, during a struggle, Ivery allegedly grabbed the back of the agent’s helmet and pulled the agent’s head down.

According to the complaint, Ivery admitted to his threat during a later interview. He also said he “explained his disappointment that ICE agents were disrespectful towards the Broadview Police Department and veterans,” the document said.

Briggs allegedly refused to move out of a street when instructed by agents, but an agent made contact with him and knocked him backward.

As agents moved forward to arrest Briggs, he allegedly tried to hand off his phone to another protester. When an agent reached forward to prevent him from doing so, Briggs allegedly swung his right arm toward the agent’s left arm, striking the agent.

The complaint against Mazur alleges that Mazur refused to step back as ordered when agents tried to move protesters away from the facility. It says an agent pushed him before Mazur grabbed the agent’s arm, causing Mazur to be shoved again.

Both then ended up on the ground, where Mazur continued to resist arrest until being placed in handcuffs, according to the complaint.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2fc44e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4676+0+394/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fde%2Ff3%2F78dc2ce04265a3e22c5276e8b7f7%2Fbroadview-092825-0096.JPG,N,,2025-09-29 22:57:50.525435

During a hastily scheduled meeting on Monday evening, school board members voted 6-0 to place Dr. Roberts on unpaid leave, a day after the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked his state license. Dr. Roberts, who was placed on paid leave on Saturday, is being held in a jail nearly 200 miles away.

All of it left residents of Iowa’s capital city confused, concerned and unsure how to square their impressions of Dr. Roberts, whose vision for the school district was embraced by many, with claims by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that he had faced a deportation order since last year and had fled from officers when they approached him on Friday.

“Two things can be true at the same time — Dr. Roberts was an effective and well-respected leader, and there are serious questions related to his citizenship and ability to legally perform his duties as superintendent,” Jackie Norris, the school board chair who is also a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, said in a statement before the meeting.

Ms. Norris said during the meeting that the district was formally notified by federal officials on Monday that Dr. Roberts was not authorized to work in the United States, and that the district had received a copy of an order of deportation. She set a noon Tuesday deadline for Dr. Roberts’s lawyer to provide information refuting that information. If he did not, she said the board would begin the process of ending Dr. Roberts’s employment contract.

Alfredo Parrish, a lawyer for Dr. Roberts, said in a brief interview on Monday evening that his client had been cooperating with the school board.

“It’s my thought that they have now thrown away the valuable tool of due process, and did this without any sufficient notice to me or Dr. Roberts, and we believe that’s concerning,” said Mr. Parrish, who declined to address whether his client was authorized to work in this country.

The superintendent’s arrest came against the political backdrop of President Trump’s deportation campaign. Iowa Republicans and federal immigration officials expressed alarm at how someone without legal status might have been able to lead a 30,000-student school district, which is the state’s largest.

Sam Olson, an ICE field office director, described the employment of Dr. Roberts as “beyond comprehension,” and Representative Randy Feenstra, an Iowa Republican, said on social media that Dr. Roberts “should never be near children.”

“It still seems baffling to me how someone could be hired and their status not be legal in that process,” said the Rev. Robyn Bles, who has a child in the district. “The case that is being presented to us doesn’t stand up to the fact that he has been hired and worked in multiple districts and multiple states. So what’s going on in all of those places?”

Over a roughly two-decade education career, Dr. Roberts, who was born in Guyana, had moved from state to state and built a national profile as an administrator. He wrote books, spoke at conferences and supported racial equity programs, sometimes drawing criticism from conservatives.

He also was issued citations by police officers several times, often for speeding or other traffic offenses. While working as a superintendent in Pennsylvania in 2021, a state game warden cited him for having a loaded firearm inside a vehicle, and Dr. Roberts later pleaded guilty. Des Moines officials said they had been aware of that citation when they hired Dr. Roberts but did not find it disqualifying. Dr. Roberts was in possession of a gun and knife when confronted by ICE agents on Friday, officials said.

In the two years since coming to Des Moines, Dr. Roberts had been a highly visible presence, stopping by classrooms regularly and asking voters to approve additional funding for the district. Dr. Roberts, a former Olympic runner for Guyana, was known for sometimes racing with students during his visits to schools. School board members said they had no idea that his immigration or work eligibility status had been in dispute.

Ako Abdul-Samad, a former Democratic state representative from Des Moines, said on Monday before the school board meeting that he was concerned about a rush to judgment against the superintendent amid “a lot of unanswered questions.”

“When there’s an officer shooting, that officer is placed on paid leave until all the facts are in, right?” Mr. Abdul-Samad asked. “We’re asking the same thing. Place him on paid leave until the facts are in.”

In its statement announcing the arrest on Friday, ICE said Dr. Roberts had entered the country on a student visa in 1999 and was ordered to be removed from the country in May 2024. What happened with his immigration status in the intervening quarter-century remained unclear, as did how, if he did not have work authorization, Dr. Roberts had managed to land jobs in Maryland, Missouri, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.

Des Moines Public Schools officials said Dr. Roberts, whose base salary is about $286,000, had filled out forms at the time of his hiring that were intended to prove that he was allowed to work in the United States. Ms. Norris said Dr. Roberts said on those forms that he was a United States citizen, and that he had provided a driver’s license and Social Security card.

In reality, ACA premium tax credits are available only to U.S. citizens and immigrants who are lawfully present in the United States.
Undocumented immigrants are also ineligible for other federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
In fact, lawfully present immigrants are generally subject to a five-year waiting period before becoming eligible for Medicaid.
Telling debunked lies about undocumented immigrants will not take away from the real pain that millions of Americans will experience in the months ahead if Congress fails to act.","In an attempt to distract from the damage these premium increases will cause and the Big “Beautiful” Bill’s (BBB) historic health care cuts that Trump signed into law this summer, the White House as well as Senate and House Republican leaders are peddling a bald-faced lie: They are erroneously claiming that Democrats are holding funding for the federal government hostage in order to pay for health care for undocumented immigrants. While Democrats in Congress have made clear that they cannot support funding bills that sustain the Republican health care cuts that increase costs, in no way would reversing those cuts and extending enhanced premium tax credits provide federal funding for undocumented immigrants’ health coverage.

In reality, ACA premium tax credits are available only to U.S. citizens and immigrants who are lawfully present in the United States. Federal law limits both eligibility for enrollment in the marketplaces and premium tax credits to people who can prove they reside here lawfully. Furthermore, every marketplace enrollee is required to have their Social Security number or other identity documents verified to receive coverage.

Undocumented immigrants are also ineligible for other federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). In fact, lawfully present immigrants are generally subject to a five-year waiting period before becoming eligible for Medicaid.

As the government funding deadline approaches, congressional Republicans are desperate to distract from the fact that the Trump administration’s agenda is increasing health care costs; shuttering rural hospitals and clinics; and betraying the president’s own promises to lower prices. It’s a key reason why poll after poll shows that the American people would blame the president and congressional Republicans in the event of a shutdown and that the American people want Congress to prioritize lowering health care costs in funding the federal government. Telling debunked lies about undocumented immigrants will not take away from the real pain that millions of Americans will experience in the months ahead if Congress fails to act.

Citizenship and Immigration Services when his wife was detained by federal agents during what they believed was her final step toward becoming a citizen: an interview for her green card.
The only explanation given to the couple was that Marques had missed a 2019 court appearance — one they say she was unaware of.
At 4 a.m. Monday, he received a call from Marques informing him she had been moved to a detention facility in Louisiana.
He said he would do it himself, but according to federal rules, only an attorney is permitted to do so.","A newly married man says he and his wife were lied to and tricked by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services when his wife was detained by federal agents during what they believed was her final step toward becoming a citizen: an interview for her green card.

Barbara Marques, who came to the U.S. seven years ago from Brazil to explore life in the states, met Tucker May on a dating app. The pair bonded over a shared love of film and married in April.

“We fell for each other very quickly,” May told KTLA’s Rachel Menitoff.

He said that when it came to his wife’s immigration process, the couple followed every rule, which is why they showed up for their USCIS appointment at the federal building in downtown Los Angeles. There, they were reportedly told that their paperwork was in order and everything looked good.

“The USCIS representative looked us right in the eyes and said, ‘Everything looks good,’” May said.

Moments later, the representative asked Marques to accompany him to make a copy of her passport.

As soon as she left the room, May said, she was detained by immigration agents. The only explanation given to the couple was that Marques had missed a 2019 court appearance — one they say she was unaware of.

“We let her out of our sight. She never came back,” May said. “We were lied to; we were tricked in order to have her separated from the attorney we brought specifically for any kind of worst-case scenario like this.”

Marques was first taken to a detention facility in Adelanto before being transferred to another in Arizona.

May filed urgent court documents seeking signatures that could halt her deportation, but he believes the detention center withheld the paperwork for a week and is still not processing it in a timely manner.

At 4 a.m. Monday, he received a call from Marques informing him she had been moved to a detention facility in Louisiana. The couple fears this could be her final stop before deportation to Central or South America.

“There is a serious clock ticking here. If my wife is sent from this country, if we cannot stop that, it very realistically could be years before she is able to rejoin me here in the United States,” May said. “This is how we treat the people who dream of becoming Americans.”

Not giving up, May is urgently trying to find an immigration attorney in Louisiana who can deliver the court filings to Marques for her signature. He said he would do it himself, but according to federal rules, only an attorney is permitted to do so.

He criticized it as an illegal effort to force Democratic states into complying with a federal immigration campaign they have no legal obligation to support.
Other states that are supporting the Trump administration’s immigration policies received large increases, and some more than 100% increases, the suing states said.
In their lawsuit Monday, California and the other states argued that the Trump administration appeared “undeterred” by last week’s ruling against pre-conditioning funding on immigration enforcement cooperation.
Bonta said the lawsuit is the 40th his office has filed against the current Trump administration to date.","California and other Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration on Monday for allegedly stripping them of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal security and disaster relief funding based on their unwillingness to aid in federal immigration enforcement.

The lawsuit comes just days after a federal judge in a separate case barred the administration from conditioning similar federal grant funding on states rescinding their so-called “sanctuary” policies protecting immigrants.

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said the latest funding reduction — which the states were notified of over the weekend — flew in the face of last week’s ruling. He criticized it as an illegal effort to force Democratic states into complying with a federal immigration campaign they have no legal obligation to support.

“Tell me, how does defunding California’s efforts to protect against terrorism make our communities safer?” Bonta said in a statement. “President Trump doesn’t like that we won’t be bullied into doing his bidding, ignoring our sovereign right to make decisions about how our law enforcement resources are best used to protect our communities.”

The White House referred questions on the lawsuit to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

The agency has previously argued that its core mission is to defend the nation’s security against threats, including from illegal immigration, and therefore that it should be able to withhold funding from states that it believes are not upholding or are actively undermining that mission.

The funding in question — billions of dollars annually — is distributed to the states to “prepare for, protect against, respond to, and recover from catastrophic disasters,” and have been distributed “evenhandedly” for decades by administrations of both political parties, the states’ lawsuit argues.

The funding, authorized by Congress in part after disasters such as September 11 and Hurricane Katrina, pays for things such as the salaries and training of first responders, testing of state computer systems for vulnerabilities to cyber attacks, mutual aid compacts among regional partners and emergency responses to disasters, the states said in their lawsuit.

Bonta’s office said California expected about $165 million, but was notified it would receive $110 million, a cut of $55 million, or a third of its funding. Other blue states saw even greater reductions, with Illinois seeing a 69% reduction and New York receiving a 79% reduction, it said.

Other states that are supporting the Trump administration’s immigration policies received large increases, and some more than 100% increases, the suing states said.

They said the notifications provided no justification for the reductions, noting only that they were made at the direction of Homeland Security. And yet, the reason was clear, they said, including because of recent comments by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials who have stated outright that states who do not cooperate with federal immigration policies and that maintain sanctuary policies would see reduced funding.

“The explanation for DHS and FEMA’s last-minute decision to reallocate $233 million in homeland security funds — the Reallocation Decision — is apparent. Although DHS has for decades administered federal grant programs in a fair and evenhanded manner, the current Administration is taking money from its enemies,” the states wrote in their lawsuit. “Or, as defendant Secretary Noem put it succinctly in a February 19 internal memorandum, States whose policies she dislikes ‘should not receive a single dollar of the Department’s money.’”

The states also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to immediately block the funding cuts — and prevent the Federal Emergency Management Agency from disbursing any related funds that could not be recouped later — as the case proceeds.

Just last week, a federal judge ruled that the administration setting immigration-related conditions on similar emergency funding was “arbitrary and capricious,” and unconstitutional.

“DHS justifies the conditions by pointing to its broad homeland security mission, but the grants at issue fund programs such as disaster relief, fire safety, dam safety, and emergency preparedness,” the judge in that case wrote. “Sweeping immigration-related conditions imposed on every DHS-administered grant, regardless of statutory purpose, lack the necessary tailoring.”

Last month, another judge ruled in a third case that the Trump administration cannot deny funding to Los Angeles or other local jurisdictions based on their sanctuary policies.

In their lawsuit Monday, California and the other states argued that the Trump administration appeared “undeterred” by last week’s ruling against pre-conditioning funding on immigration enforcement cooperation.

After being “frustrated in its first attempt to coerce [the states] into enforcing federal civil immigration law,” the states wrote, “DHS took yet another lawless action” by simply reallocating funding to “more favored jurisdictions” willing to support the administration’s immigration crackdown.

Bonta said the law requires such funding to be distributed based on objective assessments of “threat and risk,” but the weekend notifications showed the Trump administration doing little more than “rushing to work around last week’s order” and “force and coerce” blue states into compliance in a new way.

“This is a lawless, repeat offender administration that keeps breaking the law,” he said.

Bonta said the lawsuit is the 40th his office has filed against the current Trump administration to date. He said his office was in conversation with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office, and that they both believe that “we deserve all the funding that has been appropriated to us.”

Joining California in Monday’s lawsuit were Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.

Like DHS itself, these centers are a post-9/11 innovation meant to strengthen and streamline intelligence gathering and sharing between local, state, and federal law enforcement, with the stated aim of combatting terrorism.
“What I’m worried about is the climate that we’re in right now is very different,” Boston City Councilor Julia Mejia told Bolts.
In 2019, a WBUR investigation revealed that an officer with the Boston Police Department had been deputized as a federal law enforcement agent through the HSI task force.
In her interview with Bolts, Perez Arroyo said the Trump administration’s policies mean that any involvement with law enforcement can put someone on ICE’s radar.","Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has been scrapping with the Trump administration over immigration enforcement all year, a battle replete with threatening letters, lawsuits, congressional testimony, and multiple ICE deployments. After Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the leaders of Democratic cities and states to participate in mass deportation efforts or else face criminal and financial consequences, Wu sent a defiant response, vowing that “Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom, and a home for everyone.”

Soon after their exchange, ICE initiated a new round of operations in Boston and its surrounding cities. On Sept. 4, the Department of Justice sued the city over the TRUST Act, the landmark local policy that limits local law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with ICE. “The City of Boston and its mayor have been among the worst sanctuary offenders in America,” Bondi said in a statement. Meanwhile, Wu, a popular mayor who is sure to win a second term in November, has drawn praise from Democrats desperate for leaders willing to stand up to Trump.

But Wu is also pursuing funding this year that would entrench the bonds between the city’s local police and federal immigration enforcement. In August, as the fight with the DOJ played out, the Boston mayor said that the city would reapply for a $12 million-dollar federal grant that’s meant to fund emergency response—but because it’s routed through a controversial center that channels information from local police to the federal government, civil liberties watchdogs have called it a “Trojan horse” that will facilitate data-sharing with ICE and usher in more raids, immigrant detention, and deportations.

The grant, managed by the Department of Homeland Security, is a major source of funding for the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC), a so-called fusion center. Like DHS itself, these centers are a post-9/11 innovation meant to strengthen and streamline intelligence gathering and sharing between local, state, and federal law enforcement, with the stated aim of combatting terrorism.

Since its inception, BRIC has presided over precisely the sort of monitoring and data collection that activists worry the Trump administration will exploit in its quest to round up and deport undocumented immigrants and target politically active non-citizens. The center, which has consistently drawn concerns about surveillance and privacy rights, manages Boston’s controversial gang database, keeps tabs on politics-related social media activity, and routinely surveils protesters.

In particular, activists and immigration attorneys have long warned that BRIC creates both formal and informal pathways for the Boston Police Department to pass data along to ICE—from networks of surveillance technology, to various taskforces, to a host of databases containing sensitive information. Through BRIC and Massachusetts’ state fusion center, ICE has access to fingerprints and other personal data like license plate information and alleged gang membership. “The whole purpose of it is federal and local law enforcement collaboration,” said Fatema Ahmad, executive director of the Muslim Justice League and one of the center’s fiercest critics. With Trump back in office, she said, her longstanding concerns about how ICE may use the information that BRIC is collecting and sharing are greater than ever: “Exactly what we predicted is happening.”

Under the current administration, the DHS money comes with even more strings attached. In August, the federal government altered the grant to include new requirements that localities spend 10 percent of the disbursed funds on “border crisis response and enforcement.”

Wu has argued that the city can comply with the new federal requirements without working directly with ICE. In fact, she says, Boston already meets the spending requirements through its existing harbor security work. “We do not & cannot comply with their coercion [because] of city ordinance & state law,” Wu, whose office did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, wrote in an August Bluesky post.

Still, DHS specifies that the state agencies that apply for these grants “must coordinate with ICE on all projects and related matters” that fall within this 10 percent. The agency in charge of this process in Massachusetts also did not reply to Bolts’ request for comment.

And despite Wu’s assurances, BRIC’s critics warn that the center is already funneling data to the federal government, and some local officials are nervous that doubling down on the grant means collaboration could escalate further.

“What I’m worried about is the climate that we’re in right now is very different,” Boston City Councilor Julia Mejia told Bolts. “Who’s to say that we will enter with one set of beliefs and end up with unintended consequences?”

The Boston debate has largely focused on the city’s TRUST Act, the 2014 law at the center of the DOJ lawsuit. The ordinance prohibits local police from acting as immigration officers or actively helping ICE out on civil immigration matters. It disallows things like asking people about their immigration status, sending their personal information to ICE, and complying with “detainers,” administrative requests from ICE to hold a person in jail or prison after they are legally free to go in order for immigration enforcement to pick them up.

Wu’s original response to Bondi cited the TRUST Act as a lawful protection against the incursions Bondi has threatened. Wu has also defended her decision to reapply for the federal grant by arguing that the city can spend the funds without running afoul of it.

“Nothing in the 2025 new documents can compel the City of Boston to violate our own city laws or state laws in using this grant money,” she told reporters last month, adding that the city had run an independent legal analysis and feels “on solid ground on solid ground applying for these grants.”

At a March 2025 criminal justice committee hearing on the grant, Boston City Councilor Benjamin Weber inquired, with evident concern, about the possibility of BRIC facilitating data sharing with ICE at a time when “people are being detained for their speech.” BRIC director Ryan Walsh reassured him, saying, “we stringently adhere to the TRUST Act.” Later on, Councilor Ed Flynn seemingly made reference to the protections provided by the TRUST Act, saying: “Why would we not want to accept federal funds that would go to the Boston Police, knowing that we have the most progressive city administration maybe in the country, including the police department?”

He continued: “Isn’t that enough…to accept the funds, knowing that there’s protections built in?” (The Boston Police Department, Flynn, Weber, and an additional councilor on the committee, Erin Murphy, also did not respond to requests for interviews.)

But even after the city council strengthened the TRUST Act in 2019, civil rights advocates have warned that its protections remain limited. “The TRUST Act is a really small barrier to very specific types of collaboration,” Ahmad told Bolts. “There’s just so many other ways that collaboration is happening.” For instance, the law prevents local law enforcement from taking active steps to share information with ICE, but when someone is booked into jail, their fingerprints are still automatically uploaded to a database that ICE can access, under the Obama-era “Secure Communities” program. And a number of police departments in the Boston area upload sensitive information to COPLINK, a database maintained by the state fusion center that an investigative arm of ICE, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), has direct access to.

Today, the TRUST Act continues to allow Boston police to share information with HSI, as long as the primary reason for doing so isn’t simply civil immigration enforcement. The ACLU of Massachusetts has warned that there’s nothing in the revised TRUST Act preventing officers from using low-level crimes as a pretext for contacting ICE.

Heather Perez Arroyo, a senior immigration attorney at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, says BRIC allows for “passive information sharing” between the police and federal agents. The center counts among its ranks at least two federal employees, who work at the FBI and DHS. It also governs federal-local partnerships like the Joint Terrorism Task Force and HSI’s task force.

This arrangement has sparked major controversies in the past. In 2019, a WBUR investigation revealed that an officer with the Boston Police Department had been deputized as a federal law enforcement agent through the HSI task force. The BPD officer and ICE’s field office regularly exchanged emails scanning misdemeanor arrest data to see if they could find undocumented people. In one email discovered by WBUR, ICE sent the officer an immigration detainer—a request to local law enforcement to hold a person in custody so that ICE can pick them up. “Happy hunting,” the sender wrote.

After the arrangement was uncovered, the officer was removed from the task force position. It’s unclear who replaced him; the city council put in a formal request for any current MOUs governing the task force in August, but Mejia’s office told Bolts that Boston mayor’s office has not replied or produced anything.

BRIC also oversees a number of databases that can serve as key sources of information for ICE. Though fusion centers’ initial focus was combatting terrorism, their remit has expanded to include a major focus on ordinary street crime and gang violence—which is why, for instance, BRIC manages the Boston police department’s database of local residents it considers gang members.

The database has repeatedly come under fire for racial profiling: as of 2021, more than 97 percent of those on it were either Black or Latino.To end up on the list, you don’t need to have a criminal conviction, or technically even an arrest. You might just have the wrong apparel or tattoo. But simply being added—even if you’re not a gang member and are later taken off the list—can have devastating and far-reaching consequences.

In 2015, Boston school police mistakenly labeled a Salvadoran teenager, who’d never been arrested before, as a MS-13 associate after reviewing footage of a high school cafeteria argument. They forwarded the report to BRIC, where investigators from ICE’s HSI arm got ahold of it and performed social media surveillance that led them to conclude the young man was a gang member. Relying on this information, an immigration judge chose to deport him.

Perez Arroyo, the immigration attorney, says she has encountered similar situations with her clients because of the BRIC database. After one of her clients was detained shortly after his 18th birthday, ICE lawyers produced a report from HSI labeling him a gang member, based on information from BRIC’s gang database. Even though she was able to prove that the allegations were false and get the man taken off the gang database, the damage was done: “Every immigration judge that he saw from that point had taken that into evidence and used that against him.” Her client was denied bond and held in detention, then deported back to his home country where, she says, “he was afraid of the very gang members that they were alleging him to be.”

As the new administration invokes the Alien Enemies Act to deport people it deems gang members without due process, it has been using similar criteria to the BRIC database to determine gang membership—especially tattoos. “No one would be surprised by the Trump administration doing whatever it takes to get every single name that is on the BRIC gang database to deprive those individuals of due process and to deport them,” Perez Arroyo told city councilors in March.

In her interview with Bolts, Perez Arroyo said the Trump administration’s policies mean that any involvement with law enforcement can put someone on ICE’s radar. “It really puts a red flag up for the people that have any type of interaction with the police, even if it’s something in the past that would not have raised any cause for concern.”

At the March hearing, Walsh tried to assuage the criminal justice committee’s doubts by saying that federal law enforcement employees don’t have “direct access” to Boston’s gang database. He stressed that BRIC shares information with HSI, the investigative arm of ICE, but not with Enforcement and Removal Operations, the part of ICE that carries out deportations.

But the Trump administration has been pressuring federal agencies to share information with each other, dismantling the usual walls and privacy shields that traditionally protected some information from deportation officials. Later on in the hearing, the ACLU’s Kade Crockford said that those traditional distinctions no longer apply, within the agency or beyond it. “It is no longer simply the enforcement and removal wing of ICE, ERO, that is focused on detaining and removing immigrants,” Crockford told the committee. “Under President Trump, the FBI, the DEA, ATF, ICE’s homeland security investigations, and even the state department are now working on civil immigration enforcement matters.”

The GOP megabill, which Trump signed into law in July, juiced immigration enforcement spending by an astonishing $171 billion, which experts predict will also increase the pressure for local law enforcement to get on board with the administration’s draconian immigration agenda.

Mejia, perhaps BRIC’s most vocal critic on the city council, told Bolts that she is in talks to strengthen the TRUST Act. “I do not think that the Boston TRUST Act is at the place that it needs to be for the type of drama that we are experiencing with the federal government,” she said. “I don’t believe we’re ready to meet the moment.” Mejia says she’s in talks with local civil rights organizations to determine how to establish better protections, and she hopes to advance a new ordinance further strengthening protections.

Mejia and the rest of Boston’s city council are on the ballot in November, alongside Wu, though the election seems unlikely to produce much change. The preliminary round in September signaled that incumbent councilors, including BRIC defender Flynn and BRIC critic Mejia, are strongly favored to win reelection.

Growing up, Mejia told Bolts, her mom was undocumented, so the issue is personal to her. “People are living in fear right now. So everything and anything that compromises the safety of the people that we deeply care about is a concern for me.”

That said, Ahmad warns that even well-intentioned TRUST Act reforms probably wouldn’t touch most of the existing avenues of collaboration that occur through BRIC. “There’s so much more that Mayor Wu could do, and other local mayors and cities could do, to protect folks from federal law enforcement,” she said, noting that it’s not just about ICE—“all of these agencies are working together now in immigration enforcement.”

For Ahmad, there are three main changes that could have real impact: pulling out of the Joint Terrorism task force, out of the HSI task force, and abolishing BRIC altogether.

It may sound fanciful, but not so long ago, it was on the table. Wu’s position on BRIC has changed notably from 2021, when she first ran for mayor. At that time, she supported eliminating not only the gang database but BRIC as well. But by 2023, she switched course to support an increase in funds for the BRIC, justifying her move by citing a number of recent reforms to the gang database and police oversight.

BRIC has continued to draw controversy under Wu’s tenure. In 2023, it disseminated regular reports on demonstrations related to Israel’s war on Gaza, according to documents obtained via FOIA by the Muslim Justice League and reviewed by Bolts. BRIC says that it “only reports on First Amendment protected activities for operational planning.”

Still, Wu’s change of heart on BRIC, as well as her strong opposition to the council’s proposed cuts to the Boston Police Department and support for a contract that included raises for officers, has won her the endorsement of the city’s largest police union, the first time in 30 years that it has backed a sitting mayor for reelection. She’s been able to forestall the sort of retaliation campaigns by rank and file officers that have threatened and undermined progressive leaders like Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson or former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio.

But her shift toward supporting BRIC has also increased the city’s dependency on the federal government, given that funding for the fusion center relies in large part on the DHS grant.",https://boltsmag.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/25251558190579-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 22:57:13.071168

Goldman accused the ICE officer of ""violently"" assaulting the woman from Ecuador.","An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who was initially relieved of his duties after being captured on video pushing a woman to the ground outside an immigration court in New York City has been returned to duty, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told CBS News.

The officials, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal move that has not been publicly announced, said the ICE officer was placed back on duty after a preliminary review of the incident.

The move is a striking about-face, just a few days after the Department of Homeland Security released a statement denouncing the officer's conduct as ""unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE.""

""Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,"" the department said in its statement on Friday. It's unclear where that investigation stands.

The ICE officer's actions garnered national attention last week, after videos surfaced on social media depicting his confrontation with a visibly upset Ecuadoran woman at the 26 Federal Plaza building, which houses Manhattan's immigration court.

The confrontation appeared to have started when the woman and her daughter tried to cling to her husband, whom federal immigration officers were attempting to take into custody. Officials were captured on video trying to separate the family, and one of the officers was seen grabbing the woman's hair. Footage shows the husband was ultimately detained by federal agents.

Another video depicts the woman confronting the ICE officer who was initially relieved of his duties. Visibly distraught, she confronts him. ""Take me, too,"" she is heard saying in Spanish. Video appears to show the woman touching the officer with her hands. He tells her not to touch him.

The officer is then captured on camera pushing the woman to the floor in front of her children and a crowd of journalists and federal and court officials. The ICE officer is heard saying ""adios"" — or goodbye — several times during the altercation.

In a statement shared Monday, ICE identified the woman's husband as Ruben Abelardo Ortiz-Lopez, saying he illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in March 2024. The agency said he came onto ICE's radar after being arrested in June by local authorities for ""assault and criminal obstruction of breathing or blood circulation.""

ICE said the woman is also in the U.S. unlawfully and faces deportation proceedings.

Reached for comment, a DHS official did not address the officer being placed back on duty but called the woman's husband a ""criminal illegal alien.""

""President Trump and Secretary Noem are not going to allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,"" the official said. ""If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we will arrest you and you will never return.""

CBS News reached out to representatives for ICE and the White House for comment.

Soon after the videos of the altercation emerged, New York Rep. Dan Goldman and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, both Democrats, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the ICE officer and explore ""potential prosecution."" Goldman accused the ICE officer of ""violently"" assaulting the woman from Ecuador.

YouTube froze Mr. Trump’s account after the riot, blocking him from uploading new videos and arguing that the content could lead to more violence. Mr. Trump sued YouTube in October 2021, claiming that it and other social media firms that removed his accounts had wrongfully censored him.

The vast majority of YouTube’s settlement payment — $22 million — will go to Mr. Trump, according to the filing in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. He has directed that the money be contributed to the Trust for the National Mall and to the construction of a ballroom at the White House.

The remaining $2.5 million will be distributed among other plaintiffs in the case, including the writer Naomi Wolf and the American Conservative Union.

“If he hadn’t been re-elected, we’d be in court forever,” said John Coale, a lawyer for Mr. Trump. “Then the president gets re-elected and things look at lot better.”

A representative for YouTube declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported the agreement earlier.

YouTube’s settlement is the latest move by major technology and media firms to end expensive legal battles with Mr. Trump, who has accused social media platforms of censorship and claimed that media firms have defamed him.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in January settled a similar lawsuit brought by Mr. Trump, agreeing to pay $25 million. X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk and formerly known as Twitter, agreed in February to pay about $10 million to resolve a dispute about the 2021 suspension of Mr. Trump’s account.

Media companies have also made concessions to Mr. Trump. Paramount in July agreed to pay him $16 million to settle his lawsuit over the editing of a CBS “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. ABC News agreed to pay $15 million in December to settle a defamation case filed by Mr. Trump against the network and one of its anchors, George Stephanopoulos.

Last week, YouTube said it would reinstate content creators who were banned for violating its rules against misinformation related to Covid and the 2020 election. The streaming service also said it would relax some of its content moderation policies, in response to an investigation by Republican lawmakers into whether social media companies restricted speech at the behest of the Biden administration.

“Federal law prohibits the expenditure of taxpayer dollars on providing health care to undocumented immigrants,” Jeffries said.
Their short-term spending bill, through Nov. 21, is designed to buy lawmakers more time to hash out a longer-term bipartisan compromise.","House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) warned Monday that Democrats won’t accept any Republican spending bill that makes life more expensive for working class people, pointing specifically to looming health care cuts as a “five-alarm fire” that must be addressed to win his party’s support for legislation preventing a shutdown.

Just hours before he and other top congressional leaders were scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House, Jeffries amplified the Democrats’ opposition to the Republicans’ partisan bill, saying it’s doomed to fail unless Republicans agree to scale back the scheduled cuts to health care programs.

He did not draw specific red lines but pointed directly to threats to Medicaid, Medicare, medical research, vaccine availability and tax credits under ObamaCare that are due to expire at the end of the year.

“What we will not do is support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of the American people,” Jeffries told reporters in the Capitol. “This is a five-alarm fire in terms of the Republican-caused health care crisis. And that’s why Democrats are determined to turn things around.”

Trump had initially agreed to meet with leaders from both parties last Thursday, but he canceled the gathering two days beforehand at the behest of GOP leaders in the Capitol, who maintain that their “clean” spending bill is already bipartisan and requires no further negotiations.

On Saturday, Trump reversed course again, scheduling the meeting for 2 p.m. Monday at the White House. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Jeffries are all expected to attend.

If Congress doesn’t reach a deal, large parts of the government will shut down at the end of the day Tuesday.

Heading into the meeting, GOP leaders have remained open to the idea of addressing the ObamaCare subsidies, which, if they’re allowed to expire, would lead to a spike in health care costs for millions of patients. But the Republicans don’t want that issue to be a part of the current spending debate, arguing that they have time to address it later in the year, since the tax credits don’t expire until Jan. 1.

Jeffries and Democrats have rejected the longer timeline. They note that ObamaCare’s open enrollment process begins Nov. 1, warning that patients will likely opt out of coverage if they see rate quotes — calculated before Congress acts — that they deem unaffordable.

Jeffries also dismissed the Republicans’ argument that Democrats, as part of any new negotiations, should expect new bans on health care for immigrants lacking permanent legal status. He said that ban is already in effect.

“Federal law prohibits the expenditure of taxpayer dollars on providing health care to undocumented immigrants,” Jeffries said. “Nowhere have Democrats suggested that we’re interested in changing federal law. The question for the president is whether he’s interested in protecting the health care of the American people.”

Monday’s breakthrough meeting has provided a glimmer of hope that the sides can reach a deal before Wednesday’s shutdown deadline. With both sides digging in on their current position, however, many in Washington expect the government to close its doors, at least temporarily, which is sure to intensify the blame game over which party is at fault for the impasse.

Republicans say Democrats bear that blame, since Schumer and other Senate Democrats are now opposed to spending levels they had supported in March. Their short-term spending bill, through Nov. 21, is designed to buy lawmakers more time to hash out a longer-term bipartisan compromise.

Democrats reject that argument. And Jeffries emphasized Monday that Republicans control the Senate, the House and the White House, saying it’s therefore their responsibility to draft legislation that can become law and avert a shutdown.

“If the government shuts down, it’s because Republicans want to shut the government down,” he said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/jeffrieshakeem_092525gn10_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-29 19:57:22.665560

OAKLAND – California Attorney General Rob Bonta today, as part of a multistate coalition, sought emergency relief from the U.S. District Court for the District Court of Rhode Island to stop the unlawful reallocation of hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Homeland Security Grant Program funding away from states like California. For decades, California has relied on this funding to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terrorism and other catastrophes. And across each presidential administration, this funding had been allocated even-handedly and on the basis of need and risk. On Saturday, however, California and other states received award notifications that were significantly lower than anticipated — without justification and seemingly based on their states’ decision to use their law enforcement resources to protect public safety rather than assist in federal immigration enforcement. In filing the lawsuit, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition assert that this reallocation exceeds FEMA’s statutory authority, is arbitrary and capricious, and violates the U.S. Constitution.

“The Trump Administration is setting a record as one of the most anti-law enforcement, anti-public safety administrations in America’s history,” said Attorney General Bonta. “Tell me, how does defunding California’s efforts to protect against terrorism make our communities safer? President Trump doesn’t like that we won’t be bullied into doing his bidding, ignoring our sovereign right to make decisions about how our law enforcement resources are best used to protect our communities. We secured a permanent injunction last week blocking the Trump Administration’s illegal efforts to condition this funding, and today, we’re seeking emergency relief to keep them from unlawfully diverting Congressionally-appropriated homeland security funding away from our state without justification and apparently because they don’t like our commitment to public safety. Unlike this President, I will always step up and defend California’s safety.”

The Trump Administration seeks to reduce California’s funding for two Homeland Security Grant Programs. The State Homeland Security Program assists state, local, and tribal efforts in building, sustaining, and delivering capabilities necessary to prevent, prepare for, protect against, and respond to acts of terrorism. The Urban Area Security Initiative assists high-threat, high-density urban areas in addressing terrorism threats. Specifically, these program grants enhance cybersecurity, support infrastructure security enhancements, and fund trainings and exercises designed to test and improve emergency preparedness and terrorism prevention. These funds are also utilized to procure specialized equipment including detection systems for chemical and biological agents, specialized response vehicles, personal protective equipment for first responders, security cameras, and warning systems, among other uses. Congress created these federal grant programs and appropriates billions of dollars each year to ensure they are fully funded to meet the nation’s needs. And for decades, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its sub-agency, FEMA have operated these programs evenhandedly — until the Trump Administration.

On January 20, 2025, his first day in office, President Trump directed DHS to “ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions do not receive access to Federal funds.” The President deemed certain states and jurisdictions in “lawless insurrection,” despite the fact that courts have upheld laws like California’s SB 54 as constitutional and consistent with federal immigration law and firmly rebuked the Trump Administration’s attempts to condition federal funds on assistance with immigration enforcement. Just last week, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a permanent injunction in California’s lawsuit blocking the Trump Administration’s effort to unlawfully impose immigration enforcement requirements on billions of dollars in annual DHS grants. Yet, DHS and FEMA remain undeterred from continuing to attempt to carry out the President’s directive.

On Saturday, September 27, FEMA issued award notifications for its single largest grant program — the Homeland Security Grant Program, which totals approximately $1 billion in funds annually. Consistent with federal law, FEMA has previously issued notices of funding opportunity preliminarily allocating the funding among state recipients based on each jurisdiction’s “relative threat, vulnerability, and consequences from acts of terrorism.” According to that notice, California could expect to receive approximately $165 million in grant funding. However, when California received the grant notification, the award was only $110 million, reflecting a 33% reduction. Some states saw even sharper cuts: Illinois received a 69% reduction in funding, and New York received a 79% reduction. At the same time, many other states saw increases to their allocation upwards of 100%. While the states are still gathering information, a defining factor appears to be whether a state was a so-called “sanctuary” jurisdiction or not. In short, the current Administration appears to be taking money from its perceived “enemies” and reallocating it to its “friends.”

In their lawsuit, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition argue that the reallocation of this grant funding is unlawful and should be vacated and set aside. The Homeland Security Act requires DHS and FEMA to allocate Homeland Security Grant Programs funds using objective, risk-based criteria. Instead, the reallocation appears to rest on another factor: California and other states’ domestic policies about how to best utilize their domestic law-enforcement resources. The reallocation also is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, withdrawing hundreds of millions of dollars from states like California with no explanation and based on factors Congress did not intend DHS to consider. Finally, the reallocation violates the Constitution, by baselessly treating California differently from other states.

In their motion for a temporary restraining order, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition ask the court for immediate, emergency relief requiring FEMA to rescind the award notifications and blocking FEMA from disbursing funding that would then potentially be unavailable to California and other states if they are successful in the litigation.

CHICAGO – Several Southwest Side immigrant rights organizers were detained by federal agents Sunday “without any stated reason,” according to an area alderman and a social media statement by the local rapid response group.

At approximately 9:30 a.m. Sunday, members of the Southwest Side Rapid Response Team responded to a tip of federal agents in Back of the Yards. While they were in the area, three members were “followed, harassed, physically kettled in their vehicles and intimidated by federal officers aiming a firearm at them,” according to the group’s statement.

Federal agents were “aggressive” and started to intimidate organizers when they noticed they were being filmed, Ald. Julia Ramirez (12th) told Block Club. A few blocks down, agents in multiple vehicles surrounded organizers, detained them and moved them to an immigration processing center in Broadview, Ramirez said. They were later released, Ramirez said.

Members “were illegally detained, threatened, harassed and intimidated, without any stated reason for their detainment, nor information about their whereabouts,” the Southwest Side Rapid Response Team’s statement reads.

Ramirez said that organizers and neighbors have a right to film and record federal agents’ actions. Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd) also decried the arrests of residents as they exercised their First Amendment rights.

“This is tyranny and should not be allowed in our city,” he said. “Donald Trump is trying to distract from his problems by scapegoating immigrants.”

It is not the first time residents have been improperly arrested by federal agents, according to watchdog groups.

Civil rights and immigrant justice groups filed a notice in federal court Friday representing 27 people, including United States citizens, who were unlawfully arrested without warrants or probable cause since May.

Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois and the National Immigrant Justice Center said federal agents have continued to violate a consent decree that limits ICE from making arrests without a warrant or probable cause, according to the court notice.

The groups have identified over 27 people who were illegally detained without probable cause since May, the groups’ lawyers said in the court notice.

More than 70 additional cases of potential violations of the Castañon-Nava settlement have been identified, according to the court notice. Earlier this year, the groups sued federal authorities over the arrests of 22 people in the Midwest – including one U.S. citizen.

On Sunday afternoon, armed border patrol agents patrolled some of the most high-trafficked spots in the city, detaining several people, including a family at Millennium Park, according to witnesses and local officials.

Gregory Bovino, the chief U.S. Border Patrol agent, told the Sun-Times/WBEZ that people were being targeted based on how they look.

It is unclear how many people were detained during the operation. Multiple construction workers at a Downtown site and a street vendor near the Art Institute of Chicago appeared to be among those detained, officials said Sunday at an emergency press conference.

Mayor Brandon Johnson said the patrols are a “brazen provocation” by Trump’s administration.

Agents Escalate Violence Against Protesters, Journalists In Broadview

Federal authorities arrested at least one journalist and used chemical weapons on protesters and members of the press in suburban Broadview over the weekend.

Broadview police are investigating the alleged assault of a local television journalist by federal immigration authorities Sunday, the local police chief said. CBS2 Chicago Reporter Asal Rezaei said she was outside the ICE processing facility Sunday when a masked ICE agent inside the fenced area fired a pepper ball, hitting the news truck, “causing the chemical agents to engulf inside.”

The Sun-Times reported that agents fired pepper balls into a group of about 75 protesters Saturday evening and made several arrests outside the ICE Broadview processing center.

Steve Held, a journalist with investigative startup Unraveled, was among those detained, according to Unraveled and other journalists on the scene. Held was “safe” and released overnight, Unraveled said in a social media post Sunday.

Happening In Chicago

Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Monday that the Illinois National Guard has received word that the Department of Homeland Security is asking the Defense Department to deploy 100 military troops to Illinois, claiming a need for protection of ICE personnel and facilities.

Federal agents were spotted Monday morning near Davis Square Park and Midway Airport, according to social media alerts by the Southwest Side Rapid Response Team.

Federal agents detained several people on the Northwest Side Saturday. A family, including two parents and a 6-year-old child, were detained by eight Customs and Border Patrol agents Saturday in the parking lot of a Burlington store at 800 N. Kedzie Ave., according to an alert by the Northwest Side Rapid Response Team. One person was detained by border patrol agents near the CTA Blue Line Belmont Station stop in Avondale and another person was detained at approximately 3:17 p.m. Saturday at West Fullerton and North Tripp Avenues, the group alerted on social media.

Agents were also spotted at a Home Depot at North Kimball and West Addison avenues Saturday afternoon, according to the Northwest Side Rapid Response Team.

Happening In The Suburbs

One woman was detained at approximately 10:30 a.m. Saturday near an Elgin restaurant, according to an alert by the Elgin Area Rapid Response.

“With one voice we are telling this unwarranted and unconstitutional occupation by ICE and potentially military troops to get out of Chicago.","Gov. JB Pritzker said the Illinois National Guard has received word that the Trump administration intends to deploy 100 “military troops” to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who the governor said have “wreaked havoc” during days of protests at a suburban processing center.

Pritzker on Monday said the Illinois National Guard has informed him that the Department of Homeland Security has sent a memo to the Department of War seeking the deployment after ICE agents used chemical munitions and less lethal ammo on protesters outside the agency’s suburban Broadview facility.

“What I have been warning of has now been realized,” Pritzker, who has previously said he believed federal agents would try to provoke a response from local residents in order to justify any military deployment, said at a press conference.

Pritzker added that it remains unclear what troops have been requested or when they could be sent to Illinois.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to send the military into Chicago and Illinois in recent months, pointing to shootings and homicide data in claiming a deployment is necessary, even as violent crime levels have dropped significantly since last year.

In a social media post Monday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the Department of Justice “is deploying agents to protect ICE facilities, arrest violent agitators on the spot, and bring the strongest federal charges possible.”

Pritzker said protesters who have been nonviolently holding signs, chanting and expressing their First Amendment rights, have been “regularly attacked” by ICE agents, whom he claimed have promised to unleash a “shitshow” on Broadview.

According to the National Lawyers Guild of Chicago, at least 11 people were taken into custody following continued confrontations between protesters and ICE agents in Broadview Saturday, including one journalist. As of Sunday, at least five of those people remained in custody, the group said, adding that at least 28 people have been arrested at that facility since Sept. 19.

At least two of those people arrested Saturday were carrying “loaded, concealed firearms” according to a social media post from the Chicago branch of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms bureau. That office claimed the pair were arrested for assaulting officers and injuring an ATF agent at the Broadview facility.

Federal prosecutors in Chicago on Monday announced five people were arrested and face charges including forcibly assaulting or resisting federal officers engaged in immigration enforcement operations in Broadview.

Broadview police are investigating after an U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement agent allegedly fired a “chemical munition” at a vehicle driven by a CBS Chicago news reporter over the weekend.

Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills confirmed his department has launched “a criminal investigation” into what he said was an “allegedly unprovoked attack on a CBS Chicago TV news reporter’s vehicle” on Sunday.

CBS Chicago reporter Asal Rezaei said in a social media post Sunday that an ICE agent “took a direct shot at my car” in an “absolutely unprovoked” attack.

“There was not one protester in sight,” Rezaei wrote. “I was simply driving by to check the scene out like I have been for weeks, about 50 feet from the entrance.”

Rezaei added that “local authorities along with my news org are taking this very seriously.”

In his statement, Mills said a “chemical munition” was allegedly fired “from the direction” of the ICE detention facility.

“The victim declined medical attention,” he said. “The Broadview Police Department expects the full cooperation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security into our criminal investigation.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security — which oversees ICE — claimed in a statement that “no member of the media was “‘attacked.’”

“For their safety, we remind members of the media and journalists to exercise caution as they cover these violent riots,” the spokesperson said. “We have seen rioters throwing rocks, armed with guns, slashing tires, throwing tear gas cans and other violent acts.”

In a social media post about the incident, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said “the residents of Broadview, our businesses, and our visitors should never be caught in the crossfire of reckless actions by federal agents.”

“The deployment of chemical munitions in our small, majority-Black community is not only unjustified but dangerous,” she wrote, adding that her office is calling for an immediate end to “these hostile and wasteful” tactics. “It puts at risk the lives of our residents, our first responders, and even members of the press who are simply doing their jobs.”

Thompson last week wrote a letter to ICE officials demanding the agency stop “making war on my community.”

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly described the protests as “riots” and has claimed that it launched “Operation Midway Blitz” earlier this month, people at the facility have “assaulted law enforcement, thrown tear gas cans, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.”

Pritzker said that ICE has detained around 1,500 people in and around Chicago and that approximately 60% of those have no criminal record.

Pritzker's comments also come one day after armed federal agents patrolled Chicago’s downtown streets on Sunday, a new escalation of an immigration enforcement crackdown in the city that followed Trump’s announcement that he will send troops to Portland in the latest examples of creeping federal law enforcement presence in U.S. cities.

Dozens of armed federal agents, in full tactical gear, walked the streets of some of the city’s most prominent tourist and shopping areas. That comes amid a surge of immigration enforcement that began early this month, including repeated conflict at an ICE building in Broadview, west of Chicago, where federal authorities on Friday and Saturday fired pepper balls and tear gas at protesters.

Mayor Brandon Johnson said families who were simply enjoying a sunny day downtown were instead met with “heavily armed federal agents” who were “aiming to strike fear into our communities.”

Johnson said the agents targeted street vendors and construction workers and claimed agents forced a young girl to act as a translator between them and her family members who were being detained.

“These are heartbreaking scenes that have nothing to do with making our city safer,” Johnson said Monday.

Trump said on social media Saturday that he was directing the Department of Defense to “provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland.” Trump said the decision was necessary to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. His announcement was met with pushback from Oregon’s Democratic governor.

“This is not about fighting crime or about public safety. This is about sowing fear and intimidation and division among Americans,” Pritzker said. “With one voice we are telling this unwarranted and unconstitutional occupation by ICE and potentially military troops to get out of Chicago. You are not helping us.”

Pritzker, alongside notable lawmakers including Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, among others, criticized ""the MAGA Republicans supported invasion"" of Chicago, Portland, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.

""This is not about fighting crime or about public safety,"" he said. ""This is about sowing fear and intimidation and division among Americans. It was about creating a pretext to send armed military troops into our communities.""

President Donald Trump, in an exclusive interview with NBC News on Sunday, said that he is still considering sending armed National Guard troops into Chicago.

“Any place where there is big trouble, we want to go and help out,” he said, calling Chicago a “crime-ridden mess.""

Late last month, Pritzker delivered a strongly worded message, warning the president not to come to the city, following his threats to deploy the National Guard.

Trump reposted videos showing agents in Chicago this weekend, but has yet to make a public statement on their presence.

Noem.

This filing follows a federal district judge’s ruling that the Administration acted unlawfully when it canceled TPS for Venezuelan and Haitian migrants. The court found that DHS Secretary Noem lacked the statutory authority to vacate and terminate TPS designations for those countries.

“Separation of powers requires that the Executive Branch not usurp Congress’s power to make laws; it mandates that the Executive Branch not override the Judiciary’s power to declare what the law is; and it obligates the Judiciary to not shy from its duty to prevent Executive Branch overreach that upsets the carefully calibrated role each co-equal branch plays in our constitutional democracy,” said the Members in the brief’s introduction.

The brief continues, “The Secretary’s actions not only violate the TPS statute but also contradict the bipartisan opposition to terminating Venezuela TPS. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have long supported temporary protected status for Venezuelans who fled dangerous conditions in their country—conditions that persist today.”

The brief asserts that legislative intent of the TPS statute was to (1) standardize the process of awarding humanitarian protection based on enumerated criteria to protect the decision from political pressures and (2) to provide relief to individuals facing serious but generalized forms of harm as opposed to targeted persecution necessary to qualify for asylum. If the government is inherently able to vacate previous designations or extensions due to shifting political winds, then the process is no longer standardized and free from domestic politics. The full amicus brief can be found here.

Guzman was an illegal alien from El Salvador who was picked up by ICE from local law enforcement.

According to ICE records, it is unknown when and where Guzman illegally entered the United States; however, his criminal background dates back to Feb. 19, 2012, when the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office in Palm Springs, Florida, arrested and charged him for battery, improper exhibit of a firearm or dangerous weapon and criminal mischief. All charges were dropped minus the criminal mischief.

On Feb. 14, 2020, the Arlington Police Department in Arlington, Texas, arrested and charged Guzman with driving while intoxicated. Guzman bonded out of custody before ICE was able to lodge a detainer.

On Aug. 25, the Dallas Police Department arrested and charged Guzman with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and an outstanding warrant for driving while intoxicated. On that same date, ICE encountered him at the Dallas County Jail subsequent to his arrest and lodged an immigration detainer.

On Sept. 10, the charge of the aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge was dismissed.

On Sept. 24, ERO Dallas apprehended Guzman in accordance with a detainer for his apprehension. Upon arrival to the ERO Dallas Field Office, ICE officers encountered an active shooter at the facility, targeting immigration officials. Regretfully, Guzman was one the victims of this tragic incident which resulted in his death.

Consistent with ICE policy, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations notified the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Inspector General and the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility via the Integrity Coordination Center. ERO provided telephone notification of the death to the Consulate of El Salvador.

ICE makes official notifications to Congress, nongovernmental organization stakeholders and the media upon an official report of a detained illegal alien’s death and posts a news release with relevant details on the ICE public website within two business days per agency policy. This information may be accessed in the ICE.gov Newsroom. Additionally, congressional requirements described in the DHS Appropriations Bill of 2018 require ICE to make public all reports regarding an in-custody death within 90 days.",https://www.ice.gov/sites/default/files/images/dhsIceSocial1.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 19:57:38.800012

House Bill 282 would add the defendant’s immigration status to that list.
Instead, Williams contends treating immigrants differently isn’t an issue because immigration status is not a suspect category under the 14th Amendment.
Researchers point to an Ohio case where the appeals court upheld a lower court considering a defendant’s immigration status when imposing a felony sentence.
“I think we need to have consistency across the state of Ohio.” Follow Ohio Capital Journal Reporter Nick Evans on X or on Bluesky.","An Ohio lawmaker wants judges to consider a defendant’s immigration status when they set conditions for bail or hand down criminal sentences.

The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Township, characterized the changes as a way to give judges “a full picture” of the defendant before them.

But critics argue the proposal might violate the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause or encroach on the federal authority over immigration enforcement.

More generally, they worry the measure targets immigrants — whether here legally or not — at a moment of rising fear and distrust of justice system. People with a target on their back, they argue, aren’t likely to report crimes or testify in court.

What the bill does

When it comes to setting bail, the central question a judge must consider is whether the defendant show up for their court date.

But state law carries a laundry list of other considerations judges should weigh when determining bail, parole or sentences. Did the defendant serve in the military? Did they exhibit remorse? Do they have ties to the community? In 2022, state lawmakers even went to the ballot to explicitly direct judges to weigh whether a defendant is a threat to public safety when setting the amount of cash bail.

House Bill 282 would add the defendant’s immigration status to that list. Williams thinks judges should be considering whether a defendant is in the country illegally or subject to a federal detainer when they’re setting conditions.

“It’s always a factor, one, in bail, whether or not an individual is going to return to court,” Williams said. “I think immigration status has a direct effect on that, whether or not an individual is going to be here to answer to justice or not at the conclusion of the case.”

When it comes to criminal sentences and parole, Williams contends, a defendant’s immigration status should be given the same weight as their criminal history.

“Just like probation and parole, if you are actively on those at the time that you commit an offense, and you are an American citizen, that goes against the idea of you being able to be rehabilitated, absent incarceration,” Williams said. “I think it also should be a factor that an individual is here unlawfully, already breaking the law in the state of Ohio and they commit another criminal offense.”

Committee questions

Williams’ proposal got pushback from Democratic committee members, including state Rep. Ismail Mohamed, D-Columbus. He pressed Williams on the Supremacy Clause, which gives the federal government exclusive authority to enforce federal laws. Mohamed noted several states have passed laws wading into immigration enforcement and it hasn’t gone well.

“There’s about five to seven different bills that were passed in other states that were all struck down,” Mohamed said.

Williams insisted those other measures gave local authorities policing powers or made federal violations state crimes as well.

“There’s no federal statute, there’s no constitutional revision that prevents an individual from, especially a judge from considering immigration status as it comes to bond conditions or sentencing,” Williams said.

Mohamed asked about the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, which applies to “any person” within a state’s jurisdiction.

“It doesn’t make any distinction with U.S. citizens, green card holders, noncitizens,” he said. “So essentially, if this will directly lead to judges that are imposing harsher sentences, how do you reconcile that with the 14th Amendment.”

Williams didn’t deny the provision would subject immigrants to greater scrutiny.

“I think it’s reasonable that individuals that are here, legally or illegally, are held to a high standard, just like individuals that are facing parole, probation or bond conditions in another case,” he said.

Instead, Williams contends treating immigrants differently isn’t an issue because immigration status is not a suspect category under the 14th Amendment. He pointed to analysis by state legislative researchers which draws a distinction between immigration status and the race, ethnic background, gender or religion protections found in state law.

Researchers point to an Ohio case where the appeals court upheld a lower court considering a defendant’s immigration status when imposing a felony sentence.

“Courts have done it before. It’s been upheld before,” he said. “I think it’s reasonable to use that classification, because it’s not a suspect classification that gets protection under the equal protections clause.”

But notably — and Williams acknowledged as much — judges already have the discretion to consider a defendant’s immigration status. State law includes a catch all “any other factors that are relevant” in its instructions to the bench.

To Williams, though, that flexibility is treacherous.

“I think it can lead to sentencing disparities where in one jurisdiction, an immigrant would have been seen — viewed more harshly, (and) in another jurisdiction, they will be seen, more lenient,” he said. “I think we need to have consistency across the state of Ohio.”

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to be doing all sorts of things nobody ever thought was even possible.

MIKE JOHNSON: President Trump has brought back strength to the White House.

JD VANCE: We can't just ignore the president's desires.

TRUMP: This will be an entirely different country in a short period of time.

DETROW: Every episode of TRUMP'S TERMS, we bring you NPR's latest coverage of the 47th president, with a focus on actions and policies he is pursuing on his own terms and, in the process, taking the presidency into uncharted territory. Today's story starts right after this.

AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. President Trump has vowed to conduct a mass deportation of everyone who's in the country without legal status. But there are a few groups of people who live in a gray area, including DACA recipients. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is supposed to protect people from immigration enforcement, but several DACA recipients have been arrested and detained. NPR's immigration policy reporter Ximena Bustillo has been following this and joins us now. Hi, Ximena.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hi.

RASCOE: So the DACA program was created in 2012. Where does it stand today?

BUSTILLO: The program was created to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation. But DACA is not an immediate path to citizenship or even a green card. Participants instead have to renew their protection every two years. They can also be removed from the program and lose protections if they commit crimes. Currently, about half a million people are on DACA, and now many of them are in their 30s and 40s. It provides a work permit and can be adjusted if a person leaves the U.S. and comes back with a visa or marries a U.S. citizen, among other options to adjust status. And since it was created, there has been no successful effort to provide a pathway to legal status for those who are on the program. Plus, the president had already tried to repeal DACA in his first term, and he failed to do so.

RASCOE: Since President Trump couldn't get DACA repealed then, how is he approaching the program in his second term?

BUSTILLO: So far, no regulatory changes have been made to formally end the program, but parts of Trump's administration have made moves to strip benefits. For example, the Health and Human Services Department said in June DACA recipients would no longer be eligible to buy insurance through the federal health care marketplace. Then in July, the Education Department launched an investigation into five universities that offer financial help directly to DACA recipients. And as the Homeland Security Department has increased the rates of arrests, there have been reports of DACA recipients being caught up in worksite raids and even deportations. At one point, I asked DHS about this, and they told me that DACA did not confer legal status and that those without legal status are encouraged to self-deport. Now, that's a very strong message that deviates from the first public statement Trump made after he won the election last year.

RASCOE: So what did he say then?

BUSTILLO: At the time, Trump said on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA with Democrats. Now, both Republicans and Democrats have hung on to that statement made in December as a sign that someday Trump may say he's ready to come to that negotiating table, though there has since been nearly no discussion on the issue. And instead, the focus is still on deportations.

RASCOE: DACA could be addressed not just by the president, but particularly by Congress. What can Congress do?

BUSTILLO: Right. Ultimately, any permanent solution has to come from Congress, but the coalition that cares about this issue is a little bit fractured right now. I spoke with several GOP senators and representatives that have all previously supported finding a pathway for DACA recipients. And Senate Democrats have been increasingly vocal about the urgency to find a solution because arrests are happening. Still, Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and there was the consensus that nothing would happen this year. There are simply other concerns at the top of lawmakers' minds, like keeping the government from shutting down, for example. And they also said that they were waiting for the president himself to say that it's time to broker a deal. There are a few efforts in the House and Senate, individual bills that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients. But there isn't a sense that they will move anytime soon, even as Trump's deportation efforts only grow.

RASCOE: That's NPR's immigration policy reporter Ximena Bustillo. Thank you so much for joining us.

BUSTILLO: Thanks, Ayesha.

Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported from the United States to El Salvador before being returned to the U.S. in June to face human smuggling charges, has become a high-profile figure in the debate over President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. He was moved from a Virginia detention center to the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, the Associated Press reported Saturday.

The Shut Down Detention Campaign organized a protest on short notice scheduled for 5 p.m. Monday at the intersection of Graham Station Road and U.S. Route 322 near Philipsburg. It will be followed by a candlelight vigil.

Advocates have held several recent protests against the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, most recently in late August when hundreds filled Cold Stream Dam park to urge the Clearfield County Commissioners to end the contract between the county, ICE and the Florida-based GEO Group, which owns the facility.

“Every person that comes to these rallies, every little bit counts,” Shut Down Detention Campaign organizer Jasmine Rivera said Monday afternoon. “We’re going to continue to do the best that we can to bring attention to this facility.”

According to the Associated Press, ICE notified Abrego Garcia’s lawyers Friday that he was transferred to the Moshannon Valley Processing Center. ICE said the location would make it easier for them to access him.

The Trump administration has claimed Abrego Garcia was a MS-13 gang member, “human trafficker, serial domestic abuser and child predator.” He denies the allegations and has not been convicted of a crime.

“The ongoing mistreatment of this father and community leader is an international example of the cruelty of our broken immigration system and the terrorization this presidential administration is committing against our neighbors,” a press release for Monday’s protest reads.

“We stand in solidarity with Kilmar and his family, and we demand justice, humane treatment and accountability for him and for everyone being incarcerated at Moshannon.”

In addition to two deaths at the facility, potential abuses at the facility have concerned immigration and civil rights activists since it opened in 2021. The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and two other advocacy groups filed a complaint last year with the Department of Homeland Security after hearing from frustrated and fearful people detained there.

An average of 1,404 people were at the detention center as of Sept. 15, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data distribution organization founded at Syracuse University. It’s the largest federal immigration detention center in Pennsylvania and the rest of the Northeast.

A press release for Monday’s protest continues a call for the Clearfield County Commissioners to take action.

“We call on the Clearfield County Commissioners to stop assisting an agency that blatantly ignores and violates the Constitution,” the release reads. “We know far too well this prison has a long record of abuse and neglect since first opened in 2021, and have heard directly from those detained there that the abuse has only gotten worse in 2025.”

Clearfield County Commissioners toured the facility in August and said they found no signs of poor conditions, WJAC reported.

Safety of ICE facilities has also been in the spotlight after a deadly shooting at a Dallas ICE facility last week. During an event in Ferguson Township Thursday, U.S. Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Howard, was asked about increased security at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center.

“I would think that individual elected officials, agencies, offices and facilities like [the processing center] ... everybody’s taking a second look at security,” Thompson said.",https://www.centredaily.com/public/latest-news/ujh5iv/picture259021218/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/GEOfacility.JPG,N,,2025-09-29 17:57:12.383403

Dozens of federal law enforcement officers in tactical gear deployed non-lethal munitions while pushing back a crowd of protesters outside the facility Saturday evening. For weeks, protesters have gathered at that location, about 10 miles west of Chicago, to protest ramped-up ICE enforcement and aggressive tactics. In recent days, agents stationed at that facility on the ground and from the roof have used pepper balls, rubber bullets, and tear gas to clear out protesters.

Three people are facing charges for assaulting federal law enforcement, according to the complaints filed Sunday in the Northern District of Illinois federal court. One person is facing charges for resisting arrest.

In one case, a Homeland Security Investigations agent alleges protester Paul Ivery admitted to threatening to kill a Border Patrol Aagent, shouting words to the effect of “I’ll f*cking kill you right now” and “do something,” according to the criminal complaint.

Ivery then resisted arrest when he ran from police, then jumped on a car. The complaint also accuses Ivery of assaulting a federal agent by grabbing his helmet.

“Ivery’s actions also caused Victim 1’s helmet to move askew thereby temporarily exposing him to pepper spray in the vicinity; it caused pain on Victim 1’s chin from the helmet’s chin strap; and forcibly pulled Victim 1’s chin to his clavicle area,” the complaint said.

Another cased filed by an agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives accuses Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo, a married couple, according to the complaint, of assaulting federal agents. Robledo is accused of “causing a struggle with the agents,” when she “pushed back against agents who were attempted to extend the perimeter.”

Collins is accused of charging at the agents during the confrontation. According to the complaint, Collins caused a “physical injury to the thumb of an ATF special agent.”

According to the complaint, both Collins and Robledo carried 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols to the protests and have lawful permits for the weapons. They are not facing firearms related charges.

The FBI has charged a fourth person, Hubert Mazur, with resisting arrest after failing to move back after agents ordered him to move.

According to the Bureau of Prisons inmate database, Ivery and Mazur are in federal custody. Robledo and Collins do not appear to be in custody.

It is not clear if any of the accused protestors have attorneys.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2237819687.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-29 17:57:16.071337

The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners said in a letter to Des Moines public schools Superintendent Ian Roberts that he was ineligible to hold a license because “you no longer possess legal presence in the United States.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Roberts on Friday, saying that he was subject to a final removal order that a judge issued in May 2024. Roberts is a native of Guyana who entered the United States on a student visa in 1999, according to ICE. He’s being held at an Iowa jail.

ICE said that Roberts fled after a traffic stop in Des Moines, and that he was apprehended with the assistance of the Iowa State Patrol. The agency said that Roberts, 54, had possessed a loaded handgun in his district-issued vehicle, a hunting knife and $3,000 cash when arrested.

Des Moines school officials said they had known nothing about Roberts being in the country illegally, and that he had signed a form verifying his eligibility to work when he was hired in 2023.

The district said Roberts had been identified as a candidate for the job by a search firm and that a “comprehensive background check” was completed as part of the process. The state board that granted Roberts a license to serve as superintendent said that process included background checks by the state police and FBI.

His arrest shocked a district where he was known as a frequent presence at community events and a champion of students during his two-year tenure. Roberts had been in education for the last two decades, and had served as a superintendent in Pennsylvania before his hiring in Iowa.

The Des Moines school board put Roberts on paid administrative leave during a brief special meeting Saturday. The board said it would hold another meeting Monday afternoon to consider changing Roberts’ leave status to unpaid, citing the revocation of his license.

“New information and confirmed facts will continue to inform our decisions as we develop a path forward,” said Jackie Norris, chair of the Des Moines Public Schools Board. “Two things can be true at the same time — Dr. Roberts was an effective and well-respected leader and there are serious questions related to his citizenship and ability to legally perform his duties as superintendent.”

ICE said that it had asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to investigate how Roberts obtained a handgun. People in the country illegally are ineligible to possess firearms. Roberts had a history of gun ownership, however, and had been cited in 2021 in Pennsylvania and fined $100 for storing a loaded hunting rifle in his vehicle.

ICE has said that Roberts also had a separate, pending weapons charge dating to February 2020, but has not provided further details about the incident.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/07804bc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1620x911+0+84/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F48%2Fe4%2Fe324392be4c2387e2bb47d697249%2F62531b9a2b234cbd9e4c6aca99f020b1,N,,2025-09-29 18:57:09.470382

The Justice Department is asking the Supreme Court to settle the constitutionality of President Trump’s executive order restricting birthright citizenship.

It brings the battle back to the court just months after its 6-3 conservative majority sided with the administration by ruling that judges could not issue universal injunctions blocking the birthright citizenship order nationwide.

That decision did not address the constitutionality of Trump’s directive. Friday’s petitions tee up the question, urging the justices to bless the president’s upending of the conventional interpretation of the 14th Amendment.

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the President and his Administration in a manner that undermines our border security. Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote.

The petitions have not yet been docketed, but The Hill reviewed copies provided by the Justice Department.

Signed on Trump’s first day in office, his executive order curbs birthright citizenship for children born on U.S. soil if they don’t have at least one parent with permanent legal status.

Every court that has directly confronted its constitutionality has found it violates the 14th Amendment’s guarantee of birthright citizenship, which has long been held to include only narrow exceptions, like for the children of diplomats and enemy invaders.

Friday’s filing marks the second time the administration has brought the legal battle to the Supreme Court.

In late June, the court agreed to wipe several universal injunctions that judges had issued blocking Trump’s executive order nationwide, saying those orders swept too far.

But the high court still left the door open for nationwide orders in some cases, including via class action lawsuits. Plaintiffs have since convinced several judges to do so, keeping Trump’s order from going into effect anywhere.

The administration is appealing two such cases to the Supreme Court.

The Justice Department seeks review of a Seattle-based appeals panel’s ruling in July that sided with a group of Democratic-led states and blocked Trump’s order nationwide. The administration is also appealing a similar order from a judge in New Hampshire issued in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.

The Justice Department wants the justices to take the case up for their upcoming term, so a decision can land by next summer.

The Supreme Court has regularly sided with the Trump administration in emergency appeals, but it has yet to fully resolve a challenge to a major administration policy on its normal, merits docket.

Taking up the birthright citizenship order would add to arguments already scheduled this fall on the legality of Trump’s tariffs and his ability to fire independent agency leaders without cause.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/birthright_citizenship_supreme_court_06272025_GettyImages-2221594152-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-29 18:57:25.835510

Advocates say that many have chosen that path out of fear and that immigration has shifted dramatically under the Trump administration.

In body camera footage from the Cato raid, a federal agent discussed the lack of access to the outside world for people in detention centers.","In the first months of the Trump administration, the country has witnessed a tightened grip on immigration. There has been a greater presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), large-scale deportation goals and policies to revoke status from individuals who have long maintained it.

Immigrants are living in fear, local advocates said, seen as tally marks on the administration’s checklist, not individuals with human rights.

“What we are talking about here is not numbers, not statistics, but people, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, coworkers and friends,” said Ana Menez-Vasquez, Western New York regional coordinator for Rural and Migrant Ministry.

According to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, during Donald Trump’s first presidential term, around 1.5 million immigrant repatriations were carried out. Under the Biden administration, from 2021 to 2025, there were 4.4 million repatriations. A large percentage of this number can be credited to 3 million expulsions under the pandemic-era Title 42 order. President Obama's eight years in office saw a total of 2.7 million deportations — more than any other president in U.S. history. Yet, President Trump is now challenging this high.

In the first eight months of Trump’s current presidency, the administration has recorded 2 million deportations — around 5% more people than his first term. Such rapid removals align with a central promise made during Trump’s 2024 campaign to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. The majority of repatriations include immigrants who have chosen to self deport. Advocates say that many have chosen that path out of fear and that immigration has shifted dramatically under the Trump administration.

“We used to have our rights and the rights of our clients, being able to enforce them with ICE or with any agency. Now they are violating all our clients' rights, not only under the Immigration and Nationality Act but under the Constitution,” said Syracuse-based immigration lawyer Jose Perez.

Perez, who continues to represent several local people in immigration cases, said even though it is illegal for law enforcement to racially profile, federal agents still are.

“The most important thing right now is to understand that we're in a climate where the rights of individuals that are not from the United States and that look different are being questioned,” said Perez. “We need immigration reform. We don't need [to be] rounding up people by the look of them, or by nationality, accent, or different cultural backgrounds.”

The Supreme Court, however, recently paused a ruling after the Trump administration’s request, allowing agents at immigration raids across Los Angeles to racially profile who they decide to stop.

Federal initiatives feel extremely targeted, Perez said. The halt on issuance of worker visas and the tightened requirements regarding the English Language Proficiency (ELP) for commercial truck drivers, are two of many.

While a raid earlier this month at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners factory has grabbed headlines, Marc Alessi, an organizer for the Syracuse Immigrant and Refugee Defense Network, said ICE is active all over – including Syracuse.

“I mean, it's kind of happening all over the place. And that's of course, because ICE's budget was just tripled in the latest, by Congress, so they now have all the resources and manpower to do things like this all the time,” Alessi said at a recent immigration rally in Fulton.

Federal officials have said that anyone in the U.S. without proper documentation are breaking the law and are therefore criminals. A spokesperson for the agency said the enforcement of policies is an effort to protect public safety and combat the “undermining of the American labor market.""

“The employment of illegal aliens also incentivizes dangerous and illegal practices, including Social Security fraud. As we saw during a recent worksite operation in Nebraska, many illegal aliens use stolen Social Security numbers and identities to unlawfully obtain wages, health benefits and employment authorization. Behind every stolen Social Security number uncovered these operations is a real American — mothers, fathers, students, and disabled workers — now facing devastating financial, emotional, and legal fallout,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

None of the 57 workers detained in the Cato raid are accused of using stolen Social Security numbers.

Yet, Perez echoed sentiments from Alessi and other advocates, saying that despite the actions a person takes, ICE agents may still detain them.

Melina Ivanchikova stood in Voorhees Park in Fulton during the Cato raid rally. Ivanchikova, an organizer with Finger Lakes Rapid Response, translated a statement on behalf of a mother whose son was recently taken by ICE.

“My son had his papers and his work permit in order, but they aren't allowing that anymore,” said the mother’s statement. “We feel fear every day. We are asking what is going to happen tomorrow, and we feel even more sad. Nobody was even doing anything wrong.”

With grit in her voice, Jessica Maxwell, director of the Workers Center of Central New York, clutched the microphone that she held stiff to her chest.

“We are seeing workers living in fear and this includes not just undocumented workers, [but also] workers with valid working papers,” said Maxwell. “This is really sending shock waves, so that now we are having people call saying, ‘I thought I would stay, but now I don't know. I have my working papers, but now I'm not sure that's enough. I don't know what to do.’ This is the kind of chaos that the community is dealing with.”

Even weeks after the Cato raid, immigrants in the area are traumatized, these local advocates said. They are now less likely to seek medical care, go to work and connect with their neighbors, regardless of their status.

“The raid at Cato Nutri-Bar did not just remove workers from a factory floor, it ripped open the fabric of our community,” said Menez-Vasquez.

As an immigration attorney, Perez emphasized the importance of knowing your rights regardless of your status as an immigrant in America. Under the Constitution, even noncitizens have the right to remain silent and refuse search, unless authorities have reasonable suspicion.

“Personal rights, human rights, immigration rights. Anything that you can think of ICE is violating right now,” said Perez. “Every single law that is in the books protecting someone not to be harassed, stereotyped, detained for reasons that are unlawful. We have situations in which U.S. citizens that speak with an accent, just like myself, have to tell ICE ‘I am citizen, and I know my rights.’”

While Perez has taken on many immigration cases in Central New York, overall, there aren’t enough resources.

“There is a lack of attorneys, not only in the area, but I would say, of the whole [state] of New York,” he said. “We have very limited attorneys that do immigration, and only a handful that speak Spanish. I'm the only one in the Syracuse area that speaks Spanish and does immigration.” Immigrants typically have an incredibly hard time finding legal representation. Not only is there a shortage of immigration attorneys, but financial barriers and restricted communications at ICE facilities for detainees, including minimal to no phone, mail and email access.

In body camera footage from the Cato raid, a federal agent discussed the lack of access to the outside world for people in detention centers.

“I would not let anybody out of their cells, so we did it in an orderly fashion, had them all lined up. It’s bathroom time, or it’s f— brush your teeth time, or it’s food time. Other than that, nope, your a— is staying in there. ‘But you can’t do that.’ I absolutely can. ‘I need a phone call.’ No, you don’t. ‘I need to go to medical.’ Nope, you look good to me,” the agent in the video said, mimicking a conversation with a person detained.

Maxwell, her boots dug into the park grass, continued to speak with frustration.

“We need justice from the immigration courts. We are tired of this kangaroo court where you don't even have access to lawyers,” Maxwell added.

The immigrant communities that make up America no longer feel as safe as they once did, advocates said.

“We have witnessed the deep fear and humiliation caused when people are treated as disposable rather than as human beings. This is not about politics. This is about humanity,” said Menez-Vasquez. “Every single person deserves dignity, respect and safety. No family should have to live with the trauma of separation. No child should have to wonder if their parent will disappear overnight. We will not stand by while our neighbors are targeted or racially profiled and fear is weaponized while families are torn apart. We are here to say it's we, not they. We demand accountability. We demand compassion and we demand justice.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/spec-ice-raid,N,,2025-09-29 16:57:00.358663

WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Dan Goldman (NY-10) joined all of his Homeland Security Committee Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to Chairman Andrew Garbarino (NY-02) demanding that Trump “Border Czar” Tom Homan testify before the Committee following reports he accepted a $50,000 cash bribe while promising access to lucrative government contracts.

“The American people deserve to know why President Trump’s so-called Border Czar allegedly used his position and influence to take bribes in his own self-interest. Congress must investigate Tom Homan’s actions and his influence on government spending,” the Members wrote.

According to reporting, the FBI recorded Homan in September 2024 accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as contractors after indicating he could help them win border enforcement deals. Federal prosecutors reportedly considered charges of conspiracy, bribery, and fraud, but the investigation stalled once Trump took office. Trump’s political appointees officially closed the case earlier this month.

Homan’s consulting firm previously advertised its ability to “open doors” to DHS contracts, boasting of tens of millions of dollars in government deals for private clients. While portions of his client list remain hidden, reporting shows that some of Homan's business partners have already profited under Trump’s $170 billion border and immigration enforcement spending spree funded by the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Goldman and his colleagues say Homan’s testimony is urgently needed to ensure DHS contracting is not being corrupted by political insiders cashing in on Trump’s extreme immigration agenda.

Read the letter here(link is external) or below.

Dear Chairman Garbarino:

We call on you to require Trump administration “Border Czar” Tom Homan to appear before the Committee to answer allegations that he accepted cash bribes in exchange for promises to deliver government contracts.

According to media reports, on September 20, 2024, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recorded Tom Homan, now President Donald Trump’s so-called “Border Czar,” accepting $50,000 in cash after indicating he could help undercover agents posing as business executives win government contracts related to border enforcement. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and FBI initially planned to wait to see whether Homan would deliver on his alleged promise once he became Border Czar, and were considering potential charges of conspiracy, bribery, and two kinds of fraud against Homan. However, the investigation reportedly stalled soon after Donald Trump became President in January 2025, and Trump political appointees officially closed the case in recent weeks.

Homan has been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s extreme immigration enforcement tactics, positioning him to help former business partners and clients capitalize on the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) border security and immigration enforcement spending. In fact, Homan’s consulting firm, Homeland Strategic Consulting LLC, previously advertised its ability to help businesses cash in on government contracts, stating, “We have a proven track record of opening doors and bringing successful relationships to our clients, resulting in tens of millions of dollars of federal contracts to private companies.”

Portions of Homan’s client list remain shielded from scrutiny by Congress and the public. Nevertheless, it is well known that some of Homan’s former business partners have been turning enormous profits under the Trump administration. Scrutinizing Homan’s role in DHS contracting is critical as the administration rushes to obligate $170 billion in border security and immigration enforcement funding provided under the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” As the Committee responsible for ensuring that DHS’s mission is faithfully executed, we have an obligation to take testimony, on the record, regarding the role that Homan has played in the Department’s contracting decisions since entering government in January 2025.

No one is above the law. The American people deserve to know why President Trump’s so-called Border Czar allegedly used his position and influence to take bribes in his own self-interest. Congress must investigate Tom Homan’s actions and his influence on government spending. We urgently request that you call him to testify before the Committee on this matter without delay.

The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) ruled on August 12, 2025 to reject a Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) application to deport Afshin Pirnoon.

Documents related to his case were obtained by Iran International and indicate Ottawa's push to deport former Iranian officials faces a high evidentiary bar.

Canada's government barred entry and residency for “senior officials” of the Islamic Republic in 2022 citing accusations Tehran is a state-sponsored terrorism and systematic human rights abuser.

The policy aims also to prevent the risk of so-called transnational repression by Iran or its agents among Canada's sizable Iranian diaspora community. It tasks CBSA with cases of people it deems inadmissible to Canada to the IRB for review.

Pirnoon, worked as a civil engineer and Director-General of the Road Maintenance Office at Iran’s Road Maintenance and Transportation Organization for 22 years.

The IRB found he did not to meet the statutory definition of an Iranian “senior official” or to have “significant influence over the exercise of government power,"" therefore the legal requirement for his being deemed inadmissible was not met.

Pirnoon came to Canada on a tourist visa in 2022 and was working as an Uber driver when the Canada Border Services Agency launched deportation proceedings.

Three-year track record

Official data indicates that 23 individuals have been identified as suspected senior Iranian officials and 21 cases have been referred to the IRB.

But only three removal orders have been issued, with just one removal carried out to date, though some have departed voluntarily.

Canada has previously referred identified Iranian officials in the country to the IRB to assess their status and determine whether they qualify as “senior officials.”

These include Majid Iranmanesh, a former director-general in the Vice-Presidency for Science and Technology, whom the IRB found to be a senior official and ordered removed on February 2, 2024.

Another was Seyed Salman Samani, former deputy minister and spokesperson of Iran’s Interior Ministry, who received a removal order on March 20, 2024.

By contrast, in several other cases—including Pirnoon’s—the IRB has found that an official position alone, attendance of official ceremonies or routine administrative duties do not prove actual influence over policymaking or the exercise of power.","https://i.iranintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/6335fb00f02133d7cea3a1aad2dd23dc408fce24-960x540.jpg?rect=73,67,773,406&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-09-29 15:57:55.000995

Investigators said the women followed the agent home, livestreamed their pursuit and then posted the agent’s address online, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Once they arrived at the agent’s home, prosecutors allege the women shouted “ICE lives on your street and you should know,” according to the indictment.

The defendants are each charged with one count of conspiracy and one count of publicly disclosing the personal information of a federal agent, the statement said.

Prosecutors said a 25-year-old woman from Panorama City, California, is free on $5,000 bond. A 38-year-old resident of Aurora, Colorado, who is also charged in a separate case with assault on a federal officer, is in custody without bond.

And authorities are searching for the third defendant, a 37-year-old woman from Riverside, California.

“Our brave federal agents put their lives on the line every day to keep our nation safe,” Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement. “The conduct of these defendants are deeply offensive to law enforcement officers and their families. If you threaten, dox, or harm in any manner one of our agents or employees, you will face prosecution and prison time.”

Doxing is a typically malicious practice that involves gathering private or identifying information and releasing it online without the person’s permission, usually in an attempt to harass, threaten, shame or exact revenge.

Attorneys for the women could not immediately be reached on Monday. An email was sent to the Federal Public Defender’s Office asking if its attorneys are representing the defendants.

According to the indictment, the three women last month followed an ICE agent from the federal building in downtown Los Angeles to the agent’s residence in Baldwin Park east of LA. They livestreamed the entire event, court documents say.

In July, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threatened to prosecute people for publishing federal agents’ personal information in response to fliers in Portland, Oregon, that called for people to collect intel on ICE.

You’ll find stories, reflections and accomplishments—told in their own words—by grassroots leaders, women of color, Indigenous women, and trans and gender-expansive people supported by Groundswell. By amplifying these voices—their solutions, communities, challenges and victories—our shared goal is to show how intersectional organizing strengthens democracy.

My family immigrated from Mexico to California when I was 3 years old. My brother wasn’t walking and was showing signs of physical delays. Unable to find answers back home, my parents sacrificed everything—our home, their small business, a familiar life—in search of a diagnosis, treatment and hope.

This Latine Heritage Month, I’m reminded of the strength of the women in my family in the face of migration and uncertainty, and the extraordinary community in the U.S. that welcomed us.

My brother was eventually diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, a disease that worsens over time and has no cure. By age 6, I was translating at his appointments, reading letters from doctors and helping my parents complete Medicaid forms—while balancing a childhood and a new home. It was only through constant advocacy that we managed to get him the care he needed.

Decades later, too many immigrant communities, including Latines across the country, still struggle to access basic healthcare. Many are excluded from insurance programs, forced to wait years to qualify, or unable to find providers who understand their language or culture.

By age 6, I was translating at his appointments, reading letters from doctors and helping my parents complete Medicaid forms—while balancing a childhood and a new home.

As government attacks on immigrant communities increase, the threat of deportation, family separation and criminalization keeps many from seeking the critical healthcare they need to survive. This fear is paralyzing, too many times leading to avoidable illnesses and worse health outcomes. Healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet many of our policies deny this right to immigrants.

To make matters worse, the Republican tax and spending plan signed into law earlier this year made the largest cuts in history to Medicaid and the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program. These programs are lifelines for millions of individuals across the nation. The aftermath means the closure of hundreds of Planned Parenthood health centers, which provide essential health services ranging from cancer treatment to contraceptive care. The law also makes it harder for immigrant communities to access affordable insurance, as the government instead pours billions into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and immigrant detention centers.

As for reproductive care, immigrants have long been unable to access abortion care because of coverage gaps or restrictions. I saw this firsthand in college while working at a family help desk at the public hospital in Boston and in a women’s health clinic—where, beyond my own life experience, I learned about the depth of health inequities and injustices that people face in this country and how they lead to adverse health outcomes.

Once, as I was helping an immigrant woman from Haiti sign up for Medicaid and food support, she confessed she had not come to the hospital or clinic even once, until she needed to give birth to her son one month pre-term. The reason? She didn’t have insurance.

As she prepared to be discharged while her son remained in the NICU, she struggled to determine how she would feed herself or her other two children without being able to work due to the early birth.

Her story, along with countless others, remains seared in my mind as living, breathing examples of the toll of inequities.

I have spent my life advocating for healthcare, starting with my own family. I often reflect on conversations with my grandmother, who had 11 children—who told me that if she had access to birth control, she would have chosen for herself how many children to have. She wanted that freedom for me and for all her children and grandchildren.

Ever since, my career has enabled me to analyze the cause of maternal death in Mexico, especially from unsafe abortions; support people seeking abortion care in California through an abortion fund; and advocate to expand health clinics through Planned Parenthood. I’ve seen how transformative it is when people have the information and care they need to shape their futures.

When people have the power to make decisions about their bodies and lives, families thrive. Our research shows that undocumented and mixed-status families are especially harmed by abortion bans and at risk of criminalization because of their status. With the possibility of Planned Parenthood being forced to close many more health centers, it will be harder to get abortion care, even in states with the right to abortion. It’s the national ban extremists have long wanted.

Misinformation also runs rampant, leaving people unsure if abortion is legal where they live. Traveling to another state can mean risking detention and family separation. Abortion bans only deepen barriers for immigrant communities.

Healthcare access, including the full spectrum of reproductive care, can make or break lives. Nobody should be denied healthcare, no one should have to choose between paying for healthcare and rent, and no one should fear deportation for going to the doctor. All of us should have access to care. Period.

Healthcare couldn’t wait for my family. It can’t wait for millions more in our communities who are denied care or too afraid to seek the care they need.

We must work together to ensure all of us can raise our families with health, safety and dignity. Latine communities across the country are vibrant and resilient.

The law enforcement officials’ testimony were filed as part of Oregon and Portland’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s deployment.

In a declaration Monday, Craig Dobson, a Portland police official, testified that the president’s characterization of Portland and protests outside of an ICE facility in southwest Portland did not match reality.

While there have been protests outside the facility, Dobson said demonstrations have been largely peaceful and have only amounted to a few people gathering outside of the ICE facility on a nightly basis.

The protests began in June after federal officials arrested asylum seekers in Portland’s immigration court, Dobson noted.

“For the most part, nightly ICE-Facility protests since July 18, 2025, have been limited to fewer than thirty participants. The protests have been largely sedate during this time,” Dobson said. “Certainly, these protests bear no resemblance to the sustained, large protests of 2020.”

Dobson added that since the demonstrations started, the PPB has intervened to protect public safety only a few times. The bureau made 25 arrests at protests outside the facility in mid June but hasn’t made any arrests since then, despite nightly monitoring.

“The notion that the ICE-Facility protests cannot be adequately managed by those local and federal resources already present before September 27, 2025, when the federal government ordered the deployment of federal troops into the area, cannot be squared with the facts on the ground,” Dobson testified.

The assistant chief also warned that the Trump administration’s deployment could undermine public order by inciting larger demonstrations.

“The contemplated federal troop deployment is unnecessary and counterproductive. Rather than improve public safety at the ICE-Facility protests, or in Portland more generally, the deployment is likely to provoke a larger protest.”

In a separate declaration, Cameron Bailey, a captain with the Oregon State Police, said the PPB in recent months made no request for additional law enforcement assistance, indicating that the bureau believed it had sufficient resources to maintain order.

Thousands of people peacefully marched through downtown Portland Sunday to protest Trump’s deployment and ICE activity in the city. The PPB said that no reports of injuries and no arrests were made in relation to the march.

In an interview with NBC News Sunday, Trump appeared to question his own perception of Portland after speaking with Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek (D).

“I spoke to the governor, she was very nice,” Trump said. “But I said, ‘Well wait a minute, am I watching things on television that are different from what’s happening? My people tell me different.’ They are literally attacking and there are fires all over the place … it looks like terrible.”

Hours after Trump gave the interview, however, Hegseth issued the memo claiming to federalize the Oregon National Guard troops.

The memo cited 10 U.S.C. 12406, an archaic statute that allows the president to mobilize the Guard when the country faces foreign invasion or rebellion, or when the president is unable to execute laws with regular resources.

Trump used the same statute over the objections of California leaders earlier this year to federalize thousands of National Guard troops in response to unrest in Los Angeles, which the president claimed was a “rebellion” against the federal government.

After California challenged the deployment, a three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined Trump was within his authority to federalize Guard troops because conditions in LA were sufficient for use of the statute.

However, the panel rejected the Trump administration’s argument that judges could not review a president’s decision to federalize the National Guard, ruling that a president could not federalize Guard troops “based on no evidence whatsoever.”

Trump’s deployment to LA eventually swelled to around 4,000 California National Guard members and 700 active-duty Marines.

Oregon and Portland’s lawsuit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Michael Simon, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.

The Ninth Circuit could soon again confront whether Trump’s use of 10 U.S.C. 12406 was legal, as appeals from the District of Oregon are heard by the Ninth Circuit.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2237687579-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 14:56:49.040040

Customs and Border Protection has 67,792 workers and would retain 63,243 during a shutdown, according to the plan.

Like the Pentagon, much of the Department of Homeland Security is considered ""essential"" to government operations and remains on duty during a temporary funding shutdown.

In stark contrast, the White House Office of Management and Budget asked agencies for plans to lay off non-essential workers rather than simply furlough them, as in past shutdowns.

Congress nearly tripled ICE’s funding this year − from $10 billion to $28.7 billion − as part of President Donald Trump’s top priority of increasing deportations. The extra funding included $50,000 bonuses to spur hiring 14,000 more agents.

But immigration agents have also come under fire for stricter enforcement.

The Des Moines School Board is meeting Monday night to place embattled Superintendent Ian Roberts on unpaid leave after state officials revoked his administrator license.

Roberts is being held on a deportation order following his Sept. 26 arrest by U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement agents for allegedly being in the United States illegally.

The Des Moines School Board placed Roberts on paid administrative leave on Sept. 27, and the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners revoked his license on Sept. 28.

After receiving word of the revocation, the School Board added Roberts to the special board meeting agenda.

""This morning the school district learned that the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners has officially revoked Dr. Roberts’ education license to practice in the state of Iowa,"" according to an Sept. 29 district news release. ""The School Board is scheduled to take action to place Dr. Roberts on unpaid administrative leave retroactive to the BOEE’s decision. This action is required by law.""

Following Roberts arrest, federal officials have said he received a court-issued ""final order of removal"" in May 2024 in relation to an earlier court case. DMPS officials have stated they were unaware of the removal order or that Roberts may have misrepresented himself as an American citizen.

“New information and confirmed facts will continue to inform our decisions as we develop a path forward,” said Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris, in the release. “Two things can be true at the same time — Dr. Roberts was an effective and well-respected leader, and there are serious questions related to his citizenship and ability to legally perform his duties as superintendent.”

The board has reached out to Roberts' legal counsel as well.

“We hope to hear from Dr. Roberts, but in the interim, we must make decisions that are fact-based, legally sound and in the best interest of our students, staff and families,"" Norris said.

The board is schedule to meet at 4:45 p.m., Central Campus, 1800 Grand Ave., Des Moines.

State revokes Ian Roberts' administrative license

The announcement of school board's intention to place Roberts on unpaid leave comes hours after the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners announced that it had revoked his administrator license.

""Our office has received information that you no longer possess legal presence in the United States, therefore you (are) not able to hold a license issued by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners,"" a letter from BOEE Executive Director Micheal Cavin to Roberts dated Sept. 28 states. ""… The license issued by the Board of Educational Examiners is no longer valid and your authority to serve as superintendent is revoked.""

The Iowa Department of Education sent out a one sentence news release about the change the morning of Sept. 29.

Before joining DMPS, Roberts underwent several background checks, including one by the state's board of education examiners.

Roberts was licensed by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners in July 2023. Before Sunday's revocation, Roberts' professional administrator license was set to expire Dec. 31, 2028.

Roberts has until Oct. 28 to appeal the decision, according to Cavin's letter.

The federal fiscal year (FY) for 2026 begins on Oct. 1, 2025, and, if appropriations bills have not been enacted into law before that date or a temporary funding measure – known as a continuing resolution (CR) – has not been enacted, a gap (or lapse) in appropriations will occur.

Timeline

On Sept. 19, 2025, by a vote of 217-212, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Republican-sponsored CR (H.R.5371) to keep the government open through Nov. 21, 2025, generally extending funding at current levels with enhanced security funding for government officials and extension of some expiring authorizations related to veterans' benefits and healthcare. They included the Medicare-dependent hospital and low-volume adjustment programs, telehealth and hospital-at-home flexibilities, as well as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. The bill also would have delayed Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital cuts that are set to become effective Oct. 1, 2025. Later the same day, however, the U.S. Senate rejected H.R.5371 by a 44-48 cloture vote.

The Senate also rejected a Democrat-sponsored CR (S.2882) on Sept. 19, 2025, to fund the government at current levels through Oct 31, 2025, by a 47-45 cloture vote. Though the Democratic version included an extension of the same public health provisions as the CR (H.R5371), it also included a permanent extension of the enhanced premium tax credits (EPTCs) that are set to expire on Dec. 31, 2025. The bill would also repeal the healthcare provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), Pub. L. 119-21. On Sept. 18, 2025, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an analysis1 estimating that a permanent extension of the EPTCs would cost roughly $350 billion between 2026 and 2035 and expand health insurance coverage to an additional 3.8 million people by 2035. In addition, repealing provisions of the OBBB that restrict marketplace eligibility and enrollment – such as those targeting certain immigrants and low-income individuals – would add about $272 billion in costs and increase coverage by 2.9 million people in 2035.

Next steps are unclear as lawmakers departed for the Rosh Hashanah recess, and the House is not scheduled to return until after FY 2026 begins. President Donald Trump is now scheduled to meet with House and Senate Republican and Democratic leadership on Monday, September 29, after previously cancelling a proposed meeting with the Democratic leaders last week.

On Sept. 24, 2025, it was reported that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed agencies to consider extensive employee layoffs in unfunded programs that are not administration priorities if the government shuts down on Oct. 1, 2025. An OMB memo directs agencies ""to use this opportunity to consider Reduction in Force (RIF) notices for all employees in programs, projects, or activities (PPAs) that satisfy all three of the following conditions: (1) discretionary funding lapses on October 1, 2025; (2) another source of funding, such as OBBB, is not currently available; and (3) the PPA is not consistent with the President's priorities."" The memo asserts ""Federal programs whose funding would lapse and which are otherwise unfunded … are no longer statutorily required to be carried out.""

The memo was first reported by Politico, citing an OMB source as saying the following programs ""will continue regardless of a shutdown"": Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, military operations, law enforcement, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and air traffic control. Notably, each of these programs has funding from the OBBB or other mandatory or advanced appropriations that may be spent during a shutdown or involves activities easily deemed by OMB to be necessary for the safety of human life or the protection of property under the Antideficiency Act.2

History of Government Shutdown and Potential Impacts

The relevant laws that govern shutdowns have remained relatively constant in recent decades. However, OMB exercises great discretion in how it defines and interprets exceptions to the law, and OMB's actions under the Trump Administration have led to great friction with Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.

The Antideficiency Act generally bars the government from incurring obligations3 or making expenditures in the absence of appropriations.4 It also bars the government from receiving voluntary services from federal personnel in the absence of appropriations that pay their salaries, except for ""emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.""5 Accordingly, federal agencies are required to curtail many activities in the absence of an appropriation, commonly referred to as a ""government shutdown."" Every agency is required to develop and update shutdown contingency plans, which will be posted to agency websites once approved by OMB.

OMB's Circular No. A-11 (August 2025) provides that activities financed with appropriations that have not lapsed can continue to operate in a shutdown, which could include mandatory funding (i.e., reconciliation bills or entitlement program funds) or unexpired prior-year funding with valid apportionments.6 However, the salaries of agency personnel executing or supporting these legally exempted activities may be funded by lapsed appropriations, so whether a particular program will continue to operate in practice can best be determined by reviewing the agency's contingency plan. OMB states these plans will be posted to agency websites once approved by OMB.7

In the past, there have been funding gaps that led to occasional government shutdowns. In many cases, these were ""partial"" government shutdowns, as some of the 12 regular appropriations bills had already been enacted. The government was shut down previously for:

21 days, beginning Dec. 16, 1995

16 days, starting Oct. 1, 2013

35 days, beginning Dec. 21, 2018 (five of the 12 regular appropriations bills had been enacted in advance of this shutdown; agencies and activities funded by those measures were unaffected)

two brief shutdowns in January 2019 and February 2019

In prior instances, not everything that the federal government does was discontinued during a gap in discretionary appropriations. Some activities – such as those funded by permanent, mandatory or advanced appropriations – are not dependent on a current-year appropriation, so their funding continued in an appropriations lapse. Common examples include Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and veterans' healthcare benefits.

In addition, activities funded by user fees or trust funds that are independently available outside of the appropriations process (for example, student loan processing, reimbursements from the Highway Trust Fund or Medicare provider claims payments) have historically continued as long as staff responsible for processing those payments are also called into work.

Activities funded through bills outside of the annual appropriations process typically continue during shutdowns, including, for example, the advance appropriations in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Pub. L. 117-58, and mandatory appropriations in budget reconciliation acts such as the OBBB and American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act, Pub. L. 117-2. Of note, the Trump Administration received unprecedented levels of new funding for enhanced ICE and CBP operations in the OBBB.

Even for activities funded with lapsed appropriations, the Antideficiency Act allows several excepted activities to continue, including, for example:8

activities necessary to protect human life or safety or property

activities necessarily implied by law to perform statutorily required activities

activities necessary to discharge of the president's constitutional duties or power

Unsurprisingly, U.S. military operations typically continue during a shutdown due to the vital national security interest. In addition, recent reporting indicates other safety-critical activities will remain operational, including federal law enforcement and air traffic control.

Federal government shutdowns have a wide range of impacts, the severity of which can depend on the shutdown's length. In addition to the disruption of internal government functions, the unavailability to the public of many government services and lack of access to public facilities, shutdowns can profoundly impact government contractors, public and private recipients of federal grants, and the general public.

For instance, those traveling could experience delays due to air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers having to work without immediate pay. And though social safety net programs such as SNAP will continue to function, a lengthy shutdown period could squeeze remaining funding. On the other hand, less-essential activities utilized by the general public – such as national parks – could be suspended until government funding resumes.

Some federal contracts funded with unexpired prior-year funding may be eligible to continue. It is a best practice for federal contractors and grant recipients to contact their program officer to discuss these issues in advance of a potential shutdown, as these individuals may be unavailable once the shutdown is triggered. Historically, contract activity during a CR relies on obligation authority, and agencies could place orders on existing contracts where the prior-year funding is already obligated, such as government-wide and large task-order-type contracts. For example, during prior shutdowns, contractors working on some Pentagon acquisition programs had less exposure because they had access to unused funding from multiyear appropriations. 9 The Pentagon's updated shutdown guidance released on Sept. 27, 2025, generally permits activities that are funded with unexpired appropriations, including funding provided in the OBBB, to continue during a shutdown.

The Congressional Research Service also has online resources to assist interested parties in understanding the implications and history of government shutdowns:

Contingency Plans by Agency

Historically, a week prior to a shutdown, federal agencies publish contingency plans for how they will operate in the event of a lapse of appropriations. These plans traditionally were posted together on the OMB website, but the current OMB site states each agency's website will exclusively host the contingency plan for the agency. Contingency plans lay out what functions will continue to be provided and which federal workers must report to work because they are deemed ""essential."" OMB directed agencies to update their contingency plans in August 2025, noting that plans would be published once approved by OMB.

As of today's date, a few updated agency contingency plans have been published, although more are expected in the coming days:

U.S. Department of the Army

U.S. Department of Defense (also referred to as the U.S. Department of War)

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

U.S. Department of Homeland Security

U.S. Department of Labor

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

These frameworks provide critical lenses to understand the systemic barriers that migrants face in accessing healthcare services.
How do healthcare workers and cross-border migrants perceive the impact of limited access to antiretroviral therapy for migrants?
The guide was designed to capture the demographic characteristics of healthcare providers, information about healthcare entitlement for migrants, experiences of healthcare providers in dealing with migrants seeking healthcare services, access to healthcare for migrants in Botswana and use of health policies when providing healthcare services.
This study explored the experiences of both healthcare providers and migrants on the impact of inadequate antiretroviral therapy provision in Botswana.","Globally, an estimated 39.9 million people will be living with HIV in 2023 [1]. By the end of the same year, 77% (30.7 million) of these individuals were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), reflecting significant progress in HIV treatment access [1]. However, migrants remain disproportionately disadvantaged in accessing ART, experiencing delays in HIV diagnosis, interruptions in care, and poorer health outcomes [2]. Barriers to healthcare access for migrants include stigma, discrimination, social isolation, and disruptions in the continuity of care [2,3,4]. Additionally, some migrants report fears of ART side effects, further hindering treatment uptake and adherence [5,6,7]. Studies [3, 8] have reported that migrants often encounter legal obstacles such as lack of insurance and irregular immigration status, which restrict their access to healthcare services, including ART. A study by Ndumbi et al. (2018) [8] reported that in Spain, irregular immigration status was a significant risk factor for experiencing barriers to healthcare access, disproportionately affecting both men and women, disproportionately. Other studies [8, 9] have shown that financial constraints, such as the cost of medication and lack of employment, are prevalent among migrants, affecting their ability to initiate and adhere to ART. These challenges not only worsen health outcomes for migrants but also contribute to ongoing HIV transmission and increased public health risks in host communities.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) remains the epicentre of HIV epidemic, accounting to over two thirds of global HIV cases and 66% of all AIDS-related deaths [10]. While significant strides have been made in expanding ART coverage across the region, migrants continue to face disproportionate barriers to HIV treatment and care [10, 11]. Migration within SSA is driven by economic opportunities, conflict, and displacement, yet many countries lack inclusive healthcare policies that ensure ART continuity for mobile populations. Studies [12,13,14] have shown that migrant workers, refugees, and undocumented individuals are more likely to experience treatment interruptions, delays in accessing ART, and higher HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Additionally, restrictive healthcare policies, couples with language barriers, financial constraints, and legal uncertainties, further intensify disparities in HIV care for migrants in SSA [12,13,14]. These structural challenges contribute to the region’s struggle to achieve the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, which aim for 95% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) to know their status, 95% of those diagnosed to be on ART, and 95% of those on ART to achieve viral suppression by 2030 [10, 11]. Addressing these gaps requires urgent policy reforms that integrate migrant populations into national HIV treatment programs, ensuring healthcare access for all. Despite Sub-Saharan Africa’s ongoing challenges in ensuring ART access for all, Botswana has been recognised as a leader in the HIV response, achieving 90% ART coverage among its citizens [10]. On the other hand, the country has made significant progress in reducing AIDS-related mortality and mother-to-child transmission, largely due to robust HIV treatment programs supported by The United State President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and Global Fund [10]. However, despite efforts to expand access, migrants living in Botswana have continued to face significant barriers in obtaining ART, reflecting broader exclusionary trends across Sub-Saharan Africa. These challenges ranging from legal status restrictions to structural and institutional discrimination played a critical role in prompting policy shifts. Prior to 2019, Botswana’s national ART program explicitly excluded non-citizens, leaving migrant workers, refugees, and undocumented individuals particularly vulnerable to treatment interruptions, worsening health outcomes, and heightened risk of HIV transmission [15].

Although policy changes have since expanded ART eligibility to some migrant populations, implementation gaps, economic barriers, and healthcare discrimination continue to limit their access. The extent to which these policy changes have improved ART accessibility for migrants remains unclear, and there is limited research evaluating their effectiveness in addressing persistent challenges. Furthermore, the exclusion of migrants from ART services has contributed to the emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) among non-citizens in Botswana [16]. Pre-treatment and acquired HIV drug resistance have been reported at higher rates among migrants, largely due to inconsistent ART access, treatment interruptions, and lack of routine viral load monitoring. The presence of drug-resistant HIV strains poses a significant public health risk, as migrants with resistance mutations may experience treatment failure, develop multi-drug resistant strains, and contribute to ongoing transmission within the local populations [16]. These findings emphasise the urgent need for targeted interventions to improve ART adherence, implement HIVDR surveillance, and ensure continuity of care for migrants, thereby strengthening Botswana’s overall HIV response [16]. This study examines the impact of inadequate ART provision for migrants on public health, economic stability, and ethical considerations in Botswana. By highlighting the consequences of exclusionary policies and the broader implications for HIV control, the study aims to inform policy reforms that promote equitable healthcare access and strengthen Botswana’s HIV response.

This study is guided by Fassin’s (2009) [17] concept of selective blindness and Farmer’s (2010) [18] theory of structural violence. These frameworks provide critical lenses to understand the systemic barriers that migrants face in accessing healthcare services. They help to explain how policies, institutions, and social attitudes contribute to the exclusion and marginalisation of migrants within Botswana’s healthcare system, particularly in relation to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and HIV treatment. Fassin (2009) [17] introduced the concept of selective blindness to describe how societies, institutions, and policymakers deliberately ignore or fail to acknowledge the suffering of marginalised populations. This blindness is not always deliberate, it can also stem from entrenched bureaucratic practices, economic priorities, or dominant social narratives that prioritise certain groups over others [17]. In healthcare, selective blindness can manifest in exclusionary policies that deny migrants’ access to ART, inadequate monitoring of their health outcomes, or absence of tailored interventions addressing their specific needs.

Farmer (2010) [18] defines structural violence as the systemic, institutionalised forms of oppression that prevent individuals from meeting their basic needs, particularly in healthcare. Unlike direct violence, which involves physical harm, structural violence operates silently through policies, economic systems, and bureaucratic barriers that disproportionately affect marginalised groups [18]. In the context of healthcare for migrants, structural violence is evident in the legal restrictions on ART access, financial barriers due to employment precarity, and lack of inclusive health policies that accommodate mobile population. Farmer’s framework highlights how historical and economic inequalities shape present-day health disparities, reinforcing the need for structural reforms.

Aims and study design

The study aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers and cross-border migrants regarding the exclusion of migrants from ARVs provision in Botswana. The following research questions guided data collection and analysis:

1.

How do healthcare workers and cross-border migrants perceive the impact of limited access to antiretroviral therapy for migrants?

2.

What challenges do healthcare workers face when delivery HIV-related services to migrant populations?

3.

How is the exclusion of migrants from ART programs perceived to affect the health of both migrant populations and the broader community?

4.

In what ways do current policies align or conflict with principles of equity and the right to health for all individuals, regardless of migration status?

A descriptive qualitative design was used that provides straightforward descriptions of experiences and perceptions [19]. This is particularly useful in areas where limited knowledge exists [20]. This study design is appropriate as it considers the subjective nature of the topic and the diverse experiences of participants and presents results that closely align with the original research questions [21]. A qualitative descriptive design captures participants’ experiences and the meanings they attribute to these experiences without aiming to develop theories [19, 22].

Recruitment and selection

Recruitment took place between May and July in 2019. Inclusion criteria were: being healthcare providers who have worked at the clinic for at least 2 years and had provided medical care to migrants. Selection for migrants was based on: being migrant, i.e. having stayed in the Botswana for more than 1 year; aged 18 years and above and have accessed healthcare services from public health facilities. A purposive sampling method was used for the recruitment process, during which the researcher identified suitable participants from the clinics. The nurse in charge of the clinic was asked for permission to conduct the study in the health facility. Healthcare providers were contacted in person and by telephone and explained the objectives of the study. Migrants were selected using snowball sampling, a method appropriate for reaching hard-to reach or mobile populations. Initial participants were approached in public health clinics and malls in Gaborone and Francistown. These individuals then referred the lead researcher to other eligible participants within their network. Contact was made through cell phone communication, allowing the researcher to schedule interview appointments at times convenient for the participants. All interviews were conducted in a secured and private office setting to ensure confidentiality and create a safe space for open dialogue.

Participants

A total of 32 participants were interviewed and included in the study. A total of 12 participants were healthcare providers. Table 1. shows the demographic characteristics of healthcare provider participants. A total of 20 in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 documented and ten undocumented Zimbabweans migrants. Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics of migrant participants.

Data collection

In this qualitative study, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with both healthcare providers and migrants to explore their experiences in accessing those services. An interview guide served as a guide for conducting detailed interviews. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with cross-border migrants and healthcare providers. The guide was designed to capture the demographic characteristics of healthcare providers, information about healthcare entitlement for migrants, experiences of healthcare providers in dealing with migrants seeking healthcare services, access to healthcare for migrants in Botswana and use of health policies when providing healthcare services. The interview guide used in this study was developed specifically for this research as part of my PhD thesis and has not been previously published. An English language version of the interview guide has been uploaded as a supplementary file. Other critical areas were included in the data analysis, but more data will be published in other journals in the future.

Each interview lasted approximately 70–80 min and was recorded for transcription after obtaining consent from the participant. The interviews were recorded; consequently, the interviews were written. The lead researcher carefully observed the interviewees’ attitudes, expressions, tone and body language throughout the interviews. After conducting the interviews, a research assistant checked the transcripts carefully to ensure the accuracy of the information.

Data analysis

The data were analysed using Atlas ti version 9, following a selective blindness [18] and structural violence [18] frameworks to organize ethical themes. A deductive thematic analysis was conducted [23], guided by the concepts of selective blindness [17] and structural violence [18]. Selective blindness provided a lens to examine how healthcare policies and institutional practices systematically overlook or dismiss the healthcare needs of migrants, reinforcing disparities in ART provision and HIV treatment. Structural violence helped frame the systemic barriers such as restrictive policies, bureaucratic hurdles, and fear of deportation that prevent migrants from accessing essential healthcare services. These frameworks enabled a deeper understanding of how institutionalised exclusion contributes to health inequalities among migrants in Botswana.

All interviews were transcribed verbatim, with the sentences used as the units of analysis. The lead researcher and co-researchers independently reviewed and coded each transcript, comparing raw data and coded meanings to reach consensus on the codes and interpretations. Thematic content analysis was employed to explore the challenges, and strategies used by migrants to access healthcare services, enabling the identification of themes and patterns within the data [24]. The research team collaboratively identified themes and subthemes and organised them into a codebook. To ensure trustworthiness, standard qualitative research guidelines were followed [25, 26], including thorough review and coding of transcripts. An initial list of codes was developed based on the research question, with additional codes emerging from the data. These codes were refined into more abstract categories, leading to the creation of broader themes that illustrated the impact of inadequate provision of ART to migrants on the local population in Botswana. Manual coding and analysis were used to maintain close interaction with the data, mitigating the limitations of software analysis, such as data distancing and potential recontextualization of codes [27].

The main themes that were identified among healthcare providers participant interviews; (1) Health risks to the local population, (2) Ethical and public health implications, (3) Economic and emotional costs, (4) The need for regional health service integration. Additionally, the themes identified among migrants include 1)Barriers to Healthcare Access 2) Fear of Immigration and Police harassment 4) Challenges in accessing HIV and other essential treatments (5) Health Risks to the Local Population (6) Ethical and humanitarian concerns (7) Mother-to-Child Transmission (MTCT) of HIV.

Health risks to the local population

The exclusion of migrants from ART services increases the health risks not only for migrants but also for the local population. Untreated migrants with high viral loads are more likely to transmit HIV, particularly in cases of unprotected sexual relationships. Addressing these risks is crucial in Botswana’s broader HIV response. Participants highlighted the direct public health risk posed by untreated HIV-positive migrants. Without ART, viral loads remain high, increasing the likelihood of HIV transmission within both migrant and local populations. A participant suggests that inclusive treatment policies would be a more effective approach to epidemic control:

Those who are not on treatment are highly infectious, and you can imagine how risky it is. If migrants were given a chance to be treated, it would be better. The best way is to enrol everyone in the treatment and stop this.” (Nurse, 14)

Another participant reinforced the notion that excluding migrants from ART increases community-wide health risks. The participant acknowledges that HIV has no borders, and failure to treat migrants has spill-over effects on the general population.

Migrants should be provided with ARVs – HIV is an infectious disease, therefore they may interact with locals and put their lives in danger.” (Nurse, 1)

The risk extends to other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which can easily spread without adequate treatment. Addressing these health risks is crucial in controlling the overall HIV epidemic in Botswana.

Yes, there are health risks if migrants are denied services. For example, if a migrant has an STI or tuberculosis (TB) and we do not treat them, they will spread the infection to the rest of the population. They should be treated to protect the community. (Nurse, 3)

Ethical and public health implications

Participants question the ethical inconsistency in Botswana’s HIV response. Thus, testing individuals but denying them treatment contradicts public health ethics and the principle of equitable healthcare access. Denying ART to migrants raises serious ethical and humanitarian concerns, as healthcare should be a universal right, regardless of nationality or immigration status. A participant commented that:

Changes I would like to see in healthcare services for migrants include providing ARV treatment. If we test a foreigner and they are HIV positive but cannot access ARVs, what is the point of testing them? (Nurse, 5)

Participants emphasised that exclusion of migrants from ART jeopardises national HIV goals, particularly the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, particularly the goal of ensuring that 90% of diagnosed individuals receive ART. The ongoing transmission risk from untreated migrants makes epidemic control more challenging.

There is no way Botswana can achieve the 90-90-90 targets, especially the second 90, if all patients who test positive are not placed on ART. New infections will remain a challenge to control. (Nurse, 11)

In addition, even though the participants acknowledges financial constraints, they emphasised that migrants should not be denied ART based on nationality, aligning with ethical of universal healthcare rights.

Yes, migrants should have the same access to healthcare as those in Batswana. There are a lot of health risks when migrants are denied certain healthcare services. However, they should be accountable for their care—perhaps paying for services—but should never be denied access. (Nurse, 4)

Economic and emotional costs

Excluding migrants from ART services imposes significant economic and emotional burdens on healthcare providers and the system. Healthcare workers expressed frustration and moral distress over being unable to provide the necessary treatment, making their work emotionally exhausting. As a participant said that “It’s emotionally draining for us, assisting a person to die. I have cases of a person who tested negative and, in the long run, tested positive.” (PMTCT Coordinator, 2)

Additionally, untreated HIV among migrants increases long-term healthcare costs because the system must manage preventable HIV-related complications, new infections, and outbreaks. Participants highlighted the economic costs and treatment inefficiencies. Limited ART access leads to medication sharing, which can result in improper dosing, drug resistance, and higher healthcare costs eventually.

As one of the participants commented that:

Lack of ARVs for migrants is risky because they have relationships with the local population, leading to HIV transmission. If a Motswana is HIV positive, they may share medication with their migrant partner due to lack of access. (Nurse, 7)

Furthermore, participants also pointed out that the economic burden of delayed treatment will cost the government in the future. Preventive ART is more cost-effective than managing advanced HIV complications, which strain Botswana’s healthcare resources.

Denying ART to migrants will only cost the healthcare system more in the future. Treating someone temporarily and not ensuring continuity is not economical for the country. (Nurse, 10)

The need for regional health service integration

Participants strongly emphasized the urgency of integrating health services across borders to address the fragmented care experienced by migrants, particularly those living with HIV. The lack of regional coordination disrupts treatment continuity for mobile populations, undermining adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increasing the risk of reinfection and further transmission within and across borders.

Healthcare workers described how migrants frequently travel between neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe and South Africa, yet the absence of shared health information systems and cross-border protocols often results in treatment defaulting. This undermines both national HIV control efforts and regional public health objectives. The need for regional cooperation was framed not only as a health systems concern but also as a moral and ethical obligation to protect vulnerable populations and the broader community.

One nurse explained the consequences of failing to coordinate care across countries:

Migrants engage in relationships with locals, leading to reinfection. We need healthcare integration across countries. (Nurse, 6)

Another participant raised concerns around gaps in maternal care and the exclusion of migrant mothers from prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services due to inability to pay:

If a migrant mother gives birth here, we don’t test the baby at six weeks unless they pay first. I have seen cases where a baby was later diagnosed HIV-positive. (Nurse, 12)

The absence of regionally harmonized HIV services was also seen as a barrier to achieving epidemic control:

If we don’t integrate healthcare services across borders, migrants will continue defaulting, and we will never control the spread of HIV. (Nurse, 15)

These accounts highlight the need for stronger regional health governance structures that enable ART continuity, data sharing, and inclusion of migrants, particularly pregnant women within national HIV programs. Participants called for more migrant-sensitive health policies that go beyond national borders and recognize the interconnectedness of health outcomes in southern Africa.

Themes for migrants

Barriers to access to healthcare

The findings from migrant participants show that they experience multiple barriers to healthcare access, including financial constraints, documentation requirements, and discriminatory policies when accessing healthcare in public health facilities. High healthcare costs for non-citizens create inequities in service accessibility, forcing many migrants to delay seeking treatment or forego healthcare entirely. The requirement to provide official documents further limits access, particularly for undocumented migrants, increasing their vulnerability to preventable illnesses. These challenges create a healthcare environment in which migrants are unable to access timely care, often delaying or entirely avoiding treatment. As one participant noted:

I don’t feel equal to Batswana nationals because I pay more money at hospitals than in Zimbabwe where we are given services for free. (Migrant 1)

The requirement to present official identification was repeatedly mentioned as a restriction that excludes undocumented individuals from care:

At the clinic, they require me to present papers, or they don’t give me treatment. (Migrant 3)

Even when I am very sick, they turn me away. How do they expect me to survive? (Migrant 2)

Such experiences highlight systemic exclusion that pushes migrants further to the margins of the healthcare system, increasing their risk of preventable illness and health deterioration.

Fear of immigration and Police harassment

Another key theme of this study is that fear of arrest, detention, and deportation discourages migrants from seeking healthcare services, even when they are in critical need. Migrants reported avoiding clinics and hospitals due to the risk of being reported to immigration authorities, resulting in delayed or missed treatments. This fear-driven behaviour leads to worsened health outcomes, higher mortality rates, and increased transmission risks for communicable diseases such as HIV.

I don’t go to the clinic because I don’t have papers, and I am afraid of being detained. (Migrant 4)

In some instances, participants recounted being denied emergency care due to their migrant status:

The police once beat me, and I was very injured, but when I was taken to the hospital, they didn’t help me. (Migrant 5)

This environment of fear not only contributes to worsened health outcomes but also undermines trust in the healthcare system, deterring migrants from seeking help in critical moments.

Challenges in accessing HIV and other essential treatments

Migrants living with HIV face substantial difficulties in accessing ART, family planning services, and other essential treatments due to restrictive healthcare policies. ART interruptions increase the likelihood of HIV progression, contribute to higher viral loads, and elevate the risk of transmission. The exclusion of migrants from ART programs directly contradicts Botswana’s commitment to achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, which require ensuring that 95% of people living with HIV know their status, 95% of diagnosed individuals receive ART, and 95% of those on ART achieve viral suppression. These barriers are driven by restrictive policies that exclude non-citizens from national programs:

My fellow Zimbabweans end up dying because of being denied medication. (Migrant 6)

One of the participants reported being refused access to reproductive health services:

They refused to give me family planning pills. Migrants should have access to condoms, PrEP, and family planning like Batswana. (Migrant 8)

Interrupted ART access often resulted in poor adherence and risk of treatment failure:

I have missed doses many times because sometimes I cannot afford to travel to the clinic, and other times they tell me only citizens can get medication. (Migrant 7)

These findings point to urgent gaps in HIV care, undermining both individual health and Botswana’s efforts to meet the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets.

Health risks to the local population

The lack of ART access for migrants not only endangers their health but also poses public health risks to the local population. Without treatment, HIV-positive migrants are more likely to have high viral loads, increasing the likelihood of transmission to their sexual partners and communities. Some migrants reported sharing ART medication due to lack of access, a practice that contributes to poor adherence, treatment failure, and the emergence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR). The spread of drug-resistant HIV strains presents a significant challenge for Botswana’s HIV response and underscores the need for inclusive treatment policies that prioritise public health. Participants recognized that untreated HIV among migrants increases the risk of transmission within communities:

If migrants are not treated, they will pass HIV to other people in the community. (Migrant 9)

The practice of sharing medication, driven by desperation and inaccessibility, poses further health risks:

Some people who don’t get treatment share pills, and that is not safe. (Migrant 10)

These accounts raise concerns about the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains and the consequences for Botswana’s HIV response efforts.

Ethical and humanitarian concerns

Denying migrant access to ART and other essential healthcare services raises profound ethical and humanitarian concerns. Migrants expressed frustration at being treated as outsiders in healthcare settings despite their urgent medical needs. The exclusion of migrants from lifesaving treatments violates fundamental human rights and contradicts the principles of medical ethics, including the duty to provide care without discrimination. Migrants shared strong feelings of being treated unfairly and inhumanely within the healthcare system, particularly when denied essential care:

We are all human beings, but they don’t treat us the same way when we are sick. (Migrant 11)

Denying people treatment just because they are not from Botswana is not fair. (Migrant 12)

Such statements reflect not only a sense of exclusion but also a deeper humanitarian crisis that challenges the ethical foundations of medical practice and the right to health for all.

Mother-to-Child transmission (MTCT) of HIV

The findings indicate that pregnant migrant women struggle to access prenatal care and PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) services, increasing the risk of HIV transmission to new-borns. Limited access to ART during pregnancy results in higher rates of vertical HIV transmission, negatively impacting maternal and infant health outcomes. The exclusion of pregnant migrants from PMTCT programs contradicts global commitments to eliminating mother-to-child transmission and highlights the need for more inclusive maternal healthcare policies. Ensuring that all pregnant women, regardless of their migration status, receive comprehensive maternal and neonatal care is crucial for improving health outcomes for both mothers and children. Participants described cases where women were unable to access ART during pregnancy, resulting in infants being born HIV-positive:

I know a woman who was pregnant and couldn’t get ART, and her baby was born with HIV. (Migrant 13)

In addition to lack of care, some migrants reported experiencing disrespect and surveillance during labour:

One day, my wife was in labor, and they told the security guard to watch us because we might run away. (Migrant 14)

The exclusion of pregnant migrants from essential maternal health services not only undermines international commitments to eliminate mother-to-child transmission but also perpetuates structural discrimination against migrant women:

A nurse told my friend that migrants should not have babies if they cannot afford care, but what choice do we have? (Migrant 16)

These narratives highlight the need for more inclusive maternal health policies that ensure equitable care for all pregnant women, regardless of migration status.

This study explored the experiences of both healthcare providers and migrants on the impact of inadequate antiretroviral therapy provision in Botswana. The findings from this qualitative study show that systemic barriers that exacerbate health disparities, increase the risk of HIV transmission, and contribute to ongoing structural violence against migrants. Migration and healthcare inequalities often intersect in complex ways, resulting in the systematic neglect of marginalised populations. Fassin (2009) [17] conceptualises this phenomenon as selective blindness, which is deliberate disregard by healthcare systems and policymakers towards the needs of socially and economically vulnerable groups. This selective blindness is not accidental but embedded within institutional structures that prioritize the health of certain populations while marginalising others. In the context of Botswana, the exclusion of migrants from ART services exemplifies this selective blindness, where legal and policy frameworks consciously overlook the healthcare needs of migrants, despite their significant vulnerability to HIV.

On the other hand, the study found that migrants living with HIV face significant challenges in accessing ART and other essential treatments. Some of these challenges include; high medical costs, lack of documentation, and discriminatory policies. These challenges align with Fassin (2009) [17] notion of selective blindness, where the healthcare system consciously ignores the needs of migrants. Similarly, Farmer (2010) [18] concept of structural violence helps explain how economic and legal systems marginalise migrants, creating barriers that perpetuate health inequalities. A study done in South Africa and Thailand, showed that migrants are often excluded from national ART programs due to citizenship-based restrictions [28]. In South Africa, migrants often face denial of ART services despite having the right to free healthcare. In Thailand, only pregnant women among registered migrants are entitled to ART, reflecting discriminatory policies that limit access for migrants [29]. Furthermore, findings also revealed that healthcare providers recognise the necessity for more inclusive policies but cite logistical and resource-based constraints as barriers to universal ART provision. Expanding ART programs to include migrants is essential for Botswana to meet its UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets and reduce new HIV infections. The exclusion of migrants from ART services not only affects them individually but also poses significant public health risks to the local population. As Farmer (2010) [18] asserts, structural violence marginalises those at the intersections of socio-economic vulnerability and legal exclusion. The restricted access to ART increases HIV transmission risks, perpetuates high viral loads, and contributes to the emergence of HIV drug resistance. Studies have shown that untreated individuals with high viral loads contribute to continued HIV transmission, particularly in mobile and cross-border communities [8, 12].

Moreover, healthcare providers expressed concerns where migrants have fear of arrest and deportation, which discourages them from accessing healthcare. This fear-driven avoidance behaviour is a manifestation of structural violence, as it reflects the power dynamics that suppress and silence vulnerable populations [18]. On the other hand, healthcare providers acknowledged the challenge migrants face but, felt constrained by policies that intertwine healthcare with immigration enforcement. This selective blindness to the needs of migrants (Fassin, 2009) [17] exacerbates health inequalities, reinforcing their exclusion from critical services.Similar findings in Europe and North America demonstrate that immigration policies often act as a barrier to accessing healthcare among undocumented migrants [29, 30]. Findings also showed that migrants’ interactions with healthcare providers ranged from compassionate care to experiences of neglect and discrimination. These inconsistent experiences reflect selective blindness within the healthcare systems, where some providers consciously or unconsciously reprioritize migrant needs [17].

Healthcare providers expressed concerns that limited ART access for migrants undermines Botswana’s broader HIV control efforts. Implementing inclusive treatment strategies can help mitigate these risks and contribute to overall epidemic control. Both healthcare providers and migrants highlight the ethical dilemmas associated with denying ART based on migration status. Thus, the exclusion of migrants from essential healthcare services raises significant ethical and humanitarian concerns. Structural Violence Theory [18] also provides a useful framework for understanding how systemic healthcare inequities perpetuate harm. Similar research in high-income countries has also demonstrated that denying healthcare based on legal status contradicts global health ethics and principles of non-discrimination [3]. Addressing these ethical concerns requires policy reforms that prioritise health equity over nationality-based exclusions. The study findings reveal that migrant women face challenges in accessing prenatal care and PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) services. Similar trends have been documented in Zambia and Mozambique, where exclusion from maternal healthcare services leads to higher rates of vertical HIV transmission [11]. Healthcare providers acknowledge the importance of ensuring universal ART access for pregnant women but cite financial and policy limitations as major barriers. Expanding PMTCT programs to include all pregnant women, regardless of their migration status, is critical for achieving Botswana’s HIV prevention goals.

Strengths and limitations

This study offers valuable insights into an under-researched area by foregrounding the voices of both healthcare providers and cross-border migrants, two key yet often overlooked stakeholders in discussions about HIV service delivery in Botswana. One of its main strengths lies in its qualitative design, which enabled in-depth exploration of complex and sensitive issues surrounding ART provision, ethics, and migration. By capturing lived experiences in both urban border areas, the study sheds light on how policy gaps are experienced on the ground, and how they shape perceptions of equity and access in real-time service delivery contexts.

Furthermore, the inclusion of healthcare workers from various cadres, alongside migrants with diverse migration statuses and occupational backgrounds, enhances the richness and relevance of the findings. The study also contributes to ongoing policy conversations by situating the issue within broader ethical, public health, and human rights frameworks. However, the study is not without limitations. The findings are based on purposively selected participants from two urban settings, which may limit the transferability of results to rural contexts or other regions of the country. Additionally, while efforts were made to recruit a diverse group of migrants, those who were undocumented or in more precarious conditions may have been less willing to participate, potentially leading to underrepresentation of the most marginalized voices. Lastly, as with all qualitative research, the findings reflect participants’ subjective experiences and cannot be generalized statistically to all healthcare workers or migrants in Botswana. Despite these limitations, the study provides a strong foundation for future research and policy reform aimed at advancing health equity for migrant populations in Botswana and similar settings.",https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/cover-hires/journal/12939,N,,2025-09-29 14:56:35.021982

ImmigrationOS was developed by the software company Palantir Technologies, co-founded by tech billionaire and Donald Trump ally Peter Thiel.

Protesters took to the streets of Newark on Sept. 29 to send a message: No to ICE surveillance database.

The protest organized by the immigration advocacy group Make The Road was centered around the technology platform ImmigrationOS, developed by the software company Palantir Technologies, co-founded by tech billionaire and Donald Trump ally Peter Thiel.

The Trump Administration awarded a $30 million contract in April to Palantir to develop the software that tracks people who plan to self-deport and target gang members and those who have overstayed their visas. That will be done by collecting biographical and biometric data from government databases to identify immigrants.

Palantir was scheduled to provide a prototype of ImmigrationOS to ICE on September 25. It will be used by ICE for two years, according to the contract.

The attendees at the protest, which occurred a few miles away from Delaney Hall, the immigration detention center operated on the outskirts of Newark by ICE, expressed their concerns that the software could target immigrants, irrespective of status, and violate their human rights.

“Here in New Jersey, we believe in democracy and we believe in freedom,"" Nedia Morsy, executive director of Make The Road New Jersey, said before a press conference at Newark's Military Park. She called for the state to divest from investing pension fund money in Palentir.

Larry Hamm, the founder the Newark activist group People’s Organization for Progress, said the Palantir database is not just an immigrant problem but a problem for everyone.

""Immigrant rights are human rights,"" he said.

After the press conference, the protesters marched several long blocks across downtown Newark to Lincoln Park.

The Republican President has said repeatedly that he fully expects the government to enter a shutdown this week.
They say that because Republicans control the White House and Congress, Americans will mostly blame them for any shutdown.
It remains to be seen whether the White House meeting will help or hurt the chances for a resolution.
Negotiations between Trump and Democratic congressional leaders have rarely gone well, and Trump has had little contact with the opposing party during his second term.","Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are heading to the White House for a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday in a late effort to avoid a government shutdown, but both sides have shown hardly any willingness to budge from their entrenched positions.

If government funding legislation is not passed by Congress and signed by Trump on Tuesday night, many government offices across the nation will be temporarily shuttered and non-exempt federal employees will be furloughed, adding to the strain on workers and the nation’s economy.

Republicans are daring Democrats to vote against legislation that would keep government funding mostly at current levels, but Democrats so far have held firm. They are using one of their few points of leverage to demand that Congress take up legislation to extend health care benefits.

“The meeting is a first step, but only a first step. We need a serious negotiation,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in an interview Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Trump has shown little interest in entertaining Democrats’ demands on health care, even as he agreed to hold a sit-down meeting Monday afternoon with Schumer, along with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. The Republican President has said repeatedly that he fully expects the government to enter a shutdown this week.

“If it has to shut down, it’ll have to shut down,” Trump said Friday. “But they’re the ones that are shutting down government.”

The Trump administration has tried to pressure Democratic lawmakers into backing away from their demands, warning that federal employees could be permanently laid off in the midst of a funding lapse.

“Chuck Schumer said a few months ago that a government shutdown would be chaotic, harmful and painful. He’s right, and that’s why we shouldn’t do it,” Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Sunday on “Meet the Press.”

Still, Democrats argued that Trump’s agreement to hold a meeting shows that he is feeling the pressure to negotiate. They say that because Republicans control the White House and Congress, Americans will mostly blame them for any shutdown.

But to hold on to their negotiating leverage, Senate Democrats will likely have to vote against a bill to temporarily extend government funding on Tuesday, just hours before a shutdown — an uncomfortable position for a party that has long denounced shutdowns as pointless and destructive.

The bill has already passed the Republican-controlled House and would keep the government funded for seven more weeks while Congress works on annual spending legislation.

Any legislation to fund the government will need support from at least 60 senators. That means that at least eight Democrats would have to vote for the short-term funding bill, because Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is expected to vote against it.

During the last potential government shutdown in March, Schumer and nine other Democrats voted to break a filibuster and allow a Republican-led funding bill to advance to a final vote. The New York Democrat faced fierce backlash from many in his own party for that decision, with some even calling for him to step down as Democratic leader.

This time, Schumer appears resolute.

“We’re hearing from the American people that they need help on health care and as for these massive layoffs, guess what? Simple one-sentence answer: They’re doing it anyway,” he said.

Democrats are pushing for an extension to Affordable Care Act tax credits that have subsidized health insurance for millions of people since the COVID-19 pandemic. The credits, which are designed to expand coverage for low- and middle-income people, are set to expire at the end of the year.

Some Republicans are open to extending the tax credits, but want changes. Thune said Sunday that the program is “desperately in need of reform” and Republicans want to address “waste, fraud and abuse.” He has pressed Democrats to vote for the funding bill and take up the debate on tax credits at a later date.

It remains to be seen whether the White House meeting will help or hurt the chances for a resolution. Negotiations between Trump and Democratic congressional leaders have rarely gone well, and Trump has had little contact with the opposing party during his second term.

The most recent negotiation in August between Schumer and the president to speed the pace of Senate confirmation votes for administration officials ended with Trump telling Schumer to “go to hell” in a social media post.

Trump also abruptly canceled a meeting that was planned with congressional leaders last week, calling Democrats’ demands “unserious and ridiculous.”

Schumer argued that the White House coming back to reschedule a meeting for Monday showed that “they felt the heat.”

Sparing the usual litany of ""stare decisis"" factors, Justice Clarence Thomas offered a simple formula for the amount of deferential weight he gives a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court: how much he agrees with it.

In a new petition, CashCall claims it was entitled by the Seventh Amendment to a jury trial in the case, in which the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has sought to return money to consumers who paid sky-high interest rates over what the agency says were illegal loans.

Cristóbal Cavazos gets a call from a People’s Patrol volunteer at an industrial park near O’Hare International Airport where thousands of undocumented immigrants work in warehouses and manufacturing and food-processing plants.

The volunteer tells Cavazos she’s watching agents who might be from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency known as ICE.

Cavazos, 46, rushes to his car. He opens the hatch and packs in five-gallon buckets, drumsticks to pound on them, and bullhorns. He invites me to ride along.

Bensenville, the village that includes the industrial park, has been “a hotbed of ICE activity since Trump came in,” he says.

Cavazos leads the People’s Patrol, one of many volunteer rapid-response networks countering a Trump administration deportation blitz in the Chicago area. The idea is to locate immigration enforcement activity, record it, document abuses and, right on the spot, voice community opposition.

Cavazos’ network focuses on Chicago’s western suburbs. It’s housed at the Casa DuPage Workers Center, a small nonprofit devoted to immigrant rights.

“We saw ICE go into a factory about a month and a half ago, looking for someone,” Cavazos tells me on the way to Bensenville. “They freaked out the whole factory and they took some people from there. It’s just really sad, the way the United States crucifies [its immigrant] workers, particularly in this case. They’re essential workers that are in these factories giving us food.”

Racing toward the industrial park on an expressway, Cavazos says the People’s Patrol includes 180 people, all volunteers. The center holds trainings for the work every other Friday.

As the volunteers go about their daily lives, they all keep an eye out for immigration enforcement activity. Some make a point of driving past parking lots and businesses where the federal authorities typically gather before a day’s operations.

The ICE officers usually drive unmarked vehicles. But People’s Patrol volunteers sometimes manage to tail them. If the officers stop a motorist or try to take people from a house or workplace, the volunteers send an alert through a Facebook page and through text groups.

“We’ll send people to go check it out,” Cavazos says. “We want to go in and show the community ‘Hey, we got your back.’ We’re in the midst of a historic fight-back right now against ICE. We’re not going to leave any space to ICE. The People’s Patrol is there to fill these spaces of terror and fear with solidarity and strength.”

As Cavazos speaks, he clenches his fist. I make sure his other hand remains on the wheel.

When we arrive in Bensenville, we hear there is no immigration sweep, just a press conference about some illegal imports.

Now, however, Cavazos is getting word about immigration arrests in Elgin.

“So we’re going to head over,” he says.

Soon we are back on an expressway for another long drive across the western suburbs. I start to understand the mileage Cavazos racks up each day to help show his community’s opposition to Trump’s deportation campaign.

I ask Cavazos how he got into this work. He says he’s been fighting for immigrants since his college years two decades ago. And he talks about his parents: His mother, a South Texas native, and father, who came from northern Mexico, were migrant farmworkers. They harvested apples in Michigan, dug out potatoes in Idaho and picked cotton across the South.

“These were Mexican workers traveling during Jim Crow and Juan Crow, being asked to sit in the back of restaurants,” he says.

Some of the indignities were hazardous. Cavazos recalls his father telling stories about returning to Texas after visits to Mexico. At the border, they would be sprayed down with “some kind of a chemical to supposedly get all the germs off of Mexican workers.”

The chemicals included the toxic insecticide lindane and DDT, a pesticide later banned for killing off too much wildlife.

Eventually, Cavazos’ parents heard about jobs in the Chicago area. They settled in DuPage County. Cavazos was born in Winfield.

Throughout his childhood, he heard what his parents had gone through but also about freedom fighters, such as farmworker organizer César Chávez and Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata.

“Zapata once said, ‘I would rather spend one day standing up than 1,000 years on my knees,’ ” Cavazos says.

Emulating those freedom fighters, Cavazos patrols the west suburbs to stand up to Trump’s immigration enforcement.

“We’ll be there in two minutes,” Cavazos says in Spanish to People’s Patrol volunteers calling from Elgin.

When we arrive, the volunteers tell him the day’s immigration arrests seem to be over.

But then he gets a call about a U.S. Department of Homeland Security vehicle at a hotel 20 minutes away. DHS oversees ICE, the immigration enforcement agency.

“It’s parked at the Marriott in Bloomingdale, so that is where we’re headed,” Cavazos tells me.

We pull up to the hotel and see a white SUV with markings of the Federal Protective Service, a DHS police force.

I follow Cavazos and two People’s Patrol volunteers to the hotel’s front desk.

The hotel manager informs them that Homeland Security personnel are frequent guests there. A moment later, two uniformed DHS officers stride past the desk on their way out to the SUV.

Cavazos cannot be sure the officers are working on immigration enforcement but asks the manager to boot them from the hotel nevertheless: “They’re staying here, using your premises to launch their war of terror on the immigrant communities. That goes against our values. I would invite you to just tell them to leave.”

The request seems like a long shot. Cavazos starts working his phone to get more people there and make a stronger case.

By sundown, two dozen protesters are in front of the hotel with a petition to kick the DHS officers out.

“The people united will never be defeated!” they chant in Spanish through the bullhorns, beating the buckets. After a couple hours, Bloomingdale police officers threaten to enforce a noise ordinance. Everyone leaves.

A few days later, I catch up with Cavazos at a different protest. About 75 immigrants and supporters are marching to denounce a Mexican father’s fatal shooting by an immigration officer during a traffic stop in Franklin Park.

After the march, I ask Cavazos to sit down for a few minutes. I want to hear how Trump’s deportation blitz is affecting him after fighting so long for immigrant workers.

He describes what the backlash looks like up close.

“We had a protest a couple weeks ago, and one guy came up spewing racial epithets and screaming at us, and then I had this right-wing guy come into my face,” he says.

The second man, Cavazos says, was a “tall white dude without a shirt” trying to provoke a fight.

He says incidents such as these and the Franklin Park killing have been deflating: “You feel this emptiness. And you look at your community. People that you love are afraid.”

Cavazos says his community is suffering a “dark night of the soul,” a phrase coined by St. John of the Cross, the 16th-century Spanish monk who said a feeling of abandonment by God was necessary for a more profound faith.

That monk knew about suffering. His ancestors were among the hundreds of thousands of Iberian Jews, known as conversos, who adopted Roman Catholicism to survive the Inquisition. Converso descendants, even generations later, were viewed with suspicion, labeled “swine” and singled out by blood-purity laws.

In the Chicago area, Cavazos tells me, the “dark night” has led too many immigrants to internalize Trump’s attacks and even slam rapid-response work.

“On social media, they don’t like what we’re doing and they think that we’re too out there, that we’re putting people in danger by being community organizers,” he says.

“When you feel the government attacking you,” Cavazos explains, “you just feel that you’re somehow not an essential, valuable part of the community, that you should be gone because of the color of your skin or the fact that you were not born in the United States. There are people that don’t have courage right now.”

Cavazos confides that sometimes he himself struggles to find courage.

He also gets pushback from some relatives. Cavazos says they are “evangelical Christians that think that Trump is somehow part of the Armageddon and the end of the world.” He says they tell him he is selfishly rebelling against the inevitable.

Amid the doubts and criticism, Cavazos turns to his faith.

“Every morning, I give thanks to God. I give thanks for my family. I give thanks for my organization, Casa DuPage. I give thanks to be in this moment of time, where I have some kind of influence and I’m able to organize.”

Where does all this gratitude come from?

Cavazos points to Gustavo Gutiérrez, the late Peruvian priest who pioneered liberation theology, a movement that encouraged some Catholic clergy in the 1960s and ’70s to stand up to Latin American dictators. The theology links gratitude for God’s love to solidarity with the poor and to the active struggle to build a just society.

“I give thanks for beautiful allies,” Cavazos says. “The past few months, more and more people have been coming out of the shadows to say ‘How can we help?’”

He ushers them into the People’s Patrol.

“Sometimes the only thing we have is resistance. Particularly at this moment, we don’t know where this is going to end,” Cavazos says. “But you have faith in justice. You have faith in principle. You have faith.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/45cc81f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5983x3415+0+288/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2F10%2F2ea6c25842dd995f0c8d05b29890%2Fmain-image-rapid-response.JPG,N,,2025-09-29 14:56:39.704746

Case Name: Midwest Environmental Advocates, Inc. v. Frederick Prehn

Case No.: 2023AP001478

Officials:

Focus: Mootness Doctrine-Prevailing Party Relief

Midwest Environmental Advocates (MEA) sued Frederick Prehn (as a member and former Chair of Wisconsin’s Natural Resources Board (NRB)) along with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the NRB. MEA claimed that Prehn had “arbitrarily and capriciously” withheld or delayed the production of certain text messages and communications in response to an MEA Records Request, per the Wisconsin Public Records Law (WIS. STAT. §§ 19.31–19.39).

Prehn moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the requested communications were not “records” under the applicable law and he was not an “authority” covered under the law. The court denied Prehn’s motion but after negotiations, the parties agreed to a forensic inspection of Prehn’s digital devices, which yielded an additional 159 additional communications.

Both sides moved for summary judgment. MEA sought prevailing-part relief and Prehn argued the case was moot because he had voluntarily produced the records during litigation. The circuit court ruled in favor of Prehn.

The Court of Appeals ruled that the disputed text messages qualified as “records” in the initial suit because they were communications tied to government functions, and that mid-litigation compliance with a Records Request does not automatically render the action moot. Further, the court found that the circuit court misapplied Friends of Frame Park, particularly considering recent court decisions that clarified a ruling on the merits remains relevant even with mid-litigation compliance, in regards to attorney fees, litigation costs and damages. The court remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with its ruling.

The pace of ICE arrests in Wisconsin is rising during the Trump administration’s nationwide immigration enforcement surge.","Of the roughly 6.6 million immigrants who landed in the federal immigration court system over the past decade, at least 41,000 listed addresses in Wisconsin.

Those immigrants, many of them new arrivals, are now in the spotlight.

The Wisconsin Assembly voted earlier this month to bar local governments or state agencies from subsidizing or reimbursing health care for immigrants who are not “lawfully present” in the United States. One bill sponsor described that proposal as mostly “preemptive,” given that undocumented immigrants are already ineligible for most Wisconsin Medicaid coverage. The ACLU of Wisconsin is asking the state Supreme Court to prohibit local jails from holding immigrant detainees on behalf of federal immigration authorities, even while some law enforcement agencies attempt to wade further into the realm of immigration enforcement.

Many of the human details of those interactions – immigrants’ names, for instance – aren’t recorded in the spreadsheets listing immigration court hearings and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests. But the records do provide clues about where new immigrants to Wisconsin came from, where they settled and how they have fared in the immigration court system.

The records also illustrate a 10-year history of shifting immigration enforcement priorities, including the beginning of the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown.

At least in Wisconsin, immigrants with legal permanent residence outnumber new arrivals. Roughly 21,000 new immigrants in Wisconsin obtained permanent residence between 2015 and 2023: the most recent year for which those data are available. Most were relatives of U.S. citizens, employees of American companies or refugees, though the number of refugees arriving annually in Wisconsin has declined. Of the nearly 7,000 immigrants in Wisconsin who became legal permanent residents in 2023, roughly a quarter were from Mexico.

Those with cases before immigration court, on the other hand, often overstayed visas or entered the country without them, complicating their paths, if any exist, towards legal permanent residency or citizenship. Most came to the U.S. within the past five years, making their way north and registering with the court using a Wisconsin address. Others arrived as children decades ago, first appearing in immigration court records well into their adulthoods.

Unlike federal district courts, immigration courts do not operate within the judicial branch, nor are immigration court judges political appointees subject to Senate confirmation. Instead, the courts operate within the U.S. Department of Justice, hearing cases of noncitizens who the federal government intends to “remove” – in other words, deport. The courts can also consider immigrants’ requests for asylum and other forms of relief.

Wisconsin has no immigration court of its own. The immigration court in Chicago handles most cases involving immigrants with Wisconsin addresses, while a court in Fort Snelling in Minnesota handles a smaller number. But other new arrivals have cases in courts as far away as California and Puerto Rico – an indication of the bewildering range of paths through the federal immigration system.

Immigrants with cases before the courts have the right to an attorney, but the federal government is not generally required to provide one. Unable to afford private attorneys’ fees, many immigrants opt to represent themselves.

Roughly a third of immigrants in Wisconsin who entered the immigration court system over the past decade have been represented by an attorney at some point in their case.

The limited address data available in court records suggests that these new immigrants have settled in major cities and rural communities across Wisconsin, often following jobs in agriculture and manufacturing. Small cities like Abbotsford and Darlington have received more of those recent immigrants per capita than Green Bay, though parts of Milwaukee and Dane County absorbed the largest numbers, both in absolute terms and per capita.

More than half of the new arrivals came to Wisconsin from Mexico and Nicaragua. Wisconsin received roughly 1 in 20 Nicaraguan immigrants to the U.S. over the past decade — behind only Florida, California and Texas, and by far the most disproportionate number in the country relative to the state’s overall share of recent arrivals.

“Most Nicaraguans (in Wisconsin) came from the northern parts of the country and are used to working in agriculture,” said one woman who immigrated to Wisconsin from Nicaragua in 2021. Wisconsin Watch agreed not to name her due to fears of legal repercussions.

A spiraling economy, nationwide protests and a violent police crackdown in 2018 prompted many of her neighbors to leave the country, she said, and word of abundant – and familiar — agricultural jobs drew many to Wisconsin. “By the time I left, only the grandparents remained,” she recalled in Spanish. “There were no more young people, no more children, no more parents.”

Nicaraguans made up the largest share of new immigrants on Milwaukee’s south side, whereas new immigrants from Mexico outnumber those from Nicaragua in the neighboring suburbs.

But the makeup of new immigrants varies substantially between Wisconsin communities. Venezuelans make up the largest share in parts of Dane County, as do Cuban immigrants in parts of Outagamie County, Vietnamese immigrants in Menomonee Falls and Indian immigrants in Oak Creek.

Representation rates vary significantly between immigrant nationalities: Only about 20% of Nicaraguan nationals had representation at some point in their case, compared to roughly 90% of Indian and Chinese nationals.

Not everyone with a case in the immigration court system lacks legal status. Some have obtained Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which currently shields nationals from a dozen countries from deportation, though Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has moved to terminate those protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Venezuela and Haiti in the coming months. DHS terminated TPS for Nicaraguan nationals in early September.

ICE, a branch of DHS, can move to deport immigrants without a hearing in some cases.

ICE records through late July indicate the agency has arrested roughly 1,700 people in Wisconsin since September 2023. Roughly 45% of those arrested have left the country, either via deportation or “voluntary departure.” Those able to leave via “voluntary departure” avoid adding a removal to their record.

The pace of ICE arrests in Wisconsin is rising during the Trump administration’s nationwide immigration enforcement surge.

In recent months, those arrests have primarily targeted immigrants with criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. The records offer no specifics on the nature of the convictions or charges.

In that regard, Wisconsin is out of step with countrywide trends. ICE data indicates that immigrants with no criminal history made up nearly 30% of arrests nationally in 2025 as of late July, compared to just over 15% of arrests in Wisconsin.

Still, arrests in Wisconsin of immigrants with no criminal history and subsequent deportations are ticking upwards. Milwaukee immigration attorney Davorin Odrcic says the trend reflects a new set of priorities among immigration enforcement officials.

“There was an unspoken rule,” he said, that if an immigrant was seeking legal status and “not a danger to the community, didn’t have any convictions, ICE would let them go through that process.” Based on one client’s recent arrest and detention, Odrcic believes that unspoken rule has vanished.

While location data on ICE arrests is sparse and often unreliable, the agency’s records point to hundreds of arrests in Wisconsin jails and prisons over the past two years. Those figures will likely grow as Wisconsin sheriffs increasingly sign agreements to help ICE locate and take custody of undocumented immigrants detained in local jails.

Arrest data from the Biden administration included hundreds of records of arrests at an ICE office in downtown Milwaukee, the vast majority of which involved Nicaraguan immigrants with no criminal history. Only a handful of those arrests resulted in deportations, suggesting the immigrants were quickly released. Researchers at the Deportation Data Project, which collects and publishes federal immigration enforcement data, say the “arrests” may simply represent immigrants checking in at the ICE office.

Many of Odrcic’s clients are still required to check in at an ICE office periodically – a visit that has become far more daunting under Trump’s recent crackdown. “It’s a challenging situation,” he said. “I can’t advise you to blow off one of these appointments. I could advise you that there is a possibility of detention. So, I just have to leave it at that.”",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2025/03/scales-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 12:57:11.306271

By Arnie Alpert, Active with the Activists

Arnie Alpert spent decades as a community organizer/educator in NH movements for social justice and peace. Officially retired from the American Friends Service Committee since 2020, he keeps his hands (and feet) in the activist world while writing about past and present social movements.

MANCHESTER—It was a relatively quiet afternoon at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport on Sunday, but those who drove by the terminal would have noticed eight people with signs protesting against Avelo Airlines. The protest was timed to coincide with the departure of Avelo Flight 605, headed to Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, where another demonstration took place.

Avelo, a budget carrier which flies passengers from MHT to three North Carolina airports as well as Myrtle Beach in South Carolina, has for months been flying shackled immigrant prisoners between domestic airports under contract to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency with primary responsibility for carrying out President Donald Trump’s “mass deportation” agenda. Avelo has also operated “removal flights” carrying deportees from Arizona to Guatemala. The practice has aroused a nationwide protest movement, including a boycott, intended to pressure the company to end its involvement in the deportation business.

Avelo is not transporting immigrants out of Manchester. But they are one of three airlines that has been flying them out of Portsmouth under contract with ICE.

“We want them to cancel that contract,” said Jimmy Trinh, a spokesperson for the Southern NH chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which organized the demonstration. “Our goal is to pressure them to make it financially unfeasible for them to run these flights. And if they cancel their contracts, we’ll stop trying to pressure them, but if not, we’re perfectly fine with them going out of business.”

The Houston-based carrier is the only airline with an ICE contract that also has scheduled commercial flights. Many of the ICE flights, including those which have departed from Portsmouth International Airport, are “shuffle” flights which transport detainees to airports closer to the border, from which the prisoners are taken to detention prisons, grouped with others from their home countries and put on removal flights, mostly to Latin America.

The other airlines which have operated ICE flights from Portsmouth, Global X and Eastern Air Express, are charter companies and therefore more immune to consumer boycotts.

According to Human Rights First, which publishes the monthly ICE Flight Monitor, ICE contracts directly with CSI Aviation, which in turn subcontracts the flights to airline firms such as Avelo. In July, Avelo was responsible for 20% of all ICE flights and 10% of removal flights, the group said.

“This combined protest between North Carolina and New Hampshire is to demonstrate the resolve of us all across the country to get Avelo to drop their contract with ICE. Avelo’s decision to try to profit off of human trafficking is a clear demonstration of their willingness to collaborate with this administration in its attempts to terrorize our immigrant communities,” DSA said in a statement prior to the protest.

“We are not asking people to make the difficult choice of confronting a violent deportation machinery directly, we are asking them to make simple changes to their spending habits here on this airline, and any other airline that might try to do the same. Avelo is making money by destroying our communities, we have to show them we won’t let them,” the group said.

DSA also protested at MHT on August 6. Another group held signs protesting Avelo’s ICE flights on a busy Manchester road leading to the airport on May 31.

In Durham, North Carolina, where Avelo Flight 605 landed at Raleigh-Durham (RDU) at 5:07 PM, members of Engaged Durhamites for Democracy held their own protest. “We have been demonstrating since late April to put pressure on Avelo to stop coordinating with ICE to deport passengers,” said Kathryn Pollak, a spokesperson for the group. “They often fly passengers without due process and in shackles, which causes moral distress for Avelo flight crews as they cannot keep their passengers safe. We hope that by doing a joint event with Manchester we can raise awareness further to those traveling on that Avelo flight, encouraging them to not fly Avelo until they sever their contract with ICE.”

Pollak’s group, which is affiliated with Indivisible, has been protesting at RDU every week since April, and now has a permit for a quiet protest inside the airport terminal every Monday.

Indivisible’s “Ground Avelo” campaign, and another called the Coalition to Stop Avelo, have both been promoting protests and a boycott. In addition to its attention to potential passengers, Ground Avelo is calling for pressure to be put on Avelo’s university partners, the states and municipalities which run airports, and the company’s leadership, which together they label as the “pillars” that hold up the company’s business. By weakening the pillars, they believe they can push the airline to cease its involvement in mass deportation.

It’s not clear whether the protests and boycotts are having an impact, but Avelo recently announced it will suspend its Manchester flights in January. “Avelo unfortunately made the difficult decision to pause service at MHT, with their latest flight scheduled to depart on January 5, 2026. They plan to continue to explore opportunities in MHT and hope to return for the summer 2026 season once they identify the right mix of markets and frequencies,” says a statement on the MHT website.

The airline has suspended flights from Portland Airport in Maine and will end all its West Coast flights in October.

Reporting on early September protests at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Travel and Tour World said there is a “growing national movement aimed at drawing attention to the role of airlines in facilitating deportation flights. Across the United States, similar protests have been staged targeting airlines involved in deportation activities. The movement has garnered increasing support, with more protests expected in the coming weeks.”

The online publication, which calls itself, “the premier digital B2B [Business-to-Business] integrated media platform in the travel and tourism industry,” added, “As the focus on deportation flights intensifies, the question of the ethical responsibilities of airlines operating in the U.S. continues to be a point of contention. These protests have brought to light the increasing desire among travelers and tourism stakeholders for more transparency and accountability in the way airlines collaborate with government agencies on sensitive issues like immigration and deportation.”

Avelo passengers I spoke with inside the terminal were unaware of the airline’s connection to ICE flights. One, a Durham resident named Matt, said he would consider joining the boycott.

Jade Curtis, a resident of Dover who was outside the terminal with a sign reading, “No Human Being is Illegal,” said she had been unaware of the Avelo-ICE connection until recently. “As soon as I heard about it I was definitely on board to come down here and protest it and make more people aware.”

Avelo’s deportation flights have also drawn the concern of the Association of Flight Attendants, which represents Avelo workers. In a September 18 letter to Avelo’s CEO, the union president, Sara Nelson, said, “Our Union and the Avelo flight attendants we represent have grave concerns about safety on Avelo flights flown for the Department of Homeland Security to deport detainees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE flights). Based upon reports we are receiving from our members, Avelo is not following FAA safety requirements.

“Recent press reports have documented how ICE flights by other airlines have not accounted for passenger safety in the event of an emergency,” Nelson’s letter continued. “Flight attendants were not trained on evacuation of restrained passengers, and were discouraged or prohibited from performing safety checks and cabin walk-throughs required by the FAA. No modifications were made to the aircraft cabin to ensure restrained passengers could be evacuated in an emergency. No protocols were developed to apply FAA safety rules such as requirements for emergency row exits. Unfortunately, these issues are now occurring on Avelo ICE flights.”

An Avelo flight on September 5 appears to be the most recent immigrant transfer flight from Portsmouth, according to local activists who have been monitoring the airport. They say it was carrying 30 people.

In its latest ICE Flight Monitor, Human Rights First reported, “Since taking office on January 20, 2025, the Trump administration has pursued an unprecedented mass deportation agenda. U.S. officials have adopted a range of new tactics to achieve this objective, including expanding the use of expedited removal, sending people from the United States to offshore detention facilities in the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo, terminating protected legal statuses, disappearing people without due process including to a high security prison in El Salvador, and forcibly transferring individuals to other countries of which they are not citizens. These actions, many of which have been determined to be unlawful by federal courts, have been carried out with little to non-existent transparency, while thousands of people’s lives are uprooted from communities across the country and their rights are systematically violated.”

“Before removal, individuals are often moved repeatedly between ICE detention centers and staging facilities via domestic ‘shuffle flights.’ These frequent transfers not only disorient individuals but also make it significantly harder for them to access legal counsel and maintain contact with family. Between January 20 and August 31, 2025, the Trump administration carried out at least 4,422 shuffle flights—a 43 percent increase from the same period in 2024—including a monthly record of 805 flights in August 2025 alone. Among them were at least 81 flights to offshore detention facilities at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay Naval Base—six of which occurred in August. At the military base, individuals are detained thousands of miles from the United States and face abuse and mistreatment.”

Reports of inhumane conditions in ICE detention facilities as well as those run by private prison companies continue to reach the American public. “Children, including the very young, have been spending weeks or months in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in a remote part of Texas where outside monitors have heard accounts of shortages of clean drinking water, chronic sleep deprivation and kids struggling for hygiene supplies and prompt medical attention, as revealed in a stark new court filing,” The Guardian reported on September 28.

Manchester-Boston Regional Airport is owned by the City of Manchester and is governed by a public board with members appointed by the City and the Town of Londonderry. Jimmy Trinh from Southern NH DSA said, “I think our next actions are going to be focused on pushing changes at the municipal level to keep them [Avelo] from returning to MHT.”",https://indepthnh.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Avelo-protesters-outside-MHT-1170x780.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:59:08.929228

Mexico City. Labor and migrant advocacy organizations from seven Latin American countries and the United States deliberated this Sunday to call for “unity among the continent’s governments against the imperialist policies” of President Donald Trump, which also includes the defense of Venezuela. They agreed to convene a Continental Day of Action for the Right to Migrate in all countries of the hemisphere during the second week of March 2026.

The announcement came at the conclusion of the Continental Conference For the Rights of Migrants and National Sovereignty held in Mexico City on September 27 and 28 at the headquarters of the National Union of Workers of the Metropolitan Autonomous University (SITUAM). This conference brought together 120 representatives from various organizations working with migrant populations.

“Resistance against Trump’s policies is growing in the United States, as seen in the street demonstrations. In Panama, the people are fighting to defend the Canal. In several countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, people are fighting against imperialist interference and its agents, like Bolsonaro and his generals. In other cases, such as Ecuador, Peru, and Argentina, they are fighting against puppet regimes. These are expressions of the same cause: the defense of national sovereignty. The fight for the right to migrate is part of the fight for workers’ rights and human rights,” they stated in a statement.

They also acknowledged that Presidents Lula Da Silva (Brazil), Claudia Sheinbaum (Mexico), Gustavo Petro (Colombia), Nicolás Maduro (Venezuela) and Xiomara Castro (Honduras) have vigorously spoken out in defense of migrants, but “until now each one acts on their own, and the adversary is too strong to confront individually, when what is desirable is the unity of the continent’s governments against imperialist policies.”

The meeting addressed the increasingly restrictive conditions of U.S. immigration policies, particularly under the Donald Trump administration.

“Imperialist policy is the main cause of forced migrations driven by free trade policies, ‘structural adjustments,’ the ‘War on Terror,’ and the ‘War on Drugs,’ which displace populations and are systematically used against national sovereignty. In this regard, French colonialism, still present in the Caribbean, has a complementary effect, suffocating peoples seeking independence.”

“The most striking case of aggression today is against Venezuela, with economic attacks, lethal attacks on vessels, and threats of military intervention. We call for the unconditional defense of our sister country,” they stated.

They also highlighted the effects of these measures on migrant communities in Latin America and the Caribbean, which in January 2025 reached a record high of 53 million people, equivalent to 15.8% of its total population, while in 2023 the number of unauthorized immigrants reached 14 million, mainly from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.

The participants called on the region’s governments to coordinate policies for migrant reception, job placement, and healthcare, emphasizing that, to date, each country has acted individually in response to a continental phenomenon.

The impacts of economic, trade, and security policies that have led to forced displacement and mass migration were also discussed, as well as the need for Latin American governments to articulate a common position regarding these structural causes.

Since the early 2000s, demand for specialized workers has far outstripped a cap that remains where it stood when the H-1B program started in 1990.

But the employers that profit the most from H-1B workers — including workers who are relatively low-paid — would still have an incentive to request visas.","After the White House’s startling changes to the nation’s high-skilled visa program, employers have moved from shock to acceptance.

Some are strategizing how to work with the new rules. Others are making plans to litigate. And many wish the Trump administration had heeded the piles of ideas to fix the program’s central, widely acknowledged failing.

Since the early 2000s, demand for specialized workers has far outstripped a cap that remains where it stood when the H-1B program started in 1990. The government allocates the visas randomly, and outsourcing companies have learned to flood the system with applications for relatively low-paid positions.

The Trump administration said it wanted to stop that practice and reserve the coveted visas for the most valuable workers so they do not displace American software programmers, researchers and engineers. The solutions the administration chose — a $100,000 fee for new visas and a complex weighting system to favor higher-paid jobs — are unlikely to accomplish that.

Instead, loopholes appear likely to allow outsourcing companies to adapt while start-ups, universities and research organizations lose out, according to experts from across the political spectrum.

“Something that addresses the right problem and sounds good on paper can still lead you down the exactly same problematic road,” said John Lettieri, president of the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank that has studied the H-1B program.

‘A really high barrier’

Any comfort that might have come from certainty about the administration’s long-awaited action was erased by the likelihood of legal challenges to the new rules. A provision for exemptions based on the “national interest” — which the White House suggested it might grant to doctors, for example — has kept workers and employers hoping for clemency.

“They want to create a really high barrier that gives them discretion to bring people to them to make a deal,” Mr. Lettieri said.

Immigration officials aggressively denied H-1B applications in Mr. Trump’s first term, but the support of tech leaders including Elon Musk raised hopes that Mr. Trump might look more favorably on foreign talent now.

The H-1B is America’s largest visa category for workers with specialized skills. The annual limit is 85,000, and employers that aren’t subject to the cap — including nonprofit universities and hospitals — usually expand the total by at least 50 percent. The visa can be extended for up to six years, or longer if the worker has a pending green card application. In 2019, the last year the Department of Homeland Security provided data, there were about 583,420 H-1B visa holders in the United States.

Almost since its inception, the program has been plagued with instances of employers who substituted foreign visa holders for American workers and paid them less. In the early 2000s, the federal government embraced a lottery to allocate scarce visas, with no mechanism to elevate exceptional talents over more run-of-the-mill workers.

Despite the program’s shortcomings, economists have generally found that H-1B visa holders boost American productivity and raise wages even for American workers. Politicians and policy experts on both sides of the aisle have called for changes to maximize the program's value.

“It’s all random chance, which is insane for a program that should be our flagship high-skilled immigration program,” said Jeremy Neufeld, director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress.

Some possible fixes

To squeeze more benefits from the system, Mr. Neufeld has proposed ranking applications by compensation, so that only the highest-paid workers would be assured visas. Alternatively, the government could devise a points system — similar to Canada’s — that would capture other desirable characteristics such as youth and language skills that aren’t reflected in compensation. Policymakers could also reduce abuse by awarding more green cards, which allow workers to switch jobs for better offers.

Some solutions would require congressional action. Lawmakers have proposed fixes like requiring employers to look harder for domestic applicants before recruiting outside the country, or banning layoffs of workers who are replaced by visa holders. They have also considered more targeted measures to crack down on wage suppression by outsourcing companies. The Biden administration finalized a rule in its last days allowing for tougher oversight.

The $100,000 fee, however, came out of nowhere.

“Up until this weekend, business felt aligned with the Trump administration on the need to modernize the H-1B program,” said Jennie Murray, president of the National Immigration Forum, which helps companies integrate their foreign-born workforces and pushes for immigrant-friendly policies.

The White House said the fee would ensure that employers only submit petitions for workers they need so much that they’re willing to pay an extra $100,000 to get them. But the employers that profit the most from H-1B workers — including workers who are relatively low-paid — would still have an incentive to request visas.

“If they keep the H-1B worker for six years, it’s a worthwhile investment,” said Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the labor-aligned Economic Policy Institute.

The largest tech companies could afford the fees, improving their chances in a crapshoot that right now gives them only one in five odds. And the fee is only required for people applying from outside the United States. It is easier for multinational corporations to bring their desired workers into the country on other visa types before transferring them to an H-1B, allowing them to skip the fee. More than half of H-1Bs are granted to people who are already in the United States.

“Primarily, we’ll see small businesses being locked out of the program,” said Cecilia Esterline, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, a think tank. “It’s kind of incoherent.”

A small edge for higher-paid jobs

The other major element of the changes to the H-1B program comes from a proposed rule that would take effect after several months of comment and review. It is intended to give higher-paid positions an edge in the lottery. But rather than ranking them by compensation, it would tie the lottery to four wage thresholds based on occupation and region, giving additional weight to the higher wage levels.

That means a relatively well-compensated worker in a less lucrative profession — like journalism or nursing — could have a better shot than a recent college graduate entering a highly paid field with the potential to earn much more in the future. Employers would still be able to bring people in at the lowest wage levels, which an earlier version of the rule proposed in 2020 would have effectively prevented.

“The whole point — which I emphatically agree with — is to select high-wage H-1B workers,” said George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, which pushes for more restrictive immigration policy. “This would undermine the basis for the entire rule.”

Todd Schulte, the president of the pro-immigration group FWD.us, favors a simple wage floor that would ensure that the visas go only to the highest-paid workers. The median annual compensation of H-1B holders is $120,000. One approach would be to cut out everyone below that level.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/30/business/00h1b-mess/00h1b-mess-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:58:29.133399

Doctors Without Borders says it has been forced to suspend activities in Gaza City. The group’s emergency coordinator in Gaza, Jacob Granger, said, “We have been left with no choice but to stop our activities as our clinics are encircled by Israeli forces.”

Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled Gaza City but say there is nowhere safe to go. This is Rami Al-Hassi, who lost a leg in an Israeli attack. He spoke as he attempted to flee Gaza City on foot.

Rami Al-Hassi: “I am walking from Beach camp since yesterday 6 a.m. I got the artificial leg recently, and I can’t walk for long. I arrived at 10 p.m. to another place.

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with President Trump at the White House today. It’s his fourth trip there since Trump returned to office in January. They are expected to discuss a 21-point U.S. plan for ending the war in Gaza. One U.S. proposal calls for installing former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as the head of a transitional authority to rule Gaza. On Sunday, Netanyahu met in New York with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who once called Gaza’s waterfront property “very valuable.”

On Friday, Netanyahu addressed the United Nations and vowed to “finish the job” in Gaza.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “But we’re not done yet. The final elements, the final remnants of Hamas are holed up in Gaza City. They vow to repeat the atrocities of October 7th again and again and again, no matter how diminished their forces. That is why Israel must finish the job. That is why we want to do so as fast as possible.”

Netanyahu spoke to a largely empty room at the U.N. after over 100 diplomats from more than 50 countries walked out in protest. Thousands also protested Netanyahu outside the United Nations, with many calling for him to be arrested for war crimes.

In Israel, hostage families also held protests. This is Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan has been held in Gaza for nearly two years.

Einav Zangauker: “I’m looking you in the eyes, Netanyahu. If you come back without an agreement, a hell awaits you here that you cannot even imagine. The protests and strikes of the past weeks will seem like child’s play compared to what I’m preparing for you. If you sabotage the agreement again, we will chase you until the end of time. You will not have a single moment of peace.”

The Trump administration revoked the visa for Colombian President Gustavo Petro after he joined a pro-Palestinian protest outside the United Nations in New York. During the protest, he called for an international force to end Israel’s genocide. He also urged U.S. troops to disobey orders from President Trump.

President Gustavo Petro: “The global force has to be bigger than that of the United States. That’s why, from here, from New York, I ask all the soldiers of the Army of the U.S. not to point their guns at people. Disobey the orders of Trump. Obey the orders of humanity.”

After the U.S. revoked his visa, Petro wrote online, “Revoking it for denouncing genocide shows the U.S. no longer respects international law.”

NBC News is reporting that U.S. military officials are drawing up options to possibly launch drone strikes inside Venezuela. In recent weeks, the U.S. has attacked several boats in the Caribbean that officials claimed were carrying drugs. On Friday at the United Nations, Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto accused the U.S. of targeting Venezuela in an effort to steal Venezuela’s oil and gas.

Yván Gil Pinto: “Today the aggression is aimed at Venezuela, a peaceful and supportive country like Venezuela. It cannot be accused of having weapons of mass destruction or nuclear weapons. Today the United States invents vulgar and perverse lies that no one believes, neither in the United States nor in the world, to justify an atrocious, extravagant and immoral military threat. That is why we once again thank world public opinion and that of the United States, the governments and peoples of the world, the denunciation of this attempt to bring war to the Caribbean and South America in order to promote a regime change that would allow them to steal Venezuela’s incalculable oil and gas wealth.”

The state of Oregon has sued the Trump administration after President Trump directed troops to be deployed to Portland, the state’s largest city. In a social media post, Trump said the troops are needed to “protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.” Trump added, “I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.” Oregon Governor Tina Kotek denounced Trump’s call for troops.

Gov. Tina Kotek: “There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security, and there is no need for military troops in our major city. … We do not need or want federal troops in Oregon stoking fear, creaking conflict and, frankly, escalating a situation that is under control. Any, any federal takeover with military troops in our state is a threat to communities across Oregon.”

President Trump confirmed that he will be attending a meeting of the country’s top generals and admirals ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, scheduled for tomorrow. The orders provided no reason for the unusual and unprecedented event. Eugene R. Fidell, a military law expert at Yale Law School, told The Washington Post that the last-minute meeting “should be tremendously concerning to the American people.” Earlier this year, Hegseth called for a 20% reduction of four-star generals and fired more than a dozen senior military officials. It comes as the White House has recently renamed the Department of Defense as the Department of War.

The Supreme Court ruled Friday to allow the Trump administration to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid that had been approved by Congress. The court’s three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing, “The stakes are high: At issue is the allocation of power between the executive and Congress.” A lawyer who represents the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, which sued the Trump administration, said that the ruling “will also have a grave humanitarian impact on vulnerable communities throughout the world.” Meanwhile, the conservative majority on the court warned that their decision was a temporary one and “should not be read as a final determination on the merits.”

In international news, Russia launched nearly 600 drones and more than 40 cruise missiles at Ukraine, hitting Kyiv and other cities over Saturday night and into Sunday morning. The onslaught killed at least four people and wounded at least 70. It comes as Bloomberg reports that British, French and German envoys privately warned Russia that NATO members would shoot down any Russian aircraft violating European airspace. On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine had received a Patriot defense system from Israel and that two more systems would arrive in the fall.

Missouri’s governor signed into law Sunday a new Trump-backed congressional map designed to flip a seat in Kansas City currently held by Democrats over to the Republicans. The seat is held by Democratic Congressmember Emanuel Cleaver, and the new map reduces the number of Black and minority residents in Cleaver’s district. At least three lawsuits have been filed in Missouri contending that the map is illegal since it takes place outside the usual once-in-a-decade cycle for redrawing congressional maps. It comes as Texas approved a new congressional map earlier this year that would flip five Democratic-leaning seats.

Assata Shakur died in Havana on Thursday at the age of 78. Shakur was a legendary figure within the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army. Shakur was convicted in the May 2, 1973, killing of a New Jersey state trooper during a shootout that left one of her fellow activists dead. She was shot twice by police during the incident. In 1979, she managed to escape from jail and later fled to Cuba, where she received political asylum. She long proclaimed her innocence. We will hear Assata in her own words later in the show.

September 29, 2025 9:35 am

RICHMOND, VA – Dr. Badar Khan Suri’s legal team on Friday urged the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the lower court’s rulings that ordered his release on bail.

Dr. Suri is a postdoctoral scholar from India at Georgetown University’s Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding focused on peace and conflict resolution. He is married to a Palestinian-American U.S. citizen and is the father of three young children, all of whom are U.S. citizens. On the basis of a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Dr. Suri somehow poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy, the government canceled Dr. Suri's visa, arrested him outside his home, and then transferred him to five different ICE facilities across three states, before leaving him in a Texas detention center thousands of miles away from his wife and children for months. His time in detention left him scarred both physically and emotionally, and recently he had to get a tooth extracted due to lack of dental care while detained.

“My children need me, my wife needs me, my academic community and students need me, and my research requires my full focus. I humbly submit that I should not be punished for something I did not do, nor should I be made a tool for political gains—whether by the groups who initiated these attacks or by those who amplified the smear campaigns against me,” said Dr. Suri.

“Throughout my career, I have been a small but consistent voice for the inalienable rights of oppressed people facing occupation and inhumane practices. I have done so out of a sense of justice and humanity, and I intend to continue in that spirit. I firmly believe that there is nothing wrong in standing for human dignity and compassion.

“I place my faith in this honorable court, with the hope that my rights will not be suspended, that justice will prevail, and that I will remain free to fulfill my responsibilities to my family, my students, and my community.”

The Trump administration is now asking the court to permit it to redetain Dr. Suri because, it says, the district court had no jurisdiction to consider his case in the first place. This comes months after the district court in Virginia ruled that Dr. Suri’s habeas case alleging violations of his constitutional rights may remain in Virginia, and shortly thereafter, released him on bail.

“Dr. Badar Khan Suri should never have been detained,” said Noor Zafar, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “The government’s argument essentially boils down to the sweeping assertion that it can use immigration laws to silence speech it disagrees with and no federal district court has authority to review the constitutionality of its actions. This dangerous and unprecedented argument not only chills Dr. Suri’s and his family’s speech but that of other noncitizens who seek to speak up in support of Palestinian rights. We are asking the court of appeals to reject this frightening proposal.”

This is not the first case in which the Trump administration has made extreme arguments about federal court jurisdiction. A federal court already ruled against the Trump administration when it found that it can review former Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil’s First Amendment claims challenging his arrest and detention. Another federal court ruled against the Trump administration when it ordered the release of Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi on bail back in June. And yet another federal court ruled against the Trump administration when it ordered Tufts student Rümeysa Öztürk to be transferred back to Vermont from Louisiana and released on bail.

Dr. Suri is challenging his arrest and detention under the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act. He is represented in his federal lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Virginia, the Center for Constitutional Rights, the HMA Law Firm, and the Immigrants and Non-Citizens Rights Clinic at the CUNY School of Law.

Della Valle was detained by Customs and Border Protection on Christmas Day 2024, heading to St. Thomas to vacation with his family.
Supporters say Della Valle first fled cartel violence in Mexico as a teenager.
""Carlos is an important member of our community,"" said Jason Gill, a pastor in Downingtown who is friends with the Della Valles.
""Thank you for all you have done and continue to do,"" Della Valle said in a recorded message.","More than 100 people filled Valley Forge Presbyterian Church in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, on Sunday for a bilingual rally and vigil supporting Carlos Della Valle, a longtime Downingtown resident who is being held in immigration custody.

Della Valle has lived in Chester County since 1997. It was there that he met his wife Angela, and together, they raised their son Alessandro. Della Valle was detained by Customs and Border Protection on Christmas Day 2024, heading to St. Thomas to vacation with his family. His family says he was released on bail within a week, but taken back into custody in August after his case shifted to the immigration system. His family says he is now being held at a detention facility in Louisiana.

Supporters say Della Valle first fled cartel violence in Mexico as a teenager. His sister-in-law, Deanna Brown, told CBS News Philadelphia he was caught in Colorado at age 19, when federal officials had him sign a document agreeing not to return. She said he did not have a translator at the time and did not understand what he was signing.

""He did not speak English, so he signed this piece of paper not knowing what it was,"" Brown said. ""And then they deported him, and he came right back, because he knew that he was trying to escape crime and poverty.""

Brown added that although he illegally re-entered the U.S., Della Valle has since built what she called an honest life, working steadily, paying taxes and raising a family in Chester County.

""Carlos belongs here,"" she said. ""He may not have that citizenship in paper — but through and through, he loves his country.""

Speakers alternated in English and Spanish during the two-hour event, urging attendees to write to lawmakers and contribute to a legal fund for the family. Supporters also heard a brief recording of Della Valle's voice from detention.

""Carlos is an important member of our community,"" said Jason Gill, a pastor in Downingtown who is friends with the Della Valles. ""The community deeply believes it's important for him to be here.""

The rally followed a similar event last week in Downingtown. Family members say the uncertainty is devastating but expressed gratitude for the outpouring of community support.

""Thank you for all you have done and continue to do,"" Della Valle said in a recorded message. ""Thanks again.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/29/2aabe876-4050-4ee5-ae3a-7e6c3325803e/thumbnail/1200x630/74c04402ae74e85ec12c51514898a0a6/snapshot-4.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:59:27.524066

Advocates express concern Activists have responded with concern that Illinois sheriffs would cooperate with ICE in violation of the TRUST Act.","CHICAGO — As the U.S. government escalates immigration raids in Illinois and nationwide, some Illinois sheriffs are expressing support and a desire for greater cooperation with federal immigration enforcement despite state laws that limit their involvement.

A survey of Illinois sheriffs by the Medill Illinois News Bureau for Capitol News Illinois revealed that over two-thirds of those who responded are frustrated by the state law and would favor repeal or changes. A few described actions that appear to conflict with state restrictions.

“What are they going to do to you?” Adams County Sheriff Anthony Grootens asked regarding the consequences of violating state law. “Are they gonna have me lock myself up in my own jail?”

The Illinois TRUST Act, signed in 2017 by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, and the Illinois Way Forward Act, signed in 2021 by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, limit sheriffs’ involvement in civil immigration enforcement. Under state law, local officers may not hold someone for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, grant agents access to jails or share nonpublic information unless there is a federal criminal warrant or court order.

The Medill Illinois News Bureau and Capitol News Illinois sought to survey Illinois sheriffs about how they perceive their roles in immigration enforcement. Of the 102 Illinois sheriffs, 28 responded to reporters or answered survey questions electronically. Medill Bureau reporters reached out to unresponsive sheriffs at least three times over several months by phone, mail, email and sometimes in person.

Sheriffs surveyed come from geographically diverse regions of the state, although the state’s 21 northernmost counties, aside from Cook County, did not respond. Sheriffs’ views varied widely. Some said they had no opinion due to their county’s lack of immigration activity. Others said they favor repealing or revising state limits to allow more cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Grootens — who formerly worked for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration — said, in his opinion, sheriffs are “obligated” to cooperate with federal immigration agents, and any state laws contrary to that violate federal law.

“It’s kind of like when you’re in the military, you don’t follow illegal orders,” Grootens said.

Contrary to Grootens’ interpretation of the law, legal scholars and a federal judge have cited the precedent set in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1997 ruling in Printz v. United States to note that the federal government cannot compel state and local officers to administer federal programs.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul reiterated the legality of the TRUST Act in a statement, noting that his office is currently reviewing potential violations but “will not conduct any investigations in the media.”

“The courts have spoken on the constitutionality of the TRUST Act, and my office has successfully defended the law in court against multiple challenges. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has made clear that the Supremacy Clause does not preempt the TRUST Act,” Raoul said. “Any law enforcement officer or agency that unilaterally declares that the TRUST Act violates the Supremacy Clause, contrary to the courts’ rulings, is wrong.”

The Pew Research Center estimated in 2023 that roughly 550,000 people were living without legal status in Illinois, making the stakes of local law enforcement cooperating with ICE high.

Of the 28 responding sheriffs, 25 said they recognized the state law as binding, while three said they have or would cooperate with ICE. But 17 of the sheriffs who recognized the law as binding also expressed reservations, confusion or disagreement with its purpose. Some expressed support for the mission of ICE, while acknowledging that they have limited scope to cooperate with the agency.

“I’ve got no problem getting on the news and supporting what ICE is doing,” Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Bullard Sr. said. “We believe in what they’re doing.”

Bullard said he would not break the law to work with ICE but hoped lawmakers or the courts would overturn the TRUST Act so that he could do so legally.

Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said the “underlying premise” of the Trust Act is to build trusting relationships with immigrant communities and help them feel safe that they can come forward to report suspected criminal activity.

“Local police cooperation with ICE, on the other hand, discourages immigrant victims and witnesses of criminal activity from coming forward, driving wedges between local police and immigrant communities that damage public safety for everyone,” Tsao said.

Opponents argue the law shields immigrants from federal enforcement and puts communities at risk. The Illinois Sheriffs’ Association has long opposed the TRUST Act.

“The ISA has consistently opposed legislative efforts to restrict local involvement in federal immigration enforcement. Our position remains that local agencies should retain the discretion to cooperate with federal authorities when public safety is at stake,” the association said in a statement.

What the sheriffs shared

The survey asked Illinois sheriffs:

Whether they regard immigration enforcement as solely a federal responsibility or one shared with local law enforcement.

Whether they had observed any increased ICE presence in their county.

Whether they had received requests for cooperation from ICE, including access to databases, facilities or people in custody.

Whether they did or would comply with those requests.

About their opinions on the TRUST Act.

Responses fell along a spectrum, and reporters organized them into four primary categories — from sheriffs who steadfastly support the act to those who feel it shouldn’t be followed.

Follow TRUST Act, echoed bill rationale

These sheriffs include: Dustin Heuerman (Champaign) and Ronnie Stevens (Fayette).

Sheriffs in this category said they comply fully with the TRUST Act and would not cooperate with ICE detainers or other requests for assistance, as limited by state law. They also drew a distinction between civil and criminal code violations, rather than treating immigration as a criminal issue.

These sheriffs said they considered those without legal status in their communities to be law-abiding, hardworking or less likely to report crimes if local law enforcement participated in civil immigration enforcement — echoing the rationale behind the bill.

“Undocumented immigrants are less likely to do that (report crime) if they feel their citizenship status will be requested or they may be deported,” Champaign County Sheriff Dustin Heuerman wrote. “I have tried to make it very clear to the immigrant community that citizenship status does not matter to my deputies — just crimes against the Illinois Compiled Statutes.”

Fayette County Sheriff Ronnie Stevens said he did not think those in his community would be less likely to report crimes without the TRUST Act. At the same time, he didn’t see a need for those without legal status, a civil issue, to be considered potential criminals.

“I’ll be quite honest with you, we know quite a few of those are probably here illegally, but they don’t cause no problems,” Stevens said in an interview. “I mean, granted, the federal government says they are (breaking laws), but on the criminal side of it, they are pretty law-abiding. They stay pretty low key, and they stay in the residences usually at night.”

Both sheriffs referenced the TRUST Act unquestionably as the law. Stevens said he “absolutely would not allow” ICE access to his facilities or databases.

“What I think about the Trust Act doesn’t matter. It is the law,” Heuerman wrote.

Follow TRUST Act, expressed no opinion

These sheriffs include: Justin Oliver (Brown); Bruce Kettelkamp (Christian); Thomas Dart (Cook); William Rutan (Crawford); Chad Howard (Perry), and Richard Watson (St. Clair).

Sheriffs in this category said they comply fully with the TRUST Act, but either had no opinion or declined to share it. In some cases, adherence to the TRUST Act was not an active choice, but simply the reality of living in a small, rural area with little to no immigration activity.

Several of these sheriffs reported they’ve had no ICE presence for many years and said immigration enforcement does not impact them. Brown County Sheriff Justin Oliver, for example, said he had not engaged with ICE in around 10 years. Crawford County Sheriff William Rutan, who has served since he was initially elected in 2014, similarly said he had never spoken with ICE agents about anyone in his community.

Rutan emphasized his intention to uphold the law both for those with legal status and those without it. “The only thing that I’m concerned with is people who’re breaking the law as far as hurting people in my community,” Rutan said.

Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said he would adhere to the state laws. “We follow the legislation that says, if they’re not being held for a local crime, then that’s up to the federal government,” Kettlekamp said of immigration enforcement. “I would say, due to the lack of presence currently, it does not affect how we do our daily operations as is.”

Perry County Sheriff Chad Howard said he does not ask or retain information about citizenship status and would not provide ICE access to databases, facilities or individuals in custody. He declined to comment on what he thought of the TRUST Act.

St. Clair County Lt. Jesse Carmack issued a statement on behalf of Sheriff Richard Watson but declined to participate in the full survey. “The position of the St. Clair County Sheriff’s Office in Illinois is that the immigration laws have not affected us,” Carmack said.

Cook County recently has been at the center of federal actions to deport immigrants, putting tremendous public attention on Sheriff Thomas Dart’s office. The Department of Homeland Security began its immigration enforcement campaign called “Operation Midway Blitz” earlier this month, already resulting in hundreds of arrests in the Chicago area, according to a DHS official.

On Sept. 12, federal agents conducting a traffic stop fatally shot a Franklin Park man who legally immigrated from Mexico, sparking protests and calls for transparency from Gov. JB Pritzker.

Dart’s office responded to questions about the TRUST Act by saying the department “follows the laws of Illinois and does not have an opinion on this matter.”

The response said the sheriff’s office does not ask for or retain citizenship status or allow ICE access to their databases, facilities or people in custody.

Following recent ICE operations targeting individuals detained in the Cook County Jail, DHS accused the jail of not cooperating, consistent with Dart’s response to the survey.

However, an investigation by South Side Weekly found that ICE is able to indirectly access sensitive data through a loophole in the jail’s contract with a system used for notifying crime victims of changes in offender custody status.

Follow TRUST Act, but expressed reservations

These sheriffs include: Kent Martin (Coles); Paul Kuhns (Effingham); Matthew J. Link (Henderson); Jeff Bullard Sr. (Jefferson); Pete Sopczak (Johnson); Shawn Kahl (Macoupin); Wayne Strawn III (Marshall); Nicholas Petitgout (McDonough); Matthew R. Lane (McLean); Mark Oller (Menard); Gary Carroll (Moultrie); David Greenwood (Pike); Randy Kern (Pulaski); Joshua Boedigheimer (Putnam); Andrew Hires (Richland); Martin Edwards (Warren), and Ross Schultze (Washington).

Sheriffs in this category said they comply with the TRUST Act and would not cooperate with ICE detainers or other requests for assistance prohibited under state law. However, these sheriffs also described the TRUST Act as problematic or overly restrictive.

Safety and transparency concerns

A subset of sheriffs surveyed mentioned safety concerns resulting from the TRUST Act, either for the public, for officers or both. McLean County Sheriff Matthew R. Lane and Putnam County Sheriff Joshua Boedigheimer both stated they believed it would be safer for all parties for ICE to collect individuals from the custody of local law enforcement rather than tracking them down in public.

“It’s much safer in my opinion and other sheriffs’ opinions that ICE would be able to take that individual from a jail area rather than trying to find them in public and create more of a situation that may not be necessary,” Boedigheimer said.

The jail handoff also minimizes chances for the public to intercede, he said.

Coles County Sheriff Kent Martin similarly mentioned concerns that sheriffs’ inability to assist could jeopardize the safety of ICE agents. Sheriffs also said the law limits their capacity to manage traffic where ICE is operating or provide ICE with pertinent local information, such as directions or neighborhood dynamics.

Martin said he thought it could lead to somebody getting hurt.

“I don’t understand why we can’t even do anything to assure the safety of our fellow officers,” Martin said. “I don’t understand the logic behind that.”

Warren County Sheriff Martin Edwards and Moultrie County Sheriff Gary Caroll said the inability to talk with ICE hinders their ability to provide accurate information about ICE operations to their communities.

“People call up, they see excitement, they see activity, they want to know what the hell’s going on,” Edwards said. “I wouldn’t know. So again, what good does that do us to operate in the dark?”

Limiting resources

Some sheriffs expressed frustration that they could not cooperate with federal agents on immigration in the way they can work across agencies for other issues.

“I believe that all law enforcement should be able to cooperate with federal law, so I don’t know what the difference would be between federal immigration and a federal warrant for drugs or murder or anything else,” said McDonough County Sheriff Nicholas Petitgout. “We’re held to help them in any other type of criminal enforcement, so for the state of Illinois to tell us that we can’t help them with this specific topic, I don’t agree with it.”

Petitgout said he considered immigration to be a shared responsibility between federal and local law enforcement but said he would not give ICE access to databases, facilities or people in custody, stating that such actions are illegal.

Henderson County Sheriff Matthew J. Link and Warren County Sheriff Martin Edwards similarly mentioned the conflict between state and federal law.

“It’s a frustrating position for us because we do everything in our power to hold criminals accountable and protect our communities, but you have a federal law that says one thing and an Illinois law that says another, and we’re sworn to uphold the constitution of both,” Link said.

For Link and others in this group, the conflict was mostly theoretical — Link said he has never had contact with ICE in 23 years working in law enforcement in the county. Edwards, too, said he had not seen ICE agents in years, but he took issue with the TRUST Act on principle.

Marshall County Sheriff Wayne Strawn III said he did not “personally” agree with the TRUST Act, mentioning the federal government’s responsibility for controlling U.S. borders.

Menard County Sheriff Mark Oller said he would not be interested in proactively seeking out and arresting individuals residing in his county without legal status but said the prohibition on cooperation with federal law enforcement did not sit well with him.

“I wouldn’t see myself being the person to go and shake them (a family) down to see their status, but if it was some kind of a foreign gang or foreign criminal, I would be for protecting the law-abiding people in the area,” Oller said. “It’s just kind of weird where they make a law where you don’t cooperate with federal law enforcement.”

Sheriff Paul Kuhns of Effingham County said he’d like a chance to use ICE and immigration law to remove individuals arrested for other crimes.

“I’m not so concerned about the people that are here working hard, feeding their families, obeying the law,” Kuhns said. “But if I have someone that’s breaking the law or a threat in my community, I should be able to use federal immigration laws and federal enforcement officers to help me deal with that.”

The sentiment was echoed by Macoupin County Sheriff Shawn Kahl.

“I think that if they’re violent criminals and they’re running loose and they have a detainer, we should be able to detain them and hold them until they can be picked up,” Kahl said. “If you’re a violent illegal citizen, you should be arrested. Period.”

The Attorney General’s office stated that the TRUST Act does not prevent local law enforcement from coordinating with federal officers “related to criminal court proceedings or to execute a federal judge’s orders.”

Legislative disconnect

Many sheriffs expressed frustration that they felt legislators did not properly consider their input on the TRUST Act.

“We’re at the table on just about any situation that moves through, but again, it often times feels like we’re not heard or not listened to and they have an agenda and they push it through,” Richland County Sheriff Andrew Hires said.

Hires added that sheriffs’ inability to cooperate with federal immigration officials is “completely wrong” and said it “should be corrected.”

Johnson County Sheriff Pete Sopczak used stronger language when discussing the TRUST Act and its passage by the General Assembly.

“We call things ‘TRUST’ Act and we call it the ‘HOPE’ Act,” Sopczak said. “Springfield doesn’t run the state, Chicago does, and they’ve masterminded the language they use to make everything sound great.”

To Sopczak, the state law does not reflect that ideal.

“They can’t even use our bathroom,” Sopczak said, referring to the prohibition on allowing ICE agents to use facilities or equipment for investigative or immigration enforcement purposes. “It’s sad, is what I think. All law enforcement has to be able to work together.”

Hoping for repeal

Several sheriffs shared a hope that a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in February against the city of Chicago and the state would overturn the TRUST Act. The lawsuit attacked the jurisdictions’ sanctuary laws, claiming they deliberately impeded the work of federal immigration officials.

U.S. District Court Judge Lindsay Jenkins dismissed the lawsuit in July, stating the federal government “may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.”

Prior to Jenkins’ dismissal of the suit, Washington County Sheriff Ross Schultze and Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Bullard Sr. had been confident it would succeed.

“We’re waiting for that to get to the Supreme Court because we’re very sure that the Supreme Court will overturn the TRUST Act and all the sanctuary state policies in this state,” Bullard said in May.

The Justice Department did not amend its complaint by the required August deadline and the case was dismissed with prejudice, according to the court docket. However, Pulaski County Sheriff Randy Kern suggested that he and other sheriffs are working to devise plans to fight the TRUST Act.

“We’re getting a game plan together,” Kern said when asked for clarification.

Have cooperated or would cooperate with ICE

These sheriffs include: Anthony Grootens (Adams); Shannon Bradley (Gallatin), and Jerry Suits (Pope).

Sheriffs in this category said they cooperate with ICE detainers or other requests for assistance, in apparent conflict with the TRUST Act, or would do so given the opportunity. They cited safety concerns or the laws of the federal government as taking precedence over those of the state.

“Whether you’re federal, local, state — whatever level you’re at — I just feel like we all need to work together,” Gallatin County Sheriff Shannon Bradley said.

While Bradley said he has not had communication with ICE, he said he would cooperate with a request from the agency.

Bradley said his office currently asks someone when arrested whether they are a U.S. citizen through a “generic form” the sheriff’s office has used since he has been there, at least 15 years. Asking an individual arrested about citizenship status appears inconsistent with the TRUST Act’s limits on inquiring about immigration status in most contexts.

While Pope County Sheriff Jerry Suits said immigration is not significant in his county and he has not had communication with ICE, he said he would cooperate with a request from the agency.

“We don’t want to break any laws but we want to do the right thing,” Suits said. “I’m going to do whatever it takes to keep Pope County people safe.”

Grootens, the Adams County sheriff, was the only Illinois sheriff who said that he has already cooperated with ICE on a civil immigration matter.

His rationale, he said, is: “It’s not whether they commit a crime here or not, they committed a crime by crossing over into the United States illegally.”

In an apparent violation of the TRUST Act, Grootens said the Adams County Sheriff’s Office has transferred two men into ICE custody this year.

Grootens said he was “obligated” to follow federal law above any state statute, including by cooperating with federal law enforcement. “I don’t think that we can just turn our backs on federal law enforcement.”

While he said he understands Pritzker’s stance and the state’s position, Grootens said he believes the federal government “trumps” it.

Advocates express concern

Activists have responded with concern that Illinois sheriffs would cooperate with ICE in violation of the TRUST Act.

The ACLU of Illinois sued two sheriffs in 2019 — from Ogle and Stephenson counties — for allegedly violating the TRUST Act. Court dockets show that both cases resulted in settlements for the plaintiffs represented by the ACLU.

Edwin C. Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at ACLU of Illinois, said some of the comments by sheriffs in this survey were “deeply disturbing.”

Both the ACLU and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights emphasized the role of the Illinois Attorney General in upholding the TRUST Act.

Raoul said his office has provided guidance to law enforcement about the TRUST Act since its enactment and remains committed to working with agencies to bring them into compliance. But he didn’t comment specifically on whether he’s currently investigating any county.

“We rely on Illinois law enforcement officers to enforce state laws, and we expect that they will comply with those laws – including the TRUST Act,” Raoul said. “The TRUST Act gives my office the responsibility to investigate violations where appropriate.”

Tsao, the senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, called on sheriffs to remember their oath.

“Sheriffs and other law enforcement officers are sworn to uphold our laws,” Tsao said. “They might disagree with some parts of the law, but they must enforce it.”

His previous offences included a 20-month prison sentence in the UK for actual bodily harm and assault by beating.
Court documents showed he had been accused of domestic violence against five women, including his current partner.
The court ruled it would be “unduly harsh” to separate Pinho from his child.","A migrant accused of attacking five of his girlfriends has avoided immediate removal from the UK.

Hamilton Jorge Da Silva Pinho, a Portuguese national, was judged to pose a “risk of serious harm” after he threw an electric heater and a steam mop at a partner, as part of a history of domestic violence.

He also threatened to to hit the woman with a weight and throw acid at her, an immigration court was told, and was subject to a restraining order against another woman.

Despite having being jailed for almost a year, Pinho was allowed to stay in the country by a lower-tier immigration tribunal judge because of the emotional effect deporting him would have had on his child, with whom he did not live.

The Home Office appealed against the ruling and its challenge was backed by an upper tribunal which set aside the case to be heard again.

It is the latest case exposed by court documents in which foreign-national offenders and illegal migrants have won appeals against deportation in the lower courts by claiming it would breach their rights to a family life under article eight of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Pinho entered the UK in 2009 with his parents and was given leave to remain for five years in November 2019. His previous offences included a 20-month prison sentence in the UK for actual bodily harm and assault by beating.

Court documents showed he had been accused of domestic violence against five women, including his current partner. He had also had verbal arguments with his mother.

He had been prosecuted for threatening and abusive words or behaviour, theft, shoplifting, battery and destroying property, and the restraining order to which he was subject will be in place until 2028.

Deportation blocked in 2023

The Home Office sought to deport Pinho in November 2023 but was blocked by the first-tier tribunal.

The court admitted he posed “a medium risk” of harm to children because of abusive drunken behaviour in front of them, but found that this risk had been minimised by restrictions including alcohol monitoring and curfew.

The court ruled it would be “unduly harsh” to separate Pinho from his child. The judge said: “I find that the evidence demonstrates a particularly close relationship and very strong emotional bonds, and that there is a strong likelihood of emotional damage to the child if [Mr Pinho] is deported to Portugal.

“I do not accept that contact via modern means of communication will be any sort of substitute for the regular in-person care and responsibility that [Mr Pinho] provides for his child.

“Overall, I find that, on balance, the evidence demonstrates that the long-term effect of [Mr Pinho’s] deportation on his child would be unduly harsh.”

In its appeal against that verdict, the Home Office claimed Pinho had “failed to accept responsibility for all of his offending”.

It said the first-tier tribunal judge had noted that Pinho had an “entrenched pattern of abusive behaviour toward female partners’ and there was a ‘risk of serious harm to his child, ex-partner and future partners’”.

Pinho’s two-year-old child lived with his mother who was the primary carer. The child was born two months before Pinho was sent to prison. He was released in September 2024.

Judge Helen Rimington accepted the Home Office appeal at an upper-tier tribunal, saying there had been a “procedural error”, with the lower-tier judge “exceeding his powers in considering the human rights appeal”.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/09/29/TELEMMGLPICT000323135567_17591447102710_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7N2CxnJWnYI3tCbVBgu9T0aesusvN1TE7a0ddd_esI.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-09-29 09:57:34.149647

In her Labour conference speech, Shabana Mahmood will outline a series of new conditions migrants have to meet to qualify for indefinite leave to remain.

Under the proposals, legal migrants will have to learn English to a high standard, have a clean criminal record and volunteer in their community to be granted permanent settlement status.

Labour says the policy draws a clear dividing line between the government and Reform UK, which says it would abolish indefinite leave to remain.

Currently, migrants can apply for indefinite leave to remain after five years, giving them the right to live, study and work in the UK permanently.

Labour plans to double the period it takes to gain the status from five years to 10, and a consultation was announced in May as part of a package of plans to cut immigration.

Reform said it would replace indefinite leave to remain with visas that force migrants - including non-EU nationals who already have the status - to reapply every five years.

Labour says this would force workers who have been contributing to the UK for decades to leave their homes and families.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Reform UK's policy was ""racist"" and ""immoral"" in an interview with the BBC.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves echoed his comments on Monday. She told the BBC people in the UK illegally should ""be sent home"" but it was ""quite a different thing"" to deport those living and working in the UK legally.

""Those policies are racist, and we will call them out,"" she added.

In response, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the Daily Express that Labour ""do not believe in border controls"" and said the prime minister's comments were a ""desperate attack"".

Zia Yusuf, Reform UK policy chief, told BBC Breakfast that people have ""perfectly legitimate concerns about immigration"" and ""are smart enough to know if somebody is voting for a policy that Starmer calls racist, what do you think Starmer thinks of you?""

He added that the UK ""should not fund benefits and welfare for foreign nationals"".

Ministers are keen for migrants to prove they have integrated in the UK if they want the settlement status.

That includes meeting conditions such as making National Insurance contributions, not taking any benefits payments and giving back to their communities.

Labour says some foreign nationals could earn earlier settlement, based on their contribution or skills.

The main theme of Labour's conference is taking the fight to Reform UK, which is leading in UK-wide national opinion polls.

In her speech, Mahmood is also expected to say patriotism ""is turning into something smaller, something more like ethno-nationalism"".

Mahmood will argue that ""fair migration"" and secure borders are integral parts of an ""open, generous, tolerant"" country.

She will tell party members ""you won't always like what I do"".

But she will warn them if the Labour government does not succeed, ""working people will turn away from us"" and ""seek solace in the false promises"" from Nigel Farage's party.

Mahmood will also speak about her parents' experience of arriving in the UK, arguing the acceptance of migrants depends on their contribution to local communities.

She will talk about how she was a victim of shoplifting, when she worked behind the counter of her family's corner shop as a child, and why that has motivated her to crack down on theft.

The home secretary will launch a ""winter of action"" scheme in a bid to tackle shoplifting.

The state of Oregon and city of Portland filed a joint lawsuit Sunday against Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over the deployment of the National Guard to the city.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court, calls the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland “heavy-handed” and unlawful.
It also says the move violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from being used for civilian law enforcement.
“Defendants have thus infringed on Oregon’s sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity and National Guard resource,” the lawsuit says.","Officials in Oregon have filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Portland, adding to legal battles against President Trump’s use of troops in major cities.

The state of Oregon and city of Portland filed a joint lawsuit Sunday against Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over the deployment of the National Guard to the city.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court, calls the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland “heavy-handed” and unlawful.

The president, in a post on his Truth Social platform Saturday morning, directed Hegseth to “provide all necessary Troops” to deploy to Portland. The move stems from protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in the city, with Trump claiming the building was “under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.”

The court filing, though, argued that the protests have involved fewer than 30 people in recent weeks and no arrests have been made since mid-June.

“Defendants’ heavyhanded deployment of troops threatens to escalate tensions and stokes new unrest, meaning more of the Plaintiffs’ law enforcement resources will be spent responding to the predictable consequences of Defendants’ action,” the lawsuit states.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek (D), appearing at a press conference alongside state Attorney General Dan Rayfield (D) and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson (D), called the deployment “an abuse of power and a disservice to our communities and our service members,” according to KOIN 6 in Portland.

Kotek also marched with residents in downtown Portland on Sunday, saying in a post on social platform X that “we don’t need military intervention here.”

As governor, Kotek controls her state’s National Guard. The lawsuit alleges that Trump does not have the authority to seize control of the Oregon National Guard under Title 10, Section 12406 of the U.S. Code, which gives the president the capacity to federalize state national guards if the country is facing an invasion or rebellion or the president “is unable with the regular forces to execute the law.”

The lawsuit also says Trump’s order violates the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states that authority not delegated to the federal government is reserved for states. It also says the move violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from being used for civilian law enforcement.

“Defendants have thus infringed on Oregon’s sovereign power to manage its own law enforcement activity and National Guard resource,” the lawsuit says. “Far from promoting public safety, Defendants’ provocative and arbitrary actions threaten to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NBC News that the president’s actions were “lawful” and would “make Portland safer.”

“President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,” she said.

This decision is no surprise for those of us who study the 4th Amendment.
Even if the 4th Amendment doesn’t prevent them, can’t race-based discrimination and police violence often be addressed through civil rights lawsuits?
The recent decision virtually declaring that the 4th Amendment allows police to engage in express racial profiling may not be the final word on the matter.
If the 4th Amendment is to retain meaning, it must be interpreted to constrain — not enable — the racialized policing practices that have become routine in America.","Earlier this month, the Supreme Court rendered obsolete the 4th Amendment’s prohibition on suspicionless seizures by the police. When the court stayed the district court’s decision in Noem vs. Vasquez Perdomo, it green-lighted an era of policing in which people can be stopped and seized for little more than how they look, the job they work or the language they speak.

Because the decision was issued on the Supreme Court’s “shadow docket,” the justices’ reasoning is unknown. All we have is Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s solo concurrence defending law enforcement’s use of race and ethnicity as a factor in deciding whom to police, while at the same time playing down the risk that comes with every stop — prolonged detention, wanton violence, wrongful deportation and sometimes even death. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in her impassioned dissent (joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson): “We should not live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.” But now, we do.

The practical effect of this decision is enormous. It strips away what little remained of the guardrails that prevented police (including agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement) from indiscriminately seizing anyone with only a flimsy pretext.

Now there is no real limit on police seizures. History teaches us that people of color will bear the brunt of this policing regime, including the millions of immigrants who are already subject to police roundups, sweeps and raids.

This decision is no surprise for those of us who study the 4th Amendment. The police have long needed very little to justify a stop, and racial profiling is not new. Yet prior to the Vasquez Perdomo order in most instances, police had to at least articulate a non-race-based reason to stop someone — even if as minor as driving with a broken taillight, not stopping at a stop sign long enough, or walking away from the police too quickly.

Now, police no longer need race-neutral person-specific suspicion (pretextual or real) to seize someone. Appearing “Latino” — itself an indeterminate descriptor because it is an ethnicity, not defined by shared physical traits — along with speaking Spanish and appearing to work a low-wage job is enough, even if you have done nothing to raise suspicion.

Some might believe that if you have nothing to hide there is no reason to fear a police stop — that if you just show police your papers or offer an explanation you can go on your way. Even if that were the case, this sort of oppressive militarized police state — where anyone can be stopped for any reason — is exactly what the 4th Amendment rejected and was meant to prevent.

Moreover, ICE agents and police are not in the business of carefully examining documents (assuming people have the right ones on them) or listening to explanations. They stop, seize and detain — citizens and noncitizens alike. If lucky, some people are released, but many are not — including citizens suspected of being in the country illegally, or individuals whose only alleged crimes are often minor (and the product of poverty) or living peacefully (often for years) in the United States without legal status. And as evidenced by plaintiffs in this case, even if eventually released, a single stop can mean harassment, violence, detention or a life permanently upended.

Even if the 4th Amendment doesn’t prevent them, can’t race-based discrimination and police violence often be addressed through civil rights lawsuits? U.S. Code Section 1983 allows individuals to sue officials who violate their rights. But the reality plays out differently. In a recent decision, this Supreme Court dramatically limited class-action lawsuits, the primary vehicle that would allow widespread relief. The court has created a world in which law enforcement can largely act with impunity under the doctrine of qualified immunity. And there is likely no recourse if a federal official such as an ICE agent violates one’s constitutional rights, as the Supreme Court has sharply limited the ability to sue federal officials for money damages even if they commit a clear constitutional wrong.

The recent decision virtually declaring that the 4th Amendment allows police to engage in express racial profiling may not be the final word on the matter. We hope it isn’t. But longstanding court doctrine had already allowed racial profiling to flourish under the guise of seemingly neutral language of “reasonable suspicion” and “consent.” By allowing a further erosion of the limits on seizures, the Court entrenches a system in which the scope of one’s constitutional rights depends upon the color of one’s skin.

Despite being in the United States legally, according to Santiago’s attorneys, the Trump administration is arguing that it can hold her indefinitely in a not-so-subtle attempt to run out the clock until her status expires and deport her.

Immigration experts warn that the administration’s tactics could be used as a backdoor to expel those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which offers temporary protection from deportation to some formerly undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.

On August 3, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents detained Santiago, 28, at the airport while she was attempting to catch a flight to Austin. Nearly two months later, she’s still being held in an immigration processing facility in El Paso.

“She’s holding on,” said her brother Jose, who wanted to be identified by his first name only in case of retaliation from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. “[But] it’s been over a month, so that takes a toll.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to The Intercept’s request for comment. However, in statements to other media outlets, DHS cited a past arrest for narcotics and trespassing as a reason to keep Santiago detained. However, she was never prosecuted for that arrest due to “insufficient information.”

On Tuesday, federal Judge Kathleen Cardone extended a restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting or removing Santiago to a different facility. However, she did not rule on her release.

A separate judge already terminated the immigration case against Santiago in early September, ruling that she cannot be deported because she has lawful status through DACA.

Despite an immigration judge dismissing Santiago’s case, the Trump administration has refused to release her. “They’re arguing, even though they can’t support it, that they can detain her indefinitely,” said Bridget Pranzatelli, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, who has worked on Santiago’s case.

More troubling still, the 28-year-old community organizer is set to renew her DACA status in 2026. Pranzatelli raised concerns that she won’t be able to renew if she’s still in government custody, putting her status at risk.

“If they keep her in detention until her renewal period comes up and she is unable to renew,” said Pranzatelli, “then they will have de facto terminated her DACA status without going through the processes that are required by the regulations.”

The consequences of this case could extend far past Santiago. “The government holds this position that they are able to initiate removal proceedings against anyone who is not a citizen of the United States,” said Pranzatelli, “and that during the pendency of those removal proceedings, a person can be detained. … That is just not what the law says.”

Immigration experts told The Intercept that the Trump administration is attempting to end protections for Dreamers without the risk of the public outrage that followed President Donald Trump’s attempt to end the program during his first term.

“It’s obvious that they’re trying to evade a public reaction,” said Diana Pliego, a senior strategist at the National Immigration Law Center. “What they’re trying to do is quietly end it, essentially slashing and killing DACA in front of us, one case at a time, one individual at a time.”

According to a tracker launched by a coalition of immigration organizations, including the National Immigration Law Center and United We Dream, nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained within the last year.

“We’re really concerned,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, deputy director of federal policy for the immigrant advocacy organization, United We Dream.

Macedo do Nascimento said that the Trump administration appears to be intentionally going after DACA recipients, who should not ordinarily be targets for deportation.

“There are two cases right now, that we’re aware of, Jean Carlos and [Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira], where ICE showed up to in Paulo’s case, to his mother’s house while he was dropping off his kids, specifically to apprehend him, and then in Jean Carlos’s case, to his own house specifically to detain him,” she said. “So that shows that de-prioritization is not happening anymore.”

They’re trying to “kill DACA by 1,000 cuts,” said Macedo do Nascimento, noting that the administration has been urging Dreamers to “self-deport.”

Santiago’s friends and family told The Intercept that detention has taken a significant toll on her.

“Physically and psychologically, the conditions are extremely dehumanizing,” said Christine Miranda, a close friend and colleague of Santiago’s.

Miranda, who met Santiago a decade ago while working together as organizers, said that Santiago was committed to standing up for her community despite the risks. Now, as she sits in detention, Miranda said that community has shown up to support her, hosting rallies and organizing on behalf of her release.

“She is truly a lifelong community organizer, both at the small scale of connecting with people personally, and the big scale of leading massive actions or rallies or marches,” Miranda said. “She had a lot of personal clarity that fighting for yourself and for others is worth it.”

Santiago’s brother shared similar sentiments. “She was very kind as well, and very compassionate,” said Jose. “That led her to become a community organizer and fight for everyone’s rights, especially the immigrant rights.”

Santiago arrived in the United States when she was only 8 years old from Oaxaca, Mexico. Her brother said it would be “devastating” if his sister were deported. “She’ll be torn away from her community,” he said. “We don’t really have connections in Mexico, so it will be a very harsh reset to life.”

Looking beyond this specific case, Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., said the Trump administration could not be allowed to disappear its critics.

“As authoritarians, Trump, Noem, Miller, and the rest of the Administration are abusing their power to silence dissent. Despite the legal protections for DACA recipients and green card holders, we are witnessing the disappearance of community activists, like Catalina Xóchitl Santiago, who are challenging the rise of fascism in our nation,” wrote Ramirez, in a message to The Intercept. “We have to stand up for Dreamers and immigrants and protect our civil and constitutional rights.”

The sheriff testified that deputies would only screen criminal defendants and not check the immigration status of victims or witnesses.

Local Latino residents testified that the program has created fear in the immigrant community, causing them to alter their daily routines.

A Bucks County judge is expected to decide next month if the sheriff can implement a controversial program that grants county deputies the power to act as federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.

Following a second four-hour hearing Friday, Sept. 26, Common Pleas Court Judge Jeffrey Trauger indicated that he hoped to issue an order before the end of October, ahead of the Nov. 4 general election.

Bucks County Sheriff Fred Harran, a defendant in the lawsuit, is seeking reelection. The Republican incumbent, a retired Bensalem director of public safety, is running against Democratic challenger Danny Ceisler, an attorney and a U.S. Army veteran.

The hearing Friday was a continuation of a Sept. 16 proceeding regarding a lawsuit filed earlier this year seeking to prevent the implementation of the ICE program, known as 287g, which gives local law enforcement agencies authority to enforce immigration law while performing routine duties.

The ACLU of Pennsylvania and the Community Justice Project sued Harran and Bucks County on behalf of immigrant and civil rights organizations. They're seeking a preliminary injunction to halt implementation of 287g until the court decides the lawsuit's merits.

Defendant Bucks County has also filed a cross claim against Harran seeking to nullify the 287g agreement on the grounds that Harran applied for the program without approval from the county commissioners.

The Pennsylvania Sheriffs’ Association, a professional organization, has also filed a claim as an interested party. Bucks County is among 10 county sheriff offices with approved 287g programs, according to the latest federal data.

In a surprise development Friday, Harran’s attorney, Wally Zimolong, produced ICE paperwork that Harran signed July 3. The paperwork appears to limit the scope of powers that Harran and his 16 deputies could exercise under 287g agreement.

These documents were significant because in the earlier hearing Harran testified that he didn't request a modification of the ICE agreement limiting its scope of authority, and that it was unnecessary because he could choose what parts he wanted to follow and ignore the rest.

At the Sept. 16 hearing, Trauger repeatedly urged the parties to reach a compromise limiting the scope of the 287g agreement based on what Harran testified he planned to do, but nothing has materialized.

When Harran was questioned about his previous testimony that he didn't change the agreement, Harran said that he had forgotten about it.

In another new development, Harran testified that ICE recently notified him that the federal government would begin reimbursing local government expenses, including equipment and officer salaries and overtime related to 287g activities.

Previously, the feds only paid for officer training and left local governments responsible for covering all other costs for the program.

Under cross-examination, however, the sheriff said that he would have to apply to seek reimbursement and that this might require approval from county commissioners.

Harran also repeated his assurances that deputies wouldn't be checking the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses or individuals at the Bucks County Justice Centeron civil matters, such as child support or protection from abuse petitions.

But he said they'll screen criminal defendants against names in the ICE database to see if they're wanted for immigration law violations.

Detainer paperwork would be prepared for defendants identified as being in the country undocumented, but the responsibility for issuing the detainer will rest with ICE agents, not deputies, Harran said. If ICE approves a detainer, deputies would transfer the person to a detention facility.

“I know what I’m doing and what I intend to do,” Harran added. “We are not stopping and interviewing, that’s not my job. It’s ICE’s job.”

But what Harran said he'd do under the ICE agreement versus what he's permitted to do under the broad authority of the agreement has surfaced as a recurring central theme in the case before Trauger.

Two Bucks County residents, who are Latino, testified Friday that the looming possibility that county deputies could act as ICE officer has resulted in fear and suspicion within local immigrant communities.

Karen Rodriguez, a member of Make the Road PA, one of the lawsuit plaintiffs, testified that she's changed her behaviors since learning that Harran joined the 287g program, even though she is a U.S. citizen born in Puerto Rico.

She said she's stopped attending festivals celebrating Latino heritage in Bucks County and avoids large group activities.

Rodriguez also testified that she no longer attends a Sunday Spanish-language Mass at a Bristol church fearing that she could be detained in an ICE raid. She added other Latino congregants have stopped attending the Mass.

“The members there have the fear,” she said. “People are terrorized right now.”

Bucks County resident Heidi Roux, a U.S. citizen who was born in El Salvador, testified that she has stopped speaking Spanish in public, and that she is more conscious now about how she dresses.

Recently she also told her son to keep a Spanish language book he's reading at home, fearing it could make him a target for racial profiling.

Roux, the director of immigration justice for The Welcome Project PA, testified that she has received death threats over her vocal opposition for 287g, though she did not report them to local police.

Over the last few months, Roux testified that she met with Harran four times to talk about the 287g program, and to urge him to rescind participation.

Under questioning, Roux described her relationship with Harran as cordial, calling him a “frienenemy."" She also testified that she doesn't believe the sheriff would racially profile her.

“He said I don’t have to worry about it because I look Italian,” Roux said.

But she's less confident about how deputies will interpret the scope of their authority.

“This is not an a la carte menu,” Roux added. “You ordered the whole menu and now you’re only ordering the pancakes.”

President Trump on Saturday said he had directed troops to be sent to Portland, Oregon, and that he authorized the troops to use “full force” to respond to protests around ICE facilities. According to a Pentagon memo to Oregon leaders received yesterday, 200 members of the Oregon National Guard are being placed under federal command and control in connection with the plan. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek (D) said she “made it very clear” to Trump that she objects to the deployment.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

During an extraordinary gathering of hundreds of U.S. generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia, tomorrow, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is planning to address the army leaders on military standards and the “warrior ethos,” according to multiple sources. Trump yesterday said he would attend the meeting, saying that “It’s really just a very nice meeting talking about how well we’re doing militarily, talking about being in great shape, talking about a lot of good, positive things.” According to a former defense auditing official, the likely cost of the army leaders’ travel to the event is in the millions of dollars. Tara Copp, Ellen Nakashima, Dan Lamothe, Alex Horton, and Noah Robertson report for the Washington Post; Yamiche Alcindor and Alexandra Marquez report for NBC News.

Trump on Friday called for Microsoft to “immediately terminate the employment of” Lisa Monaco, Microsoft’s head of global affairs, alleging without proof that Monaco is a “menace to U.S. National Security.” Monaco served as Deputy Attorney General under the Biden administration. Separately, Trump also said he “would certainly imagine” the DOJ is investigating former FBI Director Christopher Wray, whom Trump accused of doing “a terrible job.” Sebastian Herrera reports for the Wall Street Journal; Yamiche Alcindor and Alexandra Marquez report for NBC News.

Tulsi Gabbard’s Office of the Director of National Intelligence last month eliminated the group that writes the Global Trends report. The report, published every four years, outlines the future risks to the United States and the world. The Office said that it found the draft 2025 report to “violate professional analytic tradecraft standards in an effort to propagate a political agenda” and that the group “had neglected to fulfill [its] purpose.” According to former officials, some of the report’s warnings, in particular on climate change, had become politically inconvenient. Julian E. Barnes and Helene Cooper report for the New York Times.

The Energy Department has added “climate change,” green,” “emissions,” and “decarbonization” to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s “list of words to avoid,” according to a Friday email seen by POLITICO. Other words to avoid include “energy transition,” “sustainability/sustainable,” “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy,” “carbon/CO2 ‘Footprint’” and “tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies.” Zack Colman reports.

Laura Meckler and Susan Svrluga report for the Washington Post.

The FBI has fired agents who were photographed kneeling during a 2020 racial justice protest in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police officers, sources told AP News on Friday.

Eric Tucker reports for AP News.

In cooperation with the Justice Department, multiple federal regulators have sent or are about to send requests for information concerning alleged political and religious discrimination by banks to a number of financial institutions, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Gina Heeb, AnnaMaria Andriotis, and Dylan Tokar report.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

New York City Mayor Eric Adams yesterday announced he would abandon his re-election campaign, ending weeks of speculation.

At one point, Trump administration aides had been involved in discussions to offer Adams an administration post to encourage him to leave the race and to counter the Democratic front-runner, Zohran Mamdani. Nicholas Fandos, Dana Rubinstein, William K. Rashbaum, and Maggie Haberman report for the New York Times.

In the years before his death, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was apparently linked to billionaire and former Trump advisor Elon Musk, tech billionaire Peter Thiel, and Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, according to documents published by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Friday. Hailey Fuchs reports for POLITICO.

The Dominion Voting Systems election tech company has settled its defamation lawsuit against Trump’s former lawyer and former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani, according to court records and a statement by Dominion.

Project 2025 publishers, the Heritage Foundation, and their spinoff, the Oversight Project, last week issued a call for the FBI to designate “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism” as a domestic terrorism threat category.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Chinese President Xi Jinping intends to persuade Trump to oppose Taiwanese independence, sources told the Wall Street Journal. The sources said that Xi plans to press Trump on this issue as the United States shows eagerness for a Washington-Beijing trade deal. Lingling Wei reports.

The Taliban administration released U.S. citizen Amir Amiry yesterday following negotiations mediated by Qatar. Amiry’s release comes weeks after the Taliban announced an agreement with the United States on prisoner exchanges. The Taliban continue to hold at least three U.S citizens, a U.S. official told the New York Times. Elian Peltier and Adam Goldman report.

U.S. military officials are drawing up plans to target drug traffickers inside Venezuela, four sources told NBC News. The sources said that U.S. strikes within Venezuela’s border could begin in a matter of weeks. Courtney Kube, Gabe Gutierrez, and Katherine Doyle report.

The Trump administration revoked Colombian President Gustavo Petro’s visa on Friday after he joined a pro-Palestinian demonstration in New York. “Revoking it for denouncing genocide shows the U.S. no longer respects international law,” Petro posted on social media on Saturday. Luis Jaime Acosta and Natalia Siniawski report for Reuters.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

A Biden administration Pentagon plan to field thousands of AI drones by August 2025 to prepare for a potential conflict with China has fallen short of its goal, according to sources.

Smith report for the Wall Street Journal.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The U.N. Committee Against Torture last week sent a request to Ghana to halt onward deportations of at least five migrants who were recently deported from the United States to Ghana. The request highlights that the affected individuals had U.S. court-ordered protections against being returned to their home countries where they face a risk of torture. Mattathias Schwartz and Chris Cameron report for the New York Times.

Attorney General Palm Bondi announced on Friday that she will send Justice Department agents to ICE facilities to protect immigration officials “to safeguard federal agents, protect federal property, and immediately arrest all individuals engaged in any federal crime.” Kaanita Iyer reports for CNN.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

Negotiations over the latest iteration of Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza are “at their final stages,” Trump told Axios yesterday, asserting that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is “on board” with the plan. In a statement, Hamas said that the group has not received any new ceasefire proposals from mediators, and stressed that negotiations have been suspended since Israel’s failed attempt to kill its leaders in Doha three weeks ago. U.S. officials suggested that Arab and Muslim countries have been in touch with the militant group on the proposal. Barak Ravid reports.

Netanyahu will give Israel’s response to the newest U.S. proposal for a Gaza ceasefire when he meets Trump in the White House later today, according to a senior Israeli official. Other Israeli officials suggest Netanyahu is expected to present reservations to the plan during the meeting and push for changes. Netanyahu yesterday said that the deal has “not been finalized yet.” Matt Spetalnick and Steve Holland report for Reuters; Tal Shalev, Oren Liebermann, and Kit Maher report for CNN.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

The Israeli military has killed at least 18 people across Gaza today and advanced to within a few hundred meters of Gaza City’s Al-Shifa and Al-Helo hospitals, according to medics. The Médecins Sans Frontières medical charity late on Friday said it had been forced to suspend its activities in Gaza City after its clinics were encircled by Israeli forces. Nidal Al-Mughrabi and May Angel report for Reuters; Nidal Al-Mughrabi and Alexander Cornwell report for Reuters.

The Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas conflict has now surpassed 66,000 deaths, Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry said yesterday. Samy Magdy, Melanie Lidman, and Giovanna Dell’Orto report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

The vast majority of officials and diplomats gathered at the U.N. General Assembly Hall on Friday appeared to walk out as Netanyahu took the stage for his address. In his speech, Netanyahu said that Israel would “finish the job” in Gaza, and claimed that the Israeli intelligence services were livestreaming his speech to the phones of people across Gaza. Gaza residents told CNN they had not received any messages or streams related to the speech. Barak Ravid and Dave Lawler report for Axios; Tal Shalev, Jennifer Hansler, and Oren Liebermann report.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russia attacked Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities yesterday with nearly 600 drones and 48 missiles, killing at least four people in the capital. “This vile attack came virtually as the close of U.N. General Assembly this week, and this is exactly how Russia declares its true position,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said yesterday. Marc Santora reports for the New York Times; James Waterhouse and Rachel Muller-Heyndyk report for BBC News.

The United States is considering Zelenskyy’s request for long-range Tomahawk missiles, Vice President JD Vance said yesterday. Tomahawk missiles have a 2,500km range, which would allow Ukraine to strike targets deeper inside Russia. Steve Holland reports for Reuters.

Defense ministers from ten EU countries agreed on Friday to develop a drone wall along their borders with Russia and Ukraine to detect, track and intercept drone incursions into European airspace. “Russia is testing the EU and NATO, and our response must be firm, united and immediate,” EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said. Lorne Cook reports for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Moldova’s pro-European ruling party won a majority over the Russia-leaning Patriotic Bloc in yesterday’s parliamentary election. “The people of Moldova have spoken […] they chose democracy, reform, and a European future, in the face of pressure and interference from Russia,” President of the European Council Antonio Costa said on social media. Dan Peleschuk reports for Reuters.

Denmark this week banned all civilian drone flights to “simplify security work” for the police ahead of a European Union summit in Copenhagen, the Danish transport minister said yesterday. Nick Thorpe and Tabby Wilson report for BBC News.

Israel has reintroduced its demand for a humanitarian corridor to Syria’s southern province of Sweida in Israel-Syria security talks, four sources told Reuters. A Syrian source said the demand had derailed plans to announce a deal this week. In previous talks in Paris, Syria rejected this same request as a breach of its sovereignty. Maya Gebeily reports.

The Indian government on Friday detained Sonam Wangchuk, the leader of a popular protest movement in Ladakh, accusing him of instigating violent protests that threatened national security. The protests in Ladakh last Wednesday, associated with Wangchuk’s arrest, called for greater governmental autonomy in the region. Anupreeta Das and Hari Kumar report for the New York Times.

IRAN

The U.N. Security Council on Saturday reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, activating the snapback mechanism. While Tehran has warned of a harsh response to the reimposition of sanctions, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Friday that Iran had no plans to leave the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

Iran’s intelligence service attempted to recruit “hundreds of [Israeli] citizens” via phone calls on Saturday, the Israeli police said in a statement. When they picked up, “a person spoke to them and offered to recruit them to an Iranian organisation.” Dana Karni and Catherine Nicholls report for CNN.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Supreme Court granted an injunction on Friday, allowing the Trump administration to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid previously appropriated by Congress. The majority wrote that based on its “preliminary view” of the case’s merits, the plaintiffs did not have a legal right to bring a lawsuit under the relevant federal statutes. The short, unsigned order on the court’s emergency docket was issued over the dissent of three liberal judges. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

Oregon and Portland yesterday sued to block Trump from deploying the state’s national guard, arguing that the move amounts to an unconstitutional abuse of power. “Far from promoting public safety, Defendants’ provocative and arbitrary actions threaten to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry”, the lawsuit contends. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to uphold Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. In a pair of petitions, the government lawyers argued that the Constitution’s promise of citizenship was conferred on “freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens.” Abbie VanSickle reports for the New York Times.

The local authority lodged its application on Friday (26 September), naming the hotel owners, Somani Hotels Limited, and the Secretary of State for the Home Department as respondents.

The council's application to the Supreme Court followed the Court of Appeal's decision to set aside an interim injunction order made by Mr Justice Eyre.

Lord Justice Bean, who heard the appeal with Lady Justice Nicola Davies and Lord Justice Cobb, said Eyre J had made a ""number of errors of principle"" that undermined his decision.

A separate three-day hearing for the full injunction is scheduled to take place at the High Court between 15 and 17 October.

The council announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court on 5 September.

Commenting on the move at the time, a spokesperson for Epping Forest District Council said: ""We would like to thank the Court for expediting these matters. It is in no one's interest to delay the legal process. The sooner we get to a full resolution the better.""

A coalition of 20 state Democratic attorneys general in May filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the Trump administration is threatening to withhold billions of dollars of disaster-relief funds unless states agree to certain immigration enforcement actions.
In their complaint, states argued that for decades they counted on federal funding to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters.
But they argued conditions put forward by the Trump administration requiring them to commit state resources to immigration enforcement put at risk funding for everything from mitigating earthquake and flood risks to managing active wildfires.
For the remaining programs, the government argued that this was a contract dispute that should be resolved in the Court of Federal Claims.","A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled on Wednesday that it’s unconstitutional to require states to cooperate on immigration enforcement actions to get funding for disasters, which is overseen by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

A coalition of 20 state Democratic attorneys general in May filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the Trump administration is threatening to withhold billions of dollars of disaster-relief funds unless states agree to certain immigration enforcement actions.

In a ruling granting a summary judgment to the plaintiffs and denying one for the federal government, U.S. District Judge William Smith found that the “contested conditions are arbitrary and capricious” and that the actions are unconstitutional because they are “coercive, ambiguous, unrelated to the purpose of the federal grants.”

“Plaintiff States stand to suffer irreparable harm; the effect of the loss of emergency and disaster funds cannot be recovered later, and the downstream effect on disaster response and public safety are real and not compensable,” Smith wrote.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said the ruling was a “win for the rule of law and reaffirms that the President may not pick and choose which laws he and his Administration obey.”

“Today’s permanent injunction by Judge Smith says, in no uncertain terms, that this Administration may not illegally impose immigration conditions on congressionally allocated federal funding for emergency services like disaster relief and flood mitigation. Case closed,” he said.

In their complaint, states argued that for decades they counted on federal funding to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters. But they argued conditions put forward by the Trump administration requiring them to commit state resources to immigration enforcement put at risk funding for everything from mitigating earthquake and flood risks to managing active wildfires.

The Department of Homeland Security “seek to upend this emergency management system, holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage unless States promise to devote their scarce criminal enforcement resources, and other state agency resources, to the federal government’s own task of civil immigration enforcement beyond what state law allows,” the plaintiffs wrote.

They argued successfully that this not only was unconstitutional but that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a law that governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.

“The conditions are arbitrary and capricious under the APA because DHS failed to provide a reasoned explanation, failed to consider the reliance interests of the states, and departed from longstanding funding practices without adequate justification,” Smith wrote.

The government had argued that the challenge was moot since it had already decided to exclude 12 of the 18 programs from having to comply with the immigration requirements. For the remaining programs, the government argued that this was a contract dispute that should be resolved in the Court of Federal Claims.

“Even if that were not so, Congress intended for the FEMA grant programs at issue to address national security and terrorism concerns that rely on the cooperation that the conditions promote,” the government wrote in court documents. “Congress did not preclude the placement of the challenged conditions on the grant programs at issue, and Plaintiffs have not established a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to these programs.”

A spokeswoman for DHS, Tricia McLaughlin, said in a statement Wednesday that the administration believes that “cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding.”

“The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that,” she said.

They include at least 107 career Justice Department senior managers in the span of eight months, out of roughly 320 career leadership positions immediately below presidential appointees included in a government directory.
The Justice Department is simultaneously hemorrhaging many more trial attorneys and other career employees.
At the Justice Department, approximately 4,500 employees, largely non-leadership positions, took deferred resignation offers, according to a June budget report.
In some cases, the Justice Department replaced a departing career manager with a political appointee, according to Bloomberg Law’s analysis.","At least a third of senior career leaders have left the Justice Department since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, taking with them centuries of combined expertise, according to a Bloomberg Law analysis.

The departures, both voluntary and involuntary, represent an unprecedented level of departures in recent memory, former officials said, with the divisions enforcing civil rights, immigration, and environmental laws among the hardest hit.

They include at least 107 career Justice Department senior managers in the span of eight months, out of roughly 320 career leadership positions immediately below presidential appointees included in a government directory.

The loss of so many senior managers, many of whom have spent their entire careers rising through the department’s ranks, could take generations to rebuild. The Justice Department is simultaneously hemorrhaging many more trial attorneys and other career employees.

“You’re talking about an incredible brain drain which doesn’t even take into account all of the other people who have been lost,” said Pamela Hicks, former chief counsel for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who was fired early in Trump’s second term.

Stuart Gerson, who led the Justice Department’s civil division during the George H. W. Bush administration and served as acting attorney general early in Bill Clinton’s presidency, said the departures mean DOJ will “lose both excellence of ability and institutional memory that’s extremely important, both in terms of maintaining credibility in the courts and getting it right.”

The department’s civil rights division, created in 1957 by landmark civil rights legislation to enforce anti-discrimination law, was most impacted. Over 76% of career managers, including members of the Senior Executive Service, departed between the start of the new administration and mid-September, according to Bloomberg Law’s analysis.

The DOJ division enforcing federal environmental laws has lost over half of its career leaders, the analysis shows.

Political appointees routinely change over when new presidents take office. But it’s “almost unheard of” for career members of the Senior Executive Service to leave the Justice Department because of a change in administration, said Stacey Young, who founded Justice Connection, an organization that supports current and former department attorneys.

“There’s no precedent for this,” said Young, a former DOJ lawyer.

A Justice Department spokesperson didn’t return requests for comment.

Refocused Priorities

The exodus comes as the Trump administration has refocused the department on conservative priorities, including surging federal law enforcement resources to major cities and targeting universities for diversity initiatives. It also follows the White House’s January executive order calling to “prioritize accountability” among the Senior Executive Service, who “must serve at the pleasure of the President.”

The high-level turnover tracks what’s happening elsewhere in the department. At the Justice Department, approximately 4,500 employees, largely non-leadership positions, took deferred resignation offers, according to a June budget report.

The administration has also forcibly reassigned or demoted dozens of career managers across the department, prompting many to leave earlier than they’d originally planned. Some longtime career managers were pushed into the so-called sanctuary cities working group, widely viewed as a demotion. The last exiled member of that group left last month.

David McConnell, a veteran career leader who left in February, said departures of this scale are disruptive to the workforce. McConnell retired earlier than he’d planned after he was reassigned to the sanctuary cities group.

“It was certainly destabilizing when I was just suddenly gone when everyone was counting on me being there,” said McConnell, a former director at the Office of Immigration Litigation.

Several senior career leaders who were removed have challenged their terminations. Joseph Tirrell, formerly director of the DOJ’s ethics office, has contested his firing in a Washington federal court, alongside other fired DOJ employees. Former pardon attorney Liz Oyer has lodged a challenge at the federal board that hears civil servant disputes and testified before Congress about her removal.

In some cases, the Justice Department replaced a departing career manager with a political appointee, according to Bloomberg Law’s analysis.

Impacted Divisions

The losses have been felt most acutely in the civil rights division, where nine sections, including those that specialize in civil rights violations in education, employment, and voting, lost their chiefs. A number of deputy chiefs across the division are also no longer at the department, including some after forced demotions.

The departures follow leadership’s decision to pivot the civil rights division’s work to align with the Trump administration’s ideological priorities and away from its traditional advocacy on behalf of historically marginalized groups.

As career leaders have left, so have the trial attorneys working under them. As of July, DOJ disclosed to a Democratic senator that 368 civil rights division employees, including both attorneys and staff, had left during the second administration.

Mikael Rojas, who served in a political role at the division during the Biden administration, said that political appointees in the division “took a lot of our direction from the career staff” to do their jobs.

“They are the subject matter experts,” Rojas said.

The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which houses the immigration courts, saw over 62% of those managers exit since January.

The Justice Department’s tax division has lost more than a third of its career managers under the current administration, while the national security division saw about half depart.

The civil division, whose attorneys have handled much of the litigation against federal policies, has lost at least a quarter of its career managers.

Methodology

The analysis is based on the Office of Personnel Management’s database of leadership-level positions reported under legislation requiring the government to publish a directory of certain executive branch leaders, including Senior Executive Service members and other high-level managers.

Current employment statuses for the individuals listed were verified by reviewing OPM’s information, public LinkedIn posts, news reports, Justice Department webpages, as well as by conducting interviews with current and former employees, as of mid-September. Employees who took the deferred resignation offer, and who are technically on administrative leave through this month, are counted as departures.

OPM relies on individual agencies to report the positions and managers as of June 30, and the directory may omit some career leadership positions that should have been included. The reporting is required under the PLUM Act, passed in late 2022 to increase transparency in government.

The analysis likely represents an undercount as civil servants continue to leave their posts.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/b027bac/2147483647/crop/5000x1927+0+623/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2a%2Fc9%2F2c20cd184c1ba248c1c35b68a166%2F358927359.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:57:55.251166

In June 2017, the Court held that sections 34(1)(b) and (d) of the Immigration Act were unconstitutional in that these provisions:

do not require the detainee to be informed of the right to legal representation;

do not require the automatic judicial review of a detention before the expiry of 30 calendar days;

do not allow the detainee to make oral or written representations to the court, or appear in court in person;

do not permit the detainee to make representations to the court on whether the grounds advanced by an immigration officer meet the standard of good and reasonable grounds; and

deny the detainee the right to challenge the lawfulness of their detention by appearing in court.

The declaration of invalidity was suspended for a period of 24 months and the Court ordered that pending the correction of the defect within 24 months (by 28 June 2019), any illegal foreigner detained in terms of section 34 of the Immigration Act must be brought before a court in person before the expiry of 48 hours from the time. Since then, this has been the position with foreigners being brought before court.

Second Constitutional Court judgment

In October 2023, the Court supplemented and clarified the order in the First Constitutional Court judgment by allowing a detainee to appear before a court in person when a court is considering whether to extend a detention period beyond 30 days, and by introducing the “interests of justice” criterion as a guideline for immigration officers and courts in the exercising of their discretion under the Immigration Act.

The Court ordered that, pending the enactment of remedial legislation within a period of 12 months, and if remedial legislation is not enacted, the following provisions will apply:

an immigration officer must apply the interests of justice criterion when considering the arrest and detention of an illegal foreigner in terms of section 38(1) of the Immigration Act;

a detained person shall be brought before court within 48 hours from the time of arrest;

the court must apply the interests of justice criterion when the arrested person is brought before it;

the court may authorise the further detention of the person if it concludes that the interests of justice do not permit the person’s release;

if the further detention of the person is ordered, they must again be brought before court prior to the expiry of the authorised detention period, and the court must again apply the interests of justice criterion at that stage;

the court may then again authorise the further detention of the person, but by no more than 90 calendar days, if it concludes that the interests of justice do not permit the person’s release; and

whenever the person concerned is brought before court, they must be given an opportunity to make representations to the court.

Agents have been patrolling the Chicago River on boats in recent days, and Sunday were seen walking down one of the city’s busiest streets as increased federal intervention continues in the city.

Footage captured at Millennium Park showed agents interacting with four people - two children and two adults - and placing them in the back of a pickup truck. It remains unclear if they were arrested.

The videos of the masked agents sparked intense reactions on social media, including from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who accused the Trump administration of using “provocative” tactics in continuing to deployed armed agents in the city.

“While Chicagoans and visitors are enjoying another gorgeous Sunday, they are being intimidated and threatened by masked federal agents flaunting automatic weapons for no apparent reason,” he said. “This is another brazen provocation from the Trump administration that does nothing to make our city safer. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as they become available.""

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker echoed similar concerns following the reports.

“This is not making anybody safer — it’s a show of intimidation, instilling fear in our communities and hurting our businesses,” he said. “We cannot normalize militarizing American cities and suburbs.”

In an exclusive interview with NBC News on Sunday, President Donald Trump called Chicago a “crime-ridden mess,” and indicated that he is still considering sending armed troops into the city of Chicago as part of “Operation: Midway Blitz.”

“Any place where there is big trouble, we want to go and help out,” he said.

Trump also said that his administration sent additional FBI resources to the city earlier this year on an “information gathering mission.” He also claimed credit for reductions in crime, though there is no available data tying reduced crime to the presence of FBI agents.

“We sent the FBI in about six months ago on an information gathering mission and that’s what they’ve done and they’ve done a good job,” he said. “They actually brought down crime a little bit in Chicago. But, you know, that was minor compared to what has to be done. But we sent them in five months ago and we brought it down about 20 percent, 25 percent.”

NBC Chicago reached out to Border Patrol for information about if anyone had been arrested on Sunday, but hadn't received a response as of the late evening.

Agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have arrested hundreds of individuals in the city and suburbs in recent weeks as part of an increased effort to deport more individuals who are in the country without legal status.

Protests at a Broadview facility have garnered national headlines, with multiple arrests made and tear gas deployed against activists at the scene.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Saturday that she is sending more federal troops to ICE facilities around the country, with a strong message to protestors.

""If you so much as touch one of our federal officers, you will go to prison,"" she said.

Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker also issued a statement Saturday addressing the Trump administration's plans to send more federal agents to Chicago and other cities, and the ongoing protests in Broadview.

The military should not come to Oregon.” Oregon files suit Oregon Gov.","PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — Tensions rose throughout Sunday as hundreds of protesters gathered at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland one day after President Donald Trump formally announced his intent to deploy federal troops to Portland.

As night fell and the crowd thinned, the tension reached a boiling point. Federal agents engaged protesters and apparently took at least one into custody, although that has not been confirmed. One protester apparently punched another protester, then ran to the police for help as he was chased by the crowd. Bike patrol officers separated some from engaging with each other before vacating the block.

By 10 p.m. the crowd had largely dispersed. Only about 60 people remained from the much larger group just an hour earlier. But the Portland police moved in at that point and pushed protesters back and out of the street, apparently arresting at least one person.

By 11 p.m. there were only about 30 people outside the ICE facility. However, someone in the crowd apparently used bear mace near some protesters, causing some to move quickly out of the area. The bear mace was initially believed to be pepper spray.

At one point in the late afternoon, about 300 protesters were on the sidewalks outside the ICE facility on Southwest Macadam.

By 5 p.m. protesters were blocking the streets in front of the ICE building. KOIN 6 News observed some rising tensions and the possible use of pepper spray. Armed uniformed personnel wearing masks were visible on the rooftop of the ICE building looking down to the street filled with people.

Large helicopters, believed to be federally operated, flew overhead for hours.

There were two separate events on Sunday: this one outside the ICE facility, and an earlier event on Portland’s downtown waterfront.

In a Sunday release ahead of the planned events, Portland police said they activated their Incident Command Team. Those resources include Dialogue Liaison Officers (wearing white uniform shirts), Rapid Response Team, Sound Truck, as well as their Air Support Unit.

The downtown waterfront rally organized by the Protect Oregon coalition – which includes the ACLU of Oregon, labor unions and other community organizations – began at the Battleship Waterfront Memorial along Southwest Naito Parkway to drive home the message, “No military takeover of our communities.”

Both Gov. Kotek and Mayor Wilson were among those who marched in this rally.

“This is an abuse of power and a misuse of the military,” said Sandy Chung, Executive Director, ACLU of Oregon. “Oregon is home, not a military target. Violence has no place in our politics or our communities. The military should not come to Oregon.”

Oregon files suit

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Attorney General Dan Rayfield and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson held a joint press conference Sunday to announce new litigation following President Trump’s announcement he would deploy federal troops to Portland.

Rayfield said the request for a temporary restraining order was filed at 2 p.m. Sunday, slightly more than 4 hours after learning Trump invoked Title 10, which allowed him to order the deployment of the Oregon National Guard to Portland.

Rayfield said the plaintiffs are the State of Oregon and the City of Portland in the request for a temporary restraining order filed in the District Court of Oregon.

“We hope to be in front of a judge within a week,” Rayfield said.

‘Authorizing Full Force’

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he is sending the federal troops to “protect” the city and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities from antifa and other “domestic terrorists.”

The president also said he was “also authorizing Full Force, if necessary,” though it was unclear exactly what he meant.

Numerous local leaders at the city, state and federal levels denounced the message, leading to a press conference held by Gov. Tina Kotek and Portland Mayor Keith Wilson on the banks of the Willamette River.

It was there Kotek said she spoke with the president Saturday and told him in no uncertain terms that there was no need for federal troops to be sent to Portland.

But she added, “We had no proactive communication from the White House until I reached out.”

Saturday night, dozens of protesters maintained a spot on the sidewalks in front of the ICE facility as large helicopters and drones buzzed the skies over the area.

Before dark, about 100 of the protesters came from the Portland peace team with different religious leaders and families with flowers. They marched peacefully in front of the building on SW Macadam as drones — believed to be operated by authorities inside the ICE building — flew overhead.

It appeared that at least one protester was arrested by ICE agents, but there has been no confirmation of that by officials at this time.

In a Sunday release ahead of the planned events, Portland police said they have activated their Incident Command Team. They say those resources include Dialogue Liaison Officers (wearing white uniform shirts), Rapid Response Team, Sound Truck, as well as their Air Support Unit.

However, PPB noted larger groups of officers may be observed to “make targeted arrests for specific crimes committed.”

“PPB members may also investigate crimes and conduct follow-up investigations into criminal activity later and will forward cases to the Multnomah County District Attorney for prosecution when feasible,” the release added. “As a reminder, just because arrests are not made at the scene, when tensions are high, that does not mean that people are not being charged with crimes later.”

In practical terms, waiver occurs only when a defendant has ""invok[ed] the jurisdiction of the state court in resolving the issues presented by the original complaint.""","In Abraham Watkins Nichols Agosto Aziz & Stogner v. Festeryga, No. 23-20337, 2025 WL 2621301 (5th Cir. Sept. 11, 2025), the plaintiff law firm sued its former associate attorney in Texas state court and sought a TRO and expedited discovery.

In an effort to stave off the discovery, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss (and did agree to a limited document production). He never set the motion to dismiss for hearing, and he then removed the action to federal court. The district court remanded the case, finding that filing the state court motion to dismiss prior to removal waived the right to remove the case to federal court.

The Fifth Circuit decision followed the case's prior en banc decision in Abraham Watkins Nichols Agosto Aziz & Stogner v. Festeryga, 138 F.4th 252 (5th Cir. 2025), reversing In re Weaver, 610 F.2d 335, 337 (5th Cir. 1980), which had prohibited appeal of waiver-based remand orders. On return from the court's en banc decision, the Fifth Circuit panel found:

No one disputes that [the defendant] removed within the 30-day statutory window. Yet the district court held that by filing a TCPA motion in state court and securing its automatic stay of discovery, he ""reflect[ed] an intent to invoke the jurisdiction of the state court.""

....

Waiver, in our circuit, is no casual affair. A defendant's intent to remain in state court must be ""be clear and unequivocal,"" and ""the right of removal is not lost by action in the state court short of proceeding to an adjudication on the merits."" In practical terms, waiver occurs only when a defendant has ""invok[ed] the jurisdiction of the state court in resolving the issues presented by the original complaint."" Anything less—mere procedural skirmishing—does not suffice.

....

This case illustrates why. [The defendant's] TCPA motion—while potentially dispositive—could not be decided without a hearing, and it was his responsibility to set one. He never did. Filing a motion that sits idle is not the same as ""submitt[ing] the cause to adjudication on the merits."" Other circuits agree: a dispositive motion, unaccompanied by a hearing or ruling, does not trigger waiver—particularly when, as with the TCPA, the motion carries collateral procedural effects (like staying discovery, expediting proceedings, or shifting burdens) apart from any merits decision. Defendants may have sound tactical reasons to file such a motion without any intent to seek a merits ruling. The district court therefore erred in treating Festeryga's filing, standing alone, as ""clear and unequivocal"" waiver.

Festeryga, 2025 WL 2621301 at *3 (footnotes omitted).

Festeryga makes clear that one can add waiver-based remand orders to the very small category of remand orders that may be appealed in the Fifth Circuit.

Francisco Garduño, who remained in his position as head of the National Immigration Institute until April, was ordered by a judge to make the public apology, among other steps, during a temporary suspension in his prosecution for failing in his responsibility to protect those in his custody.

There were “human rights violations that never should have happened” due to “omissions by personnel of the (National Immigration Institute),” Garduño said at an event in Mexico City.

He called for “those responsible” to be punished and for reparations to be made without recognizing his own responsibility in the tragedy.

In addition to the 40 killed, more than two dozen people were injured. Most of the victims were from Central America and Venezuela.

Two Venezuelan migrants have been charged with homicide for starting the fire.

Dozens of victims’ relatives were present, including some who wept when their loved one’s names were read, along with representatives of the immigration agency and the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

Two migrants allegedly started a fire on March 27, 2023, inside the Ciudad Juarez detention center to protest conditions. Security cameras inside the facility showed smoke quickly filling the cell holding several dozen male migrants, but no one with keys attempted to release them.

In January, the judge in Garduño’s case gave him 18 months to take several steps that could lead to the closure of his case. Several of his subordinates face charges including homicide.

Lawyers representing the victims and their families, worried Garduño will escape prison time, have challenged the suspension of his trial but accepted the idea of a public apology because it was the first time they would face the former official in person.

On Friday, some victims and relatives were allowed to address Garduño.

Claudia Araceli Varela, a relative of one of the victims from El Salvador, said she wanted those responsible held accountable, not pardoned. She told Garduño his apology was “forced” and chastised him for not using his authority to order the cell door opened when the fire started.

“I feel angry, rage, they’re making him do it, he doesn’t do it from his heart, so it’s not worth it,” said Wilson Alexander Juárez, a 23-year-old Guatemalan scarred by burns on his body, who watched from the front row while gripping a walker.

Juárez wanted to be present because it was the first time he saw Garduño up close, he said.

“He’s never showed his face,” Juárez said.

Marcos Zavala, a lawyer with the Foundation for Justice, one of the organizations representing the victims, said Garduño’s public apology “doesn’t end anything.”

Prior to taking over the National Immigration Institute, Garduño had run Mexico’s prison system. When U.S. President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on imports unless Mexico did more to control migration, then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador put Garduño in charge.

There are a few efforts in the House and Senate, individual bills that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients.","Congressional Republicans are waiting on President Trump to signal he is ready to negotiate a permanent solution for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

Over the last decade, DACA has received varying degrees of support from Republican lawmakers. The program, created in 2012 to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation, now benefits around half a million people. During the last few months, there have been reports of DACA recipients without criminal records being detained by federal immigration officials despite the protection the program offers from immigration enforcement.

As Trump expands the reach of his mass deportation effort bolstered by record funding from Congress, immigration advocates and Democrats are raising concern that those on DACA may get caught in the crosshairs. Nearly 20 DACA recipients have been detained by immigration officials this year, according to the immigrant rights group Home is Here. But Republican lawmakers open to a solution are still deferring to the executive branch to broker a deal.

""I understand they are undocumented. I get it that they broke the law. I get it. But they're needed in the economy and someone gave them a job,"" said Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, a Republican from Florida who earlier this year introduced a bill that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients and others. ""President Trump is a guy who gets things done and he can do it. And I am sure that he will come to the realization that this is what's good for America so we can make America greater.""

Salazar's bill has received bipartisan support. But in interviews with Republican lawmakers who have previously supported a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients, nearly every lawmaker was clear: Trump needs to be the one to start talks.

Trump spent the bulk of the campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history. While he has occasionally voiced support for finding a policy solution for certain groups, like farmworkers and other migrant laborers, there has been little effort to do so.

""The Trump Administration's top immigration enforcement priority is arresting and removing the dangerous violent, illegal criminal aliens that Joe Biden let flood across our Southern Border – of which there are many,"" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson. ""America is safer because of President Trump's immigration policies.""

The DACA coalition has weakened in Congress

In 2017, 34 Republicans signed onto a letter urging then-House Speaker Paul Ryan to pass a permanent fix for DACA after Trump attempted to rescind the program, arguing that ""reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients…is the right thing to do.""

But strategists and immigration advocates said that the coalition of Republicans supporting DACA has shrunk over the years, as has the sense of urgency to find a solution after Trump's first attempt to repeal the program failed. Of those 34 Republicans who signed that letter, only eight are still voting members in the House.

""Allowing DACA to go forward became a political hot potato for the Republicans,"" said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. ""Congress always tries to kick the can down the street.""

During his first network interview after winning the election, Trump said he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA with Democrats. More recently, border czar Tom Homan told reporters at the White House that ""no one is prioritizing DACA"" for enforcement.

On the Hill, strategists said that this early in the administration's tenure, it may be a tall order to envision the cabinet's immigration enforcement leaders at the negotiating table with the Capitol Hill Democrats that would be needed to see a Congressional fix through.

""The Trump administration's position is that the only thing that is important on immigration is shutting the border. Almost everything [else] to this administration looks secondary,"" Chishti said. ""As long as that doesn't change as a signal from President Trump, I don't think we're going to see much movement from Republicans in the House or the Senate.""

House holds out hope on a bipartisan deal

Attempts to work across the aisle can be seen scattered throughout the chamber. The strongest effort is seemingly from Rep. Salazar.

""I have no doubt that we have started a national conversation as to what are we going to do with those people, including the DACA kids, who have roots in the country, who have children, who have been working, paying taxes and do not have a criminal record,"" Elvira Salazar told NPR in an interview. ""That is the national conversation that we need to sit down on the table and specifically the GOP, my party and my president. We can definitely solve it.""

Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Penn., said his support for DACA has not wavered. A member of the Problem Solvers Caucus, he was joined by fellow caucus members earlier this month to announce the group would provide a framework to hopefully kickstart negotiations on legislation that could include providing a solution to those who have been here for decades.

""I look in America and look [at] how immigrants built this country,"" he said. ""So it's really a question for my colleagues as to whether they view America that way.""

Separately, earlier this year the caucus sent a letter to the White House requesting a meeting to discuss a bipartisan compromise on immigration. For now, the goal is to come up with a general framework.

Still, there needs to be a strong directive from Trump in order to get the process moving, reiterated Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us, an immigration advocacy organization.

""The political reality here is he could snap his fingers and tomorrow we'll have an intelligent conversation,"" Schulte said.

Still, any measure also needs bipartisan support in the Senate where enthusiasm is low.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cosponsored the Dream Act in 2024, which would provide a pathway to legal status for people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Speaking at the Capitol with NPR, Graham said he didn't see any of the current efforts making much headway while the priority stays on enforcement.

""If you start legalizing anybody now, that's just another magnet. So I want to turn off the magnets before we do anything,"" Graham said.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who introduced measures to provide some pathway to legalization for DACA, said he doesn't see movement before the new year.

""I hope the president goes back to what he said in his first term – he thinks there's room for legal immigration and more people immigrating legally here,"" Tillis said.

Sen. John Cornyn, who, in the past spoke strongly about the need to provide a pathway for DACA recipients, said he believes there are others ahead of DACA recipients in terms of the administration's immigration priorities.

""These young people who've now grown to be adults have found themselves in a very bad situation but don't see any prospects for immigration bills, including for them, any time soon,"" Cornyn said. ""Thankfully, the border has settled down, but we still have a lot of people in the country who are under final orders of deportation shouldn't be here. And I think at some point, hopefully, we can have that conversation. But I don't think any time soon.""

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

President Trump has vowed to conduct a mass deportation of everyone who's in the country without legal status. But there are a few groups of people who live in a gray area, including DACA recipients. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is supposed to protect people from immigration enforcement, but several DACA recipients have been arrested and detained. NPR's immigration policy reporter Ximena Bustillo has been following this and joins us now. Hi, Ximena.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hi.

RASCOE: So the DACA program was created in 2012. Where does it stand today?

BUSTILLO: The program was created to protect children who arrived in the country illegally prior to 2007 from deportation. But DACA is not an immediate path to citizenship or even a green card. Participants instead have to renew their protection every two years. They can also be removed from the program and lose protections if they commit crimes. Currently, about half a million people are on DACA, and now many of them are in their 30s and 40s. It provides a work permit and can be adjusted if a person leaves the U.S. and comes back with a visa or marries a U.S. citizen, among other options to adjust status. And since it was created, there has been no successful effort to provide a pathway to legal status for those who are on the program. Plus, the president had already tried to repeal DACA in his first term, and he failed to do so.

RASCOE: Since President Trump couldn't get DACA repealed then, how is he approaching the program in his second term?

BUSTILLO: So far, no regulatory changes have been made to formally end the program, but parts of Trump's administration have made moves to strip benefits. For example, the Health and Human Services Department said in June DACA recipients would no longer be eligible to buy insurance through the federal health care marketplace. Then, in July, the Education Department launched an investigation into five universities that offer financial help directly to DACA recipients. And as the Homeland Security Department has increased the rates of arrests, there have been reports of DACA recipients being caught up in worksite raids and even deportations. At one point, I asked DHS about this, and they told me that DACA did not confer legal status and that those without legal status are encouraged to self-deport. Now, that's a very strong message that deviates from the first public statement Trump made after he won the election last year.

RASCOE: So what did he say then?

BUSTILLO: At the time, Trump said on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that he would be open to negotiating a deal for DACA with Democrats. Now, both Republicans and Democrats have hung on to that statement made in December as a sign that someday Trump may say he's ready to come to that negotiating table, though there has since been nearly no discussion on the issue. And instead, the focus is still on deportations.

RASCOE: DACA could be addressed not just by the president, but particularly by Congress. What can Congress do?

BUSTILLO: Right. Ultimately, any permanent solution has to come from Congress, but the coalition that cares about this issue is a little bit fractured right now. I spoke with several GOP senators and representatives that have all previously supported finding a pathway for DACA recipients. And Senate Democrats have been increasingly vocal about the urgency to find a solution because arrests are happening. Still, Republicans control both chambers of Congress, and there was the consensus that nothing would happen this year. There are simply other concerns at the top of lawmakers' minds, like keeping the government from shutting down, for example. And they also said that they were waiting for the president himself to say that it's time to broker a deal. There are a few efforts in the House and Senate, individual bills that would provide a pathway to legal status for DACA recipients. But there isn't a sense that they will move anytime soon, even as Trump's deportation efforts only grow.

RASCOE: That's NPR's immigration policy reporter Ximena Bustillo. Thank you so much for joining us.

BUSTILLO: Thanks, Ayesha.

The suit was announced by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield within hours of Gov. Tina Kotek receiving a memo from Department of War Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which he authorized the troop deployment for 60 days.

According to the order seen by Fox News Digital, the federally controlled Oregon National Guard would be stationed in Portland to protect federal property “where protests are occurring or likely to occur.”

Kotek, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, and Rayfield, all Democrats, responded by jointly filing the challenge in federal court, arguing the administration’s move is “unlawful” and unnecessary.

“Oregon communities are stable, and our local officials have been clear: we have the capacity to manage public safety without federal interference,” Rayfield said in a statement.

On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he had directed Hegseth to send “all necessary Troops to protect war-ravaged Portland, and any other ICE facilities under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists.”

Kotek also said Saturday she had spoken directly with the president before Sunday’s order and had urged him not to send in troops.

“Our city is a far cry from the war-ravaged community he has posted on social media,” Kotek told reporters at a news conference at Tom McCall Waterfront Park.

“There is no insurrection, there is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city,” she added.

Despite those objections, federal agents began arriving in Portland over the weekend, with one clash already reported outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility.

Mayor Wilson condemned the arrival of National Guard troops.

“We did not ask for them to come. They are here without precedent or purpose,” he said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., urged demonstrators to avoid confrontations with federal agents. “Their goal is to create an engagement that will lead to conflict,” he said.

The lawsuit follows a similar case filed by California in June, after the administration sent troops to Los Angeles.

“This will only serve to divide us as a nation and community under the guise of caring about public safety,” Rayfield said. “The number of necessary troops is zero.”

“As standing policy, the Department does not comment on active litigation.

Although the Supreme Court recently limited the use of national injunctions, it has yet to address the order's constitutionality.
The Impact of Ending Birthright Citizenship Trump's initiative to end birthright citizenship has sparked a vigorous legal battle since he signed the executive order during his second term.
Simultaneously, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) initiated an internal plan to redefine who qualifies as a citizen at birth.","President Donald Trump has called upon the Supreme Court to uphold his executive order that seeks to terminate automatic citizenship for children born to immigrants residing in the United States unlawfully or temporarily. This development, reported by the Associated Press on Saturday, marks the beginning of a legal process that could lead to a final decision by mid-2026.

On the first day of his second term, Trump signed a decree that challenges more than a century of the 14th Amendment's interpretation, which guarantees citizenship to all individuals born on U.S. soil, with exceptions like children of foreign diplomats. Up until now, federal courts across various states have blocked the enforcement of this measure, arguing that it infringes upon the Constitution.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled in favor of a nationwide injunction, while a federal judge in New Hampshire issued a similar ruling as part of a class-action lawsuit. In the appeal, Solicitor General D. John Sauer contended that judicial decisions have nullified ""a policy of utmost significance to the president and his administration,"" granting ""without legal justification, the privilege of citizenship to hundreds of thousands of unqualified individuals.""

Legal Challenges Against Trump's Executive Order

Immigrant rights organizations have labeled Trump's attempt as unconstitutional. Cody Wofsy, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), stated, ""This executive order is illegal, period, and no maneuver will change that reality."" Although the Supreme Court recently limited the use of national injunctions, it has yet to address the order's constitutionality.

Nearly all courts reviewing the matter have agreed that it violates or is likely to violate the 14th Amendment, which was established after the Civil War to ensure citizenship for African Americans freed from slavery. Trump's administration's appeal encompasses two ongoing cases. A potential hearing before the Supreme Court justices could take place between this winter and next spring, but a decision on whether to accept the case will take several months.

The Impact of Ending Birthright Citizenship

Trump's initiative to end birthright citizenship has sparked a vigorous legal battle since he signed the executive order during his second term. The measure aims to radically alter the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, historically guaranteeing this right to all born within U.S. territory, save for exceptions like diplomats' offspring.

The order immediately met with lawsuits from civil rights groups and various states, resulting in judicial suspensions across different courts. Amidst the litigation, the legal battle escalated through federal channels, yielding conflicting rulings regarding the order's validity. While some judges questioned the decree's constitutionality, others allowed parts of the government's plan to proceed.

This uncertainty led to an unprecedented cascade of legal and administrative procedures, impacting immigrant families and state agencies responsible for civil registration. Simultaneously, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) initiated an internal plan to redefine who qualifies as a citizen at birth.

A leaked document, scrutinized by experts, suggests establishing criteria to exclude children of immigrants in irregular or temporary situations. Although its implementation hinges on the Supreme Court's final ruling, the draft indicates an intention to apply new eligibility standards retroactively, potentially affecting thousands of previously issued birth certificates.",https://cdn0.celebritax.com/sites/default/files/styles/watermark_100/public/1759098286-trump-pide-corte-suprema-eliminar-ciudadania-nacimiento-hijos-inmigrantes.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 23:56:31.047101

PROTESTERS DEMANDING DOCTOR IAN ROBERTS RELEASE. WE TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE DMPS LEADER’S BACKGROUND. WE SHOULD PROMOTE TRUE DISCOURSE AND FACTS, NOT SPREAD MISINFORMATION MEANT TO DIVIDE US. WHAT STARTED THE INVESTIGATION AND THE BIG QUESTION STILL UNANSWERED DAYS AFTER HIS DETAINMENT. WILL MAP OUT THE DISTRICT’S NEXT MOVES AND HOW ROBERTS ARREST COULD SHAPE CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT POLICY, BOTH AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL IN THE YEARS TO COME. THIS IS IOWA’S NEWS LEADER. THIS IS KCCI EIGHT NEWS CLOSE UP. GOOD MORNING. THANKS FOR JOINING US FOR KCCI EIGHT NEWS CLOSE UP. I’M CHIEF POLITICAL REPORTER AMANDA ROOKER. IT HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT WEEK FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND FOR THE DES MOINES PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT. ITS SUPERINTENDENT, DOCTOR IAN ROBERTS, HAS BEEN DETAINED BY FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES. AND IT’S NEWS THAT’S SHOCKING. AND IT HAS BEEN JARRING FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND ALL ACROSS THE STATE. ROBERTS IS NOW IN THE WOODBURY COUNTY JAIL UP IN NORTHWESTERN IOWA. HE WAS ARRESTED FRIDAY AFTER A TRAFFIC STOP. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAYS HE WAS IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND HAD NO WORK AUTHORIZATION. THE AGENCY SAYS HE INITIALLY FLED LAW ENFORCEMENT, BUT WAS LATER FOUND WITH A LOADED GUN, A KNIFE AND A LARGE SUM OF CASH. HIS ARREST HAS SPARKED PROTESTS, BOTH HERE IN DES MOINES AND AT THE JAIL WHERE ROBERTS IS BEING HELD. NO ICE, NO FEAR. IMMIGRANTS ARE WELCOME HERE. MEANTIME, DES MOINES SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS SAY THEY’RE TRYING TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY THE BEST WAY THEY CAN. THE ACCUSATIONS ICE HAS MADE AGAINST DOCTOR ROBERTS ARE VERY SERIOUS, AND WE ARE TAKING THEM VERY SERIOUSLY. I WANT TO BE CLEAR TODAY, WE STILL DO NOT HAVE ALL OF THE FACTS. YESTERDAY, THE DES MOINES SCHOOL BOARD VOTED TO PLACE ROBERTS ON PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. IN A MOMENT, WE’LL TALK WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD CHAIR. BUT FIRST, HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW. ROBERTS HAS BEEN WITH THE DISTRICT SINCE JULY OF 2023. THE DISTRICT SERVES ABOUT 35,000 STUDENTS. ICE SAYS AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE ISSUED A DEPORTATION ORDER IN MAY 2020 FOR DMP. DMPS SAYS THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF THAT ORDER. HIS MOST RECENT CONTRACT, SIGNED IN MAY, SHOWS THAT ROBERTS MAKES $286,000 A YEAR. SCHOOL LEADERS SAY DISTRICT RECORDS INDICATED THAT ROBERTS IS A US CITIZEN. ROBERTS DID PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK THROUGH THE FIRM. BAKER EUBANKS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE DISTRICT SAYS HE PASSED ANOTHER CHECK WHEN HE APPLIED FOR HIS ADMINISTRATOR LICENSE WITH THE IOWA BOARD OF EDUCATIONAL EXAMINERS. THAT WAS GRANTED IN 2023. KCCI HAS ALSO LEARNED THAT ROBERTS IS BEING REPRESENTED BY THE PARISH LAW FIRM. WE ASKED HIS ATTORNEY TO CONFIRM WHEN HE WAS HIRED AS DES MOINES SUPERINTENDENT IN 2023. THE LAW FIRM DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER, SAYING IT’S STILL GATHERING THE FACTS. THESE PAST 48 HOURS HAVE BEEN A WHIRLWIND FOR EVERYONE WHO KNOWS, THE DES MOINES SUPERINTENDENT. HE WAS VERY TIED IN AND WELL RESPECTED IN THE COMMUNITY, KCCI KAYLA JAMES TELLS US ABOUT THE TRAFFIC STOP THAT STARTED IT ALL DURING A, QUOTE, TARGETED ENFORCEMENT OPERATION ON FRIDAY IS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SAYS ICE AGENTS APPROACHED DOCTOR IAN ROBERTS IN HIS VEHICLE SHORTLY AFTER, THE DEPARTMENT SAYS ROBERTS SPED OFF AND LATER ABANDONED HIS VEHICLE NEAR A WOODED AREA. INSIDE THE VEHICLE, ICE REPORTS WERE A LOADED GUN, $3,000 IN CASH AND A HUNTING KNIFE. I WAS PRETTY FREAKED OUT THAT SAME MORNING. PEOPLE LIVING IN AND AROUND EWING TRACE TRAILER PARK SAY THEY SAW ICE AGENTS AND MEMBERS OF THE IOWA STATE PATROL IN THE AREA. KCCI WAS THE ONLY MEDIA OUTLET THERE. AS LAW ENFORCEMENT MEMBERS SWARMED THE AREA. I’M SEEING STATE TROOPERS AT THIS POINT AND THEY’RE, YOU KNOW, COMING OUT, GUNS DRAWN AND STUFF LIKE, WHAT IN THE WORLD? YEAH. SO I WAS PRETTY FREAKED OUT. WHILE KCCI CREWS DID SEE DES MOINES PUBLIC SCHOOLS SAFETY OFFICERS AROUND THE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THIS INVESTIGATION HAVE NOT YET SHARED WITH US. IF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE AT EWING TRACE TRAILER PARK WAS CONNECTED TO ROBERTS DETAINMENT. ROBERTS WAS FOUND AND TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. I WAS ON MY WAY TO MEET HIM UP AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR AN EVENT, A FUN RUN WITH STUDENTS AT WINDSOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS WHERE PHIL RADER, DMPS DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS, SAYS HE AND ROBERTS WERE SET TO MEET FRIDAY MORNING, BUT THEN HE RECEIVED A TEXT A LITTLE BEFORE NINE, SIMPLY SAYING THAT SOMETHING CAME UP. HE HAD AN EMERGENCY. HE WASN’T GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT. AND THEN 45 MINUTES LATER, RADER SAYS HE RECEIVED A FACETIME CALL FROM ROBERTS PHONE DOCTOR. ROBERTS WAS INTERESTED, AS HE ALWAYS IS, YOU KNOW, WAS READY FOR THE WORKDAY. CLEARLY. BUT WAS SURROUNDED BY 3 OR 4 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS, AND HE APPEARED TO BE CUFFED AT THE TIME HE WAS STANDING WITH HIS WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS HIS BACK, RADER SAYS. EVERYTHING ON THE SUBMITTED I-9 FORM INDICATED ROBERTS WAS A CITIZEN. THE DISTRICT SAYS ROBERTS UNDERWENT A COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK THROUGH BAKER EUBANKS, THE FIRM TELLS KCCI IT PERFORMED THE BACKGROUND SCREENING IN APRIL OF 2023, BUT IT DOES NOT PROVIDE I-9 OR WORK ELIGIBILITY SERVICES. ROBERTS REMAINS AT THE WOODBURY COUNTY JAIL IN NORTHWEST IOWA. DES MOINES BASED PARRISH LAW FIRM IS REPRESENTING HIM IN DES MOINES. KAYLA JAMES, KCCI EIGHT NEWS IOWA’S NEWS LEADER. GOVERNOR KIM REYNOLDS SAYS ROBERTS ARREST WAS SHOCKING, PARTICULARLY HIS ALLEGED ATTEMPT TO EVADE AUTHORITIES. BUT SHE SAYS, QUOTE, WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS THAT MUST BE ENFORCED. I’M JOINED NOW BY DES MOINES SCHOOL BOARD CHAIR JACKIE NORRIS. JACKIE, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING. THIS IS A DIFFICULT SITUATION. IT’S ONE THAT HAS CREATED A LOT OF EMOTION IN OUR COMMUNITY, OUR STATE, EVEN OUR COUNTRY. AND THERE’S A LOT OF CONFLICTING INFORMATION OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. AND SO WE WANT TO GET OUR VIEWERS THE MOST CLARITY WE CAN. THIS MORNING. DHS SAYS THAT WHEN DOCTOR ROBERTS WAS ARRESTED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE WORK AUTHORIZATION AND THAT HE WAS IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY WHEN THE DISTRICT HIRED ROBERTS IN 2023. WAS IT THE DISTRICT’S IMPRESSION THAT HE DID HAVE WORK AUTHORIZATION, AND WHAT WAS HIS IMMIGRATION STATUS AT THAT TIME? THIS IS ALL NEW INFORMATION, AND WE ARE SEEKING THE FACTS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IS. WHEN THE SUPERINTENDENT WAS HIRED, I WAS NOT BOARD CHAIR, BUT WE RETAINED A SEARCH FIRM. DID THE BACKGROUND CHECK, JUST LIKE THE STATE OF IOWA AND GOVERNOR REYNOLDS AND THE BOARD OF EDUCATIONAL EXAMINERS DID THEIR LICENSE CHECK. AND SO WE FOLLOWED ALL OF THE PROPER PROCEDURES. AND NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE FACTS TO UNFOLD, BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THERE’S NOT LEGITIMACY AROUND THAT RIGHT NOW. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING, YOU KNOW, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? HOW WERE THERE NO RED FLAGS THAT POPPED UP? IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY YOU WANT TO SAY TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS? THERE WERE NO RED FLAGS. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS WORKED IN MULTIPLE STATES, THAT HAS SERVED ON BOARDS, THAT HAS BEEN A SUPERINTENDENT BEFORE. AND SO WE FOLLOWED ALL OF THE STEPS IN THE PROCESS. AND NOW I THINK WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE FACTS. AND THE FACTS ARE WHAT WE ANTICIPATE. DOCTOR ROBERTS ATTORNEY IS GOING TO OBTAIN WHEN HE IS ABLE TO OBTAIN THEM FROM THE DETENTION FACILITY IN ICE. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE GOING FORWARD IN HOW THE DISTRICT VETS EMPLOYEES? THERE IS NOT BECAUSE WE FOLLOWED THE PROCESS, IS THERE IS THERE POTENTIAL DISCREPANCIES, THOUGH, IN WHAT THAT PROCESS BRINGS UP? I MEAN, IS THERE MORE POTENTIALLY IN THE FUTURE TO DO ON THOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS OR DIFFERENT TYPES OF BACKGROUND CHECKS OR COORDINATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT? I THINK THIS IS SPARKING A FAR BROADER CONVERSATION THAN JUST DES MOINES PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AND I THINK IT’S REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT THAT OUT, BECAUSE CITIZENSHIP IS CLEARLY SO COMPLEX. AND SO THE THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER, AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE I KNOW OUR STUDENTS ARE WATCHING THIS, WE’VE GOT 30,000 STUDENTS THAT ARE GOING TO RETURN THROUGH OUR DOORS ON MONDAY. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT AS THE CITIZENSHIP PROCESS WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH, WE ALSO HAVE TO ASSURE THAT, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS. AND SO TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE AT THE SAME TIME. AND SO AS WE’RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS, IT’S IMPORTANT THAT, YES, THE CITIZENSHIP PROCESS. WE NEED INFORMATION. RIGHT. IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. AND WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. SO WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHY. JUST LIKE I’M SURE YOU KNOW, GOVERNOR REYNOLDS AND THE STATE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY. BECAUSE WE BOTH ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE ALSO HAVE TO ALLOW WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND LEAD OUR DISTRICT. RIGHT. AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF ARE PREPARED TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM ON MONDAY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MONDAY, BUT FIRST, JUST ONE OTHER THING. I THINK BECAUSE THE TIMELINE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE, HE WAS HIRED IN 2023. IT WASN’T UNTIL 2024 THAT AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE GAVE HIM THAT DEPORTATION ORDER, THOUGH THE DISTRICT HAS SAID IT WAS NOT NOTIFIED ABOUT THAT DEPORTATION ORDER. IS THERE AN AGENCY THAT’S SUPPOSED TO REACH OUT AND NOTIFY? I MEAN, JUST HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. I MEAN, WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED. WE FOUND OUT ON FRIDAY, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DID. AND SO AGAIN, BROADER CONVERSATION, I THINK A CONVERSATION FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND HOW IT CHOOSES TO NOTIFY PEOPLE AND IF THEY NOTIFY EMPLOYERS. WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED. NOW, YOU KNOW, AS YOU’VE BROUGHT UP, OUR STUDENTS ARE WATCHING, YOU KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN AN EMOTIONAL MOMENT FOR THE COMMUNITY. STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE RETURNING TO CLASSES ON MONDAY. WHAT DO PARENTS AND STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW? YEAH. SO I’M SO PROUD OF OUR INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT, MATT SMITH, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HIM, WE DIRECTED THAT COMMUNICATION. REGULAR COMMUNICATION GOES TO PARENTS, GOES TO STAFF. HE’S CONVENED THE STAFF ALREADY. AND THE MESSAGES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT PARENTS ARE COMFORTABLE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR CHILD ABOUT THIS AND THAT TEACHERS ARE TOO. AND AND LOOK, I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT THROUGH THE LENS OF CHILDREN, THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT THEY SAW IN THEIR CLASSROOMS THAT WAS SPARKING ENERGETIC CONVERSATIONS IN THEIR CLASSROOMS. AND SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DOCTOR ROBERTS IS A HUMAN BEING. AND AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE DISCREPANCIES IN THE CITIZENSHIP STATUS THAT WE ARE NAVIGATING THROUGH. YEAH, WE KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME WALKOUTS PLANNED IN DMPS HIGH SCHOOLS. WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THE DISTRICT TO HANDLE POTENTIAL PROTESTS AS THEY POP UP THIS WEEK? YEAH, SO THE STAFF HAS HAD THAT CONVERSATION AND IT’S IMPORTANT TO BALANCE, RIGHT, CREATING THE CONDITIONS FOR LEARNING AND ALSO FREEDOM OF SPEECH. AND SO I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT IN THE STAFF’S ABILITY TO NAVIGATE THOSE TWO THINGS. AND THEY’RE PREPARED TO TO DO SO. NOW, I KNOW IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW, DURING PRESS CONFERENCES AND THINGS, YOU NOTICED THE NOTE, ACKNOWLEDGED THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT DOCTOR ROBERTS HAS MADE IN HIS MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF LEADERSHIP IN THE DISTRICT. WE HAD HIM ON CLOSE UP RECENTLY TALKING ABOUT THE REIMAGINING EDUCATION BOND REFERENDUM. THERE’S A $265 MILLION BOND REFERENDUM THAT WILL GO BEFORE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. HE WAS, YOU KNOW, A BIG PART OF SPEARHEADING THAT. WHERE DOES THAT STAND RIGHT NOW? YEAH, I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT REIMAGINING EDUCATION WAS ACTUALLY CATALYZED BY A BIG BOARD VISION TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT EDUCATION. AND OUR COMMUNITY INFORMED THAT OUR TEACHERS, INFORMED THAT OUR STAFF AND STUDENTS INFORMED THAT. AND SO OUR JOB IS TO TAKE THIS BIG VISION AND CONTINUE TO MOVE IT FORWARD. AND SO WE MOVE FORWARD AS PLANNED. WE ASSURE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE A PLAN. WE ARE EXCELLENT STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND OUR KIDS NEED IT. THIS IS ABOUT OUR KIDS. THIS IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR CHILDREN. I DID JUST REMEMBER I HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND AND DMPS POLICY. I KNOW DHS SAYS THAT THEY DID FIND A LOADED WEAPON IN A DISTRICT VEHICLE THAT WAS IN DOCTOR ROBERTS POSSESSION. WHAT IS DMPS SCHOOL POLICY ON? IS THERE EVER A TIME OR A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE A WEAPON WOULD BE ALLOWED IN A DISTRICT VEHICLE? YOU KNOW, WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY. SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF ARE SAFE. AS WELL. BUT THE ANSWER IS GUNS DO NOT BELONG IN STUDENT IN SCHOOL, PROPERTY, RIGHT? IN SCHOOL VEHICLES, SCHOOL VEHICLES. AND THEN VERY QUICKLY, I KNOW YOU’RE HERE IN YOUR CAPACITY AS SCHOOL BOARD CHAIR. YOU ARE ALSO RUNNING FOR US SENATE. THERE’S BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS MAY IMPACT YOUR CAMPAIGN. WHERE DOES YOUR CAMPAIGN STAND RIGHT NOW? RIGHT NOW I’M FOCUSED ON DOING MY VOLUNTEER JOB, AND THAT IS CHAIR OF THE SCHOOL BOARD. AND I’M SO PROUD TO REPRESENT THIS DISTRICT. JACKIE NORRIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT. OKAY. THANK YOU. STILL TO COME ON CLOSE UP, DOCTOR IAN ROBERTS ARREST HAS NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS. WE TALK WITH CONGRESSMAN ZACH NUNN ABOUT HIS CALL FOR MORE ANSWERS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELANDECURITY. OF PEOPLE RALLIED IN DOWNTOWN DES MOINES AFTER DOCTOR IAN ROBERTS WAS DETAINED. SUPPORTERS CARRIED SIGNS DENOUNCING ICE AND PRAISING ROBERTS, SAYING HIS WORK WITH STUDENTS MAKES HIM WORTH FIGHTING FOR. TEACHERS, PARENTS AND KIDS WHO WERE THERE TOLD KCCI THAT THEY WANT LAWMAKERS TO KNOW THAT THEY OPPOSE ISIS ACTIONS IN IOWA. NOW, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF HEATED REACTION ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS, AND THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS. CONGRESSMAN ZACH NUNN REPRESENTS IOWA’S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, WHICH INCLUDES DES MOINES. HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CALLING FOR CLARITY AFTER ROBERT’S SHOCKING ARREST. REPRESENTATIVE NUNN JOINS US THIS MORNING. CONGRESSMAN, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. AMANA, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO JOIN THIS CONVERSATION. I THINK, FIRST AND FOREMOST, IOWANS DESERVE TO HAVE FACTS IN THIS CASE. AND IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO GET AFTER THE ROOT CAUSES THAT ESTABLISH THIS. THERE’S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE KNOW. THERE WAS CLEARLY A COLOSSAL FAILURE THAT ALLOWED SOMEONE WHO DIDN’T HAVE A LEGAL IMMIGRATION STATUS IN THE UNITED STATES TO BE HERE LEADING ONE OF THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTRY. IT ALSO IS CHALLENGING THAT IN THIS CASE, THE INDIVIDUAL DIDN’T EVER TELL, THE SCHOOL BOARD, DIDN’T TELL THE STATE, AND DIDN’T TELL THE COMMUNITY IN A POSITION OF TRUST WHAT HAD HAPPENED. WE KNOW THAT THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES NEEDS REFORM. IT’S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I’VE LED ON. I’M PROUD THAT FOR 800 IOWANS IN THE THIRD DISTRICT, THEY’VE COME THEM THROUGH A VERY ARDUOUS IMMIGRATION PROCESS. WE’VE HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH THOSE FOLKS. THIS IS A CASE WHERE SOMEONE INTENTIONALLY WITHHELD INFORMATION AND A BIDEN ERA REMOVAL ORDER FROM 2024 ENDED UP BEING A SITUATION WHERE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY HAVE NOW BEEN LEFT WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THIS LACK OF INFORMATION. SO HOLDING EVERYONE FROM THE STATE IS DOING NOW, UP TO ICE AGENTS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROVIDING CLEAR INFORMATION, IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO, BOTH IN OUR ROLE IN OVERSIGHT, BUT IN HOLDING TRANSPARENCY SO THAT IOWANS KNOW THE TRUTH AND THAT WE DON’T HAVE THIS HAPPEN AGAIN. RIGHT. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE ARE RECORDS, COURT DOCUMENTS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO GET ANSWERS ON. I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE REQUESTED ALL THE DOCUMENTS RELATING TO ROBERTS IMMIGRATION STATUS. YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW THE TIMELINE ON WHEN HE ENTERED THE COUNTRY AND HIS CITIZENSHIP STATUS REMAINS UNCLEAR, HIS CITIZENSHIP STATUS WHEN HE WAS HIRED AS SHOULD ICE HAVE RELEASED THAT INFORMATION WHEN IT MADE ITS INITIAL PUBLIC STATEMENT ABOUT ROBERTS ARREST? WELL, THIS IS WHY WE IMMEDIATELY MOVED FORWARD WITH AN OFFICIAL OVERSIGHT INQUIRY INTO ICE ON HOW THIS HAPPENED. I EXPECT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO OUR COMMUNITY, BOTH WHEN HE CAME IN, IF THERE WAS A PREVIOUS GUN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN 2020, AS WELL AS WHEN WAS THAT FINAL EXECUTION ORDER TO SAY HE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM THE COUNTRY? IT WAS CLEAR THAT UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, THEY FELT THAT HIS APPEAL, NEARLY A 25 YEAR PROCESS, HAD EXPIRED, AND HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE NEEDED TO LEAVE. AT WHAT POINT DID HE KNOW THAT? AND WHY DID HE FAIL TO TELL OUR COMMUNITY THAT HE HAD BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY? IS THERE A LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR DHS TO HAVE NOTIFIED THE DISTRICT THAT A DEPORTATION ORDER WAS GIVEN IN 2024? WHETHER THERE’S A LEGAL REQUIREMENT OR NOT, THEY ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE DOING THIS. AND THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I THINK IS VERY CHALLENGING AS WE GO FORWARD RIGHT NOW, IF ICE IS GOING TO BE OPERATING IN OUR COMMUNITY CANDIDLY WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY, OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. NOW, THAT ALSO MEANS UPHOLDING THE LAW. IT DOESN’T MEAN THAT YOU GET TO HIDE BEHIND THAT AS AN EXCUSE TO NOT TELL YOUR EMPLOYER, TO TELL YOUR COMMUNITY THAT YOU’VE BEEN OPERATING IN THE COUNTRY IN A NON LEGAL STATUS. SO WE’LL BE HOLDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS. AND I THINK, CANDIDLY, IOWANS ACROSS THE BOARD ON EITHER SIDE WANT TO KNOW THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SOMETHING WE SUPPORT, IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN TRUST. TRANSPARENCY IS THE BEST WAY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. AND MAKING SURE THAT ICE IS PROVIDING THOSE DOCUMENTS IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO, AS WELL AS WORK WITH OUR STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT DES MOINES PUBLIC SCHOOLS IS PROVIDING. I THINK THE KEY QUESTION HERE, WHERE WAS THIS I-9 THAT IDENTIFIED WHETHER HE WAS A US CITIZEN OR NOT? HOW DID HE HAVE A WEAPON IF HE WAS NOT A US CITIZEN? AND WHY DID HE RUN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BEGIN WITH? THERE ARE SO MANY QUESTIONS HERE. ALSO, ON THAT VERIFICATION PROCESS ON THE I-9, ON THE BACKGROUND CHECK, THE DISTRICT SAYS, YOU KNOW, THEY DID A COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK AND THAT HE PASSED IT. THEY SAID THAT WHEN WHEN HE WAS GOING THROUGH THE HIRING PROCESS, THERE WERE NO RED FLAGS THAT POPPED UP TO INDICATE THAT HE WAS NOT A US CITIZEN, WHICH I THINK HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDERING ACROSS OUR STATE, POTENTIALLY ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. ARE THERE GAPS IN THE VETTING PROCESS? IS THERE ANYTHING ACTION THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT THIS SITUATION ISN’T HAPPENING IN OTHER PLACES? YEAH, AND I THINK YOU’RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT HERE. LOOK, IF THE THE INDIVIDUAL IN QUESTION HERE COMMITTED PERJURY AND LIED ON THE I-9, IF THERE WAS FRAUD COMMITTED, THESE ARE ALL THINGS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO AFTER. WE KNOW THIS. 10 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CAME IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME TO THIS COUNTRY LEGALLY AND HAVE A PATHWAY AREN’T BEING SUBVERTED BY RESOURCES GOING TO HAVE TO DO THIS LEVEL OF ENFORCEMENT ON PEOPLE WHO KNOWINGLY SHOULD NOT BE HERE. AT THE SAME TIME, THIS LEVEL OF FOLLOW UP FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT WE’RE USING OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE WE’RE HOLDING FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE AT THE EMPLOYER LEVEL, AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYEE LEVEL. I WANT TO HAVE A PATHWAY THAT WE ARE ALREADY WORKING ON, AND I’M MEETING WITH THE WHITE HOUSE ON THIS TO SAY WE’VE GOT TO HAVE A BETTER IMMIGRATION SYSTEM NOW THAT WE ARE SECURING OUR BORDER, NOW THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS IN OUR NATION’S HISTORY. LET’S GET TO A PATHWAY WHERE WE’RE PROVIDING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COME HERE CANDIDLY, PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY A CLEAN PATHWAY TO DO THIS. SO THIS TYPE OF BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE ISN’T SOMETHING THAT TRIPS SOMEONE UP AND WORSE, ISN’T THE TYPE OF THING THAT ALLOWS AN ILLEGAL TO STAY IN OUR COUNTRY AND POTENTIALLY BE A HARM AGAIN. AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS CLEAR. THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF THINGS THAT’S RIGHT. HOWEVER, I MEAN, DOCTOR ROBERTS WAS SOMEONE WHO WAS WELL RESPECTED IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS, I THINK, HAS SHOCKED THE COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE OF THE HIGH PROFILE NATURE OF THIS DETAINMENT. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, HOW DOES THIS FIT INTO THE OVERALL PATTERN OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY RIGHT NOW? WELL, LET’S NOT BE UNSYMPATHETIC HERE. I MEAN, I THINK YOU’RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I’VE WORKED WITH DOCTOR ROBERTS, BUT I’VE ALSO WORKED WITH A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE TRYING TO COME HERE THE RIGHT WAY. EACH OF THEM HAVE VERY POWERFUL STORIES OF WHAT THEY WANT TO BRING TO OUR COMMUNITY. BUT I KNOW THIS WHEN YOU BREAK THE LAW, WHEN YOU RUN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE TRUE ARE THAT HE WAS NOT HERE LEGALLY, THAT HE HAD BEEN INFORMED THAT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE, AND THAT HE DIDN’T TELL OUR COMMUNITY THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT. AND THAT IS BOTH HEARTBREAKING. BUT IT’S ALSO A REALITY THAT WE CAN’T ALLOW THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR TO BE REWARDED WHILE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO COME HERE THE RIGHT WAY AND ARE NOT BEING TREATED THE SAME WAY. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO DO WITH THE PASSAGE OF REAL BORDER SECURITY HERE IS TO CRACK DOWN ON THE ILLEGAL PATHWAYS AND LOOK TO BUILD A LEGAL PATHWAY FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO CONTINUE TO COME AND EXPAND. THAT’S WHAT WE’RE SORRY TO STOP YOU THERE, BUT WE’VE GOT TO GO TO BREAK. CLOSE UP. WE’LL BE RIGHT BACK. THANKS FOR WATCHING. STAY WITH US. LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL ARE SCRAMBLING TO AVOID A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. THIS IS A LIVE LOOK FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. THIS MORNING. AND WE’RE JOINED THIS MORNING BY CONGRESSMAN ZACH NUNN. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. NOW, THE LAST THAT I HEARD, HOUSE MEMBERS HAD NOT BEEN CALLED BACK TO CAPITOL HILL AT ANY POINT BEFORE TUESDAY AT MIDNIGHT. IF THERE ISN’T A DEAL BY THEN, THE GOVERNMENT SHUTS DOWN. IS THAT STILL? THERE’S NO PLAN TO BE BACK TO D.C. BEFORE THEN. YEAH, AMANDA, WE DID OUR JOB. WE PASSED A BUDGET, AND WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE NEXT RESOLUTION HERE. AS WE CONTINUE TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS BILLS, IT WENT TO THE SENATE, THE SENATE REPUBLICANS WERE UNABLE TO PASS THEIR VERSION. THEY TOOK UP THE DEMOCRAT VERSION. THE SENATE DEMOCRATS WERE UNABLE TO PASS THEIR VERSION. AND CANDIDLY, THE SENATE NEEDS TO DO THEIR JOB. AND HERE’S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW, THERE ARE LITERALLY 3 MILLION IOWANS WHO ARE DEPENDING ON A GOVERNMENT THAT FUNCTIONS THAT THEIR TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY. WE’VE GOT 15,000 NATIONAL GUARD MEMBERS RIGHT HERE IN IOWA, NEARLY 2000 OF WHICH ARE DEPLOYED TO THE MIDDLE EAST. THOSE FOLKS LOSE THEIR PAYCHECK. IF THE GOVERNMENT CAN’T BE FUNDED. THERE’S 240,000 IOWANS WHO NEED SNAP, WHO WILL NOT GET THAT. IF DEMOCRATS CANNOT WORK TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD A FUNDING BILL JUST TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT LIGHTS ON. LOOK, WHEN I WAS IN REPUBLICAN MY FIRST TERM, I FOUGHT TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN. WHEN JOE BIDEN WANTED TO BE THERE. WE’RE DOING IT NOW, AND WE EXPECT THE SENATE TO DO THE SAME. CONGRESSMAN, THAT’S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT. YEAH. LET’S KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN. WE’LL CLOSE UP. WE’LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS BREAK.

At least 200 National Guard members will be deployed to the city to ""protect federal property"" where protests are ""occurring or likely to occur"", according to a memo sent by US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Sunday.

Trump on Saturday said he had authorised the use of ""full force"" if needed to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centres.

Oregon has responded by suing the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of the National Guard to Portland is ""unlawful"".

The lawsuit, filed on Sunday by Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, called the move ""provocative and arbitrary"", and said it ""threatens to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry"".

The deployment marks a further expansion of troop deployments in US cities, amid a wider crackdown by the Trump administration on illegal immigration.

Trump claimed it would help protect ""any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists"", characterising the city as ""War ravaged"" in a Truth Social post.

Democratic lawmakers in Oregon have pushed back, rejecting Trump's assertion that Portland needed federal intervention.

""There is no national security threat in Portland. Our communities are safe and calm,"" said Oregon Governor Tina Kotek on Saturday.

Trump promised retribution - how far will he go?

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Portland has been targeted by protesters since early June, sometimes leading to violent clashes.

As of 8 September, the US Attorney's Office had brought federal charges against 26 people for crimes including arson, assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest.

The DHS said on Friday that demonstrators had ""repeatedly attacked and laid siege to an ICE processing centre"" in Portland.

The department stated that several individuals had been arrested and charged with federal offences in a post on social media.

""Rose City Antifa, a recently designated domestic terrorist organisation, illegally doxed ICE officers,"" it wrote.

""They published their home address online and on public flyers. Individuals associated with Antifa also sent death threats to DHS personnel.""

Rose City Antifa has said it was not responsible for the flyers.

Inside Chicago's split communities as Trump vows to deploy troops

Trump's use of National Guard in Los Angeles was illegal, judge rules

Earlier this week, Trump signed an order formally designating Antifa as a domestic terrorist organisation.

Antifa, short for ""anti-fascist"", is a loosely organised movement of primarily far-left activists.

Legal experts have pointed out that there is no legal mechanism in the US that would formally establish any group as a domestic terror organisation. Such efforts, they said, could face constitutional challenges under the First Amendment, which protects free speech and assembly.

Democratic lawmakers have criticised both the president's rhetoric and the reported actions of ICE agents in the state.

Oregon Senator Ron Wyden said on Friday that there were ""credible"" reports that federal agents ""may be replaying the 2020 playbook"" - a reference to federal forces being deployed in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody.

""I urge Oregonians not to fall into Trump's attempt to incite violence,"" Wyden said.

Local lawmakers have also accused ICE of going after people who are not an actual danger to society.

""ICE has said they're targeting people for arrest and detainment who have committed crimes. That's what they told us. But that's not what we are seeing,"" said Democratic house representative Suzanne Bonamici.

Lawmakers cited recent incidents, including the detention of a father outside his child's preschool and a wildland firefighter who was arrested while battling fires in the Olympic National Forest.

They also pointed to a statistic published by the Cato Institute, a US think tank based in Washington DC, which reported that 65% of people detained by ICE had no criminal convictions.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f730/live/021eaaf0-9c01-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 00:56:29.914357

Already, he has been held for over 100 days in five different facilities, and I risk losing him from the country as you read this article.

My father is a prominent Atlanta journalist who runs his own, independent Spanish media outlet, MG News, where he livestreams major Georgia news.

In detention, my father has not always been safe.

Unfortunately, his coverage of law enforcement and ICE raids caught up to him at a “No Kings” protest over the summer. Local police arrested him while he was recording law enforcement alongside other journalists. Since then, prosecutors have dropped criminal charges related to his coverage of the protest and we have tried to pay bond multiple times. Regardless, for over 100 days, he’s been detained by ICE.

In the past week, the Board of Immigration Appeals has reopened my dad’s 13-year-old immigration case, which had been settled. And in an order we received Tuesday night, the BIA ordered my father be removed, asserting that his previous voluntary departure order was dissolved without bond payment.

This simply isn’t the case.

In 2012, the Board of Immigration Appeals granted my father voluntary departure, meaning he could leave the country on his own within 60 days on the basis of paying bond. Though he paid, he appealed to the board and landed on an agreement with the government that he could stay with work authorization, which my father had until the BIA reopened his case last week. He had never been issued a final removal order until Tuesday.

My father’s vocation is journalism. He is a storyteller, a truth-seeker, a man who believed — and still believes — that people deserve to know what’s happening in their communities, in their governments, and in the world around them. He is neither a threat nor a criminal.

As my father has been transferred from facility to facility, my siblings and I have tried to follow him wherever he goes. He has been transferred five times in total, from DeKalb County now to Folkston ICE Processing Center, nearly five hours away from us. We would make the drive anywhere and any day.

Without him here, I feel like part of me is missing.

In detention, my father has not always been safe. He was placed in solitary confinement. Known for his journalism, even by others inside, he has had inmates take photos of him and threaten to hurt him should my family not pay $60 a day. What else could we do? We paid.

Since then, I have stepped up at MG News and overseen the team in his absence. But we run the risk of bankruptcy, and it hasn’t been easy, as I rely on my father.

In 2021, I was diagnosed with a brain tumor and suffered a stroke during a related surgery. My dad has been the person who kept me going during recovery. He drove me to my medical appointments, helped me manage my care and, most importantly, lifted me up when I felt like giving in to the pain. Without him here, I feel like part of me is missing. His absence has made my recovery harder, and my life emptier.

My mother, who has always been so strong, cannot sleep at night without him. My sister tries to stay brave, but I see her break down crying when she thinks no one is watching. My little brother, who is only 14, doesn’t talk about it, but I know how deeply it hurts him to go through high school without his dad by his side.

I do my best to support them, but I am still sick myself; my pain is frequently overwhelming. My dad has always held our family together. I feel like we are adrift without him, and no matter how hard I try, I cannot fill the space he left behind. I need my dad home — not only for my health, but for our family’s survival.

But I can’t give up hope. My father does not deserve to be in detention, separated from his family. This fight is not over. I will continue to fight for my father, for his freedom, and the freedom of all those who ask the hard questions, who tell the stories some people would rather keep hidden, who hold power to account.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250926-mario-guevara-se-551p-81c414.jpg",N,,2025-09-28 23:56:22.788909

Meanwhile, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has began implementing an internal plan to redefine who qualifies as a citizen at birth.

The information was reported this Saturday by the Associated Press (AP), which explained that the appeal filed by the Department of Justice kicks off a process that could lead to a final decision from the judges by mid-2026.

The decree, signed by Trump on his first day of the second term, challenges over a century of interpretation of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, with exceptions such as the children of foreign diplomats.

So far, federal courts in different states have blocked the implementation of the measure, considering that it violates the Constitution.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco determined that a nationwide pause was necessary, and a federal judge in New Hampshire issued another ruling in the same vein within a class action lawsuit.

In the submitted brief, Attorney General D. John Sauer argued that judicial decisions have invalidated ""a policy of utmost importance to the president and his administration"" and that they grant ""without legal justification, the privilege of citizenship to hundreds of thousands of unqualified individuals.""

Immigrant rights organizations called Trump's attempt unconstitutional.

Cody Wofsy, attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), stated that “this executive order is illegal, period, and there is no maneuver that can change that reality.”

Although the Supreme Court recently limited the use of nationwide judicial suspensions, it has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of this order.

Almost all the courts that have reviewed it have agreed that it violates or likely violates the 14th Amendment, designed after the Civil War to guarantee citizenship to African Americans freed from slavery.

The appeal by the Trump administration encompasses two ongoing cases.

A possible hearing before the Supreme Court judges could take place between next winter and spring, but the decision to accept or reject the case will take several more months.

The intention to eliminate birthright citizenship in the United States has sparked an intense legal battle since President Donald Trump signed the executive order during his second term.

The measure proposes a radical change in the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has historically guaranteed this right to all individuals born on U.S. soil, except for some exceptions such as the children of diplomats.

The order was met with immediate demands from civil rights organizations and several states, which successfully obtained court injunctions in various courts.

In the midst of the litigation, the legal battle escalated to various federal levels, with conflicting rulings on the validity of the order.

While some judges questioned the constitutionality of the decree, others allowed certain parts of the government's plan to proceed.

The uncertainty generated an unprecedented cascade of legal and administrative procedures, affecting both immigrant families and state agencies responsible for civil registration.

Meanwhile, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has began implementing an internal plan to redefine who qualifies as a citizen at birth.

The document, leaked to the media and analyzed by experts, proposes establishing criteria that exclude children of immigrants in irregular or temporary situations.

Although its implementation depends on the final ruling of the Supreme Court, the draft reveals the intention to retroactively apply new eligibility standards, which could affect thousands of previously issued birth certificates.

Federal agents encountered protesters at times, with some groups chanting, ""ICE go home.""

Lawmakers and community leaders held a press conference on Sunday afternoon to speak out about the federal escalation.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker issued a statement on the enforcement, saying, ""The Trump Administration's DHS officers appear to be carrying large weapons around downtown Chicago in camouflage and masks.

Chopper 7 also headed to Broadview, where a small group of demonstrators could be seen outside the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Sunday afternoon.

Broadview police say they have launched a criminal investigation into what they describe as ""an allegedly unprovoked attack"" on a journalist near that ICE facility.

They say a chemical munition was fired from the direction of the facility on a CBS TV news reporter's vehicle. The reporter declined medical attention.

Broadview police say they expect full cooperation from the Department of Homeland Security.

Protests outside the Broadview ICE facility have been happening for several days.

Protesters rally against immigration enforcement

Meanwhile, the Indivisible Chicago Alliance, a grassroots organization dedicated to fighting the Trump administration's policies and actions in Chicago and beyond, organized events in the city on Sunday.

Even before Sunday's show of force downtown, dozens of people came out across the city's North and Northwest sides for what is being called a day of action.

""We think it's important that we show the majority of us are opposed to what Trump is doing. We're opposed to ICE. We're opposed to the militarization of our cities,"" said protester Geri Kahn.

Protesters, many of them members of Indivisible Chicago, fanned out from Irving Park and Lake Shore Drive in Buena Park to Welles Park in North Center, taking heart from the support of passing motorists.

""We want to make a big statement that the American people, the majority of the American people, are not with the Trump administration,"" said protester John Bachtell.

In Humboldt Park, people also came out, but there, their purpose was different. Their eyes were firmly focused on getting people to the ballot box.

""Our actions for today are writing postcards to voters in Virginia to remind them to get out and vote because they have a really important Supreme Court election coming up,"" said Kristen Vandawalker with Indivisible Chicago Northwest.

It is an effort to encourage political action from those who might feel their impact, in what is already a blue state, is limited.

""Sometimes people feel like they can only take so much action or have so much impact within the state so it's good to have, hey there is something really important happening in Pennsylvania we can help with or Virginia or whatever,"" said Jessica Jorsch with Indivisible Chicago Northwest.

Sunday's actions are all a prelude to what is expected to be a large-scale No Kings protest coming up three weeks from now on Saturday, Oct. 18 in Grant Park.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17899998_092825-wls-maher-ice-ops-5p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-28 19:56:37.914068

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national whose deportation saga has captured headlines across the U.S., has been moved to the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania. The transfer, confirmed by his attorneys in a recent court filing, marks a new chapter in a case fraught with legal, logistical, and humanitarian challenges.

Abrego Garcia’s journey through the American immigration system has been anything but straightforward. Previously held at the Farmville Detention Center in Virginia, the Maryland-based father has faced mounting obstacles while preparing his defense against charges in a high-profile human smuggling case. According to the status update filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, his lawyers argued that detaining him in Virginia created “substantial burdens” for their Nashville-based team—making trial preparation arduous and slow.

Access to Counsel Remains in Question

The decision to relocate Abrego Garcia was presented as a move to ease those logistical hurdles. An official from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reportedly assured that the Pennsylvania facility would grant his legal team better access. Yet, as his attorneys pointed out, travel from New York to Pennsylvania is hardly a trivial undertaking, raising doubts about whether the transfer truly improves the defense team’s ability to meet with their client. “It is not appreciably easier for New York-based members of his defense team to travel to Pennsylvania, either,” the status update noted.

His lawyers communicated to the court that they would provide further updates once they could better assess Abrego Garcia’s access to counsel and his ability to prepare for trial at Moshannon. This uncertainty underscores a recurring theme in complex immigration cases: the tension between administrative convenience and the constitutional right to a fair defense.

Humanitarian Concerns at Moshannon Valley

Beyond the legal intricacies, the humanitarian conditions at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center have come under sharp scrutiny. Abrego Garcia’s attorneys raised alarms about his safety following reports of a detainee’s suicide by hanging just last month. They also cited ongoing issues, including assaults among detainees, poor medical care, and inadequate food provisions.

Such concerns are not isolated. According to Reuters, advocacy groups have repeatedly flagged deficiencies in privately-run detention centers, warning that systemic neglect can endanger the well-being of those held inside. For Abrego Garcia, these fears are compounded by his history: he was previously held for months in a notorious Salvadoran prison after the U.S. admitted to wrongly deporting him, a fact that adds layers of complexity to his current predicament.

Official Statements and Public Perception

When asked for comment, ICE deferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In a statement provided to abc27 News, Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’s assistant secretary for public affairs, described Abrego Garcia as “a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator,” stressing that he would not be allowed to “terrorize American citizens.”

Notably, Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime. His attorneys have pushed back against the characterization, highlighting that the United States itself acknowledged wrongful deportation in his case. These starkly contrasting narratives—official condemnation versus legal advocacy—reflect a broader debate in American immigration policy, where labels and allegations can often overshadow due process.

As the case unfolds, the spotlight remains on the fundamental question: can Abrego Garcia receive a fair trial amid shifting venues, logistical barriers, and fraught public discourse?

Looking Ahead: Legal Updates and Advocacy

For now, Abrego Garcia’s defense team is focused on monitoring his access to legal counsel at the Moshannon Valley facility. In their most recent update, they refrained from filing a motion regarding difficulties at the previous detention center, signaling that their next steps depend on how conditions develop in Pennsylvania.

Meanwhile, advocacy organizations continue to call for greater transparency and oversight in detention practices, warning that cases like Abrego Garcia’s exemplify the risks inherent in a system driven by administrative expedience and political rhetoric. The outcome of his trial—and the process leading up to it—will likely serve as a touchstone for broader debates on immigration reform and detainee rights in the United States.

The transfer of Kilmar Abrego Garcia highlights the precarious balance between administrative efficiency and the imperatives of justice. As legal teams grapple with access issues and safety concerns, the case serves as a reminder that behind every headline are human lives shaped by the decisions of powerful institutions.",https://azat.tv/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tmp9hfj364n.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 18:57:18.429556

“We must come together to live our city’s shared values of freedom from fear and sanctuary from federal overreach in the days ahead, no matter what our city may face,” Mayor Keith Wilson said in a letter to the city council on January 21.

In the past eight months, the city has reaffirmed that commitment by joining a lawsuit against the Trump administration and issuing a zoning violation notice for an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has been at the center of almost constant protests throughout the summer.

On Sunday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memorandum announcing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard would be “called into Federal service effective immediately for a period of 60 days.”

The City of Portland and the State of Oregon then filed a lawsuit alleging the Trump administration had overreached its mandate in federalizing the Oregon National Guard in response to unrest.

Most of the protests outside the ICE facility, about 2 miles south of downtown, have been peaceful, but occasionally have ended in the deployment of tear gas and resulted in the facility being closed for several days in the summer.

President Donald Trump on Saturday followed through on his pledge to make the city a target of his next National Guard deployment, saying in a social media post he was directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to “provide all necessary troops” to Portland, a city he described as “war ravaged,” to protect ICE facilities he claimed are “under siege” by Antifa and “other domestic terrorists.”

In the lawsuit, lawyers for the state and the city said the move breached the principles of the US Constitution and risked stoking new unrest.

“Far from promoting public safety, Defendants’ provocative and arbitrary actions threaten to undermine public safety by inciting a public outcry,” their court filing alleges. “Defendants’ deployment of troops to Oregon is patently unlawful.”

The filing names Trump, Hegseth, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and their departments as defendants.

The plaintiffs ask the court to declare the federalization and deployment of the Oregon National Guard in the state illegal and permanently prevent such action being taken by the Department of Defense again.

However, the White House said Trump’s use of the National Guard would make Portland safer.

“President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,” spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement emailed to CNN Sunday.

Trump has previously said, without evidence, that “paid terrorists” are wreaking havoc in Portland.

Last week, Trump refocused attention on Antifa – the loosely organized group of leftists and anarchists who are known for anonymity and destructive masked demonstrations – designating it as a “major terrorist organization.” The White House emphasized incidents in Portland, home to one of the oldest organizations in the United States to carry the Antifa moniker, in its statements about the designation.

Here is what we know about what is ahead for the city famous for loud protests and liberal politics as its standoff with federal immigration officials gets more tense.

Being a ‘proud’ sanctuary city could put federal funds in jeopardy

In spite of the president’s ire, Portland has doubled down on sanctuary city status, making it the first thing you see on its official website. Now the city council is moving toward an ordinance that would make it legally binding, prohibiting any Portland government organization from assisting in federal immigration enforcement, except for providing information that is already available to the general public.

The decision could be a costly one for Portland. The administration announced it would withhold a variety of federal grants – including FEMA funding, highway grants and airport improvements – from cities it classified as “sanctuary jurisdictions,” including some cities that don’t use that term. For Portland, that puts $350 million in jeopardy.

Portland joined 15 other local governments in a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration earlier this year, and a judge blocked the government from freezing those funds. But the administration is appealing, denying that they are cutting federal funding “in an indiscriminate or wholesale manner.”

Alongside Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies, sanctuary cities have been the biggest direct targets of Trump’s second term, with three different executive orders specifically mentioning them and requiring the Department of Homeland Security to make a list of them.

In response, Louisville, Kentucky, dropped its policy refusing to hold immigration suspects in its local jail for ICE, with the mayor acknowledging that “millions of dollars in federal grants were at stake.”

From Portland, the message has been much different.

“As a proud sanctuary city in a sanctuary state,” Mayor Wilson said, “we are committed to protecting the rights and dignity of all who live here, working together to strengthen our community.”

Portland first called itself a sanctuary city nearly a decade ago with a nonbinding resolution saying the Portland Police Bureau “shall not cooperate with ICE except as expressly required by Federal Law.” This week, the city council discussed taking things further by making its sanctuary status permanent.

“I think that when we are facing such an extreme level of federal overreach … then we do have a responsibility to act boldly in ways that we haven’t had to act before,” said council member Angelita Morillo during a committee meeting Tuesday. “These are unprecedented times, and we have to do unprecedented things.”

None of the members of the public who testified at the meeting spoke against the proposal, which does not yet have a final vote scheduled.

ICE facility is the target of both protests and legal challenges

The story of protests against the ICE facility on Macadam Avenue is most starkly told through photos taken there over the past two years.

As the months wear on, you see an ordinary-looking tan brick and stucco building in an industrial area is gradually swallowed by increasing layers of fencing, its lower-level windows suddenly blocked by plywood, a concrete retaining wall covered in anti-ICE graffiti.

Protester Deidra Watts told The Associated Press earlier this month that she feels ICE’s actions against immigrants are cruel and require a loud response.

“In the face of that, there has to be people who will stand up and make it known that that’s not gonna fly, that that’s not something the people agree with,” Watts said.

In the summer, protesters blocking the processing facility caused it to be closed for several days, CNN affiliate KATU reported, something the Trump administration blamed on “anarchists and rioters.”

But the building has become a magnet for a wide variety of protesters, the Oregon Capital Chronicle reported, with daytime demonstrators mostly coming from religious organizations, quietly holding signs and monitoring the movement of migrants in and out of the building until the mantle is picked up by rowdier protesters at night.

While protesters have tried to shut down the building physically, the city government is trying to do it by other means.

So far this year, federal prosecutors have charged 27 people with federal charges for activity outside the facility, said Jessica Biggers, a spokesperson for the US Attorney for the District of Oregon. Most of the charges are for assaulting a federal law enforcement officer or failing to obey a lawful order, the district attorney’s office said in press releases.

Portland sent a notice to the building’s private owners last week, saying ICE has committed code violations by boarding up windows and keeping some detainees in the holding facility for longer than 12 hours.

“Federal records show that ICE violated its land use conditions of approval 25 times in 10 months,” the notice states.

The building used by ICE is owned by a family partnership whose beneficiaries are not listed publicly. An attorney for that partnership did not return requests for comment on the zoning violation notice.

Morillo, the council member, acknowledges it’s questionable whether the city could force the ICE facility to close, even if the legal violations aren’t addressed. And her proposal to add extra fees on buildings used for federal detention raised concerns from another council member.

“If we start to begin to cherry pick on who and how the federal government gets to rent places, that’s concerning to me,” said council member Loretta Smith.

The Trump administration says shutting down the processing facility, where undocumented migrants have to periodically check in with immigration officials, would actually make things harder on immigrants.

“If the city allows further separation of families by forcing ICE to operate processing elsewhere, that is on them,” ICE said in a statement to CNN affiliate KATU. “Lending no hand to ICE in the name of ‘sanctuary,’ means also lending haven for criminals that has proven to be a great risk to public safety and national security.”

Destructive protests of 5 years ago still on leaders’ minds

While city leaders have been largely supportive of the right to protest outside the ICE facility, they have also made it clear they do not want a repeat of the city’s most notorious demonstrations in 2020.

The murder of George Floyd in May of that year touched off protests – frequently violent – in major cities around the country, but the demonstrations in Portland continued for more than 100 consecutive nights.

Through that summer, a grim routine developed where peaceful marches would devolve into vandalism and threats against police officers. The Portland Police Bureau would declare a riot and order protesters to disperse, eventually responding physically against protesters. There were more than 6,000 uses of force by police during that period, according to city records.

In what turned out to be a foreshadowing of rhetoric that would get even hotter in his second term, Trump in July 2020 called Portland a “beehive of terrorists” and deployed the National Guard to protect federal buildings downtown.

Locally, the response was more complicated, with police frequently criticized for their use of force and tear gas. Eventually then-Mayor Ted Wheeler – who also served as the commissioner of police – banned the bureau’s use of CS gas, but a study later found so much gas had been deployed on a single night in June across 18 downtown blocks prior to the ban that it became a public health danger.

In 2022, the Biden administration’s Justice Department criticized the Portland Police Bureau, saying it didn’t do enough to review its procedures and see if its use of force was warranted.

Ultimately, most of the people arrested – including some accused of rioting – were released without charge after Multnomah County’s District Attorney’s Office announced in August 2020 it was declining to prosecute cases against protesters who did not use force, steal or damage property.

“If we leverage the full force of the criminal justice system on individuals who are peacefully protesting and demanding to be heard, we will cause irreparable harm to them individually and to our society,” former DA Mike Schmidt said at the time.

While hundreds of people who were arrested went free without charge during that turbulent year, prosecutors are now pointing to those past protests in a warning to people who hope to send a message about ICE.

“Let’s not kid ourselves,” Multnomah County District Attorney Nathan Vasquez said in June. “In the past, the voices of tens of thousands of peaceful protestors have been drowned out. Their message was hijacked by a small number of individuals with a message of vandalism, destruction and violence.”

And local officials have made it clear that, regardless of any concerns about more flare-ups in the tense standoff between ICE and protesters, they don’t want the Trump administration’s help.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/sipausa-62273384.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-28 20:57:12.946967

Asian Americans ought to care just as much about Hispanic communities facing immigration raids as our own.","When I first heard about the immigration raid on a Hyundai factory in Georgia, which led to the arrest and deportation of some 300 Koreans, I was shocked. I’d always empathized with the plight of undocumented immigrants in the U.S., but I seemed to have forgotten that this group includes Asian Americans.

In fact, I later learned that as of 2015, there were around 230,000 undocumented South Koreans in the U.S. — the eighth highest number of any country. It has since fallen below the top 10, so exact figures are not published, but the number almost certainly remains significant.

I should know that immigration issues affect the Korean community. My grandmother has been trying for years to get back into the U.S. to visit her son and grandkids without success. But the arrest of these Koreans shocked me and other Asian Americans I know because systemic racism has conditioned us to think of primarily Hispanic people as “illegal.” There is data to back this up — a 2019 study found that immigrants from Mexico and Central America were significantly more likely to be perceived as “illegal” than their Asian and European counterparts.

The response to this raid highlights a troubling trend with recent border politics: the racialization of “illegality.” The extent to which Hispanic immigrants are dehumanized in political discourse is evident in our reaction to news like the Hyundai raid — when suddenly we remember that what we are doing to one group of people could happen to our own communities, too. The fact that we only start caring when we are scared for ourselves is the root of the problem.

This is what a system which necessitates dehumanization does. You can’t tear a mother away from her baby without dehumanizing both. And in the U.S., racism is the lubricant for systemic dehumanization.

Recently, this implicit pattern has been codified by the Supreme Court, which ruled that racial profiling is acceptable grounds for immigration stops. Now, legally, simply being Latino is suspicious. Speaking Spanish is suspicious. Hanging out outside Home Depot is suspicious. After we’ve come so far in calling out and addressing profiling of and police violence against Black Americans, this state-sponsored discrimination feels like a step decades back.

The other reminder of the Hyundai raid is the inverse — that in a system that utilizes minorities as scapegoats for the nation’s problems, anyone can be next. Today it’s Hispanic migrants, but who knows if this raid will be the last on Asian American communities. Scapegoats only work because we are trained to believe one group of people is “not like us,” when in reality, they are us. Asian Americans ought to care just as much about Hispanic communities facing immigration raids as our own.

Luckily for Koreans, South Korea remains a major ally and economic partner in Asia, and Seoul’s energetic condemnation of the raid seems to have given their citizens at least a modicum of protection. A senior U.S. diplomat to Korea expressed regret over the raid and the treatment of the Korean workers, and even Donald Trump toned down his rhetoric following the backlash. Many Latin American countries, however, don’t seem to have the same leverage to protect their citizens from having their rights stripped away.

This disparity in treatment highlights the ways in which global inequality is felt even within the borders of the U.S., where we enjoy first-world privilege. Ultimately, calling a human born elsewhere illegal is to say that they do not deserve the same privileges we enjoy on a daily basis. That they do not deserve to raise their families as our neighbors, to pursue what is left of the American dream. And to say that someone does not deserve these human rights is to call them less than human.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dth/2fef2888-d713-49b1-a981-85a519d7bd21.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-09-28 17:56:43.243707

Ayala-Uribe was pronounced dead at 2:32 a.m. on Sept. 22. He had been referred to the hospital the previous day to evaluate an abscess on his buttock and was scheduled for surgery. ICE reported that he was also hypertensive and displayed abnormal tachycardia. The cause of death remains under investigation by DHS.

Ayala-Uribe came to the U.S. as a young child and received Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) protection in 2012. His renewal request was denied in 2016 following a DUI conviction. He was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Aug. 17 during an enforcement action at the Fountain Valley Auto Wash, where he had worked for 15 years, and was transferred to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center on Aug. 22 for immigration proceedings.

Internal emails obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that about two weeks after arriving at Adelanto, Ayala-Uribe reported symptoms including a cough, fever, and severe pain. Staff flagged his condition as potentially life-threatening, and he was escorted to the facility’s medical center in a wheelchair. However, about an hour and a half later, medical staff cleared him to return to his dormitory. He was not sent to a hospital until three days later, as reported by the L.A. Times.

Family members told the Times that ICE provided limited information as his health declined. “He was telling them that he was sick, he wasn’t feeling well. He’s tried asking for help, but they wouldn’t really do anything,” said his younger brother, Jose Ayala. A fellow detainee reportedly contacted the family late Sunday to report that Ismael was shaking severely and had finally been sent to the infirmary, and officials then informed the family of his death the following morning.

Ayala-Uribe’s death is the 14th reported in federal immigration custody so far in 2025, the L.A. Times reported. Advocates have highlighted concerns about medical care and staffing at Adelanto, one of California’s largest ICE detention centers, which is operated by the private firm GEO Group.

Some current and former staff members told the Times that an influx of detainees and inexperienced hires may have contributed to inadequate medical response.

The Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice called for an independent investigation, stating that “no one should profit from immigrant incarceration, and no family should endure loss due to neglect.” ICE and the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that all detainees have access to comprehensive medical care and 24-hour emergency services.

Ayala-Uribe’s family plans to hold a press conference with their immigration attorney on Tuesday, Sept. 30, at 1:00 p.m. in Downtown Los Angeles to discuss the circumstances of his death.

over nothing.” Any illusions of an independent Justice Department are being shattered by a president bent on using it as an instrument of retribution.
That is hardly the transparency Trump promised for the Washington “swamp.” It does nothing to restore the credibility of Homan, the FBI or the Justice Department.
Congress should review the pertinent documents, the FBI’s audiotape and bring Homan in for under-oath questioning.","A restaurant takeout bag with $50,000 inside. A former (and future) government official. Allegations of a Department of Justice cover-up. It sounds like a Matt Damon movie, but it’s just another day in 2025.

The Justice Department has halted the investigation of border czar Tom Homan, who MSNBC reported was caught on tape last September accepting a cash payment from FBI agents posing as businessmen seeking government contracts. But that won’t end the matter — nor should it.

Americans deserve to know whether Homan, who styles himself an aggressively by-the-book cop unwilling to look past any immigrant’s slightest infraction, is guilty of soliciting bribes. That’s especially important now, when Homan is poised to oversee a massive expansion of immigration enforcement funding. Homan has denied wrongdoing, but he has not specifically denied taking the money in the sting operation conducted last September.

At the time of the alleged incident, Homan was a private citizen leading a consulting firm. Homan, who had occupied prominent roles at Immigration and Customs Enforcement in President Barack Obama’s administration and in the first Trump administration, reportedly told the undercover agents that he expected to play a key role in a second Trump administration and could steer border-related government contracts their way. That is according to internal documents reviewed by the MSNBC reporters who broke the story, and multiple figures they interviewed.

The administration has tried to characterize the exchange as entrapment — a weaponized operation designed by a Democratic administration to ensnare one of President Donald Trump’s most trusted advisers on immigration.

But Homan was not the initial target of the FBI’s investigation. He only came into it when agents were alerted to his alleged solicitation of bribes. And the agency was led at the time by Christopher Wray, a Republican whom Trump appointed in his first term. (Wray resigned under pressure from the White House in January and was replaced by Kash Patel on Feb. 20.) Once Homan allegedly took the bribe, there arose an obligation to investigate further. That obligation remains.

House and Senate Democrats are opening separate inquiries, and they are right to do so. Those inquiries should, by all rights, be bipartisan. Congress is charged with oversight of the executive branch. Republicans, however, remain supine, unable to muster the backbone for their most basic check-and-balance duties. They are taking their cues from the White House, which has been vigorous in decrying the reports and the investigation.

News of the FBI’s decision to bury the probe — for “no credible evidence” according to an FBI statement — broke as Trump was claiming credit for firing U.S. Attorney Eric Siebert for failing to find enough evidence to charge one of Trump’s sworn enemies, New York State Attorney General Letitia James. Trump also recently demanded in a social media post that Attorney General Pam Bondi move “now” to prosecute his political adversaries who, he said, “impeached me twice and indicted me (5 times!) over nothing.” Any illusions of an independent Justice Department are being shattered by a president bent on using it as an instrument of retribution.

Congressional Democrats may have trouble picking up where the DOJ left off, because without a majority in either the House or the Senate, they can’t compel testimony or call hearings. Nevertheless, it’s imperative to get to the bottom of what happened here.

Republicans’ “big beautiful” budget reconciliation bill contained an unprecedented amount of money for detaining and deporting immigrants. The immigration agencies carrying out Homan’s orders will get a gusher of new funds washing through them — enough to hire a small army of new officers and pay for countless contracts. Taxpayers deserve to know that those dollars will be well spent.

Homan’s administrative powers are limited, and do not give him direct control over either hiring or vendor contracts. But this is an administration where everything is fungible, and as border czar, Homan’s influence is profound. The details of how the funds will be disbursed remain far too vague, even though months have passed since Congress greenlit that funding.

As a civilian, Homan operated a consulting firm that secured immigration-related government contracts. One of his clients was the GEO Group, a major player in detention facilities and private prisons. After Trump’s November victory, GEO CEO Brian Evans told investors, “We’re looking at a theoretical potential doubling of all our services.” ICE maintained in April — when his connection with GEO was reported by The Washington Post — that Homan “has never been involved in any contract discussions or decisions at ICE since being named border czar.” GEO has not commented. Yet the Department of Homeland Security has recently awarded GEO a number of new contracts, including a 15-year contract for $1 billion announced Feb. 27.

That announcement came shortly after the FBI’s probe was shuttered, according to MSNBC’s reporting. In late January or early February, then-Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove told the DOJ he didn’t support the investigation. That was a mistake — a perceived cover-up could result in a much larger scandal.

In December 2024, Homan had told Rolling Stone that as incoming border czar he would recuse himself from decisions on government contracts, “therefore there is no conflict of interest.” The old Cold War phrase “trust but verify” comes to mind.

Instead, we have Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche declaring that the matter has been given a “full review” and “no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing” has been found. Case closed, nothing to see here.

That is hardly the transparency Trump promised for the Washington “swamp.” It does nothing to restore the credibility of Homan, the FBI or the Justice Department.

This administration, with its loose ethics and disregard for rules, has not earned that level of trust. Perhaps no administration in recent memory has. Congress should review the pertinent documents, the FBI’s audiotape and bring Homan in for under-oath questioning. What happened to the cash? When did the administration learn of the investigation? What steps have been taken to prevent conflicts of interest?

That’s not a witch hunt. It’s Congress doing the job it is supposed to do.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tsr-lopez-photo.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-09-28 16:56:35.086698

Steve Held, a journalist with investigative upstart Unraveled Press, was among those arrested Saturday, according to Unraveled and other journalists on the scene.
Eleven people were arrested outside the ICE facility Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement posted to the platform X, previously known as Twitter.
“ICE agents at Broadview have also unholstered their guns repeatedly, pointing machine and hand guns directly at protesters.","BROADVIEW — A day after the mayor of suburban Broadview sounded the alarm about ICE officials “making war” in her community, federal authorities appeared to double down Saturday, arresting at least one journalist and using chemical weapons on protesters and members of the press.

In a Friday letter to the Department of Homeland Security, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson asked that the agency stop “deploying chemical arms, such as tear gas, pepper spray, etc. against American citizens, our residents, and our first responders,” at the ICE processing facility, 1903 Beach St. in Broadview.

After the letter was covered by the media, Broadview police were warned by ICE of increased enforcement action Saturday, which they believe is an act of retaliation by Homeland Security for speaking out.

“In retaliation for the Village of Broadview yesterday calling on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency to ‘stop making war on our community,’ ICE agents this morning informed the Broadview Police Department that there will be ‘a s*** show’ in Broadview today,” a press release from the village said.

The Sun-Times reports that agents fired pepper balls into a group of about 75 protesters Saturday evening and made several arrests.

Steve Held, a journalist with investigative upstart Unraveled Press, was among those arrested Saturday, according to Unraveled and other journalists on the scene. Unraveled said on social media early Sunday that Held was “safe” and among those released by federal authorities overnight.

Raven Geary, Held’s colleague at Unraveled, was shot in the face with a pepper ball by federal officers on Friday and sought medical attention afterwards, Block Club reporters witnessed.

“We have never witnessed anything like what ICE has unleashed on our communities this week,” Unraveled said in a statement posted to social media Sunday.

Eleven people were arrested outside the ICE facility Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement posted to the platform X, previously known as Twitter.

In a joint statement ahead of Saturday’s planned protest, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, State Sen. Robert Peters and Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th) urged civilians to stay away from further protests near the facility — fearing that ICE will be willing to use lethal force on peaceful protesters.

“ICE has escalated their use of tear gas, pepper rounds, and rubber bullets, shooting protesters and members of the press in the face without provocation on numerous occasions,” the letter states. “ICE agents at Broadview have also unholstered their guns repeatedly, pointing machine and hand guns directly at protesters. ICE is willing to use lethal force, as we’ve seen in the recent killing of Silverio Villegas Gonzalez in Franklin Park.”

Federal officers representing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were seen assisting Homeland Security agents outside the Broadview facility Saturday.

Tensions have been escalating outside of the processing facility in the western suburb since Sept. 19, when federal officers began shooting pepper spray balls, deploying tear gas and throwing flash bang grenades at protesters attempting to block federal vehicles from entering and exiting the premises.

Friday’s protest saw federal officers unleash more violence on protesters, including a sniper who shot baton rounds into a crowd of hundreds packed into a parking lot adjacent to the facility.

Saturday’s action comes as President Donald Trump announced a deployment of federal troops to ICE facilities in Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere – authorizing “full force” on protesters he described as extremists.

In a statement Saturday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said he is “monitoring the federal deployments” and in close contact with Broadview police.

“I urge members of the public to remain calm, stay safe, and document what you see with your phones and cameras,” Pritzker said. My senior team has also asked legal organizations to support monitoring on the ground. By observing and recording peacefully, we can ensure that any violations of the law are brought to light and those responsible are held accountable.”",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/092625-Broadview-ICE-Protest-Colin-Boyle-1903.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 16:56:42.165812

In 2022, the congresswoman Zoe Lofgren introduced a bill that would have created an independent immigration court system – but the bill ultimately died.","Dana Leigh Marks had the kind of career most immigration judges dream of.

At 32, she won a precedent-setting supreme court case that made it easier to claim asylum in the US. In the decades that followed, she led the National Association of Immigration Judges to gain collective bargaining rights, fought to protect immigration courts from political meddling and blazed a trail for a generation of female judges.

Now retired at 71, she’s seen her share of political ups and downs over her 10 years as an immigration lawyer and 35 years on the bench. But nothing could have prepared her for what she’s seen the Trump administration do to the court systems she once served.

“I have seen my entire career destroyed by Trump in six months,” said Marks, reflecting on the state of her profession while sipping coffee near her home in Marin county, just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, where she spent much of her career. “I’m flat out terrified on all fronts.”

Whip-smart, with a shock of white curls, Marks can speak more freely than a sitting immigration judge. And the picture she paints is alarming.

Trump’s immigration crackdown has thrown the already backlogged courts into chaos. More than 100 immigration judges have been fired since Trump was sworn in, including roughly a third of the judges in San Francisco, home to one of the largest immigration courts in the country. People across the US are routinely arrested outside their court hearings by Ice agents “acting like the Gestapo”, Marks said.

She described her former colleagues as under siege. “If I were an immigration practitioner now, I’d tell my clients that they have to act like they’re in a war zone,” she said. “Be prepared for any eventuality, because it is so random and so chaotic.”

Despite the grim subject matter, Marks is full of wisecracks and seems to have her spirits permanently set on high – gushing at every passing dog and baby.

“Immigration judges do death penalty cases in a traffic court setting” is among her oft-quoted zingers.

She describes the frenetic work of an immigration judge as like “the guy behind the curtain in The Wizard of Oz”: managing dockets, juggling courtroom tech and interpreters, typing verbatim notes while monitoring audio recording levels, then issuing immediate oral rulings with few clerks and barely any time to think. It’s an already frenzied job, and one she believes the Trump administration is intentionally trying to make harder.

Humor aside, her message for the public is a serious one: that the Trump administration is “attacking” immigration courts “on all fronts” in order to eliminate them entirely by proving they’re “dysfunctional”. There’s a backlog of 3.6m cases waiting to be adjudicated, and Marks believes the courts have been purposefully starved of resources.

“I feel like the immigration courts are the canaries in the coalmine,” she said, “and what’s happening to them is an illustration of what might happen to other court systems if we don’t stop it.”

A critical eye and an open mind

Marks’ interest in refugees and the immigrant experience comes from her own family’s lucky escape to America.

“I was raised with an awareness of immigration to begin with,” said Marks. Her Jewish grandmother fled pogroms in Lithuania and was on one of the last boats to the US before the first world war severely restricted transatlantic migration. By the 1920s, the US enacted laws imposing strict quotas on refugees from eastern and southern Europe that almost completely shut down legal pathways for Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust.

Marks grew up in a diverse part of west Los Angeles, and spent a year in Chile after Salvador Allende’s election, where she learned Spanish and saw first-hand the dissonance between US media coverage of his presidency and how Chileans talked about politics around dinner tables. She learned to read and listen to many perspectives with a critical eye and an open mind.

She wanted to be a social worker, but went to law school and nearly dropped out before falling in love with immigration law. “You met the world coming into your office,” she said, describing her years in private practice.

In 1987, at the age of 32, she won the supreme court case known as INS v Cardoza-Fonseca, which expanded asylum eligibility by granting relief to those with a “well-founded fear” of persecution. The morning after that victory, she started her training to become a judge.

Alongside her work in court, she led the National Association of Immigration Judges for nearly two decades and recruited half a dozen female judges to the bench. She prided herself on using compassion and humor to lower the tension in her courtroom: when people feel heard and judged fairly, they’re more likely to accept your decisions, she said, even when you rule against their claim.

Marks retired in 2021 to become “Nana Dana” and care for her grandchild, but she remains deeply engaged in the field, speaking at conferences, advising the National Association of Immigration Judges, educating law students, officiating weddings and serving on the advisory board of the non-profit Justice Connection.

What’s been playing out now in courtrooms, in policy memos and on the streets has chilling echoes of the authoritarian eras her Jewish ancestors fled.

Among her more recent concerns is the push to recruit hundreds of military lawyers to serve as immigration judges. In late August, the Trump administration scrapped the rule requiring temporary immigration judges to have spent a decade practicing immigration law before qualifying for the bench. Days later, 600 military lawyers were cleared to fill vacant judge seats. All of this is “absolutely unprecedented”, said Marks. “I don’t want to slam military lawyers, but there is the concern that they’re being picked because there’s a perception that they will just follow orders.”

Political interference in the court

For Marks, political encroachment on immigration courts has been “a slow creep that now has gone to light speed”.

A hallmark of American democracy is the separation of powers and an independent judiciary. But this has never been so for immigration courts, which are overseen by the Department of Justice, a part of the executive branch rather than the judicial branch.

“Deep in my bones, I always felt the placement of the immigration court in the Department of Justice was wrong,” she said. “The boss of the prosecutor should not be the boss of the judge.”

The court’s placement has led to political interference and underfunding by both parties in power, and Marks wanted to fight back. She spent decades advocating for the nation’s immigration court system to be moved out from under the political whims and meddling of the justice department and into an independent judiciary. In 2022, the congresswoman Zoe Lofgren introduced a bill that would have created an independent immigration court system – but the bill ultimately died. Marks thinks reviving that bill should be a top priority for Democrats.

She believes everyone across the political spectrum should be incensed by the current level of meddling with due process: from firing immigration judges, to pressuring them to toss out asylum cases so they can be reassigned as emergency deportations, to turning courthouses into traps where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents scoop up immigrants to meet deportation quotas, and more.

“Americans were raised with the golden principle that everybody deserves due process, and I really think the majority of Americans believe that, and that that’s what makes us exceptional in the world,” she said.

“What kills me, as a lawyer, is that Trump turns everything on its head and blows through clearly established legal precedent as if it doesn’t exist. Fealty to precedent is the core of our legal system.”

If there’s a silver lining for her, it’s that she predicts the administration’s embrace of chaos will ultimately backfire. For example, she thinks that dropping military reservists on to the bench for six-month stints is a recipe for failure. Rather than expediting the backlog of asylum cases, it will unleash chaos, “screw up the records” and “make appeals go wild”.

“If you build by chaos, even if you’re right in what you construct,” she quipped, “it’s going to crumble.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f427fe2ca1a220fb01b06eafecded1b377f6e923/189_0_4081_3264/master/4081.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=27bd7586827656224c0ed5df1f74aaba",N,,2025-09-28 15:56:44.727644

Iowa Democrats are rallying behind a school superintendent who was arrested by ICE on allegations that he is in the country illegally this week, and they are led by a school board chair who once held a key role in the Obama White House.

After ICE arrested Ian Roberts, the superintendent for Des Moines Public Schools (DMPS) last week, school board chair Jackie Norris called for people to have ""radical empathy"" as Roberts' case plays out. Norris previously served as White House chief of staff for then-first lady Michelle Obama. Meanwhile, Republicans in the state legislature are also launching a probe into how the board chose Roberts in the first place.

Norris supported Roberts in a statement on Friday in which she said that officials ""do not have all the facts.""

""There is much we do not know,"" Norris said. ""However, what we do know is that Dr. Roberts has been an integral part of our school community since he joined over two years ago.""

""During his time with our district, he has shown up in ways big and small and has advocated for students and staff, and has begun introducing concepts that will help us reimagine education for future generations,"" she continued.

Norris said Roberts joined the school district in July 2023 after having served in various school districts across the U.S. for ""over 20 years."" Norris was not the chair of the school board at the time Roberts started, but she has been a member since 2021.

Meanwhile, Republicans in the Iowa legislature are calling for a wider probe to ensure proper hiring practices are being followed across the state. Iowa's House Government Oversight Committee also sent a letter to the DMPS directing it to preserve documents related to Roberts' hiring.

""I will not hesitate to introduce and pass legislation to mandate enhanced hiring protocols, increase transparency in district operations, and protect the resources allocated to our schools through the appropriations process,"" State Rep. Austin Harris said. ""Iowa’s families deserve nothing less than a safe, lawful, and effective education system for their children.""

DMPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

ICE alleges that Roberts is in the country illegally from Guyana. They say he is not legally permitted to work in the United States and had a final order of removal from a judge issued in May 2024.

Roberts was arrested after allegedly driving away from law enforcement. He later abandoned his car in the woods, and Iowa State Patrol ended up finding him, according to a press release.

""This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement,"" ICE ERO St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson said in a statement.

""This should be a wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats,"" Olson continued.

The Trump administration has made immigration enforcement arrests a top priority since it returned to office in January after Joe Biden’s presidency.","After days of clashes between federal officers and protesters at an immigration jail in his home state of Illinois, Democratic US senator Dick Durbin on Sunday renewed demands to meet with Trump administration immigration officials.

Durbin wrote on X that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) must be “accountable for its actions” amid the administration’s “cruel immigration crackdown”. The post on Sunday morning came after Saturday night protests and arrests at an immigration detention center in Broadview, Illinois.

For the preceding few days, federal officials have arrested protesters at the Broadview facility as Ice operations have escalated in Illinois.

Durbin, along with Illinois representative Delia Ramirez and other Democrats, have been pressing for a congressional oversight visit to the Broadview facility for weeks in connection with reports of poor conditions.

According to a letter written by Durbin and Ramirez on Friday, Democratic members of Congress have been unable to access the Broadview facility nor meet with immigration officials, as they have requested.

Durbin and Ramirez informed Ice earlier in September of an upcoming oversight visit to the facility, which members of congress are allowed to do. But Ice in Chicago told Durbin and Ramirez they were “unable to support a visit”, according to the letter, and instead offered a meeting to the Democratic delegation. Ice on Friday postponed that meeting “to an unconfirmed date in October”, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.

The Democratic pressure on Ice comes as protesters have clashed with officials at the Broadview site in recent days. On Saturday night, officials deployed pepper spray and rubber bullets and arrested a number of protesters outside the controversial immigration jail.

In one video posted online on Saturday night, US border patrol officials, who have been dispatched to the area to assist in the Ice operations, can be seen deploying what is colloquially referred to as teargas on protesters standing outside the facility.

The Trump administration has called the protesters “rioters”, accusing them of inciting violence. On Saturday afternoon, Ice posted on X: “Rioters will not deter Ice from its law enforcement mission. All those assaulting or obstructing will be held accountable. Full stop.” In another post on Sunday morning, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said 11 people were arrested outside the Ice facility – and that officials had confiscated two guns during the arrests.

In response, the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, decried the force used by federal officials at the site. He also called on protesters and bystanders to “document what you see with your phones and cameras”.

“The suggestion that chemical agents like tear gas or pepper spray could be used indiscriminately against peaceful demonstrators, or even first responders, is unacceptable and not normal,” Pritzker posted on X. “By observing and recording peacefully, we can ensure that any violations of the law are brought to light and those responsible are held accountable.”

Tensions in the Chicago area have been escalating in recent weeks after the Trump administration and DHS launched an operation they dubbed Midway Blitz. The operation led to an increase in the number of federal officials in the area targeting immigrants.

Already, the operation has led to a number of scandals for Ice and the Trump administration. Earlier in September, Ice shot and killed an immigrant they were trying to arrest in the Chicago area. Despite DHS saying an officer was “seriously injured” by the immigrant before the shooting, video later released seemed to contradict DHS’s claims.

A recent court filing by immigrants rights groups has also claimed that US citizens have been rounded up during the immigration enforcement operations in the area.

DHS says it launched Midway Blitz to target immigrants in the state, alleging that Pritzker and his “sanctuary policies” – a term meant to describe limitations on local police’s cooperating with federal immigration agents – welcomed undocumented immigrants.

ICE shooting victim update

What's new:

Stephany Gauffeny says she kept expecting a call from her husband after Joshua Jahn opened fire at the Dallas ICE facility.

But the call Gauffeny did receive was not one she was prepared for. Her husband, Miguel Angel Garcia, a Mexican national, was shot during the deadly attack.

The two other victims in the attack, one of whom has died, were identified by the Department of Homeland Security earlier Saturday.

What they're saying:

""They called me, 'Your husband is in the hospital and he’s alive. That's all we know. Go to the hospital,'"" Gauffeny said.

Garcia now lies in a hospital bed in grave condition.

""It's a lot of uncertainty... We don't know if he’s going to wake up, will he ever wake up, or if he does wake up. We don't know what function he can have. You know, anything can change,"" Gauffeny said.

""Let him know the kids love him. The kids miss you. Please fight for our kids and for the baby on the way. He was really excited to meet the baby,"" Gauffeny said.

A man with so much to fight for had been on the final steps of fixing his immigration status right before the attack.

""And I just try to let him know, I'm here with you. I know you hear me. No, don't give up praying for you. I'm sorry this happened to you,"" Gauffeny said.

And while he fights for his life, his wife is fighting for change.

""Justice for him. He was under ICE custody,"" Gauffeny said.

""For this to not happen again. These types of attacks… and for this to be prevented. For detainees to have more protection if they're under their custody,"" Gauffeny said.

And for people to know his name

""I just want people to know. To put a face to a name. You hear about, ‘Oh victim,’ but he was more than just a victim. He was a real person. He is a real person. He has a lot of people who love him. A son, a father, a friend,"" Gauffeny said.

""A human being. Just because he was a detainee doesn’t mean he was a criminal,"" said Gauffeny.

According to ICE, Garcia had been convicted of DWI and evading arrest. DHS included that he was previously convicted for giving fictitious information and fleeing police.

What's next:

The family is trying to raise money right now to cover hospital expenses, as well as help support Garcia’s family as he was their sole provider.

Dallas ICE facility shooting

The backstory:

The FBI is investigating Wednesday morning's shooting at a Dallas ICE facility as an act of targeted violence.

Officials said a sniper on the roof of a nearby building fired indiscriminately at the detention center, hitting three detainees who were arriving in a transport van. One of those detainees was killed, and two others were critically injured. No law enforcement officers were hurt.

Sources identified the shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, who had ties to North Texas and Oklahoma. Investigators said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound as agents approached him.

While a motive for the shooting has not been released, bullets reportedly found at the scene had an anti-ICE message.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/screenshot-2025-09-26-164821.png?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-28 19:56:54.899235

leaders and Mr. Trump negotiate with them.
But Mr. Thune signaled that his position had not changed.
“Keep the government open, and then let’s have a conversation about those premium tax credits,” Mr. Thune said on “Meet the Press.” “I’m certainly open to that.
“The choice remains the same,” Mr. Thune said in a statement.","President Trump will meet with the four top congressional leaders at the White House on Monday, the day before a deadline to avert a government shutdown, the lawmakers said.

Congress faces a Tuesday deadline to fund the government, which will require lawmakers to agree on a spending measure that can win at least 60 votes in the Senate. But Republicans control only 53 seats and need support from Democrats, who have been demanding that G.O.P. leaders and Mr. Trump negotiate with them.

But even as leaders of both parties agreed to a meeting, it was unclear whether Mr. Trump intended to reach a bipartisan compromise or if he was summoning Democrats to press them to accept Republicans’ funding proposal.

In an interview on CNN, Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday that the president was “always open to discussion.” But when pressed on whether Mr. Trump intended to negotiate a deal, Mr. Johnson sidestepped the question and accused Democrats of holding government funds hostage for “partisan demands.”

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Monday’s meeting was “only a first step” and emphasized the need for a bipartisan agreement to keep the government funded.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant, and just yell at Democrats, and talk about all his alleged grievances, and say this, that, and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” he said. “But my hope is it’ll be a serious negotiation”

Republicans have been trying to advance a temporary funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, or C.R., that keeps federal spending levels flat. Such measures have become routine on Capitol Hill to avoid shutdowns, and Republicans have pointed out that they repeatedly agreed to such bills in the past.

Mr. Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leaders, have tied their support to securing funding to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, and to reversing the cuts to Medicaid and other health programs that Republicans made unilaterally over the summer.

“Our position is clear,” Mr. Jeffries said on Sunday in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “Cancel the cuts, lower the costs, save health care”

Mr. Trump has rejected Democrats’ funding demands as unreasonable. Last week, he canceled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders after a phone call with Mr. Johnson and Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader.

Mr. Schumer told “Meet the Press” that he called Mr. Thune on Friday to press him to set up a meeting with Mr. Trump and the other congressional leaders, and that the White House agreed to the meeting on Saturday night. “I think they felt the heat, and they now want to sit down,” he said.

But Mr. Thune signaled that his position had not changed. He told NBC that he was open to discussing the insurance subsidies at a later date but that he still did not think it appropriate to address them in a stopgap measure to fund the government.

“Keep the government open, and then let’s have a conversation about those premium tax credits,” Mr. Thune said on “Meet the Press.” “I’m certainly open to that. I think we all are.”

Republicans’ stopgap bill would keep federal spending mostly at current levels through Nov. 21 and provide $88 million in emergency funding to bolster security for the members of the executive branch, the Supreme Court and Congress after the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Mr. Johnson and Mr. Thune both maintained on Sunday that the seven-week continuing resolution would give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan spending bills that would help them address the Affordable Care Act subsidies.

“The choice remains the same,” Mr. Thune said in a statement. “Democrats can either vote for a clean, short-term, nonpartisan C.R. that prioritizes the American people, or they can choose a completely avoidable shutdown that prioritizes politics above all else.”

But Democrats have urged swifter action, saying that the subsidies need to be addressed before millions of Americans enrolled in plans under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, start to sign up for health care coverage in November.

And furious over the White House’s repeated efforts to cancel spending that Congress previously approved, they have suggested that bipartisan spending agreements also need safeguards to restrict the Trump administration’s ability to claw back such funding.

They have also condemned a recent threat by Trump administration officials to fire scores of federal employees during a shutdown, accusing the White House of trying to intimidate them into dropping their proposal.

Trump’s climbdown comes days after he scrapped a planned meeting to discuss the crisis with Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, the respective Democratic minority leaders in the House and Senate.

The president accused the pair of making “unserious and ridiculous demands” in return for Democratic votes to support a Republican funding agreement to keep the government open beyond Tuesday night – but left the door open for a meeting “if they get serious about the future of our nation”.

Johnson, appearing on CNN, said he spoke with Trump at length on Saturday, and that the two Democrats had agreed to join him and John Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, for an Oval Office discussion Monday.

He did not say if Trump would be negotiating directly with the Democrats – but portrayed Trump as keen to “try to convince them to follow common sense and do what’s right by the American people”.

Schumer, talking to NBC’s Meet the Press, said he was “hopeful we can get something real done” – but was uncertain of the mood they would find Trump in when they sat down for the 2pm ET discourse.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant, and just yell at Democrats, and talk about all his alleged grievances, and say this, that, and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” Schumer said.

“We don’t want a shutdown. We hope that they sit down and have a serious negotiation with us.”

According to CBS News on Sunday, meanwhile, Trump is not hopeful the meeting will lead to an agreement.

The network’s chief national correspondent, Robert Costa, told Face the Nation he spoke with Trump by phone Sunday morning and that a government shutdown “looks likely at this point based on my conversation … He says both sides are at a stalemate.”

Costa said: “Inside the White House, sources are saying president Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse.”

If no deal is reached, chunks of the federal government are set to shut down as early as Wednesday morning, with the White House telling agencies to prepare to furlough or fire scores of workers.

Republican and Democratic leaders have been pointing fingers of blame at each other for days as Tuesday’s deadline for a funding agreement approaches.

The narrow House Republican majority passed a short-term spending bill known as a continuing resolution earlier in September that would keep the government funded for seven weeks – but it faces opposition in the Senate, where it needs the support of at least eight Democrats to pass.

Democrats have made the extension of expiring healthcare protections a condition of their support, warning that planned Republican spending cuts would affect millions of people.

“If we don’t extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits, more than 20 million Americans are going to experience dramatically increased premiums, copays, deductibles, in an environment where the cost of living in America is already too high,” Jeffries told CNN on Sunday.

“We’ve made clear that we’re ready, willing and able to sit down with anyone, at any time and at any place, in order to make sure that we can actually fund the government, avoid a painful Republican caused shutdown, and address the healthcare crisis that Republicans have caused that’s [affecting] everyday Americans.”

But Trump and Republicans have repeatedly accused their political opponents of exploiting the issue to force a shutdown while there was still plenty of time to fix healthcare before the subsidies expire on 31 December.

“The Obamacare subsidies is a policy debate that has to be determined by the end of the year, not right now, while we’re simply trying to keep the government open so we can have all these debates,” Johnson said.

“There is nothing partisan about this continuing resolution, nothing. We didn’t add a single partisan priority or policy rider at all. We’re operating completely in good faith to get more time.”

Thune, on Meet the Press, also attempted to blame Democrats for the potential shutdown and said “the ball is in their court” as to the next development.

“There is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now, we could pick it up today and pass it, that has been passed by the House that will be signed into law by the president to keep the government open,” he said.

“What the Democrats have done is take the federal government as a hostage, and by extension the American people, to try [to] get a whole laundry list of things that they want.”

But US senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who has previously urged his party leadership to be stronger in standing up to the Trump administration, said the problem was Republicans handing “a complete blank check” to the president to spend money on his own political interests, and not those of the nation.

“Until now the president has said he’d rather shut down the government than prevent those healthcare costs from spiking,” he told CNN.

“Democrats are united right now on this question. I’m glad we’re finally talking. We’ll see what happens.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/590b2dbe8c19e337f811fba45e219e1a0e11bf3f/170_0_4619_3697/master/4619.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b7e70de0d0f99485d64e653bb60b607e",N,,2025-09-28 13:56:53.447042

U.S. Customs and Border Protection Chief Gregory Bovino was on the scene in Broadview beginning Saturday morning, and he seems to have stayed through the evening.

Bovino was seen driving by the Broadview ICE facility in a caravan first thing Saturday morning. He was being filmed by ICE agents around him.

He was seen returning Saturday night, leading federal agents in front of the building in Broadview. That was really when the most intense moments unfolded, as clouds of tear gas filled the air.

Several journalists, including CBS News Chicago's teams, were caught up in the chaos.

Several people were detained as agents and protesters clashed when the gates opened, and demonstrators would attempt to block the road.

Bovino was the top Border Patrol agent in California's El Centro sector until he was given command of a broader immigration enforcement campaign across the state in June.

Over the past several months, Bovino has become one of the most visible public faces of the Trump administration's aggressive effort to detain those living in the country unlawfully. He has accompanied rank-and-file agents on arrest operations and posted slickly edited videos of those sweeps on social media.

Saturday was the first time Bovino was seen in action in Chicago. He posted a video to X showing multiple ICE detainments outside Home Depot stores and other areas in the city.

Back in Broadview, the village said its fire department was told agents would launch enforcement all day by deploying chemicals like tear gas and pepper spray against citizens, residents, and first responders.

""It's scary because they are already firing non-lethal rounds at us,"" said Bryan Brannon, who has been protesting outside the facility all week. ""I worry that at some point they are going to get scared and start using lethal rounds or something.""

The Village of Broadview issued a news release Saturday reading in part: ""In retaliation for the Village of Broadview yesterday calling on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency to ""stop making war on our community"", ICE agents this morning informed the Broadview Police Department that there will be 'a s**t show' in Broadview today.""

The village said the profanity was used in a verbal comment between Broadview police and ICE. When asked about the expletive, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was made up.

""This is made up,"" Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""Our law enforcement enforces the rule of law. Period.""

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker released a statement reacting to the federal deployment in Broadview, saying in part, ""Illinois will always defend Americans' right to peacefully protest and make their voices heard. We denounce any violence against the general public, members of the media, and law enforcement or first responders.""

He was held in the Woodbury County Jail in Sioux City, in northwest Iowa, about 150 miles from Des Moines.

The Des Moines school board voted unanimously to place Superintendent Ian Roberts on paid leave during a three-minute-long special meeting. The board said Roberts was not available to carry out his duties for the 30,000-student district and stated that officials would reassess his status after getting more information.

After the meeting, school board president Jackie Norris read a statement, saying word of Roberts’ arrest Friday made for a “jarring day” but noting that board members still didn’t have all the facts.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said agents detained Roberts because he was in the country illegally, didn’t have authorization to work and was subject to a final removal order issued in 2024. ICE agents stopped Roberts while he was driving a school-issued vehicle, and the agency said he then fled into a wooded area before being apprehended with help from Iowa State Patrol officers.

He was held in the Woodbury County Jail in Sioux City, in northwest Iowa, about 150 miles from Des Moines.

“I want to be clear, no one here was aware of any citizenship or immigration issues that Dr. Roberts may have been facing,” Norris said. “The accusations ICE had made against Dr. Roberts are very serious, and we are taking them very seriously.”

Norris said Roberts has retained a Des Moines law firm to represent him. Lawyer Alfredo Parrish confirmed his firm was representing Roberts but declined to comment on his case.

Norris also repeated that the district had done a background check on Roberts before he was hired that didn’t indicate any problems and that he signed a form affirming he was a U.S. citizen. A company that aided in the search for a superintendent in 2023 also hired another firm to conduct “comprehensive criminal, credit and background checks” on Roberts that didn’t indicate any citizenship issues, Norris said.

Also Saturday, the Iowa Department of Education released a statement saying Roberts stated he was a U.S. citizen when he applied for an administrator license. The department said the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners conducted a criminal history check with state and federal authorities before issuing a license.

The department said it is reviewing the Des Moines district’s hiring procedures for ensuring people are authorized to work in the U.S.

Roberts had previously said he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and spent much of his childhood in Brooklyn, New York. He competed in the 2000 Olympics in track and field for Guyana.

ICE said he entered the U.S. on a student visa in 1999.

A former senior Guyanese police official on Saturday remembered Roberts as a middle-distance runner who could have risen through the ranks of the South American country’s police force had he not emigrated to the U.S. decades ago. Retired assistant Guyana Police Force commissioner Paul Slowe said Roberts entered the Police Force after graduating from the country’s standard military officers’ course.

“He served for a few years and then left. He was not dismissed or dishonorably discharged at all; he just moved on,” Slowe told The Associated Press. “He was a good, promising and disciplined man.”

And that is the mark of fundamentalism: not just to speak, but to declare speech holy.
We imagine fundamentalism as the product of religion alone, but in truth it is about power.
It is time to see the truth we’ve trained ourselves to ignore: that the politics of faith are not a distant problem but a domestic one.
That prophecy and scripture are invoked to shape our laws, and our laws shape our lives.","I was a political science student in college when 9-11 happened. Almost overnight, the air in our classrooms thickened with talk of the Middle East—of regimes and sects, of the supposed sickness in other people’s faith. At the same time, I sat in lectures on American government, absorbing lessons on freedom, the separation of church and state, and the principles that anchor a democracy. The story was tidy: Extremism existed “over there,” and here was civility, rationality, liberty.

But even then, I felt the story was too neat. We were trained to see extremism as foreign, an affliction of others. No one asked us to look for it in our own pulpits, in our own chambers of power, where faith is wielded not only as belief but as authority.

For decades, we were told that extremism abroad is born of poverty, oppression, and lack of democracy. That dignity and fair governance could inoculate against violence. Yet here at home, the extremists are not poor. They are not desperate. They are wealthy, white, and privileged, carrying Bibles in one hand and power in the other. These are the people shaping foreign policy, writing the rules of engagement, and insisting that God Himself is on their side.

It is easy to sneer at fundamentalism when it wears a beard and prays to a different God. We do this without noticing how our own leaders claim the same divine sanction. Take Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who recently said, “Those who bless Israel will be blessed, and those who curse Israel will be cursed,” a statement guiding policy on the basis of religious prophecy. As a result, borders are drawn and redrawn, not by maps or treaties, but by the conviction that scripture demands it. Tanks move forward because some believe the end times will be hastened by the blood spilled today. I have heard lawmakers speak of Israel not as a nation among nations, but as a ticket for their own salvation—a stage for the rapture. Lives are traded away for a promise written in ancient ink. Too often, it is prophecy, not policy, that carries the weight of law.

The divine is always invoked to conquer, to exclude, to strip away the humanity of others.

Charlie Kirk was another voice in this chorus. His platform rested on the claim that his words bore the imprint of Jesus Himself. And that is the mark of fundamentalism: not just to speak, but to declare speech holy. Not just to pass laws, but to claim the laws come from God. When movements convince their followers that every act of war, every border drawn, every vote cast is sanctified, fundamentalism is no longer a fringe—it is the system itself.

This is America’s problem. We imagine fundamentalism as the product of religion alone, but in truth it is about power. It thrives in systems that punish dissent and demand obedience. It flourishes where inequality is already deep, where racism already wounds. Whether it calls itself Christian nationalism or Zionism, the fruit is the same: oppression disguised as divine order.

Christian nationalism, in particular, is theater. Fear of the stranger is the script. The Gospels are props—quoted when convenient, discarded when not. The gun becomes holy; violence is celebrated as sacrament; scripture appears only to bless white entitlement and empire. And somehow, the divine is always invoked to conquer, to exclude, to strip away the humanity of others.

“Love the stranger as yourself” has been rewritten into “expel the immigrant.” “Turn the other cheek” has become “press his cheek into the ground.” The inversion is so stark you can only call it blasphemy.

It is time to see the truth we’ve trained ourselves to ignore: that the politics of faith are not a distant problem but a domestic one. That prophecy and scripture are invoked to shape our laws, and our laws shape our lives. That the moral high ground, so often claimed, is little more than a thin veneer of power and entitlement.

We are not exempt from the damage. We are participants in it. And we cannot keep pretending that America’s fundamentalists are not pulling the strings.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56522936&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C242%2C0%2C243,N,,2025-09-28 13:56:57.523951

“Federal workers stay for the mission.
Several thousands of additional federal workers have been fired as part of reduction in force mandates ordered by the administration.
“It’s a huge grieving process,” said a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee who took the deferred resignation offer.
Another employee at the US Department of Agriculture was fired in February as a probationary employee, reinstated in April only to take the deferred resignation offer.","The Trump administration is set to oversee the largest mass resignation in US history on Tuesday, with more than 100,000 federal workers set to formally quit as part of the latest wave of its deferred resignation program.

With Congress facing a deadline of Tuesday to authorize more funding or spark a government shutdown, the White House has also ordered federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings of workers if the partisan fight fails to yield a deal.

Workers preparing to leave government as part of the resignation program – one of several pillars of Donald Trump’s sweeping cuts to the federal workforce – have described how months of “fear and intimidation” left them feeling like they had no choice but to depart.

“Federal workers stay for the mission. When that mission is taken away, when they’re scapegoated, when their job security is uncertain, and when their tiny semblance of work-life balance is stripped away, they leave,” a longtime employee at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) told the Guardian. “That’s why I left.”

The total resignation program is set to cost $14.8bn, with 200,000 workers paid their full salary and benefits while on administrative leave for up to eight months, according to a Senate Democrats’ report in July.

Trump officials argue this outlay is worth it. The Office of Personnel Management claimed the one-time costs lower longer-term spending by the federal government. It also criticized job protections of federal civil servants, claiming the government should have a “modern, at-will employment framework like most employers”.

A spokesperson for the White House claimed there was “no additional cost to the government” as employees would have received their salaries regardless of the program. “In fact, this is the largest and most effective workforce reduction plan in history and will save the government $28bn annually,” they added.

The total number of expected departures through the delayed resignation and voluntary separation programs, attrition, and early retirement programs is about 275,000 employees, the spokesman said.

Several thousands of additional federal workers have been fired as part of reduction in force mandates ordered by the administration. The mass exodus is the largest single-year decline in civilian federal employment since the second world war.

Federal employees who took the deferred resignation offer requested to speak anonymously in hopes of returning to the federal government in the future and to protect future job prospects.

They are entering a lagging job market as the unemployment rate in August 2025 ticked up to 4.3%, the highest since 2021, and only 22,000 jobs were added amid disruptions and uncertainty caused by Trump’s tariffs.

“It’s a huge grieving process,” said a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employee who took the deferred resignation offer. “Myself and many others that I know really hoped that we would finish our careers with the government. We felt very tied, especially in the VA, to the mission.

“Many of us thought we could do better for our clients, for our veterans outside of the VA, and a lot of us were so burnt out from the six months before the deferred resignation that it was actually a mental health decision for many as well.”

Communicating why they left has been challenging while searching for a new job, the VA employee said. “The job market stinks right now,” they said. “It’s great to not be working 60 to 70 hours a week any more, but you also lose your support system from those that stayed, and from those that may judge you for leaving.”

An archaeologist at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and military veteran, said they “loved” their job, but took the deferred resignation out of fear and pressure from the administration. “I was forced to accept the resignation plan. “Not physically, or through any legal means, but through fear and intimidation,” they said.

They cited comments from Russell Vought, Trump’s head of the Office of Management and Budget, who said of federal workers last October: “When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down … We want to put them in trauma.”

“This is exactly what happened,” the USDA worker said. “I was scared to go to work. Scared that the next day would be the day I would get fired, or barred from future service, scared I would wait too long to leave and not find a job, and just living everyday like a raw nerve.”

The public vilification of federal workers has pushed many to take the resignation program, the archaeologist suggested, as they were constantly inundated with threats of cuts and firings.

Another employee at the US Department of Agriculture was fired in February as a probationary employee, reinstated in April only to take the deferred resignation offer.

“At that point, I felt they could terminate me at any time,” they told the Guardian. “It’s hard to focus on your work when they can just send you an email and you can be gone, and they completely changed the terms of my work. I was hoping things would stabilize and there would be an opportunity to go back, but now it doesn’t look like there will be an opportunity.”

The American Federation of Government Employees and other labor unions representing federal workers filed a lawsuit that is still ongoing over the deferred resignation program earlier this year, alleging the buyout circumvents congressional authority, undermines statutorily required functions of government agencies in losing employees en masse, and was enacted with the threat of firings.

“Purging the federal government of dedicated career federal employees will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,” said AFGE president Everett Kelley in February. “This offer should not be viewed as voluntary.

“Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration’s goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e118071ad5e69be7099b8403cf5ab345f95f9dd8/46_255_4681_3745/master/4681.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad4dbc2a2321a203097c548009e3b819",N,,2025-09-28 12:57:41.821573

Now the self-made billionaire and longtime Republican campaign donor watches uncomfortably from South Florida as President Donald Trump takes many of the same steps he saw under Fidel Castro.

Like many people who fled to the United States from authoritarian regimes, Fernandez says the United States appears to be at a tipping point, with Trump centralizing power to silence dissent and punish people he's declared as enemies, while bullying private businesses to fall in line.

""There's something wrong, and we all know it,"" Fernandez told USA TODAY. ""Many people are hoping it's going to go away on its own, and it's not going to go away on its own.""

The billionaire émigré added: ""I'm scared of how fast we're moving.""

Trump argues that the 2024 election he won represents a mandate from American voters who endorsed his muscular leadership approach. Trump has justified his actions as necessary to secure the United States from both an ""invasion"" of immigrants and what he describes as the unwillingness of Democratic officials to stamp out visible homelessness, halt certain types of crimes and prevent civil disorder.

A historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in August of his first years in office − both as the 45th and 47th presidents − are lower than any other modern president at the same time in their administrations. In Gallup's polling, roughly 40% currently approve of Trump's job performance.

Despite the unfavorable polling, Trump has repeatedly suggested that he would serve a third term as president ‒ although the Constitution prevents him from being elected again ‒ and openly mused about how other countries have cancelled elections during war or other national emergencies.

Warning signs of authoritarianism

People who have fled authoritarian regimes say it's a combination of actions that are cause for concern right now in the United States, especially after Trump declared at activist Charlie Kirk's funeral that he ""hates"" his opponents. Those interviewed by USA TODAY raised a host of parallels they see between the authoritarian leadership of their native countries and Trump's actions over the last eight months:

Routine use of military forces to disperse anti-government protests, especially over the objection of local officials, as happened in California and Washington, DC.

Declarations that certain rights, especially for certain groups, must be curtailed because of a national emergency, such as ending due process hearings for accused undocumented immigrants.

Singling out of minority groups for harsh and selective prosecutions, often based on old laws. The White House has argued its immigration crackdown largely reflects a return to enforcing existing law that successive past presidents ignored.

Reduced access to legal counsel, especially for those targeted minority groups.

Nationalization of businesses deemed critical to the government's success. Trump announced on Aug. 22 that the federal government would purchase a 10% stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, and has expressed interest in buying into other companies as well.

Frequent reminders of the government's power and role in dominating public life, in part with monuments and banners dedicated to the leader. Earlier this year, three federal buildings in DC were festooned with giant images of the president.

Lack of free and fair elections, with leaders manipulating the system to remain in power. Trump has pressured several Republican-led states, including Texas, to redistrict to make it easier for Republicans to win seats in Congress. He has also spoken against popular mail-in ballots, saying without evidence that they are ripe for fraud.

Using government power to punish or silence opponents and journalists, and declaring them enemies, as Trump has most recently done with late-night host, Jimmy Kimmel.

The Trump administration has argued that each one of these actions is necessary and consistent with its Make America Great Again agenda, and that the Biden administration was guilty of many seemingly authoritarian measures, too.

Tanks as common as ice cream trucks

For Eddie Flores, growing up in El Salvador meant seeing military tanks rolling through neighborhoods as often as ice cream trucks. Flores' family fled the country's devastating civil war when he was 7.

Last year, he became the first Salvadoran-born immigrant elected mayor of South San Francisco.

Now, along with balancing the city's biotech cluster and creeping gentrification, he's also helping coordinate neighborhood groups opposed to Trump's mass immigration sweeps. More than a third of the city’s residents are Hispanic, and despite concerns ahead of the city’s popular Cultura Fest in August, no disruptions occurred.

In the Los Angeles area, Trump's ICE agents have swept up thousands of undocumented immigrants, sometimes chasing them through the streets or farm fields. Protests against the ICE raids became violent, and Trump then deployed active-duty Marines and members of the California National Guard onto city streets over the objection of local officials.

Trump has also deployed the National Guard to Washington, DC, and has threatened to unleash his newly renamed ""Department of War"" into Chicago.

""I constantly tell my staff that we have to remain proactive and have systems in place before any harm arrives,"" Flores said. ""It's about consistently showing up for your neighbors, not just when they are in need, so they don't have to live in the shadows.""

He added: ""Authoritarianism has no place in a country built on pluralism, and we as leaders have to safeguard that promise.""

Recognizing patterns of behavior

For a 41-year-old immigrant from the Middle East, the United States had long been a bastion of freedoms ‒ a place where the right to criticize the government is written into the nation's founding documents. Several members of his family have been detained in his home country for years for speaking out against their leaders.

""We came here to express ourselves and have found ourselves in this dilemma that we'd never thought we'd face,"" said the man, who USA TODAY agreed not to identify.

The man, a legal researcher who lives legally in the United States, is worried he might be targeted by the federal government for speaking freely. ""It's very, very ironic that we now suggest to folks who are visiting us from outside the United States to delete apps, delete text conversations, delete images even though they are completely innocent.""

The man, who is also a human rights expert for a nonprofit, said he's watched in fear as Trump has attacked the rule of law, singled out minority groups for harsh prosecution and declared emergencies or accused people of terrorism to justify some of his actions. He said Americans should heed the warnings of refugees like him who have lived under oppressive regimes and can recognize the patterns playing out.

It's easy for people in society's mainstream to think what's happening to minority groups will never happen to them, he said, adding that he has been disappointed more Americans haven't been trying to halt Trump, given the country's founding system of checks-and-balances brought by the courts, Congress and a free press.

""It's going to reach you at some point, and when it does, there'll be nobody there for you because you were never there for them,"" he said.

Echoing childhood memories

Like many other people who sought safety in the United States, Davis, California, resident Griselda Gonzalez said watching federal troops patrolling Los Angeles conjured up painful childhood memories.

The Salvadoran native can vividly recall when she was 10, as guerrilla fighters stormed her hometown of San Salvador, the nation’s capital. The complex and brutal civil war in her country killed thousands. Visions of explosions and constant gunfire, even in the smallest neighborhoods, sometimes pop into her head.

Today, she's a married mother of three with a successful family-owned commercial moving company. But she said she's shocked by how much the United States now resembles the country she fled: constant threats of military deployments, along with ICE raids targeting people who look like her.

""Five years ago, we were all fighting for our lives with COVID-19,"" said Gonzalez, who became a naturalized citizen in 2014. ""Now we're worried about fighting for our basic rights?""

Done staying quiet

Fernandez, the Cuban refugee and American-made billionaire, became a U.S. citizen after serving as an Army paratrooper. He said he's long been content to influence U.S. politics by funding political candidates, most of them Republicans.

But after watching how Trump and the people around him are behaving ‒ including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, whom he once strongly supported ‒ Fernandez said he's done staying quiet.

He has begun funding a pro-immigrant campaign, bought anti-Trump advertisements in newspapers and is preparing to spend his fortune fighting what he sees as creeping authoritarianism and tyranny within the United States.

""If I go back to zero, I will do so because I came here with nothing and I owe this country to reinvest to defend it from within,"" Fernandez said. ""I think I owe it to the country. I owe it to my children and grandchildren to come back to a place where due process matters.""

The American people have more power than they think, said Fernandez.

""The more we speak as a group, the less likely we are to be targeted. I see myself being targeted already. Will I stop? No,"" he said, encouraging everyone to speak out against what he sees as the president's anti-Americanism.

""America used to be a great country,"" he added. ""It isn't anymore, in the way it's been designed by the current administration.""

“Let him be friendly with the generals and admirals from all over the world,” Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Huckabee, a vocal supporter of the state of Israel, as ambassador shortly after being re-elected.
Mr. Trump signed an executive order this week targeting antifa, a loosely defined left-wing antifascist movement.
In his order, Mr. Trump said that he was declaring antifa a “domestic terrorist organization” — a designation that does not actually exist under U.S. law.","But for Mr. Trump, who has long favored images of himself surrounded by military leaders, such a setting may prove irresistible.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who summoned the generals and admirals, is expected to speak about grooming and fitness requirements, and other aspects of what he calls a shift toward a “warrior ethos” at the Pentagon.

Mr. Trump appeared unfamiliar with the meeting when he was asked about it during an Oval Office appearance on Thursday, but he quickly said it was good that Mr. Hegseth had organized it.

“Let him be friendly with the generals and admirals from all over the world,” Mr. Trump said. “You act like this is a bad thing. Isn’t it nice that people are coming from all over the world to be with us?”

Few details about the event have been disclosed, not even to the officers expected to attend. The secrecy has sparked alarm at a time when Mr. Trump is accelerating military action against drug trafficking boats that he says are coming from Venezuela, as well as deploying the National Guard in Washington, D.C., and Memphis for law-enforcement purposes and using troops to guard federal facilities.

Military specialists have voiced increasing alarm over Mr. Trump’s tendency to treat the military as an arm of politics. Speaking to troops at military bases, the president often uses the occasion to bash his political rivals, liberals and the news media.

During a speech at Fort Bragg in June, Mr. Trump led troops to boo journalists and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

On Saturday, two Democratic senators on the Armed Services Committee, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, criticized Tuesday’s meeting as a costly and disruptive political stunt that posed potential security risks.

“This gathering would represent an unprecedented concentration of senior military leadership in one location simply to hear you speak about standards and ethos at significant cost and with potentially serious security implications,” the senators said in a letter to Mr. Hegseth.

“For an administration obsessed with rooting out waste, this abrupt, time and resource-intensive meeting of our military’s top commanders,” the senators continued, “is absurd.”

But even as leaders of both parties agreed to a meeting, it was unclear whether Mr. Trump intended to reach a bipartisan compromise or if he was summoning Democrats to press them to accept Republicans’ funding proposal.

In an interview on CNN, Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday that the president was “always open to discussion.” But when pressed on whether Mr. Trump intended to negotiate a deal, Mr. Johnson sidestepped the question and accused Democrats of holding government funds hostage for “partisan demands.”

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Monday’s meeting was “only a first step” and emphasized the need for a bipartisan agreement to keep the government funded.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant, and just yell at Democrats, and talk about all his alleged grievances, and say this, that, and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” he said. “But my hope is it’ll be a serious negotiation”

Republicans have been trying to advance a temporary funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, or C.R., that keeps federal spending levels flat. Such measures have become routine on Capitol Hill to avoid shutdowns, and Republicans have pointed out that they repeatedly agreed to such bills in the past.

Mr. Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leaders, have tied their support to securing funding to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, and to reversing the cuts to Medicaid and other health programs that Republicans made unilaterally over the summer.

“Our position is clear,” Mr. Jeffries said on Sunday in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “Cancel the cuts, lower the costs, save health care”

Mr. Trump has rejected Democrats’ funding demands as unreasonable. Last week, he canceled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders after a phone call with Mr. Johnson and Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader.

Mr. Schumer told “Meet the Press” that he called Mr. Thune on Friday to press him to set up a meeting with Mr. Trump and the other congressional leaders, and that the White House agreed to the meeting on Saturday night. “I think they felt the heat, and they now want to sit down,” he said.

But Mr. Thune signaled that his position had not changed. He told NBC that he was open to discussing the insurance subsidies at a later date but that he still did not think it appropriate to address them in a stopgap measure to fund the government.

“Keep the government open, and then let’s have a conversation about those premium tax credits,” Mr. Thune said on “Meet the Press.” “I’m certainly open to that. I think we all are.”

Republicans’ stopgap bill would keep federal spending mostly at current levels through Nov. 21 and provide $88 million in emergency funding to bolster security for the members of the executive branch, the Supreme Court and Congress after the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Mr. Johnson and Mr. Thune both maintained on Sunday that the seven-week continuing resolution would give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan spending bills that would help them address the Affordable Care Act subsidies.

“The choice remains the same,” Mr. Thune said in a statement. “Democrats can either vote for a clean, short-term, nonpartisan C.R. that prioritizes the American people, or they can choose a completely avoidable shutdown that prioritizes politics above all else.”

But Democrats have urged swifter action, saying that the subsidies need to be addressed before millions of Americans enrolled in plans under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, start to sign up for health care coverage in November.

And furious over the White House’s repeated efforts to cancel spending that Congress previously approved, they have suggested that bipartisan spending agreements also need safeguards to restrict the Trump administration’s ability to claw back such funding.

They have also condemned a recent threat by Trump administration officials to fire scores of federal employees during a shutdown, accusing the White House of trying to intimidate them into dropping their proposal.

It would likely be the first official visit to Egypt in decades by a sitting U.S. ambassador to Israel, and is expected to include a meeting with Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, according to the three officials.

It is not yet clear what role the current U.S. ambassador to Egypt, Herro Mustafa Garg, who was appointed during the Biden administration, will play in the talks.

The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mr. Huckabee’s visit comes amid strained relations between Israel and Egypt, largely over the war in Gaza, which borders both nations.

Egypt has criticized Israel’s ground assault on Gaza City, where nearly one million Palestinians were sheltering until recently, fearing that the fighting could force hundreds of thousands of Gazans across the Egyptian border into the Sinai Peninsula, which also borders Israel.

Israeli news media has reported that Israeli officials raised concerns to Washington about an Egyptian buildup of military forces in the Sinai. The Egyptian government said publicly last week, in a statement responding to media reports about the troop buildup, that its troops were in Sinai to defend Egypt’s borders against all threats. Egypt has also denied Israel’s contention that the troops were there in violation of the peace treaty it signed with Israel in 1979.

Mr. Huckabee is expected to address the tensions between the two countries, both of which receive substantial U.S. military aid, during his visit to Cairo, the three officials said.

The talks will also include a new plan to end the war that President Trump shared with Arab and Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this week, according to two of the officials.

Mr. Trump appointed Mr. Huckabee, a vocal supporter of the state of Israel, as ambassador shortly after being re-elected.

Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel after they signed the 1979 peace treaty, ending decades of wars. They have since gradually developed ties, sharing intelligence, striking major energy deals and maintaining direct communication between their leaders.

But the ongoing Gaza war, started by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, has driven a wedge between the two countries. Egypt has acted as a mediator, alongside Qatar and the United States, in cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.

Earlier this month, Israel struck a residential building in Doha, Qatar’s capital, where senior Hamas leaders were staying, killing five people affiliated with Hamas and a member of the Qatari internal security forces. Since the attack, it has remained unclear whether cease-fire negotiations will resume, and if Qatar will continue to play a role as a mediator.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt condemned the strike, warning that Israel was risking its diplomatic ties with Arab states. He said the strike “places obstacles before any new peace agreements and even strains the existing peace accords with countries in the region.”

Like Mr. Trump’s other dispatches of federal forces, the Portland directive was quickly opposed by state and local officials, who called it unnecessary.

Gov. Tina Kotek, a Democrat, said in an afternoon news briefing that she had spoken with the president and Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, on Saturday, and that she had told them to stay out. She did not plan to approve the use of the state’s National Guard, she added.

“Portland is doing just fine. I made that very clear to the president,” she said from the city’s downtown riverfront, as bicyclists and pontoon boats passed behind her. “We got this. We are doing fine. There is no insurrection. We do not need or want federal troops in Oregon.”

Ms. Kotek, who said that she learned of the president’s declaration after “waking up to the news on social media, like everyone else,” declined to reveal what Mr. Trump had told her, other than that he had agreed to continue talking.

Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post that, at Ms. Noem’s request, he had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists.”

He added: “I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.”

It was not immediately clear what Mr. Trump meant by “full force.” Portland is one of the Democratic-led cities that has been in the president’s sights; he previously threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago to combat crime, though he has not yet done so.

In a statement, the Pentagon said it was “aware of the president’s directive to mobilize military personnel to Portland.”

Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, said in an interview that Oregon’s state and congressional leaders had not heard from the administration before the president’s social media post, despite repeated requests for information and for a chance to provide input. He and other civic leaders said they were puzzled by what they viewed as a fixation with Portland.

“Anytime he sees a TV show that involves even a mention of Portland, he gets all worked up. You can set your clock by it,” he said. “A lot of his policies come by whim. So we need to push back, push back, push back until he gets another whim.”

Mr. Wyden said that he and other Democratic members of Congress were exploring ways they might respond if the administration did take steps they considered abuses of presidential power.

Demonstrators have been camped outside the ICE building near the Willamette River in southwest Portland for several months, rarely numbering more than two dozen. Brief, isolated skirmishes have broken out between protesters and federal law enforcement, but they have been confined to a few blocks in a neighborhood outside the urban core.

A charter school that rented space next to the ICE building moved out this fall, citing the heavy use of tear gas by federal agents and potential health risks for students.

Demonstrators have been pushing city leaders to use municipal land-use laws to close the federal facility. The ICE building has been used for immigrant processing since 2011, and city code bans the federal agency from detaining people there for more than 12 hours. This month, Mayor Keith Wilson, a Democrat, announced that the city would investigate whether the federal agency had violated local laws by holding people for longer than allowed.

Federal descriptions of how events have unfolded at the building in Portland run counter to accounts from local law enforcement and demonstrators.

“We’re certainly not on fire,” Bob Day, the chief of the Portland Police Bureau, said in an interview this week. “Some of what you are seeing out there just does not accurately reflect what’s happening in this city.”

Protesters at the ICE building in Portland said their days have taken on a familiar pattern: They position themselves just outside the garage gate, then chant and hold up signs when federal cars leave every 40 minutes or so.

Their efforts draw little to no response during the day and early evening. But later, usually after a nearby streetcar stops running around midnight, federal agents regularly leave the building to confront them and attempt to drive them away.

“They get violent,” said Andy Siebe, a participant in 2020 protests in Portland who was outside the ICE building Saturday afternoon. They rested in a camping chair and spoke with the many passers-by who honked in support, dropped off supplies or took pictures.

“Tear gas, batons, bear spray, rubber bullets, shields,” Mx. Siebe said.

Portland police officers have been ordered to stay out of the way when federal law enforcement officials clash with demonstrators, but to intervene when they see people committing acts of violence or vandalism.

There had been only 15 or 20 people participating in the latest protests each night, Mx. Siebe noted, adding that the federal activity would “change things.”

“It’s going to get people who stopped paying attention engaged again,” they said.

The shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas this week that killed one detainee and critically injured two others has left the agency particularly sensitive to any potential security concerns at its facilities. The F.B.I. said it was investigating the attack as “an act of targeted violence.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that “President Trump and Secretary Noem are taking action to restore law and order following weeks of violent riots at ICE facilities, assaults on law enforcement and the terrorist attack at our ICE facility in Dallas.”

She added: “We are not going to allow domestic terrorists to attack our law enforcement.""

Mr. Trump signed an executive order this week targeting antifa, a loosely defined left-wing antifascist movement. He threatened “investigatory and prosecutorial action” against those who financially support it.

In his order, Mr. Trump said that he was declaring antifa a “domestic terrorist organization” — a designation that does not actually exist under U.S. law. Anti-fascism, like fascism itself, is a broad political ideology rather than a specific organization, and the United States does not have a domestic terrorism law.

Since July, the Department of Homeland Security has been focused on protesters outside an ICE facility in Portland, saying that month that the site was “under siege.”

“Rioters have attacked law enforcement officials, destroyed federal property, and have posted death threats at the facility,” the agency said in a statement in July.

In a news conference on Friday night, Portland civic leaders responded to reports of an increased federal presence, urging calm and telling residents that they believed Mr. Trump wanted to bait protesters into violent interactions with law enforcement.

“We’re in the midst of a renaissance, not chaos,” said Mr. Wilson, the city’s mayor. “If you walk out on the streets of Portland, or any day, you’ll see people with hope and businesses flourishing.”

He added: “As leaders, we are focused on bringing everybody together, not dividing us, and certainly not being part of a made-for-TV event.”

The Des Moines school board voted unanimously to place Superintendent Ian Roberts on paid leave during a three-minute-long special meeting. The board said Roberts was not available to carry out his duties for the 30,000-student district and stated that officials would reassess his status after getting more information.

After the meeting, school board president Jackie Norris read a statement, saying word of Roberts' detention Friday made for a ""jarring day"" but noting that board members still didn't have all the facts.

In a statement on social media, Norris said the school district had ""no confirmed information"" about why Roberts was detained and the associate superintendent would be stepping in in his place. The school said they had not been told of the ""next potential steps"" by immigration authorities.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said agents detained Roberts because he was in the country illegally, didn't have authorization to work and was subject to a final removal order issued in 2024. ICE agents stopped Roberts while he was driving a school-issued vehicle, and the agency said he then fled into a wooded area before being apprehended with help from Iowa State Patrol officers.

""I want to be clear, no one here was aware of any citizenship or immigration issues that Dr. Roberts may have been facing,"" Norris said. ""The accusations ICE had made against Dr. Roberts are very serious, and we are taking them very seriously.""

Norris said Roberts has retained a Des Moines law firm to represent him. Lawyer Alfredo Parrish confirmed his firm was representing Roberts but declined to comment on his case.

Norris also repeated that the district had done a background check on Roberts before he was hired that didn't indicate any problems and that he signed a form affirming he was a U.S. citizen. A company that aided in the search for a superintendent in 2023 also hired another firm to conduct ""comprehensive criminal, credit and background checks"" on Roberts that didn't indicate any citizenship issues, Norris said.

Also Saturday, the Iowa Department of Education released a statement saying Roberts stated he was a U.S. citizen when he applied for an administrator license. The department said the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners conducted a criminal history check with state and federal authorities before issuing a license.

The department said it is reviewing the Des Moines district's hiring procedures for ensuring people are authorized to work in the U.S.

According to CBS Des Moines affiliate KCCI, the district said Roberts underwent a background check in 2023 by a private contractor, and during the hiring process, he made the board aware of a firearm charge related to a hunting rifle, and provided ""sufficient context and explanation"" to move forward.

Roberts was licensed by the Iowa Board of Educational Examiners, the district told KCCI.

Roberts had previously said he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and spent much of his childhood in Brooklyn, New York. He competed in the 2000 Olympics in track and field for Guyana.

ICE said he entered the U.S. on a student visa in 1999.

A former senior Guyanese police official on Saturday remembered Roberts as a middle-distance runner who could have risen through the ranks of the South American country's police force had he not emigrated to the U.S. decades ago. Retired assistant Guyana Police Force commissioner Paul Slowe said Roberts entered the Police Force after graduating from the country's standard military officers' course.

""He served for a few years and then left. He was not dismissed or dishonorably discharged at all; he just moved on,"" Slowe told The Associated Press. ""He was a good, promising and disciplined man.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/28/abd01b0a-a212-4496-933b-4746bbc5399b/thumbnail/1200x630/9218c3d720aecb386793c9d6072cfa1a/ap25269735494982.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 13:57:17.515604
