MIAMI — In the streets of downtown Caracas, Venezuela, university student Mariana stood alongside her family in a sea of yellow, red and blue. She was among other Venezuelans protesting an oppressive regime controlling the country.

“Hay que estudiar, hay que estudiar, el que no estudia se parece a Nicolás,” the crowd chanted. “We must study, we must study, the ones who don’t will be like Nicolás.”

Their cries declared their disdain for dictator Nicolás Maduro.

It wasn’t long until the military intervened, sparking violence and unrest. As Mariana sought refuge, a man got out of his car and stopped her — and pointed a gun at her head.

Her shock drowned out the chaos around her. All she heard was her father screaming her name.

“We were very used to violence and guns and crime being part of the day-by-day in the city,” Mariana recalled, adding that the man quickly returned to his car and drove away. “It was not really that shocking.”

Four years later, while on vacation in Miami with her boyfriend, Antonio, Mariana heard something on the radio about a new immigration benefit for Venezuelans fleeing the country amid food shortages, kidnappings and repression.

The conditions, the U.S. Homeland Security secretary said at the time, “reveal a country in turmoil, unable to protect its own citizens.”

Mariana and her boyfriend decided to stay in the United States and restart their lives — safe from harm — through what’s known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.

Today, like hundreds of thousands of others, the couple face the unimaginable idea of having to give up that new life.

As part of the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration agenda, the Department of Homeland Security has acted to terminate TPS for recipients from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

People from Venezuela and Haiti make up the vast majority of those losing status.

In April, DHS ended TPS for 350,000 Venezuelans, which meant work permits and protection from deportation were no longer valid. On Feb. 3, 2026, TPS is set to end for nearly 350,000 Haitians.

And Sept. 10 was the deadline for the designation to end for another 250,000 Venezuelans — including Mariana and Antonio — who would have about 60 days to figure out what comes next.

Amid ongoing legal wrangling, a federal judge on Sept. 5 found the administration’s actions unlawful and blocked it from ending protections for Venezuelans and Haitians.

As the court battles go on, some beneficiaries have holed up in their homes, fearful of arrest and deportation, while others scramble to find legal alternatives — or face losing everything.

“We have people (…) who have been here for over 15, 20 years, who have made a life in the U.S., who have families in the U.S. — children, homes, cars, businesses that are at risk,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an immigration advocacy group. “Right now, the level of fear and trauma and terror cannot be explained. It is complete chaos. It is complete terror. It is complete trauma.”

Florida is home to more TPS recipients than any other state in the country — people such as Rafael Rodriguez, a former civil engineer and college professor from Valencia, Venezuela. He has gone from servicing a major cruise liner to barely leaving his home because he now is considered deportable. He obtained TPS in 2023; without it, his life in North Miami has transformed from one of prosperity to, in his estimation, a “prison.”

Sebastian, an architect also from Valencia, left Venezuela because of government oppression and dwindling career prospects. He obtained TPS in 2024, after fleeing to North Miami. For him, it was a “lifesaver.” And the loss of the benefit, he said, is the loss of his pursuit of “the American dream.”

Since 2021, Mariana and Antonio have lived in Aventura, north of Miami. They both started careers in finance, the subject they studied together in university back in Venezuela. For the couple, looming TPS expiration has made it nearly impossible to plan for their future.

“It has given me anxiety, a lot of sadness, a feeling of injustice,” said Mariana — who, along with Antonio and Sebastian, asked that her full name not be used because of concerns it could hurt her efforts to remain in the country. “I feel like my life is on hold.”

‘America is not perfect, but it was human’

Temporary Protected Status began in 1990 as a way to protect individuals fleeing armed conflict, natural disasters or other unlivable conditions in their home countries. The status provides work permits and deportation protection for up to 18 months — and can be renewed at the discretion of the U.S. Homeland Security secretary.

As of Sept. 30, 2024, some 1.1 million people were protected by the benefit.

To qualify, individuals must meet several conditions, pay a fee that jumped from $50 to $500 this year, and have never been convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors. These requirements, experts say, make holders of the humanitarian benefit some of the most vetted immigrants in the country.

“They are not criminals. They are not illegal,” said Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus in Miami. “So, what is this about?”

In a January interview with Fox News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the end of TPS for some Venezuelans, saying a Biden-era extension of the benefit meant “they were going to be able to stay here and violate our laws for another 18 months, and we stopped that.”

Noem referred to Venezuelans who were in the country legally and those of the Tren de Aragua criminal enterprise in the same breath, saying, “We are going to follow the process, evaluate all of these individuals that are in our country, including the Venezuelans that are here and members of the TDA. (…) The people of this country want these dirtbags out.”

In official announcements explaining the end of TPS, the agency has said conditions in some of the countries, including Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and violence-riddled Haiti, have improved enough to be safe for beneficiaries to return.

The leaders of humanitarian organizations disagree.

“The Taliban is one of the most repressive governments in the world,” said Matthew Soerens of World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization. “Until the U.S. Department of Homeland Security tried to make the argument, I’d never heard anyone suggest that Afghanistan was back to being a safe place for people to live.”

Daniel Noroña, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas, said a return to Haiti could be a death sentence for TPS recipients.

“In the case of Haiti, you’re just facing death,” Noroña said. “You are facing a situation where there are no guarantees for your life or for your loved ones.”

In the case of Venezuela, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement in July — titled “Standing with the Venezuelan People” — in which he denounced the regime of dictator Maduro as “corrupt, criminal and illegitimate.” The DHS, though, says “notable improvements” in the economy, public health and crime prevention “allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.”

The State Department restricts travel to and from Venezuela, Haiti and Afghanistan with Level 4 travel advisories — the highest issued by the agency, warning of “life-threatening risks.”

Homeland Security also argues that it is against the “national interest” of the U.S. to allow many of these TPS recipients to remain. But to many advocates, that’s code for something else.

“Is it just racism? Is it just xenophobia? Is it just because we are brown and Black? Is this just about making America white again?” Ferro asked. “Why (is) America becoming this absolutely unrecognizable picture of what it was?

“America is not perfect,” she added, “but it was human. Now it’s not.”

‘There’s only so much we can do’

Often called the “Gateway of the Americas,” Miami is known for its majority foreign-born population, which gives the city a multicultural flair unmatched by most other parts of the U.S.

In the north of the city, Little Haiti serves as the heart of Haitian culture. The country’s flag lines the streets, the air smells of rich Caribbean food, and the Little Haiti Cultural Complex — a vibrant building topped with ornate steeples — sits at its center.

The city of Doral is 12 miles west. Nicknamed “Doralzuela,” the city is home to some 30,000 residents of Venezuelan descent. Store owners are more likely to greet you with “Cómo estás?” than “How are you?” Arepas, corn cakes stuffed with fillings, are common menu staples.

Today, Miami’s cultural enclaves lack the bustle that once characterized them.

In North Miami, Rodriguez, the former civil engineer and professor, hides in his home with two cats and his wife, who also lost her legal status when the Trump administration canceled a different humanitarian program. The fear of immigration raids or being stopped by police keeps their lives confined to the walls of their condominium; they leave only once a week, to buy groceries.

“You feel like the net is closing around you,” Rodriguez said, “and there is nothing you can do.”

With their work permits no longer valid, he and his wife draw from their savings to live.

If he can, Rodriguez will pursue a national interest waiver, which allows professionals who hold an advanced degree or have “exceptional” abilities to more quickly gain legal status. If that’s not possible, he and his wife will self-deport — possibly to Spain.

They are waiting to see how ongoing court challenges shake out before making a final decision. Several organizations have filed lawsuits in defense of TPS recipients, and that litigation continues.

“We want to do it legally,” Rodriguez said. “But it’s very hard to hear people trying to say, ‘Oh, come here legally,’ when the system is broken.”

Sebastian, the architect, is seeking an employment-based visa, but if it isn’t approved, he said, he will self-deport. He would leave behind his uncles, cousins and friends.

“I believe the majority of the (TPS) community is doing things right. We’re not criminals,” he said. “We are trying to make our voice heard and show the American people we deserve to be here. We need to be here.”

Advocates are coming together to help TPS recipients in whatever way they can.

The Miami-based Family Action Network Movement hosted a two-day summit in June at the Little Haiti Cultural Complex. Experts provided a know-your-rights training and legal workshops to help residents navigate the fast-changing landscape.

“There’s only so much we can do from a local level, but what we’re trying to do is to stop the American dream from being the American nightmare,” Michael Joseph, a first-generation Haitian-American and the mayor of North Miami Beach, said as the summit kicked off.

Across town, in North Miami, the Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center sits across the street from a Haitian restaurant. The nonprofit serves around 20,000 people each year and helps Haitian immigrants with applications for legal status.

On a recent rainy Tuesday, the center was filled with people waiting to speak with someone. Employees in cubicles hunched over their desks — some answering phones, others counseling clients.

Executive director Gepsie Metellus, who came to the U.S. from Haiti when she was 12, sat in her office in a back corner. These days, she said, her organization’s work centers on helping TPS recipients figure out what to do next.

“If you have children who are U.S.-born and you don’t want to necessarily take them with you, you need a guardianship arrangement,” she said. “If you have property (…) let’s make sure that you have a power of attorney.”

It’s “lots of guidance, lots of counseling, lots of holding hands,” she added.

For some, the planning process involves considering self-deportation — but to where?

“We’ve had some clients suggest that they would prefer to return to the country through which they were granted some sort of status prior to coming to the United States,” Metellus said. “We’re talking Chile or Brazil.”

At the national level, two bills pending in Congress propose a pathway to legal permanent residency for TPS recipients.

And though advocacy organizations are doing their best to help TPS recipients find legal alternatives to stay, options are limited.

John De La Vega is a Miami-based immigration lawyer who counsels Venezuelan TPS recipients. Lately, his work has centered on helping his clients adjust their status to remain in the U.S.

“It’s very limited, because with a short amount of time, they have to be able to look for other options,” he said. “It’s very stressful, because they do not know what’s going to happen tomorrow.”

The first thing he asks clients is whether they have a relative who could petition on their behalf for permanent residence. For example, a U.S.-born person over the age of 21 could petition for their parent. Citizen spouses of TPS recipients may also petition for them.

If none of those options is available, De La Vega encourages his clients to apply for asylum. Some TPS recipients have already done so, but many never applied — assuming they were “safe” under Temporary Protected Status.

Though asylum can lead to permanent residency, applying also comes with risks. In addition to the multimillion-case backlog that has slowed the process, if a TPS recipient whose status has been terminated appears in court for a hearing, they could be placed in removal proceedings if asylum is denied.

“Immigration courts become, unfortunately, a place where you can be detained,” said Oscar Mendoza, an immigration attorney in Dallas:

‘We dream of a normal life’

Over the past four years, Mariana and Antonio built new lives in the U.S.

With their work permits, Mariana landed a job as an operations analyst at a wealth management firm, while Antonio found work as a retail banker dealing with personal and business accounts.

While they cherish their Venezuelan traditions — such as eating arepas almost every day for breakfast — they have adopted American customs. The couple host Thanksgiving at their apartment every year and even learned how to make a turkey.

They envision a future not unlike that of many Americans. They want to continue flourishing in their careers, get married, buy a house with a big backyard and have kids.

“That’s normal life,” Mariana said. “We dream of a normal life.”

Antonio also dreams of stability.

“We want to start a family, and we want to find a place where we could be stable and to have a certainty of the future,” he said.

But for now, they have struggled to see any future beyond this month, when their TPS was set to expire.

Mariana and Antonio spend much of their time consulting with lawyers and sifting through legal options.

“This immigration thing has taken over our entire lives,” Mariana said.

She said her company wants to support her, so she has looked into obtaining certification that allows employers to hire foreign workers to work permanently in the U.S. The couple have also explored student visas as an option.

The two recently applied for master’s programs at a university in Miami. Mariana was accepted into her program, with classes starting this month. Antonio was accepted but later found out the university was unable to grant him a visa. He is now applying for asylum, despite the risks.

If their plans fail, they say they will move to Spain.

“I love projections — I love having everything under control,” Mariana said. “And I can’t project any type of future beyond September. (…) I’m just trying to navigate through it.”

This June, on a trip to New York City, Antonio proposed to Mariana while strolling through Central Park. Her engagement ring carries special significance. Engraved on the inside of the silver band is “M.A. + A.H. = K,” the couple’s initials added together to equal the symbol for a constant in mathematics.

It’s a callback to where the couple first met — in math class at university. For the two, the equation symbolizes a forever life together.

“We can have ups and downs, but the constants are you and I,” Antonio summarized.

What was supposed to be one of the most exciting milestones in their lives is now shrouded in anxiety.

Mariana remembers the deep admiration she had for America as a young girl and the poem, etched on the inside of the Statue of Liberty’s pedestal, that had always represented what she thought the country stood for.

She recited its last line — “I lift my lamp beside the golden door” — then paused to think about what it had always meant to her.

“This used to be a place that welcomed people, people willing to work hard,” she said. “And I thought, ‘Of course, I’m going to make it there. The doors are going to be open.’

“That was the case for years, and now it’s not. It has made me very sad about what I thought of this country.”",https://nondoc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/TPS_Terminated_01.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 14:56:43.462620

This appeal represents the administration’s most significant attempt to fundamentally alter how American citizenship is conferred under the 14th Amendment.

The executive order, issued on Jan. 20 and titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” would prevent the federal government from issuing citizenship documents to children born on American soil whose parents were either in the country unlawfully or present temporarily under legal status.

This policy directly challenges more than a century of legal precedent establishing that birth on American soil generally confers citizenship regardless of parental immigration status. The administration’s appeal argues that current interpretations of constitutional citizenship provisions have created destructive consequences for border security and immigration enforcement.

Legal strategy targets procedural barriers

The Supreme Court previously addressed birthright citizenship in June, though that decision focused primarily on the procedural question of lower court authority to block presidential policies. The 6-3 majority ruling limited but did not eliminate judicial power to halt such executive actions, creating space for continued legal challenges.

Following that decision, opponents of the citizenship policy filed new lawsuits using different legal strategies, including class-action approaches that have successfully maintained nationwide injunctions against implementation. These alternative legal challenges have kept Trump’s policy on hold despite the Supreme Court’s earlier procedural ruling.

The administration now seeks definitive resolution by asking the justices to review substantive constitutional questions rather than procedural limitations. This approach represents an escalation in the legal battle over one of the most fundamental aspects of American citizenship law.

Multiple court decisions block implementation

Federal courts in different jurisdictions have consistently rejected the administration’s constitutional arguments. A San Francisco-based federal appeals court upheld a Seattle judge’s nationwide injunction in a case brought by Democratic-led states, finding the citizenship policy violated established constitutional principles.

Similarly, a New Hampshire federal judge issued a separate nationwide block in a class-action lawsuit filed by civil liberties organizations. This ruling specifically protects babies who would be affected by the policy, creating additional legal barriers to implementation.

The administration filed appeals in both cases Friday, arguing that American citizenship represents a fundamental privilege that should only extend to those legally entitled under proper constitutional interpretation. The government contends that current citizenship practices undermine national sovereignty and border security objectives.

Historical precedent faces reinterpretation challenge

The administration’s constitutional argument centers on reinterpreting the landmark 1898 Supreme Court decision in US v. Wong Kim Ark, which established birthright citizenship for people born in the United States. That case involved the son of Chinese immigrants and created precedent that has guided citizenship law for over a century.

Trump’s legal team argues that the Wong Kim Ark decision has been misunderstood and that it only recognized citizenship for people born in the United States who enjoyed permanent residence status. The administration contends this historical limitation was central to the original analysis and should restrict current citizenship practices.

Lower courts have uniformly rejected these reinterpretation attempts. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the executive order contradicts both constitutional text and decades of established executive branch practice regarding citizenship determination.

Political and legal implications converge

The Supreme Court appeal represents a high-stakes constitutional battle with implications extending far beyond immigration policy. Success would fundamentally alter how American citizenship operates and could affect hundreds of thousands of people born on US soil annually.

The administration has expressed confidence that the conservative-majority Supreme Court will approve its constitutional interpretation. However, the justices’ willingness to hear the case remains uncertain, as four justices must vote to grant review before arguments can proceed.

Civil liberties organizations have vowed continued resistance to the citizenship policy regardless of the Supreme Court’s decision on hearing the case. Legal advocates argue the executive order violates fundamental constitutional principles that have defined American citizenship since Reconstruction.

Uncertain timeline creates continued limbo

The appeal process will likely extend the legal uncertainty surrounding birthright citizenship for months while the Supreme Court considers whether to grant review. If the justices accept the case, arguments would occur during the upcoming term with a decision expected by summer.

Until resolution, lower court injunctions remain in effect, preventing implementation of the citizenship restrictions while legal battles continue across multiple jurisdictions.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2429741167.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 14:56:46.527984

The deadliest six-month period for immigration detention since 2018 has occurred this year, according to a letter Georgia Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock sent to the Department of Homeland Security this week.

Less than 24 hours after that letter was published, the year became deadlier still. A detainee was killed, and two others were seriously injured by a sniper who fired rounds at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Dallas.

The days since the attack have seen political jousting at the highest levels of power, as possible motives for the shooter — who also died in the incident — slowly emerge. Authorities have said the gunman was motivated by anti-ICE sentiment, a reading some family members have dismissed. But whatever his intentions, other deaths in immigration detention this year — from untreated illness, suicide and neglect — have been far more common and far less publicized.

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old who had lived in California since childhood, died on Sunday, Sept. 21. Uribe, a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, was detained during an August raid on the carwash where he had worked for 15 years, and transferred to ICE’s Adelanto detention center near Los Angeles. Shortly after, he became ill with coughing and fevers. Family told the Los Angeles Times that he was given little more than Tylenol as his condition deteriorated, before he died while awaiting surgery on an abscess. Ayala-Uribe’s brother said that Ismael “tried asking for help, but they wouldn’t really do anything.”

Physical conditions aren’t the only medical needs going unmet. El Pais reported this week that suicide attempts in U.S. detention centers are increasing, partly due to a lack of proper mental health treatment. Immigration lawyers and people currently in detention told The New York Times that ICE rarely meets its own standards of care, which require initial screenings on arrival, detailed assessments within two weeks, and access to emergency care. Experts say suicidal ideation is also a function of the miserable conditions in many immigration settings, which have also led to reports of detainees refusing meals in protest in California and Louisiana this week.

In many cases, detainees who express suicidal ideation are placed in solitary confinement or similar isolated settings, which are widely understood to worsen mental illness. That practice is part of a broader increase in the use of solitary confinement in detention that The Marshall Project and Univision reported on earlier this month.

In at least one case, the lack of care has also extended to an expectant mother. This week, The San Francisco Chronicle told the story of Angie Rodriguez, a 26-year-old San Jose, California, woman who discovered she was pregnant, and then miscarried while in ICE custody. Rodriguez said she received no meaningful prenatal care or dietary support, and was placed in medical isolation, which she compared to solitary confinement.

When she started to bleed, Rodriguez was “transported to the hospital in metal restraints around her wrists and ankles and connected by a waist chain,” despite ICE policy that says pregnant individuals should not be transported in restraints, according to the Chronicle. After the miscarriage, Rodriguez’s attorney filed for a temporary restraining order to secure her release. A federal judge granted it, concluding that she had been detained without cause and suffered irreparable harm.

Rodriguez is home now, but for others, a judge’s order is increasingly not enough to actually leave detention.

In early July, the Trump administration issued a new interpretation of key provisions of immigration law, asserting that most people who enter the country undocumented are ineligible for bond hearings in the lead-up to final removal proceedings. In cases where detainees have convinced immigration judges that this interpretation is wrong, the administration has used another maneuver: “automatic stay.”

Adopted in 2001, “automatic stay” allows the government to postpone release on bond for 90 days, and often to extend it even further. Historically, it has been considered a tool for “limited” use in specific circumstances — such as for a flight risk or someone who presented national security concerns. But the Trump administration has dramatically expanded the ways this stay is applied.

The unilateral nature of the move has deeply troubled many legal scholars and judges, Politico reported. “Automatic stay is a violent distortion of proper, legitimate process whereby the Government, as though by talisman, renders itself at once prosecutor and adjudicator,” a Maryland district judge wrote in a recent opinion.

Bond recipients aren’t the only detainees to receive a favorable ruling from a court, only to remain locked up. This week, Mother Jones reported on cases in which people are granted a “withholding of removal” by a judge — essentially a determination that a person’s home country is too dangerous for them — only for the government to keep them in detention in a bid to deport them elsewhere.

In both cases, lawyers and immigrant rights advocates have described the delays as tactics “to wear detainees down and get them to give up their fight to stay in the U.S.,” possibly to get them to attempt self-deportation, Mother Jones reported.

These aggressive tactics have pushed detention to record levels over the past few months. Nearly 60,000 people are in detention as of this week, a roughly 50% increase from before President Donald Trump took office.

That rise is not just a product of detaining more people once they are arrested; it’s also due to finding new ways to make arrests. One key method has been to seize people as they leave court. Most often, that has meant immigration court. Rodriguez, who had a miscarriage in detention, was first detained this way.

Increasingly, federal agents are making arrests at state courthouses as well. In California, state law bans immigration enforcement at courthouses, but ICE has done so anyway, often by waiting just outside the building. There is some debate over whether the language of the law prohibits this. In Oakland, ICE conducted at least one arrest inside the state courthouse last week, drawing fierce condemnation from public defenders.

Federal officials have defended the practice, saying they will arrest undocumented people wherever they can find them, and that courthouse arrests keep agents safe, since arrestees have already been screened by security to go inside.

As reported by CalMatters, critics, like the California Department of Justice, have countered that the chilling effects on court attendance “make our communities less safe by deterring victims or witnesses of crimes from coming forward out of fear of getting caught up in the President’s mass deportation dragnet.”",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/_rRGDR0IplCgvH5d_kfZi_dGKdKo2ne9M4H-JWb-55I/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC94eHpmZDNncHJm/bGJrcWZsYWU3a3ph/ZmdnZHprL0FQMjUw/NDM2ODAzNTI2NzEu/anBn,N,,2025-09-27 12:56:45.056104

Miguel Angel García-Hernandez of Mexico, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela and Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador were shot in what the FBI has described as a “targeted attack” on Ice by the 29-year-old alleged shooter, Joshua Jahn, CNN reported.

While several outlets, including the New York Times and Univision, reported that Garcia-Hernandez was among the injured, the federal government has not publicly confirmed this. The New York Times said Bordones-Molina was the second injured detainee, while Guzman-Fuentes was fatally shot.

García-Hernandez, who grew up in Arlington and was originally from San Luis Potosí, Mexico, was shot three to four times during the attack, his brother, who asked not to be identified because he is in immigration proceedings and has not yet obtained legal status, told the news outlets about the father of four.

“He’s in very serious condition in the hospital. He’s very bad,” his brother told Univision. “He’s already had two operations.”

A video filmed from inside the building shows detainees running while handcuffed and their legs shackled, some falling to the ground amid the rush to evade the gunfire.

García-Hernandez, who is undocumented, is a house painter who has been living in the US for about 20 years, the New York Times reported, and his mother was deported about two months ago.

“What we want is for them to help my mother so she can come see [García-Hernandez] because she was also deported unjustly,” said García-Hernandez’s brother to Univision. García-Hernandez’s brother and partner are seeking legal advice on possible actions they can take after the incident. As García-Hernandez was the family’s main support, they have launched a GoFundMe campaign to help cover expenses, including those for a baby on the way.

Meanwhile, Bordones-Molina was also undocumented and had a prior legal record, including a traffic violation and a property-related offense, according to CNN.

Guzman-Fuentes, the third shooting victim, had been previously arrested “for battery, improper exhibit of a firearm or dangerous weapon, criminal mischief, driving while intoxicated, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon”, a source told CNN.

Authorities said the shooter had not intended to harm detainees, according to notes he wrote. After the detainees were shot, Jahn, of Fairview, Texas, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

“Notably, these loose notes included a game plan of the attack and target areas at the facility,” Nancy Larson, acting US attorney for the northern district of Texas, said on Thursday. “He called the Ice employees ‘people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck.’”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e738283ee6cd622727bbc40f4fd546c7d07eda91/491_0_4380_3504/master/4380.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e857df868e3ac07e24ece45becfec877",N,,2025-09-27 12:56:53.773881

Campbell said the Attorney General’s Office has worked with community organizations to develop a rapid response system and mobilize resources to support the immigrant community.
“The federal laws are stacked against us when it comes to immigration and immigration enforcement,” Campbell said.
“This attorney general has their back,” Campbell told Brookline.News.","Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell and leaders of Greater Boston organizations fighting federal immigration crackdowns are calling on Brookline for collective action and solidarity.

They spoke Wednesday night at an event organized by Brookline for Racial Justice and Equity at United Parish. The event, “Brookline United For Immigrant Justice,” drew around 150 people and raised $7,555 for four frontline organizations — La Colaborativa, Fuerza, Lawyers for Civil Rights and LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of MA.

“Support for immigrants has been something that has long been part of the culture in Brookline,” said BRJE Executive Director Raul Fernandez. “[This] was an opportunity for Brookline residents who do care about these issues to come together and support those kinds of frontline organizations.”

Campbell headlined the event in a keynote conversation led by Kimberley Richardson, chair of BRJE’s board of directors. Fernandez called Campbell a “champion” in the immigration space for tackling federal immigration enforcement through a legal lens.

“It’s really important to have someone like her grounding this effort, because it’s not just about what people feel,” Fernandez said. “It’s also about what the law really says.”

The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office has filed more than 30 lawsuits against the Trump administration, Campbell said. Its latest victory came Wednesday in a case that challenged the administration for withholding billions in emergency service funding to “strong-arm” states into compliance.

Campbell said the Attorney General’s Office has worked with community organizations to develop a rapid response system and mobilize resources to support the immigrant community.

“The federal laws are stacked against us when it comes to immigration and immigration enforcement,” Campbell said. “That doesn’t mean we’re not going to fight like hell to protect our people [and] protect our immigrants.”

Campbell answered questions on state efforts to preserve public education funding, promote equitable access to affordable housing, and defend diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in schools and universities.

Following the keynote conversation was a panel consisting of leaders of organizations fighting immigration enforcement in Greater Boston and Massachusetts.

Fernandez said it was important to highlight frontline organizations to show Brookline residents how they can get involved and support their efforts.

“I always talk about Brookline as a community among communities,” he said. “Who our neighbors are doesn’t stop at the border of Brookline.”

Gladys Vega, president and CEO of La Colaborativa , a Greater Boston organization that supports Latino immigrants, said people need to see immigrants as human beings and not illegal criminals. She referenced the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision that cleared the way for racial profiling in immigration raids.

“We need to do more in our communities, especially communities of color, where now people have a license to racial profile, and they have a right to make you feel that you don’t belong,” Vega said.

Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights , said as angry as people may feel, there are also “lessons to be learned” from past opportunities to prevent federal encroachment that were “wasted.”

“When I look back, [I think] we have wasted entire presidential administrations, completely wasted, failed to leverage what can be leveraged, failed to mobilize with efficiency and purpose around issues that we care about,” he said. “And now we see what the federal government can actually do. It’s scary.”

Fuerza , a neighborhood watch in Waltham that is part of the LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of MA , coordinates with LUCE to receive rapid verification of ICE activity in Waltham, so volunteers can respond and support families.

Fuerza’s founder, Jonathan Paz, told Brookline.News the most important element of his group’s work is being there for community members in “their moment of most need.”

“Part of what we’re doing is shifting the tone, shifting the energy, so people are becoming more proactive, rather than just reactive, in a time where we’re constantly under attack,” he said.

During the panel, Paz said Campbell and the Attorney General’s Office need to do more to prevent courthouses from being “ICE traps,” where ICE agents detain immigrants before they can through the legal process.

“We have a highly competent attorney general who needs to display some political courage here and prevent the further entrapments that are happening in our courts,” Paz told Brookline.News. “ICE is creating an environment where people have to self-criminalize to exist here. This is untenable.”

After the conversation, Campbell told Brookline.News she appreciates the frontline organizations for helping her office with its federal accountability work by providing on-the-ground accounts.

“If we file a lawsuit, for example, it’s based on what we’re hearing and seeing happening on the ground,” she said. “These organizations are giving us those stories.”

Campbell said she loves Brookline because it is both a community and municipality that looks out for its people and sees the humanity in them, regardless of their immigration status. She reiterated her support for her constituents in uncertain times.

“This attorney general has their back,” Campbell told Brookline.News. “We’ll fight with a sense of urgency, no fear and deep compassion and empathy for the people in Massachusetts, to protect them and also protect our economy.”

Trump declined to discuss Comey at the event, and was vague about who else might be targeted under the memo.","At a tense political moment in the wake of conservative lightning rod Charlie Kirk’s killing, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum focusing federal law enforcement on disrupting “domestic terrorism.”

The memo appeared to focus on political violence. But during a White House signing Thursday, the president and his top advisors repeatedly hinted at a much broader campaign of suppression against the American left, referencing as problematic both the simple printing of protest signs and the prominent racial justice movement Black Lives Matter.

“We’re looking at the funders of a lot of these groups. You know, when you see the signs and they’re all beautiful signs made professionally, these aren’t your protesters that make the sign in their basement late in the evening because they really believe it. These are anarchists and agitators,” Trump said.

“Whether it be going back to the riots that started with Black Lives Matter and all the way through to the antifa riots, the attacks on ICE officers, the doxxing campaigns and now the political assassinations — these are not lone, isolated events,” said Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff. “This is part of an organized campaign of radical left terrorism.”

Neither Trump nor Miller nor the other top administration officials flanking them — including Vice President JD Vance, Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel — offered any evidence of such a widespread left-wing terror campaign, or many details about how the memo would be put into action.

Law enforcement officials have said Kirk’s alleged shooter appears to have acted alone, and data on domestic extremism more broadly — including some recently scrubbed from the Justice Department’s website — suggest right-wing extremists represent the larger threat.

Many on the right cheered Trump’s memo — just as many on the left cheered calls by Democrats for a clampdown on right-wing extremism during the Biden administration, particularly in light of the violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters. In that incident, more than 1,500 were criminally charged, many convicted of assaulting police officers and some for sedition, before Trump pardoned them or commuted their sentences.

Many critics of the administration slammed the memo as a “chilling” threat that called to mind some of the most notorious periods of political suppression in the nation’s history — a claim the White House dismissed as wildly off base and steeped in liberal hypocrisy.

That includes the Red Scare and the often less acknowledged Lavender Scare of the Cold War and beyond, they said, when Sen. Joseph McCarthy and other federal officials cast a pall over the nation, its social justice movements and its arts scene by promising to purge from government anyone who professed a belief in certain political ideas — such as communism — or was gay or lesbian or otherwise queer.

Douglas M. Charles, a history professor at Penn State Greater Allegheny and author of “Hoover’s War on Gays: Exposing the FBI’s ‘Sex Deviates’ Program,” said Trump’s memo strongly paralleled past government efforts at political repression — including in its claim that “extremism on migration, race and gender” and “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity” are all causing violence in the country.

“What is this, McCarthyism redux?” Charles asked.

Melina Abdullah, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles, said the Trump administration is putting “targets on the backs of organizers” like her.

Abdullah, speaking Friday from Washington, D.C., where she is attending the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual legislative conference, said Trump’s efforts to cast left-leaning advocacy groups as a threat to democracy was “the definition of gaslighting” because the president “and his entire regime are violent.”

“They are anti-Black. They are anti-people. They are anti-free speech,” Abdullah said. “What we are is indeed an organized body of people who want freedom for our people — and that is a demand for the kind of sustainable peace that only comes with justice.”

Others, including prominent California Democrats, framed Trump’s memo and other recent administration acts — including Thursday’s indictment of former FBI Director James Comey over the objections of career prosecutors — as a worrying blueprint for much wider vengeance on Trump’s behalf, which must be resisted.

“Trump is waging a crusade of retribution — abusing the federal government as a weapon of personal revenge,” Gov. Gavin Newsom posted to X. “Today it’s his enemies. Tomorrow it may be you. Speak out. Use your voice.”

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta noted that the memo listed various incidents of violence against Republicans while “deliberately ignoring” violence against Democrats, and said that while it is unclear what may come of the order, “the chilling effect is real and cannot be ignored.”

Bonta also sent Bondi a letter Friday expressing his “grave concern” with the Comey indictment and asking her to “reassert the long-standing independence of the U.S. Department of Justice from political interference by declining to continue these politically-motivated investigations and prosecutions.”

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) said the Trump administration is twisting Kirk’s tragic killing “into a pretext to weaponize the federal government against opponents Trump says he ‘hates.’”

“In recent days, they’ve branded entire groups — including the Democratic Party itself — as threats, directed [the Justice Department] to go after his perceived enemies, and coerced companies to stifle any criticism of the Administration or its allies. This is pure personal grievance and retribution,” Padilla said. “If this abuse of power is normalized, no dissenting voice will be safe.”

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said it was “the highest form of hypocrisy for Democrats to falsely claim accountability is ‘political retribution’ when Joe Biden is the one who spent years weaponizing his entire Administration against President Trump and millions of patriotic Americans.”

Jackson accused the Biden administration of censoring average Americans for their posts about COVID-19 on social media and of prosecuting “peaceful pro-life protestors,” among other things, and said the Trump administration “will continue to deliver the truth to the American people, restore integrity to our justice system, and take action to stop radical left-wing violence that is plaguing American communities.”

A month ago, Miller said, “The Democrat Party is not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization” — a quote raising new concerns in light of Trump’s memo.

On Sept. 16, Bondi said on X that “the radical left” has for too long normalized threats and cheered on political violence, and that she would be ending that by somehow prosecuting them for “hate speech.”

Constitutional scholars — and some prominent conservative pundits — ridiculed Bondi’s claims as contrary to the 1st Amendment.

On Sept. 18, independent journalist Ken Klippenstein reported that unnamed national security officials had told him that the FBI was considering treating transgender suspects as a “subset” of a new threat category known as “Nihilistic Violent Extremists” — a concept LGBTQ+ organizations scrambled to denounce as a threat to everyone’s civil liberties.

“Everyone should be repulsed by the attempts to use the power of the federal government against their neighbors, their friends, and our families,” Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson said Wednesday. “It creates a dangerous precedent that could one day be used against other Americans, progressive or conservative or anywhere in between.”

In recent days, Trump has unabashedly attacked his critics — including late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show was briefly suspended. On Sept. 20, he demanded on his Truth Social platform that Bondi move to prosecute several of his most prominent political opponents, including Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and New York Atty. Gen. Letitia James.

“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility,” wrote Trump, the only felon to ever occupy the White House. “They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”

Comey’s indictment — on charges of lying to Congress — was reported shortly after the White House event where Trump signed the memo. Trump declined to discuss Comey at the event, and was vague about who else might be targeted under the memo. But he did say he had heard “a lot of different names,” including LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and George Soros, two prominent Democratic donors.

“If they are funding these things, they’re gonna have some problems,” Trump said, without providing any evidence of wrongdoing by either man.

The Open Society Foundations, which have disbursed billions from Soros’ fortune to an array of progressive groups globally, said in response that they “unequivocally condemn terrorism and do not fund terrorism” and that their activities “are peaceful and lawful.” Accusations suggesting otherwise were “politically motivated attacks on civil society, meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with,” the group said.

John Day, president-elect of the American College of Trial Lawyers, said his organization has not taken a position on Trump’s memo, but had grave concerns about the process by which Comey was indicted — namely, after Trump called for such legal action publicly.

“That, quite frankly, is very disturbing and concerning to us,” Day said. “This is not the way the legal system was designed to work, and it’s not the way it has worked for 250 years, and we are just very concerned that this happened at all,” Day said. “We’re praying that it is an outlier, as opposed to a predictor of what’s to come.”

James Kirchick, author of “Secret City: The Hidden History of Gay Washington,” which covers the Lavender Scare and its effects on the LGBTQ+ community in detail, said the “strongest similarity” he sees between then and now is the administration “taking the actions of an individual or a small number of people” — such as Kirk’s shooter — “and extrapolating that onto an entire class of people.”

Kirchick said language on the left labeling the president a dictator isn’t helpful in such a political moment, but that he has found some of the administration’s language more alarming — especially, in light of the new memo, Miller’s suggestion that the Democratic Party is an extremist organization.

“Does that mean the Democratic Party is going to be subject to FBI raids and extremist surveillance?” he asked.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1e70d50/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3956x2077+0+280/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2Fee%2F8110a21f4131883c474370fa4b33%2Ftrump-11198.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 12:56:37.446899

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday extended an earlier order that allows the Trump administration to continue blocking nearly $5 billion in congressionally appropriated foreign funds.

The U.S. Department of Justice had reached out to the high court for an emergency appeal after a district court judge ruled the administration’s decision to hold the aid was likely illegal, adding that Congress would need to approve the withholding of funds.

""This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,"" District Judge Amir Ali said at the time.

Friday's ruling was 6 to 3, with the three liberal justices dissenting.

TRUMP CANCELS $4.9B FOREIGN AID, PUSHES DC DEATH PENALTY, TOUTS KIM TIES

President Donald Trump last month sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, explaining he was using a pocket rescission, which allows a president to submit a request to Congress to hold approved funds near the end of the fiscal year.

Under federal law, Congress has to approve the rescission within 45 days or the money must be spent. But the budget year will end before the 45-day window closes, and, in this situation, the White House is asserting that congressional inaction allows it not to spend the money.

It was the first use of a pocket rescission in 50 years.

Friday’s ruling extends a temporary block put on the lower court ruling by Chief Justice John Roberts on Sept. 9.

The conservative justices in the majority Friday said that Trump’s authority on foreign policy weighed in the decision but cautioned that it wasn’t a final ruling on the matter.

The altercation, which was captured on videos that spread quickly on social media, unfolded after the woman’s husband was arrested at an immigration court in New York City.

Footage shows the woman approach the immigration officer following her husband’s arrest, pleading with the officer in Spanish and at one point saying “You don’t care about anything,” before he pushes her into a wall and then onto the floor of a crowded hallway.

The incident was among at least four attacks or threats on ICE or Border Patrol locations in Texas this year.

In May, Democratic lawmakers faced off with Department of Homeland Security officers at an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey, pushing and shouting at one another.

Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines public schools (DMPS), was apprehended on Friday morning, according to the district’s board chair.
Jackie Norris, the Des Moines school board president, said Roberts has been an “integral part of our school community” who has “shown up in ways big and small”.
In 2023, he became the first person of color to be named to the position of superintendent in Iowa’s largest school district.

Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines public schools (DMPS), was apprehended on Friday morning, according to the district’s board chair. Roberts appears to be held at the Pottawattamie county jail, about two hours west of Des Moines, according to the Ice online detainee database. The database lists Roberts’s country of birth as Guyana.

In a statement to the Guardian, DHS said that Roberts was arrested because he had “a final order of removal and no work authorization”.

“During a targeted enforcement operation on Sept 26, 2025, officers approached Roberts in his vehicle after identifying himself, but he sped away. Officers later discovered his vehicle abandoned near a wooded area. State Patrol assisted in locating the subject and he was taken into ICE custody,” the agency shared in a statement. “Roberts has existing weapon possession charges from February 5, 2020. Roberts entered the United States in 1999 on a student visa and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May of 2024.”

The 54-year-old began his term as superintendent of Des Moines schools in July 2023, overseeing a school district that serves more than 30,000 students and nearly 5,000 employees.

Jackie Norris, the Des Moines school board president, said Roberts has been an “integral part of our school community” who has “shown up in ways big and small”.

Norris said a state board had granted Roberts a license to serve as superintendent in 2023 and that the district has been unable to verify Ice’s claims about his immigration status.

In a joint statement, the presidents of unions representing teachers and other school employees in Iowa said that Roberts had been a “tremendous advocate for students, families, staff, and the community” and expressed shock at his arrest.

“His leadership and compassion for all students, regardless of background, identity, or family origin, are a beacon of light in one of the state’s most diverse school districts,” said Joshua Brown, the Iowa State Education Association president, and Anne Cross, the Des Moines Education Association president, in a joint statement. “It is a dark and unsettling time in our country. This incident has created tremendous fear for DMPS students, families, and staff.”

Matt Smith, a Des Moines schools official who was appointed Friday to serve as interim superintendent, said members of the community felt “sad, outraged and helpless” after learning of Roberts’s detention.

In media interviews and biographies, Roberts has said he was raised in Brooklyn, New York, by Guyanese immigrant parents. A 2023 statement from the district announcing Roberts’s appointment said he was “born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn”. In 2023, he became the first person of color to be named to the position of superintendent in Iowa’s largest school district. He is a former Olympic athlete who competed as a middle-distance runner for Guyana in the 2000 Sydney games.

Court records in Pennsylvania show that Roberts pleaded guilty in January 2022 to a minor infraction for unlawfully possessing a loaded firearm in a vehicle, and was fined. The case stemmed from a citation in Erie county issued the prior month by a Pennsylvania game commission officer, who stopped Roberts as he was finishing a day of deer hunting on state lands.

Roberts said at the time he was a longtime licensed hunter and gun owner, and that he had left his hunting rifle on the seat of his vehicle in plain view to ensure the officer did not feel threatened during their interaction. He said that he was shocked when the officer cited him for doing so, but that he pleaded guilty to avoid any distraction. He questioned whether his dark skin may have played a role in the case.

“I may not appear to be the ‘type of man’ who would enjoy deer season in Pennsylvania, in fact, I am and have been hunting for more than 20 years,” Roberts wrote in a social media post then.

Earlier this year, after Donald Trump’s administration removed restrictions on Ice officers searching schools, churches and other sensitive locations, Roberts and the leaders of other regional school districts issued guidelines for parents and families enrolled in public schools.

In a letter to parents, Roberts said that schools would comply with warrants from immigration officers, and that agents seeking information about students would be directed to administrators.

“Everyday Des Moines Public Schools does everything we can within our legal and moral authority to support students, which is always our top priority,” he said.

Phil Roeder, a spokesperson for the school district, said he was supposed to meet Roberts at a school event Friday morning, but Roberts sent a text saying he could not make it. Roeder said he got a video call from Roberts soon after and watched officials detain him.

Roeder told the Associated Press that the district has seen “nothing that would suggest that he’s not a citizen”.

The district said Friday afternoon that a third party had been hired to conduct a comprehensive background check on Roberts and that Roberts completed an I-9 form, which requires workers to present documents showing that they are authorized to work. District officials also stated they had no knowledge of an order of removal issued in 2024.

The district also named an interim superintendent.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c8cecf6de62182f25336c88c104574397648237/150_0_1133_906/master/1133.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d18274097f8236ad1fff0b900126e177",N,,2025-09-27 07:56:20.096076

Draft report delivers verdict on human rights convention

David Maddox

Friday 26 September 2025 17:31 EDT

Kemi Badenoch is expected to announce the Conservative Party's support for withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

This follows a review by former justice minister Lord Wolfson of Tredegar, whose draft conclusions recommend leaving the ECHR.

Lord Wolfson's report argues the ECHR has gone “well beyond” its original intent, imposing unpredictable “constraints” on government and domestic courts, particularly regarding immigration.

The announcement, anticipated at the Tory conference next week, aims to align the party with Nigel Farage's stance on the ECHR amid challenges with illegal migration.

While Lord Wolfson claims human rights would not be harmed, Labour's attorney general Lord Hermer warned that leaving would place the UK alongside Russia and Belarus.

“There are many questions, many doubts.” The Des Moines School Board has scheduled a special closed-session meeting on Saturday to discuss the arrest and Roberts’ status with the district.","The superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools — Iowa’s largest school district – was detained Friday morning by immigration agents, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which said the educator was in the country illegally and had existing weapon possession charges.

Superintendent Ian Roberts – an educator with decades of experience who previously competed as an Olympic athlete for Guyana – was arrested as part of a “targeted enforcement operation” and fled after US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers approached him, according to statements from DHS and the Iowa Department of Public Safety.

DHS said he was “in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash and a fixed blade hunting knife” at the time of his arrest. It’s a violation of federal law to own a firearm and ammunition if an individual doesn’t have legal status in the US.

CNN is working to identify Roberts’ attorney.

The school district and DHS presented starkly divergent portraits of Roberts. DHS described him as a “criminal alien” and suggested he was a public safety threat. But at a news conference after his arrest, board president of Des Moines Public Schools Jackie Norris said the superintendent was “an integral part of our school community” who “has shown up in ways big and small” for students and staff.

The arrest spurred a protest outside the federal courthouse in Des Moines. “Education, not deportation / Free Dr. Roberts,” read one sign carried by a demonstrator, according to footage from CNN affiliate KCCI.

The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners issued Roberts a license to serve as superintendent in the state in July 2023, according to Norris.

“There is new information that has been made public that we did not know, and we have not been able to verify,” Norris said.

Roberts oversaw over 30,000 students in the Des Moines public school system, according to the district’s website, and had previously worked at public schools across the country.

Another administrator, Matt Smith, has taken the role of interim superintendent in the meantime, according to a message posted on social media by the district earlier.

“Our priority is to provide a safe, secure and outstanding education for all students and to support our students, families, and employees,” the statement read.

Roberts’ arrest comes amid the Trump administration’s continued crackdown on immigration, which has seen raids on workplaces and arrests of community pillars including a firefighter, a journalist and a pastor.

Superintendent was given final order of removal in 2024, DHS says

Roberts entered the US on a student visa in 1999 and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, according to the DHS statement. He had existing weapon charges from 2020, the agency added.

Des Moines Public Schools said it was unaware of the order of removal but Roberts did inform the school board of a firearms offense related to a hunting rifle during his hiring process. The district said in a statement Roberts “provided sufficient context and explanation of the situation to move forward in the hiring process.”

Public records show Roberts pleaded guilty to a weapon charge in Pennsylvania in 2022. CNN has been unable to verify whether Roberts has a separate charge from 2020.

The district also said Roberts submitted an employment eligibility verification form and an I-9 as part of the hiring process.

“The district has not been formally notified by ICE about this matter, nor have we been able to talk with Dr. Roberts since his detention,” district spokesperson Phil Roeder said.

ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations St. Paul Field Office Director Sam Olson said in a statement Robertson’s arrest should be a “wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats.”

ICE’s online detainee locator system shows Roberts was born in Guyana and is being held at a county jail in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

Roberts was named Des Moines Public Schools superintendent in 2023, according to the district’s website. He was “born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn, NY,” the website reads.

Before becoming an educator, the superintendent was an Olympic athlete and competed in track and field at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.

Roberts’ long educational career has included positions in New York City; Baltimore; Washington, DC; St. Louis; Oakland, California; and Erie, Pennsylvania, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Among the crowd protesting Roberts’ arrest Friday was district teacher Mary Pat LaMair, who said she was excited to see the display of support.

“I just think it’s really important that we take care of one another, and we seem to be at a spot where that’s not what’s happening,” LaMair told CNN affiliate KCCI. She added, “It’s important for people to know that the general public, I think, is not okay with what’s happening.”

The Directors Council — a nonprofit group serving Des Moines’ Black community — identified Roberts as a board member and offered him their “full support” in a post on Facebook.

Roberts “has been a trusted partner, a dedicated advocate for equity, and an unwavering supporter of families and youth in Polk County,” reads the post. “His contributions to both The Directors Council and the wider community are immeasurable, and we stand with him during this uncertain moment.”

In a video statement posted on their Facebook page, organizers from the Iowa Movement for Migrant Justice said news of the superintendent’s detention was shocking and scary for immigrant communities.

“We know in advance that our families right now are afraid that if they go to pick up their kids, if they send them to school, if immigrant agents are going to go take their kids out of school,” Elizabeth Balcarcel said in the video statement. “There are many questions, many doubts.”

The Des Moines School Board has scheduled a special closed-session meeting on Saturday to discuss the arrest and Roberts’ status with the district.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/usatsi-20678534.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-27 07:56:24.462282

It was not immediately clear whether the detainees were then sent to other locations or transferred back to the Dallas processing facility.","DALLAS — A senior official at the Department of Homeland Security identified the three immigrant detainees who were victims in the shooting Wednesday at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas.

The senior DHS official familiar with the case told NBC News the three were Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez of Mexico, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela, and Norlan Guzman-Fuentes. DHS did not say what country Guzman-Fuentes was from.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on which of the men was killed, the extent of the injuries of the other two, and details about criminal allegations made against the men by the agency.

The men were wounded on Wednesday when a gunman who targeted ICE agents and employees opened fire on the agency’s field office in Dallas, federal officials said. No ICE agents were injured in the attack, but one detainee was fatally shot and two others were injured.

NBC News has not yet been able to independently verify the criminal allegations against the men, and the official at the agency did not immediately respond to request for comment for additional details. NBC News has not yet been able to reach the families of the men and it was not clear if any of them had immigration attorneys.

Garcia-Hernandez was described by the senior official as an immigrant from Mexico living in the country illegally, whose criminal history included “convictions for giving fictitious information, evading arrest, driving while intoxicated, and fleeing police.”

A man who identified himself as Garcia-Hernandez’s sibling told a local Dallas Univision station that his 32-year-old brother was shot in the side, back, stomach and neck and remained in critical condition in a local hospital.

He said his brother had undergone two surgeries and that doctors “want to disconnect him because the machine is the only thing that keeps him alive.”

The brother, who was identified as Fernando, said Garcia had been living in the U.S. for 20 years and was a painter.

NBC News had reached out to Garcia’s relatives through a family associate but they have not responded to a request for an interview.

Bordones-Molina was described as an immigrant man from Venezuela living in the country illegally. The DHS official said his “criminal history includes theft of property and a traffic offense.”

Guzman-Fuentes’ nationality was not disclosed by the authorities. The DHS official said Guzman-Fuentes’ “criminal history includes previous arrests for battery, improper exhibit of a firearm or dangerous weapon, criminal mischief, driving while intoxicated, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.”

Since the shooting took place on Wednesday morning, little information has been publicly released about the victims.

The shooting has left some members of the city’s immigrant community anxious and uncertain, especially as questions remained about the victims.

“The government should do its job and make sure that it fully investigates this and that it’s transparent with the victims, the families of the victims, and with the community,” said Rochelle Garza, an attorney and the president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, who called for more transparency and information about the victims.

The uncertainty is creating more stress for people who have been dealing with increased immigration enforcement operations, Garza said. Families whose loved ones have been recently detained by ICE could be concerned that their loved ones were at the Dallas facility during the shooting.

An ICE official told NBC News on Thursday morning that there were between eight and 10 detainees in the van when the gunman opened fire.

An ICE spokesperson said a consulate was working to locate next of kin for at least one victim. Each of the three victims are from different countries, the spokesperson said. The agency is required to publish a notice about the death of any detainee in custody within 48 hours of the death and of the next of kin being notified, according to a 2025 agency directive.

ICE is also required to notify next of kin, the appropriate consulate, relevant DHS and ICE stakeholders and Congress about each detainee death.

Guillermo Hernandez, an immigration attorney based in Texas, said attorneys have had issues with tracking down the whereabouts of their clients, an issue that the shooting brought into focus.

“To advocate for your client, you have to know where they are,” he said. “Unfortunately, we’ve seen that there’s not necessarily the best transparency when it comes to detainees, when it comes to immigrants being transferred. They move immigrants around detention centers from one day to the next.”

“We should be able to know and figure out at what point in the immigration process they were. Did they have attorneys? Did they have a case pending?” he added.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on concerns from attorneys and relatives on being informed of the whereabouts of the detainees who were moved from the Dallas facility following the shooting.

Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday that one of the injured is a Mexican national who was receiving medical treatment at a hospital, but has not identified Garcia Hernandez and has not responded to a request for comment on his identity or his medical condition. The ministry said Thursday morning they had spoken to the wife of the Mexican national who was injured in the shooting.

Roberto Velasco Álvarez, the chief officer for North America at Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in Spanish on social media that he “conveyed our support during this difficult moment” and reiterated Mexico’s solidarity with the victim’s family.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told NBC News on Wednesday that the agency is “charged with their protection, their custody,” referring to the detainees. “Nothing like that should happen.”

Authorities have said agents with both ICE and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives pulled some detainees out of the line of fire during the shooting in Dallas.

“The shooter was just shooting at random vehicles inside,” Lyons said. “They were still hit inside the vehicle. You know, there were some brave men and women on the ground that went into those vans pulling those detainees out while they were under fire.”

Questions remain about what comes next for the detainees who were in the van during the shooting.

Marcos Charles, ICE’s field office director of Enforcement and Removal Operations, said at a news conference Thursday that those people “will be going through due process” and their immigration proceedings. He did not provide additional details about their status.

“We encourage the families to get copies of the police incident report and to also contact their consulates,” he said.

All of the detainees at the targeted site were temporarily moved from the Dallas Processing Facility to the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, according to Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. It was not immediately clear whether the detainees were then sent to other locations or transferred back to the Dallas processing facility.

Ashleigh Brown, Cynthia Raygoza and Sandra Carmona Samane face charges of disclosing the personal information of a federal agent and conspiracy, according to an indictment unsealed late Friday.
According to the indictment, the three women followed an ICE agent from the federal building on 300 North Los Angeles Street in downtown L.A. to the agent’s residence in Baldwin Park.

Ashleigh Brown, Cynthia Raygoza and Sandra Carmona Samane face charges of disclosing the personal information of a federal agent and conspiracy, according to an indictment unsealed late Friday.

Brown, who is from Colorado and goes by the nickname “AK,” has been described as one of the founders of “ice_out_ofla” an Instagram page with more than 28,000 followers that plays a role in organizing demonstrations against immigration enforcement, according to the social media page and an email reviewed by The Times.

According to the indictment, the three women followed an ICE agent from the federal building on 300 North Los Angeles Street in downtown L.A. to the agent’s residence in Baldwin Park.

They live-streamed the entire event, according to the indictment. Once they arrived at the agent’s home, prosecutors allege the women got out and shouted “la migra lives here,” and “ICE lives on your street and you should know,” according to the indictment.

“Our brave federal agents put their lives on the line every day to keep our nation safe,” Acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli said in a statement. “The conduct of these defendants are deeply offensive to law enforcement officers and their families. If you threaten, dox, or harm in any manner one of our agents or employees, you will face prosecution and prison time.”

An attorney for Samane, 25, of Los Angeles, said she intends to plead not guilty at an arraignment next month and declined further comment.

The Federal Public Defender’s Office, which is representing Brown, 38, of Aurora, Colo., did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Court records did not list an attorney for Raygoza, 37, of Riverside.

Footage published to the ice_out_ofla Instagram page seemed to capture Brown’s arrest earlier this week. The video shows a man in green fatigues and body armor saying he has a warrant for her arrest, while reaching through what appears to be the shattered driver’s side window of her car. Brown asks what the warrant is for while the man can be seen holding a collapsible baton. Then the video cuts out.

Posts on the Instagram page describe Brown as a “political prisoner.”

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Los Angeles did not immediately respond to questions about whether the women specifically shouted out the agent’s address online or what the defendants specifically did to “incite the commission of a crime of violence against a federal agent,” as the indictment alleges.

Federal law enforcement leaders have repeatedly expressed concern about the “doxing” of agents with ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol as residents of Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities continue to protest the Trump administration’s sprawling deportation efforts.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem threatened to prosecute people for publishing agents’ personal information last month in response to fliers in Portland that called for people to collect intel on ICE.

But the indictment returned Friday appeared to be the first prosecution related to such tactics.

At issue in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition is $4 billion in foreign aid allocated by Congress that the Trump administration determined was wasteful, including funding for international public health such as HIV prevention programs, which have been credited with saving millions of lives.

The high court's right-wing majority found that ""the asserted harms to the executive’s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm"" to aid recipients, while cautioning that ""this order should not be read as a final determination on the merits.""

The Trump administration sought not only validation of its claimed ability to claw back spending previously approved by Congress—which under the Constitution generally holds power of the purse—but also of ""pocket recission,"" a highly contentious budgetary maneuver to cancel previously approved federal expenditures by exploiting legal ambiguity in the Impoundment Control Act (ICA).

Democrats and many legal experts contend that pocket recissions are illegal, and Democratic lawmakers warned even before Trump's White House return that he would try to use the tactic in order to refuse to disburse funds allocated by Congress for social programs.

The bill would also give Congress the ability to end tariffs at any time by passing a resolution of disapproval.","Here’s a look at some prominent cases:

CoreCivic v. New Jersey

In 2021, New Jersey passed a law that prevents state, local and private entities from entering into or renewing contracts for immigration detention. CoreCivic, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional.

CoreCivic argued that New Jersey’s law shouldn’t apply to it because the company is effectively serving as an arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Constitution blocks state laws from regulating the federal government or its agencies.

In 2023, U.S. District Judge Robert Kirsch decided partly in favor of CoreCivic. Although New Jersey could prevent state and local entities from entering into contracts with ICE, he ruled, it could not prevent CoreCivic or another private entity from doing so. Calling the law a “dagger aimed at the heart of the federal government’s immigration enforcement mission and operations,” Kirsch reasoned that allowing the full law to stand could encourage neighboring states to pass similar laws. That, he wrote, “would result in nothing short of chaos.”

A federal appeals court upheld Kirsch’s decision in July.

Newark v. GEO

In late February, GEO announced ICE had awarded it a 15-year contract, worth roughly $1 billion, to reopen Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility in Newark, New Jersey. Delaney opened May 1 after months of what city officials called “irresponsible construction practices.”

In an April complaint, the city alleged Delaney Hall put detained people and staff in danger because GEO wouldn’t allow city inspectors to review the plumbing, electrical work or elevators. Newark also alleged that GEO failed to file for a certificate of continued occupancy — a form required whenever there is a change in tenant or ownership of a property. The city asked for a court order to stop Delaney’s operation while the case proceeds.

GEO called the lawsuit politically motivated and adopted a similar argument to the one CoreCivic made, saying Newark couldn’t use local codes to interfere with the federal government’s business: detaining immigrants.

Newark didn’t get the injunction it sought, so Delaney Hall remains open as the case proceeds.

City of Leavenworth v. CoreCivic

CoreCivic is seeking to reopen the shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas under a new contract with ICE to hold up to 1,000 immigrants. The company had used the building from 1992 through 2021, primarily to hold people awaiting trial on federal charges.

The city argues the company must obtain a special use permit to operate the facility as a detention center. When the city passed a 2012 zoning law that would have required such a permit, CoreCivic was exempt because the facility already operated as a prison. But because the facility has now been idle for several years, the city maintains CoreCivic must now apply for the permit.

CoreCivic insists it doesn’t need the permit because it never abandoned the building. As it did in New Jersey, it also argues that local ordinances can’t interfere with the company when it’s doing work for the federal government.

The city’s argument won over a local judge, who issued a temporary order barring the reopening. CoreCivic has asked the judge to reconsider while the battle plays out.

Friends of the Everglades v. Noem

In late May, two environmental advocacy groups sued several federal and Florida agencies over a sprawling new immigration detention center in the Everglades. Commonly called “Alligator Alcatraz” — a term coined by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier — the facility was constructed in a matter of days on an airfield in the heart of the Big Cypress National Preserve. Made of trailers and huge tents on the tarmac, the complex is expected to be temporary but has a capacity of up to 3,000 beds, according to state officials.

The advocacy groups want the project shut down on the grounds that authorities failed to produce the required assessment of how it will affect the environment. They’re also arguing it will harm people’s ability to use the area for recreation, science and other purposes. The Miccosukee Tribe has joined the lawsuit, saying the facility negatively affects sacred sites and other protected lands.

In court filings, defendants have sought to shift responsibility onto one another. Miami-Dade County argued the state used its emergency powers to commandeer the facility and that it was powerless to fight back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management maintains it didn’t need to produce an environmental impact report because those are required only of federal agencies.

Lawyers for ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, argue the federal government can’t close the facility because it is the state’s operation.

In late August, a federal judge halted continued construction of the facility and said no additional detainees could be sent there. Additionally, officials must remove temporary fencing that prevented members of the Miccosukee Tribe from accessing the land. A separate lawsuit alleges detainees at the facility have been prevented from accessing legal counsel.

Guantanamo Bay plaintiffs v. DHS, ICE and other defendants

On Feb. 4, a plane carrying 10 immigrants landed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after the White House directed officials to use the base to house immigrants being deported from the U.S. The notorious military prison there — first opened in 2002 to hold terrorism suspects — had never been used for this purpose.

Represented by the ACLU and several other organizations, immigrants sent to Guantanamo Bay sued, arguing their detention outside the U.S. was illegal and a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process and their right to habeas corpus, the legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment.

The case is pending.

GEO v. Washington state

In 2023, Washington state enacted new regulations and requirements for private detention centers. Those included requiring the state Health Department to adopt new rules regarding health and safety and regular inspections of such facilities.

GEO, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.

Among the state’s arguments was that GEO had no standing to sue because the law would only affect new or extended contracts — not those already in place.

A federal judge ruled mostly in favor of GEO but, on a technicality, left alone the section of the law that would affect new or extended contracts.

The state appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in February but hasn’t ruled.

In May, the state amended the statute to define a “private detention facility” as any operated by a private, nongovernmental entity, regardless of whether the facility is operated for profit. The new law, GEO argues, is still unconstitutional but much different in substance and scope.

Yet Congress has steadily ceded its constitutional role in trade policy to the executive branch over the course of many decades. What was once the responsibility of the People’s Branch has increasingly become the domain of presidents who wield tariffs and trade agreements as instruments of foreign and domestic policy. This imbalance was not created overnight. But the result is a dangerous concentration of power that runs contrary to our constitutional order.

Historically, Congress played the central role in setting tariffs and trade policy. That began to shift in the 20th century when lawmakers began delegating increased negotiating authority to the executive branch. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The Trade Act of 1974 established the Trade Promotion Authority — a statute that allowed for the President to work in tandem with Congress to approve trade agreements. Nonetheless, each of the aforementioned laws gave presidents greater leeway to cut deals or impose restrictions in the name of national security or economic stability. While these moves were intended to provide flexibility, they also blurred constitutional lines.

In recent years, presidents from both parties have increasingly exploited these powers in unilateral and unpredictable ways. Trade wars have been launched without debate, presidents have imposed sweeping tariffs against allies and adversaries alike, and major international agreements have been entered into or abandoned without legislative approval. This is not how our system of checks and balances was meant to function.

The danger is twofold. First, unchecked executive power on trade undermines democratic accountability. When a president can, with the stroke of a pen, raise costs for American farmers, manufacturers, and families, the people’s representatives are sidelined. Second, it erodes the very principle of separated powers that our republic depends on.

Congress has a constitutional duty and responsibility to reassert itself—and the American people agree. In a recent poll released by Issue One, 56 percent of American voters surveyed nationwide do not believe that the president should be able to impose tariffs unilaterally without congressional approval.

Restoring balance does not mean returning to the tariff protectionist era of the 19th century. It does mean setting clear parameters around when and how the executive may act, requiring congressional approval for significant tariff actions, and reclaiming oversight of trade agreements that have significant repercussions for our economy.

Several bipartisan proposals in recent years have sought to rein in presidential tariff authority and restore Congress's proper role. The Trade Review Act of 2025, introduced earlier this year by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), would reestablish limits on the president’s ability to impose unilateral tariffs without the approval of Congress. It would require the president to notify Congress of any new tariffs within 48 hours, and Congress would have to pass a joint resolution approving the new tariffs within 60 days; otherwise, all new tariffs would expire. The bill would also give Congress the ability to end tariffs at any time by passing a resolution of disapproval. This proposal should be taken up with urgency.

As James Madison warned, the accumulation of power in any single branch is “the very definition of tyranny.” Allowing the executive to dominate trade policy erodes the balance Madison and his colleagues carefully constructed. Reasserting Congress’s authority would not only protect our economy from the whims of individual leaders, it would reaffirm the basic principle that in a republic, no single branch governs alone.

Congress must reclaim its rightful place in trade policy – not as a matter of partisanship, but as a matter of constitutional principle. Our prosperity, our democratic accountability, and our checks and balances depend on it.

He mistakenly crossed the Ambassador Suspension Bridge, which rises about 118 meters above the Detroit River and connects the U.S. city with Windsor, Ontario, Canada.

On February 27, while in detention, Ricardo was issued a deportation order and he expected he would be going back to Venezuela.

On March 15, he told a friend in Chicago that he was among a number of detainees housed in Texas who expected to be repatriated to Venezuela. That evening, the Trump administration flew three planes carrying Venezuelan migrants from the Texas facility to El Salvador, where they have been ever since, locked up in a maximum-security prison and denied contact with the outside world.

Juan Pappier, deputy director of the Americas Division at Human Rights Watch (HRW), an organization investigating these deportations and recording other cases of deportees whose names do not appear on any list, tells EL PAÍS that these deportations not only violate due process, but also amount to “forced disappearances.”

According to Pappier, it is inconceivable that the government has not yet issued an official list of deportees, beyond the one leaked to the press. He also highlights that it was only when Bukele proposed an exchange of detainees for political prisoners with Nicolás Maduro that it was revealed that 252 Venezuelans had actually been deported to El Salvador.

“Families should not have to rely on the work of journalists to discover the whereabouts of their loved ones,” says Pappier. “The state has an obligation to disclose the whereabouts of these people. This is extremely cruel and causes immense suffering for the families.”

“Ricardo’s story by itself is incredibly tragic — and we don’t know how many Ricardos there are,” said Ben Levey, a staff attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center who tried to locate Mr. Prada. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials ultimately confirmed to him that he had been deported but did not divulge his destination.

Only after Ricardo's case made headlines on April 22, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) publicly acknowledged on social media that the young man “was expelled” to El Salvador on March 15, the same day the first 238 detainees were sent.",http://lulac.org/thedisappeared/Ricardo_Prada_Vsquez_1.png,N,,2025-09-27 02:56:26.916776

School district officials say they have not been told the circumstances of his arrest, and have called him an integral part of the school community.
The agency said that he initially fled from police in a vehicle that had been provided to him by the school district.

""How this illegal alien was hired without work authorisation, a final order of removal, and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district,"" he added.","US immigration agents have arrested the superintendent of the largest school district in the state of Iowa, accusing him of overstaying his student visa.

Superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools Ian Andre Roberts was arrested on Friday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on a fugitive warrant. He also faces a firearms offence.

Officials say that he is a citizen of Guyana, and that his permit to work in the US expired in 2020. School district officials say they have not been told the circumstances of his arrest, and have called him an integral part of the school community.

It comes amid a wider US crackdown on immigration, as President Donald Trump seeks to deport all illegal migrants.

It is unclear whether Mr Roberts has hired an attorney to speak on his behalf.

Records show that he is being jailed at an immigration detention centre near the city of Des Moines.

In a statement, ICE said that he was found ""in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash and a fixed blade hunting knife"".

The agency said that he initially fled from police in a vehicle that had been provided to him by the school district. Officers later found his abandoned vehicle and located him with the help of Iowa State Patrol.

According to ICE, he has an existing weapons charge from February 2020, and had originally entered the US on a student visa in 1999. A federal judge ordered him to be deported in 2024.

The investigation into the handgun found by officers is being turned over to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ICE said, noting that is illegal for undocumented immigrants in the US to possess firearms.

Before leading the district of around 30,000 students in Iowa, he had previously worked as an educator in four other states, and earned college degrees and credits from universities including Georgetown and Harvard.

He also competed for Guyana in track and field at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. He also participated in World Championships in Japan and Spain, according to NBC News.

A biography on the school district's website says that ""he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana, and spent most of his formative years in Brooklyn, NY"". It adds that he ""enjoys hunting"".

School Board Chair Jackie Norris said in a news conference on Friday that the board is still trying to determine the facts of his case.

""We do not have all the facts. There is much we do not know,"" she said, according to The Des Moines Register newspaper.

""However, what we do know is Dr Roberts has been an integral part of our school community since he joined two years ago.""

Local ICE Director Sam Olson said in a statement that the arrest ""should be a wake-up call for our communities to the great work that our officers are doing every day to remove public safety threats"".

Mr. Trump issued the order on his first day in office, but it has been blocked by the courts ever since.

In a pair of petitions, government lawyers argued that the Constitution’s promise of citizenship was conferred on “freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens.”

The common understanding of the 14th Amendment for more than a century, upheld by the Supreme Court, has guaranteed citizenship to children born in the United States. But D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, argued that such a view was “mistaken,” according to the filings, which were reviewed by The New York Times but have not yet appeared in the court’s public case-tracking system.

If the justices were to take the case, the court could hear arguments on the matter during its upcoming term, which is set to begin in early October. Decisions are typically announced by late June or early July.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Most of the detained workers are Mexican nationals and are being held at Dodge County Detention Center, Maldonado said.
Dairy, manufacturing industries rely on immigrant labor Statewide, and especially in Manitowoc County, undocumented immigrants make up much of the dairy industry workforce.
That's in part because there is no year-round agricultural visa available in the U.S. Manitowoc County has the most mega-dairies, or concentrated animal feeding operations, of any county in the state.
One Manitowoc County farmer, Michael Slattery, said that when one worker is detained, ""news spreads very quickly.""","People have been calling Jennifer Maldonado's phone ever since the morning of Sept. 25, when word began spreading that federal immigration authorities were picking up dairy farm workers in a Walmart parking lot in Manitowoc.

The news that 21 people without legal status were detained by the FBI and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has shaken people in Manitowoc County, a community of about 80,000 people in eastern Wisconsin. Much of the county's agricultural and manufacturing sector relies on Latino immigrants.

Maldonado, who leads a local immigrant advocacy group called Crusaders for Justicia, said people are asking her: ""Is it safe? Are they still here? Can we take our kids to school? What happens if we get taken?""

""There's just this mad rush of trying to protect their families,"" she said. ""It's frightening for the whole community.""

Many of the facts of the operation are still unclear.

The FBI has said nine of the 21 people are suspected of sexual assault and human trafficking of children. However, the agency has provided no evidence for the statement. The FBI has declined to answer questions about what prompted the operation and what charges, if any, the arrested individuals are facing.

ICE has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Journal Sentinel.

The Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Office also declined to answer whether deputies assisted in the operation. Sheriff Daniel Hartwig was unavailable for comment.

As community leaders and clergy in Manitowoc try to piece together answers, they're also reflecting on the impact on the broader community and the feeling that hardworking people were swept up with suspected criminals.

""I don't believe this is going to be a one-and-done type thing,"" said Maldonado. ""I do believe that we are just seeing the cusp of the problems that are about to ensue.""

Pastors, community leaders piece together information

With little being said through official channels, community leaders are gathering information piece by piece.

Maldonado spoke to a representative at the sheriff's office who told her that deputies helped the FBI serve warrants for specific individuals in residential areas, where they made some arrests. The sheriff's office was not involved in the arrests in the Walmart parking lot with ICE, the representative told her.

Maldonado does not know why ICE apparently detained people there. It's well-known that people gather there to carpool to nearby farms, she said.

Most of the detained workers are Mexican nationals and are being held at Dodge County Detention Center, Maldonado said.

Based on conversations with local law enforcement, Deacon Mark LeGreve of St. Francis of Assisi Parish said he had the impression that the operation was going after a few high-value targets, and others may have been picked up because they were easily accessible.

Two members of the Catholic parish were detained in the operation, LeGreve said. He said they agreed to be deported to Honduras.

As people reached out to church staff asking how they could find their detained family members, LeGreve noted ""an intensified fear"" in the Latino community. Some are questioning whether to go to church, seek health care or go to work.

""It strikes home,"" he said.

The Rev. Matthew Sauer is the pastor of the Manitowoc Cooperative Ministry, serving both Peace United Church of Christ and First Presbyterian Church. He was concerned that people were apparently detained on their way to work.

Sauer said he wanted authorities to distinguish between suspected criminals and others just trying to make a living.

""Violent offenders need to be prosecuted, and hardworking families don't deserve to be scapegoated,"" he said.

""This isn't being weak on crime,"" he added. ""It's about capturing what appear to be innocent families and disrupting their lives just because they happen to be in a particular place at a particular time.""

Dairy, manufacturing industries rely on immigrant labor

Statewide, and especially in Manitowoc County, undocumented immigrants make up much of the dairy industry workforce. That's in part because there is no year-round agricultural visa available in the U.S.

Manitowoc County has the most mega-dairies, or concentrated animal feeding operations, of any county in the state. These farms are massive operations with at least 700 cows each, making them especially reliant on undocumented immigrant labor, much more than family farms.

Darin Von Ruden, president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, echoed how much uncertainty there is for farmers and workers after an immigration operation.

""We’re putting hardworking people in a bad spot,"" he said.

Manitowoc's Latino community is well-established and integrated into the broader population, said Sachin Shivaram, chief executive officer of Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry in Manitowoc. People may come for farm work then go on to other work, contributing to the growth of the area, he said.

""Those people stay here, and then they get jobs and build families,"" said Shivaram, who has been a vocal advocate for immigrants in the workforce.

One Manitowoc County farmer, Michael Slattery, said that when one worker is detained, ""news spreads very quickly."" Other employees stop showing up for work, and it's hard to find anyone to replace them. Cows aren't milked, pens aren't cleaned and calves go unfed, he said.

According to Slattery, a man who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and was trying to legalize his status is among those who were detained Sept. 25.

Slattery spoke to the man's wife, who is a U.S. citizen. Together, they have five U.S. citizen children.

Slattery said the man was walking out to his truck before 6 a.m. to head to work when he was picked up by ICE agents who were in the neighborhood executing a warrant on a nearby house. The agents arrested four people in the house. According to Slattery, the agents did not know who the man was, but took him too.

His wife walked out to find his lunch still resting on the hood of his truck, he said.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/18/PSHE/86216443007-091725-man-manitowoc-two-rivers-scenes-gck-04.JPG?crop=4367,2457,x0,y291&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-27 01:57:06.852964

Tennessee governor says more federal agents to join fight against crime in Memphis next week

The city has been bracing for an influx of National Guard troops since Trump announced his intention to deploy them. On Friday residents finally learned more about the plan, and it looks to be very different from deployments in Los Angeles and Washington.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said the troops will be part of a surge of resources to fight crime that includes 13 federal agencies and state troopers. The National Guard troops will be from the state, and they will be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service to support local law enforcement in the majority Black city.

The Republican governor said the troops will not make arrests and will not be armed unless local law enforcement officials request it. Lee has previously said he doesn’t think there will be more than 150 guard members, but he later said the number was still in the planning stages.

ICE arrests leader of Iowa’s largest school district, says he was living and working in US illegally

Federal immigration agents targeted the well-liked Des Moines Public School Superintendent Ian Roberts in a traffic stop Friday and arrested him after he fled into the woods, leaving educators and community members stunned.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Roberts was in the country illegally and had no work authorization. Roberts, who is from Guyana in South America, was considered an ICE fugitive because he was subject to a final removal order issued in 2024, the agency said.

It was unclear if Roberts had an attorney to represent him.

FBI firings come amid broader purge

The FBI’s dismissal of agents who took a knee during a demonstration following the 2020 killing of Floyd comes amid a broader personnel purge at the bureau under Director Kash Patel.

Five agents and top-level executives were known to have been summarily fired last month in a wave of ousters that current and former officials say has contributed to declining morale.

One helped oversee investigations into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Another served as acting director in the early days of the Trump administration and resisted Justice Department demands to supply the names of agents who investigated Jan. 6. A third was incorrectly rumored on social media to have participated in the investigation into Trump’s retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

A lawsuit filed last week by three of the fired agents alleged that Patel understood the firings were “likely illegal” but had to carry them out because he was ordered to do so by the White House.

Patel has denied taking orders from the White House on whom to fire and has said anyone who has been fired failed to meet bureau standards.

Judge rules ‘MyPillow Guy’ Mike Lindell defamed Smartmatic on voting machines

The federal judge in Minnesota found that Lindell falsely claimed that Smartmatic’s voting machines helped rig the 2020 presidential election, identifying 51 instances in which he made false claims.

However the question of whether Lindell acted with “actual malice” will not be resolved until later — Smartmatic needs to prove that to collect damages.

Attorney Erik Connolly said Smartmatic will be seeking “nine-figure damages” from Lindell and MyPillow for “spreading lies” and “Smartmatic did not and could not have rigged the 2020 election.”

FBI fires agents photographed kneeling during 2020 racial justice protest, AP sources say

The agents were photographed at a protest in Washington that followed the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, three people familiar with the matter said Friday.

The bureau reassigned the agents last spring but has since fired them, said the people, who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel matters with The Associated Press.

The number of employees dismissed was not immediately clear, but two people said it was roughly 20.

79-year-old US citizen injured in Los Angeles immigration raid files $50 million claim

The man’s claim seeks $50 million in damages and says federal agents violated his civil rights when they tackled him during the Sept. 9 raid at a car wash.

Car wash owner Rafie Ollah Shouhed suffered several broken ribs, chest trauma and elbow injuries and has symptoms of a traumatic brain injury, according to the claim. Shouhed is a naturalized U.S citizen from Iran.

The claim was filed against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection.

A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that authorities arrested five people from Guatemala and Mexico “who broke our nation’s immigration laws” and alleged that Shouhed “impeded the operation and was arrested for assaulting and impeding a federal officer.”

Shouhed and his attorney V. James DeSimone denied that accusation.

States sue administration over threats to pull sexual education funding

The complaint filed Friday by 16 states and the District of Columbia alleges that threats by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to pull funding over curricula mentioning diverse gender identities violate federal law and Congress’ spending power.

“Through threatening letters and coercive terms and conditions, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is attempting to force Plaintiff States to rewrite sexual health curricula to erase entire categories of students,” the complaint says.

HHS wants to prohibit the inclusion of what it describes as “gender ideology” in lessons funded by the Personal Responsibility Education Program and the Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education program.

The lawsuit comes after HHS warned states in August that they had 60 days to change lessons or lose grants. California was warned previously, and its $12 million grant was withdrawn Aug. 21.

HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Transportation Department tightens noncitizen truck driver rules after fatal crash in Florida

The new rules announced Friday make getting commercial driver’s licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible.

States will also have to verify an applicant’s immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant’s visa expires sooner than that.

A nationwide commercial driver’s license audit began after officials say a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people. Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses.

A conviction may be beside the point for the DOJ as it pursues case against Comey

For a Justice Department facing intense White House pressure to investigate perceived presidential enemies, indicting former FBI Director James Comey was the easy part.

Building a case that can sway a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is a significantly tougher task, but like in other cases of investigations of Trump’s critics, that increasingly seems to be almost beside the point.

As the administration aims to comply with Trump’s ordered prosecutions, officials have signaled that making life uncomfortable for targets of retribution — including through reputational harm, legal fees and lingering uncertainty — is a desired goal in its own right, separate and apart from the ability to secure a guilty verdict.

It’s a sharp break for a department that for decades, under bipartisan leadership, has been hesitant to bring cases unless it believes it can win, securing convictions in the overwhelming majority of prosecutions it initiates.

Analyst sees Kimmel’s return as unsurprising

After Nexstar Media Group joined Sinclair Broadcast Group in bringing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” back to its local TV stations Friday, Matthew Dolgin, senior equity analyst at research firm Morningstar, said he wasn’t surprised.

“The relationship with Disney is far too important for these firms to risk,” Dolgin said.

And setting aside legal rights from either side, Dolgin added, “Disney would’ve been free to take its affiliate agreements elsewhere in 2026 if these relationships were too difficult. That scenario would be devastating to Nexstar and Sinclair.”

The companies suspended the program over the comedian’s comments related to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

But now Kimmel will once again air on Nexstar’s ABC affiliates in 28 cities, along with the 38 stations where Sinclair agreed to restore the show.

Trump’s transportation department pulls trail and bike grants it deems ‘hostile’ to cars

The department has been pulling back grants already announced for recreational trails and bicycle lanes, telling local officials that their projects fail to promote road capacity or are “hostile to motor vehicles.”

The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico — informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.

The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration’s emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration’s focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.

While the new grants Trump’s transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it’s practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms.

Plaintiff critical of Supreme Court ruling on foreign aid funding

Friday’s high court decision extended an order that allows Trump’s administration to keep frozen nearly $5 billion in foreign aid, handing him another victory in a dispute over presidential power.

Nick Sansone, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation Group who represented the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition in the case, said the ruling “further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order.”

“It will also have a grave humanitarian impact on vulnerable communities throughout the world.”

Trump moves toward deal to give US an equity stake in company developing Nevada lithium mine

The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world’s largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries.

General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of the Trump administration intervening directly in private companies.

“We support the project moving forward,’′ said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

Trump says he’s ordering the declassification and release of Amelia Earhart records

Trump made the announcement on his social media site shortly after he returned to the White House from attending the Ryder Cup golf tournament in New York.

He said Earhart’s story is such an “interesting story” and that “many people” have asked him about it and whether he’d consider declassifying and making public everything the government knows about her, including her final flight.

Earhart’s plane vanished in 1937 during her attempt to fly around the world.

“Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions,” Trump wrote. “I am ordering my Administration to declassify and release all Government Records related to Amelia Earhart, her final trip, and everything else about her.”

Supreme Court keeps in place Trump foreign aid funding freeze

The Supreme Court on Friday extended an order that allows President Donald Trump’s administration to keep frozen nearly $5 billion in foreign aid, handing him another victory in a dispute over presidential power.

The court acted on the Republican administration’s emergency appeal in a case involving billions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

The Justice Department sought the high court’s intervention after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that Trump’s action was likely illegal and that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.

The federal appeals court in Washington declined to put Ali’s ruling on hold, but Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked it on Sept. 9. The full court indefinitely extended Roberts’ order.

Wearing a blue suit and white golf shoes, Trump walked into the Oval Office with his granddaughter, Kai Trump, who is a competitive golfer at the collegiate level.

He didn’t stop to answer any questions from reporters and had nothing else on his public schedule for the rest of the day.

In rare rebuke, federal officials discipline ICE officer for shoving woman in New York

A federal immigration officer who shoved an Ecuadorian woman to the floor at a Manhattan court is “being relieved of current duties,” the Department of Homeland Security said Friday in a rare rebuke of one of its officers.

The altercation, which was captured on videos that spread quickly on social media, unfolded after the woman’s husband was arrested at an immigration court in New York City.

Footage shows the woman approach the immigration officer following her husband’s arrest, pleading with the officer in Spanish and at one point saying “You don’t care about anything,” before he pushes her into a wall and then onto the floor of a crowded hallway.

“The officer’s conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary at DHS, which oversees immigration enforcement.

It is extremely rare for the Trump administration’s DHS to discipline immigration officers for aggressive tactics across the U.S.",https://accesswdun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ap-img-68d6a19464904-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 13:57:36.274495

So far, federal judges – include those in D.C. and Chicago – have filed temporary restraining orders and injunctions that temporarily bar the Trump administration from deporting the children while the lawsuits play out in court.

“They're four Guatemalan teenagers, none of which want to go home, all of which have options here to apply for permission to stay.

The children, all minors – many of whom are believed to have crossed the border illegally and are now in U.S. custody of the Health and Human Services Department – have expressed concern and do not want to return, their attorneys said in court filings reviewed by NBC 5 Investigates.

The ongoing legal fight began right here in Chicago over Labor Day weekend and has since expanded to a total of three federal lawsuits – all of which seek to stop the Trump administration from deporting children whose attorneys say don’t want to be returned to their native countries and – in some cases - fear harm if they are.

So far, federal judges – include those in D.C. and Chicago – have filed temporary restraining orders and injunctions that temporarily bar the Trump administration from deporting the children while the lawsuits play out in court.

A status hearing in the Chicago case is set for Oct. 7.

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Northern District of Illinois did not respond to a request for comment Friday afternoon.

Laura Smith, an immigration attorney with the Children’s Legal Center here in Chicago, represents four Guatemalan teens who are in the custody of the federal government’s Office of Refugee Resettlement – the federal agency tasked with providing care and custody of unaccompanied minors who encountered immigration.

“They're four Guatemalan teenagers, none of which want to go home, all of which have options here to apply for permission to stay. And so we filed the litigation to allow them to stay and pursue that, pursue that relief,” Smith said.

Just four weeks ago – Smith described to NBC 5 Investigates the last-minute legal filings aimed at stopping their deportations and the conversations she had with some of the teens when news broke that they might be returned to their native countries.

Asked to characterize their responses, she said: “Terror, absolutely. Terror not fully understanding why me, why in the middle of the night… just terror.”

Television news footage from south Texas showed the unaccompanied children who entered the U.S. illegally getting off the aircraft in Texas that the Trump administration said it was planning to use to deport them back to Guatemala.

Angie Salazar, the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, said in a D.C. court filing that the request to have the children returned came from the Guatemalan government and that it was “Our understanding based on that meeting is that Guatemalan officials believed their citizen nationals should be placed with their families rather than in prolonged U.S. government custody.”

In issuing his ruling, a federal judge in D.C. wrote that the government’s explanation “crumbled like a house of cards,” adding that there was “no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.”

With the injunctions in place – it essentially acts as pause button on deportations while the cases play out in court.

In a letter sent last week to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee, attorneys representing whistleblowers within the Office of Refugee Resettlement challenged the acting director’s statements “that 327 children identified for return to Guatemala had been screened” and “would not be subject to child abuse and neglect, including human trafficking, torture and other forms of violence, upon return to Guatemala.”

The whistleblowers believe “at least 30 and possibly more children… have indicators of being a victim of child abuse, including death threats, gang violence, human trafficking and/or have expressed fear of return,” the letter states.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/09/investigatse.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-09-26 22:57:05.054522

ICE detention in sensitive locations

Current status: ICE agents can now conduct enforcement operations in churches, schools, and hospitals. In response, California passed a package of new “sanctuary laws” on Sept. 20 aimed at limiting the crackdown in places that were previously considered off-limits. How effective these laws will be at deterring federal operations remains uncertain. | Latest update: Sept. 23, 2025

More information

California law forbids ICE from making civil arrests inside courthouses, but agents have continued to bypass the statute. Civil Code § 43.54, intended to protect immigrants from harassment or apprehension while seeking justice, does not bind federal officers. In San Francisco and across the state, courthouse arrests have increased, along with raids in car washes, hospitals, schools, and churches.

In response, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a package of “sanctuary laws” on Sept. 20 aimed at limiting Trump’s immigration crackdown in sensitive locations:

Senate Bill 98: Requires immigration enforcement officers to present a judicial warrant or court order to enter a school facility; schools must notify communities of enforcement actions.

Senate Bill 805: Requires law enforcement officials to identify themselves and maintain visible identification.

Assembly Bill 49: Bars school facilities from allowing immigration enforcement officers on campus without a warrant.

Senate Bill 627: Prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings while on duty.

Senate Bill 81: Prohibits immigration enforcement officials from entering restricted areas of healthcare facilities without a warrant or court order.

The laws are a direct response to Trump administration policy changes. On Jan. 21, Trump rescinded guidelines that discouraged enforcement in sensitive locations, giving ICE broad discretion to operate in and around schools, churches, and hospitals.Lawsuits have followed. On Feb. 24, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction blocking ICE from entering places of worship or targeting immigrants nearby without a warrant. But on April 11, another judge ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing ICE to resume enforcement operations in houses of worship — a major blow to religious groups seeking to protect immigrant congregants.

Bond hearings revoked for some undocumented immigrants

Current status: Civil rights organizations and immigration law firms have filed a class-action lawsuit challenging the widespread denial of bond hearings to undocumented immigrants detained by federal authorities. Under a policy issued in July, immigrants who entered the U.S. without authorization are no longer eligible to request release on bond from an immigration judge while fighting deportation. | Latest update: Sept. 23, 2025

More information

On Sept. 22, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, along with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, and the law firms Foley Hoag and Araujo & Fisher, filed a federal court complaint challenging the policy.

Under the new rules, immigrants must remain detained for the duration of their removal proceedings — a process that can take months or even years. Immigration judges no longer have the discretion to grant release; only ICE officers may authorize parole in limited cases.

Advocates say the policy will impact millions of immigrants, including longtime residents with no criminal history. They argue it violates due process and makes it harder for people to access legal representation or remain connected with family.

The policy marks a major departure from previous Justice Department rules, which allowed detained immigrants to seek bond if they could prove at least two years of U.S. residence.

The change comes alongside a new $45 billion funding law that doubles ICE’s detention capacity to 100,000 people per day. Since then, immigrants in at least a dozen states have reportedly been denied bond hearings.

According to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University, 58,766 people were held in ICE detention as of Sept. 7, 2025 — down from 61,226 on Aug. 24, though still among the highest levels in recent years.

Limits to ICE operations in California: Face coverings, roving patrols

Current status: California has banned federal agents, including ICE officers, from using masks during enforcement actions, in what Gov. Gavin Newsom called an effort to curb federal overreach. The Department of Homeland Security already said it will not comply, as did ICE. Meanwhile, ICE agents in Los Angeles can resume indiscriminate stops based on race, language, employment, or location, following a Supreme Court decision. | Latest update: Sept. 22, 2025

More information

After a wave of immigration raids across Los Angeles this June — which sparked protests, fear in immigrant neighborhoods and a federal lawsuit — a federal judge blocked indiscriminate arrests in parts of Southern California on July 11. The decision, however, was bypassed by a Supreme Court ruling on Sept. 8, allowing agents to indiscriminately target people in Los Angeles based on race, language, employment, or location. The decision allows agents to resume immigration arrests and raids in the region.

The case stemmed from a lawsuit filed by three immigrants arrested at a Pasadena bus stop and two U.S. citizens detained alongside them — one of whom reportedly showed agents valid identification but was still held.

Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a similar suit after the Border Patrol ran a three-day sweep in Kern County in mid-January, arresting 78 people. Officials claimed they were targeting individuals with criminal or immigration violations, but a CalMatters investigation found only one of those detained had a criminal record. A federal court later issued an injunction on April 29 banning warrantless stops in California’s Eastern District, which spans from Redding to Bakersfield.

In response to these raids and what he called federal overreach, Gov. Newsom signed a bill on Sept. 20 banning local and federal officials from wearing non-medical masks during operations unless they are undercover. How the state will enforce the law remains unclear. Over the past year, federal officials have defended the practice, saying ICE agents hide their identities to protect themselves from harassment.

Nonimmigrant work visas: H1-Bs, TN

Current status: Trump has added a $100,000 annual fee to the H1-B visa application process for new applicants who have not yet filed petitions. Since July, eligibility for TN visas has also been narrowed. | Latest update: Sept. 19, 2025

More information

The H1-B visa is widely used by high-skilled foreign workers, especially those in the tech industry. Federal officials say the new fee will reduce the number of H1-B applicants and push companies to only hire the “best of the best.” However, Trump’s proclamation, which sidestepped Congress, is expected to face legal challenges.

This isn’t the first time that the Trump Administration has implemented policies to limit the number of professionals who can legally live and work in the United States, citing concerns of fraud and over workplaces issuing work visas in a way that doesn’t “put American workers first.”

On July 5, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) also narrowed down the eligibility criteria for the TN-Visa, available to Mexicans and Canadians with certain bachelor’s degrees. The visa allows many Mexicans to legally work in the U.S. for three years with unlimited renewals in specific fields.

Under the new guidelines, healthcare workers who interact with patients, mechanics, software engineers or electricians no longer qualify. USCIS also hardened its eligibility criteria, not allowing TN visa holders to work for non-U.S. companies or as independent contractors. Their degree must also now directly match their current profession.

Sharing government-collected data with immigration officials

Current status: On Sept. 19, a district judge barred the federal government from collecting personal data from people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in several states, including California. In August, a similar order prevented the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from sharing Medicaid data with immigration officials. Other federal agencies, however — including the IRS and HUD — have continued sharing information. | Latest update: Sept. 19, 2025

More information

The data-sharing stems from one of Trump’s executive orders directing federal agencies to cooperate with immigration authorities. Among them was HHS, which complied by giving the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data on millions of Medicaid enrollees, despite objections from Medicaid officials who warned it could violate patient privacy. The dataset included information from Medi-Cal beneficiaries in California, where state funds cover immigrants’ full-scope coverage.

In response, 20 states filed a lawsuit that led to the injunction. California separately sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture to stop it from sharing data of people who receive SNAP benefits.

Meanwhile, the IRS started sharing taxpayer information with immigration authorities in mid-August, following an April 8 agreement with the Trump Administration. The move broke with decades of IRS policy prioritizing taxpayer confidentiality, including for undocumented filers. The decision sparked high-profile resignations, including acting IRS Service Commissioner Melanie Krause.

Immigrant rights groups and tax experts warn the deal could deter millions of undocumented workers from filing taxes, risking their income, tax refunds and legal safety. In 2023 alone, undocumented immigrants paid $66 billion in federal taxes, according to Yale Budget Lab.

Similarly, in late March, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) started sharing data with DHS on undocumented immigrants who receive housing assistance through family members with legal status.

In parts of California, some law enforcement agencies have also illegally shared license plate data with immigration authorities, including Oakland and San Francisco.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans, Haitians, Hondurans and Nicaraguans

Current status: On Sept. 8, TPS protections for Hondurans and Nicaraguans expired. By contrast, days earlier, San Francisco’s U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to revoke TPS protections for Venezuelan and Haitian immigrants. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene. | Latest update: Sept. 19, 2025

More information

Chen’s ruling allows more than 600,000 Venezuelans — whose temporary protections expired earlier this year or were set to expire Sept. 10 — to continue living and working in the U.S. It also preserves protections for approximately 500,000 Haitians. In August, a U.S. District Court judge in New York had also previously delayed the decision for Haitian TPS holders until February 2026.

Some nationalities, however, have lost designations following unsuccessful legal battles. After weeks of legal back-and-forth, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a California judge’s ruling that had postponed the end of TPS for Hondurans and Nicaraguans until November, allowing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate protections in early September.

TPS provides deportation relief and work permits to immigrants from 17 countries facing armed conflict, natural disasters or other emergencies. Designations last 18 months and can be extended by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Earlier this year, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem reversed Biden-era actions and ended existing protections for Venezuelans, putting more than one million TPS holders at risk, including 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections were due to expire in April.

After a federal judge in San Francisco paused the termination while a lawsuit challenging the order was pending, the Trump administration argued before the Supreme Court that the ruling interfered with executive authority over immigration. Officials also claimed that ending TPS would not lead to immediate deportation, and that affected individuals could pursue other legal options to stay in the U.S.

On May 19, the Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration, allowing it to end deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans. Justices said individual immigrants can still appeal if the government tries to cancel their work permits or deport them. The case continued to be litigated.

The Trump Administration previously failed to end TPS for Sudan, Nicaragua, Haiti, El Salvador, Nepal and Honduras in 2017 and 2018.

Mass deportations in San Francisco and beyond

Current status: So far, no mass raids have been reported in San Francisco. Most local enforcement has targeted specific individuals, according to Mission Action, a nonprofit that coordinates the city’s Rapid Response Network. Federal officials, however, have threatened sending increased enforcement to a number of cities, including S.F. | Latest update: Sept. 17, 2025

More information

Oakland’s local rapid response hotline reported that on Sept. 17, ICE agents in unmarked vehicles stopped two immigrants at a red light, asked about their immigration status and then detained them after identifying themselves as ICE.

Earlier in the month, the Trump administration launched a major immigration enforcement operation in Chicago after weeks of threats to send federal agents to the city. In August, Trump threatened to deploy the National Guard to Chicago and other Democratic-led cities, including San Francisco, and promised to increase immigration enforcement in sanctuary cities.

Trump previously sent the National Guard to Los Angeles in June and still has active troops in Washington D.C., citing concerns of lawless behavior. In both cities, the deployments coincided with heightened immigration enforcement.

On Sept. 2, however, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to California, ruling that the president’s June order sending troops to Los Angeles was illegal.

Meanwhile, a July spending bill authorizing nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement is expected to accelerate deportations. The expanded budget funds 20,000 additional officers and doubles detention capacity.

ICE operations in San Francisco immigration court

Current status: A coalition of immigrant rights organizations has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging courthouse arrests of asylum seekers and detention conditions at ICE’s San Francisco Field Office. Two weeks earlier, the administration fired another one of SF’s immigration judges – the seventh to be removed since January– in what attorneys say is an effort to target judges with high asylum grant rates. | Latest update: Sept. 18, 2025

More information

Since May, immigration agencies have increased pressure on asylum seekers by attempting to dismiss their cases, arresting them outside their court appointments and detaining them at ICE check-ins. In San Francisco, most of the uptick in enforcement has taken place at immigration courthouses.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has increasingly petitioned judges to dismiss asylum cases in immigration court. Even when judges refuse, enforcement agents have arrested asylum seekers outside appointments and sent them to detention centers. Some have also been detained during check-ins.

Increasingly in San Francisco, asylum seekers without active deportation orders have won release after lawyers filed habeas corpus petitions, arguing these arrests violate due process. If successful, the newly filed class-action lawsuit could affect all immigrants under ICE’s San Francisco jurisdiction, including those currently detained or at risk of being held at 630 Sansome.

The arrests are not the only way the Trump administration is targeting asylum seekers. According to NPR, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has begun dismissing the cases of some asylum seekers who never received a credible-fear interview at the border. Those affected must restart the process, which attorneys warn could land them in detention.

Meanwhile, attorneys and former staff say the administration appears to be targeting judges more likely to grant asylum or with backgrounds in immigrant rights advocacy. On Sept. 9, the Trump administration dismissed San Francisco’s top immigration judge, Loi McCleskey. The week before, Judge Shira Levine — who had one of the highest asylum-granting rates in San Francisco — was also dismissed, along with two other judges. In total, Trump has removed about one-third of San Francisco’s 21 immigration judges.

Judge Chloe Dillion, who was fired after nearly 25 years of federal service, said she was “shell-shocked” by the wave of firings.

Immigrant advocates and attorneys say the firings are part of a broader Trump administration strategy to sow fear and destabilize immigration courts. Nationwide, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Changes to the naturalization process

Current status: The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced it will implement a revised version of the naturalization civics test as part of broader reforms tightening requirements for the naturalization process. | Latest update: Sept. 17, 2025

Already implemented reforms include increased vetting, stricter reviews of disability, prioritizing examples of “good moral character” (as opposed to the absence of bad behavior) and the resumption of neighborhood investigations.

USCIS said other initiatives will be announced in the coming months

A seventh San Francisco courthouse firing since January by Trump

Current status: On Tuesday, Sept. 9, the Trump administration dismissed San Francisco’s top immigration judge, Loi McCleskey, marking the seventh local judge removed since January. Nationwide, more than 100 immigration judges have been fired, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.| Latest update: Sept. 9, 2025

More information

Attorneys and former staff say the administration appears to be targeting judges more likely to grant asylum or with backgrounds in immigrant rights advocacy. Last week, Judge Shira Levine, who had one of the highest asylum-granting rates in San Francisco, was also dismissed, along with two other judges in the city. In total, Trump has removed about one-third of the 21 immigration judges who had been serving in San Francisco.

Some of the ousted judges are speaking out. Judge Chloe Dillion, who was fired after nearly 25 years of federal service, said she was “shell-shocked” by the wave of firings.

As the court’s supervising judge, McCleskey oversaw an office that granted asylum at a higher rate than the national average (50%). Her own approval rate stood at 72%, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Immigrant advocates and attorneys say the firings are part of a broader Trump administration strategy to sow fear and destabilize immigration courts.

ICE granted authority to make indiscriminate stops in L.A.

Current status: On Sept. 8, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 to bypass a federal judge’s restraining order that had barred ICE agents from indiscriminately targeting people in Los Angeles based on race, language, employment, or location. The decision allows agents to resume immigration arrests and raids in the region. | Latest update: Sept. 8, 2025

The conservative majority’s ruling marks a significant victory for the Trump administration, advancing Trump’s promise to carry out the “largest mass deportation” in U.S. history. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor called the decision “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket. We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low-wage job.”

Following the ruling, the administration announced it began conducting immigration arrests in Chicago on Monday morning, heightening fears about the scale of upcoming ICE raids. The Department of Homeland Security has dubbed the operation “Operation Midway Blitz,” targeting immigrant communities across Chicago. Hundreds of DHS officials are reportedly staging operations from a naval base on the city’s outskirts.

Sanctuary cities across the U.S., including San Francisco, are closely monitoring developments in Chicago as they brace for sweeping ICE activity in their own regions.

Use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants

Current status: Trump cannot invoke the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to quickly deport Venezuelan immigrants because of alleged gang ties, a federal appeals court has ruled. The decision blocked such deportations in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi and the case now heads to the Supreme Court, which could set a nationwide precedent. | Latest update: Sept. 3, 2025

More information

In one of its most controversial actions to date, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act on March 15 to target individuals allegedly linked to the Tren de Aragua gang, rapidly deporting 238 Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador without due process.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) challenged the order the same day, and a federal judge temporarily blocked further deportations. The pause was upheld by an appeals court on March 28, but on April 7, the Supreme Court overturned it in a 5-4 decision, ruling the lawsuit had been filed in the wrong venue (Washington, D.C., instead of Texas). In a partial win for due process, however, the justices also ruled that detained immigrants must receive timely notice and an opportunity to challenge their deportation through habeas corpus proceedings.

The Supreme Court sent the case back to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals to determine how much time migrants are given to challenge their deportations and whether the act’s use was legal in the first place.

Since then, additional rulings have limited enforcement:

April 18: The Supreme Court ruled 7–2 to block the removal of a group of Venezuelan migrants detained in North Texas. That same day, the Trump administration said it would proceed under other immigration laws to deport them.

April 28: A district court judge ruled Trump’s use of the act “unlawful” and barred deportations of Venezuelans in South Texas under the policy. Judges in other cities, like Los Angeles and El Paso, have also issued similar rulings over the past few weeks.

June 4: Judge James Boasberg ruled that the March deportations of 140 Venezuelan men to El Salvador were illegal. In his ruling, he allowed the deportees to challenge their removal, although he did not directly order the Trump administration to bring them back.

More than a month later, the 252 men sent to El Salvador were released to Venezuela in a prisoner exchange.

The administration took steps to cancel foreign aid and asserted power to withhold billions of domestic spending.

“I would expect this shutdown to look different than any other shutdown,” said Joshua Sewell, Taxpayers for Common Sense director of research and policy. He said he expects that the Trump team’s actions would be guided by what they believe achieves the most for them politically.

Trump could use a shutdown to dismantle government functions, wrote Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit focused on improving the federal government.

If lawmakers can’t reach a deal, Stier wrote, Trump and Vought “will have enormous latitude to determine which services, programs, and employees can be sidelined, decisions that could go far beyond what has occurred during past shutdowns.”

Beyond the Antideficiency Act, which says the government cannot spend money or incur debts without Congress’ authority, the shutdown process has historically been guided by traditions, not laws.

In recent past shutdowns, hundreds of thousands of employees were furloughed, but the shutdowns did not result in mass permanent layoffs or significant reorganizations. Under federal law, federal workers also receive back pay for their time on furlough.

Trump and his congressional allies would be in charge of the government amid a shutdown. What can Trump do on his own?

OMB told agencies to ‘consider’ layoff notices

The Trump administration has already reduced the workforce by about 200,000, a number that could grow to 300,000 by the end of the year, Stier wrote. The administration gutted some agencies and programs including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Voice of America.

OMB provided an email, first published by Politico, that it sent to agency heads that said agencies should consider sending “reduction in force” notices to employees whose programs are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” or lack mandatory funding or another source of funding, such as the tax and spending legislation H.R. 1, which became law in July.

Rachel Greszler, a workforce expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the administration hasn’t mandated layoffs, but directed agencies to “consider” issuing such notices “as a way to let federal employees know which of their jobs could be on the line if Congress reduces their agency’s funding.”

WATCH: White House threatens mass federal firings if Congress fails to avoid a shutdown

This signals to Democrats that health care funding demands could backfire, she said, potentially causing further reductions in the size of the federal government.

Several questions remain, including how many employees could face layoffs and when. The memo says once fiscal year 2026 appropriations are enacted, agencies should revise their plans to reduce staff.

“I believe this memo indicates OMB will pursue a dual path of shutdown-related furloughs and a separate process of mass layoffs,” Sewell said. Whether the layoffs happen before or after funding is restored “is an open question,” Sewell said. “This certainly indicates the administration wants to cut these agencies and programs at any opportunity either now or in the future.”

Experts offered mixed opinions about whether layoffs would hold up in court. Any such process must follow the rules, such as a 60-day written notice.

“A shutdown provides no new legal authority to engage in widespread firings,” said Sam Berger, who works for the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and who worked at OMB during the Biden and Obama administrations.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader from New York, said the memo is an “attempt at intimidation” and predicted such firings would be reversed.

Social Security checks and other mandatory spending will continue

Mandatory spending — ongoing spending that does not require periodic extensions from Congress — generally continues during a shutdown. This means Americans would still receive Social Security checks and be able to use Medicare and Medicaid.

In previous shutdowns, border protection, medical care in hospitals, air traffic control, law enforcement and power grid maintenance were deemed essential and remained active during the shutdown.

Even continued services can be disrupted. During the 2018-19 shutdown, holiday travelers faced delays as many unpaid TSA staff and air traffic controllers didn’t come to work.

Administrations have a lot of leeway to define “essential” workers. During the 2013 shutdown, the Obama administration closed national parks. In 2018, the Trump administration kept many national parks open with limited services using previously paid park entrance fees to cover personnel costs; the Government Accountability Office concluded that this violated federal law.

The second-term Trump administration is expected to continue priorities such as immigration enforcement and might try to focus cuts on areas that have already been slashed.

Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramón de la Fuente urged an end to the criminalization of immigrants and the use of trade war tactics during his address Thursday to the UN General Assembly.

De la Fuente reflected on diplomatic tensions Mexico has faced in the last year under Donald Trump’s presidency, highlighting the aggressive targeting and criminalization of immigrants, as well as repeated threats of tariffs on Mexican exports.

“We particularly reject the criminalization of people who, for whatever reason, have been forced to leave their homes and migrate --whether to seek refuge or to escape conditions of injustice or poverty. For us, migrants are people with rights,” said De la Fuente.

Trump has made anti-immigration policy the hallmark of his presidency, leaving Mexico as a witness to the dehumanizing treatment and arbitrary detention of Mexican nationals living in the US.

“Let there be no doubt: Mexico will not tire in ensuring the protection and support of Mexican nationals living abroad. They deserve all our attention and assistance,” De la Fuente added.

Alongside the US crackdown on irregular immigration, Trump has repeatedly used tariff threats to pressure Mexico, his country’s closest trading partner, to demand compliance with his immigration and security priorities.

While Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has successfully resisted the imposition of US tariffs, the American President has continued to pressure his Mexican counterpart through commercial threats.

“Mexico will always advocate for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and, for that reason, rejects sanctions and trade blockades that only harm the well-being of the people,” said De la Fuente.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/09/26/thumbs_b_c_906d7995ee23cf89254384c44679d6bd.jpg?v=081918,N,,2025-09-26 20:56:24.628271

With the three liberal justices in dissent, the court’s conservative majority granted the Republican administration’s emergency appeal in a case involving billions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.

The Justice Department sought the high court’s intervention after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that Trump’s action was likely illegal and that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.

The federal appeals court in Washington declined to put Ali’s ruling on hold, but Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked it on Sept. 9. The full court indefinitely extended Roberts’ order.

The court has previously cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip legal protections from hundreds of thousands of migrants, fire thousands of federal employees, oust transgender members of the military and remove the heads of independent government agencies.

The legal victories, while not final rulings, all have come through emergency appeals, used sparingly under previous presidencies, to fast-track cases to the Supreme Court, where decisions are often handed down with no explanation.

Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) in a letter Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.

He used what’s known as a pocket rescission. That’s a rarely used maneuver when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. Under federal law, Congress has to approve the rescission within 45 days or the money must be spent. But the budget year will end before the 45-day window closes, and in this situation the White House is asserting that congressional inaction allows it to not spend the money.

The majority wrote in an unsigned order that Trump’s authority over foreign affairs weighed heavily in its decision, while cautioning that it was not making a final ruling in the case.

But that was cold comfort to the dissenters. “The effect is to prevent the funds from reaching their intended recipients — not just now but [because of their impending expiration] for all time,” Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America’s reputation abroad as people lose access to food supplies and development programs.

The high court’s decision “further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order,” said Nick Sansone, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation Group who represented the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition in the case. “It will also have a grave humanitarian impact on vulnerable communities throughout the world.”

Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge last month that another $6.5 billion in aid that had been subject to the freeze would be spent before the end of the fiscal year Tuesday.

The case has been winding its way through the courts for months, and Ali said he understood that his ruling would not be the last word on the matter.

“This case raises questions of immense legal and practical importance, including whether there is any avenue to test the executive branch’s decision not to spend congressionally appropriated funds,” he wrote.

In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit threw out an earlier injunction Ali had issued to require that the money be spent. But the three-judge panel did not shut down the lawsuit.

The Supreme Court implicitly allowed those other types of nationwide blocks to continue.
The administration has long expressed confidence that the high court would approve Trump’s policy.
At issue are two of several lower-court rulings that have held up implementation of Trump’s policy since the high court’s more procedural ruling this summer.
“The district court correctly concluded that the Executive Order’s proposed interpretation, denying citizenship to many persons born in the United States, is unconstitutional.","The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to review the constitutionality of President Donald Trump’s executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, pushing the issue before the justices for the second time this year.

Despite more than a century of understanding that the 14th Amendment confers citizenship on people born in the United States, the Trump administration told the Supreme Court in an appeal that notion was “mistaken” and that the view became “pervasive, with destructive consequences.”

“The lower court’s decisions invalidated a policy of prime importance to the president and his administration in a manner that undermines our border security,” wrote Solicitor General D. John Sauer, the administration’s top appellate attorney. “Those decisions confer, without lawful justification, the privilege of American citizenship on hundreds of thousands of unqualified people.”

CNN reviewed a copy of the appeal, which has not yet been docketed at the high court.

While the Supreme Court handed down an important decision in June that dealt with birthright citizenship, that case was technically focused on a more procedural question of how much power lower courts had to stop a policy implemented by a president. A 6-3 majority of the court essentially limited – but did not completely rule out – the power of courts to block those policies.

That decision sent states and individuals who were challenging Trump’s birthright order scrambling to file new cases to shut down the birthright policy through other means, including class-action lawsuits. The Supreme Court implicitly allowed those other types of nationwide blocks to continue.

A series of new rulings have continued to keep Trump’s policy on hold, and the ad ministration is now asking the justices to take up those cases to settle the issue once and for all.

The administration has long expressed confidence that the high court would approve Trump’s policy. But it’s not entirely clear whether four justices will ultimately vote in favor of hearing the cases, as is required.

At issue are two of several lower-court rulings that have held up implementation of Trump’s policy since the high court’s more procedural ruling this summer. In July, a San Francisco-based federal appeals court upheld a Seattle judge’s ruling that blocked Trump’s policy nationwide in a case brought by a group of Democratic-led states.

A separate decision issued earlier that month by a judge in New Hampshire barred enforcement of Trump’s order against any babies who would be impacted by the policy in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.

The administration filed its appeal in both of those cases on Friday.

“The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that American citizenship – the privilege that allows us to choose our political leaders – is granted only to those who are lawfully entitled to it,” the administration wrote in those appeals.

The administration has in recent weeks appealed the ruling from New Hampshire to a Boston-based federal appeals court, but the intermediate court has not yet had a chance to weigh in on the matter.

“This executive order is illegal, full stop, and no amount of maneuvering from the administration is going to change that,” said Cody Wofsy, an ACLU attorney who argued the New Hampshire case. “We will continue to ensure that no baby’s citizenship is ever stripped away by this cruel and senseless order.”

A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Signed by Trump on January 20, the executive order, titled “PROTECTING THE MEANING AND VALUE OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP,” said that the federal government will not “issue documents recognizing United States citizenship” to any children born on American soil to parents who were in the country unlawfully or were in the states lawfully but temporarily.

Three decades after the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, the Supreme Court ruled in US v. Wong Kim Ark that people born in the United States – in that case, the son of Chinese immigrants – are entitled to US citizenship, with a few narrow exceptions. But the administration argued in its appeal that the precedent has long been misunderstood.

The Wong Kim Ark decision recognized citizenship for people born in the United States who enjoyed “permanent domicil and residence” in the country, US Solicitor General Sauer argued.

“That limit,” Sauer wrote, “was central to the analysis.”

But those arguments have had no purchase in lower courts thus far.

The 9th Circuit said in a 2-1 ruling in July that Trump’s order contradicts the citizenship clause of the Constitution, Wong Kim Ark and decades of executive branch practice.

“The district court correctly concluded that the Executive Order’s proposed interpretation, denying citizenship to many persons born in the United States, is unconstitutional. We fully agree,” appeals court Judge Ronald Gould wrote for the majority.

A Portland mother detained with her family after visiting the U.S.–Canada border.","PORTLAND, Ore. — U.S. Rep. Maxine Dexter of Oregon’s 3rd District said the recent detention of a Portland mother and her four U.S.-born children illustrates the “cruelty” of the Trump administration's immigration system.

Speaking on KGW’s “Straight Talk,” Dexter recounted driving to Ferndale, Washington, to locate the family after they were held for 12 days in a Customs and Border Protection facility. She said the woman, a longtime resident and business owner, has had multiple release requests denied, leaving her children traumatized as they start a new school year apart from their parents.

Dexter said her office is also aiding another Portland-area man who was allegedly injured during a violent immigration arrest and faces deportation. She criticized the Trump administration’s approach, saying promised crackdowns on criminals have instead resulted in “family separation” and violations of constitutional due process. The congresswoman urged bipartisan immigration reform to create clearer legal pathways and fair enforcement.

The Democrat also addressed the looming federal government shutdown, blaming Republican leaders for failing to negotiate a bipartisan funding plan. She warned that GOP proposals would strip health insurance from up to 20 million Americans by cutting Affordable Care Act subsidies and Medicaid funding, a move she vowed to oppose.

A former critical care doctor, Dexter further condemned what she called reckless political rhetoric around vaccines and pregnancy-related medications, pointing to research that shows no link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. She joined other members of the Democratic Doctors Caucus in calling for the removal of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom she described as unfit for office.

In the following excerpt, KGW's Stephanie Domurat dives into the Trump administrations immigration policy with Rep. Maxine Dexter as she talks through immigration arrests impacting Oregon communities.

Stephanie Domurat: Before we get started, a quick note to viewers: We’re taping this interview on Thursday, September 25, so things could change by the time you see it. I want to start first with immigration. Recently, you highlighted the case of Jackie Merlos — we've done some reporting on this. A Portland mother detained with her family after visiting the U.S.–Canada border. You visited the Northwest ICE (Immigration Customs Enforcement) Processing Center and later spoke very emotionally about the case on Capitol Hill. Why did you step in, and what’s the latest you can share?

Rep. Maxine Dexter: Jackie and her kids, along with her mother, went to the Canadian border to visit her sister, something they’d done before. They were hugging and then they were detained and disappeared. We didn’t know where they were. Her community was looking for them for over 12 days before we were alerted. So, we didn't know where she was; my chief and I just got in the car, and we drove north and found them Ferndale, Washington in a CBP (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) facility.

Domurat: Why did you feel compelled to get so involved, and why was it so emotional for you?

Dexter: I think that it's the reality and cruelty and lack of consistency with what Americans were told about immigration practices and reform that Donald Trump was trying to bring to us. They are not the worst of the worst. These were not criminals. This is a mother and her four U.S.-citizen children. She’s lived here more than 20 years, runs a business, employs community members, pays taxes, and has never broken the laws and goes to church. Yet she was detained and kept in a windowless cell with her four citizen-children for 12 days, disappeared. Nobody knew where she was, and she had no idea if her family was looking for her. The egregiousness of it, the cruelty of it, and she's one of my constituents. I'd be what I hope someone would do for me, for you or others if something so egregious was done against us.

The reality is this is still an ongoing issue. We just found out this [Friday] morning that her release request has still been denied. Her children are starting a new year of school in another person's house that they knew but certainly are not their parents. They are feeling guilty and traumatized about the separation that they are undergoing; they feel accountable for their father being detained also. The trauma on this family is emblematic of trauma happening across our country. As a representative of Congress, it's against our Constitution, and it's against our American values.

Domurat: Have you heard from other families in your district experiencing similar situations?

Dexter: Yes. We have another family that we are working with that we were just alerted to last night [Thursday]. Rafael was taken, reportedly, violently — (leaving behind a) broken glass window — pulled out of his car on his way to work. He'd just had elbow surgery, and he's very concerned that his elbow has been injured. Now, we’re told he’s being deported to Mexico, rather than having the injury our agents, exacerbated, if not caused, being addressed. We were just at the Portland ICE facility this (Friday) morning asking questions with the senators, and Congresswoman Bonamici just asking questions about practices and the fear and intimidation that our community is feeling is very real and trying to understand how our local agents are planning on address our concerns.

Domurat: For people who support tougher immigration enforcement, what policy path do you see to balance due process with enforcement?

Dexter: There is no question that we need immigration reform in this country. We need people who are legally in this country and able to work and following our laws, without question. Donald Trump's promise to be getting rid of criminals and drug trafficking that is not these families that we are tearing apart. I absolutely believe that a balanced, bipartisan immigration reform policy needs to be passed. In fact, there was one about to be passed, and Donald Trump and Republican Party decided not to move that forward before the election. We have made choices that have landed us in this position now, where cruelty and family separation are the norm rather than actually limiting people's ability to commit crimes and be in this country illegally. We need easy pathways for people to get in here legitimately and also we need to enforce our laws — and these are not laws being enforced. We are breaking the constitutional guarantees of due process.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/ef6bb31b-88a5-4ab0-9f5c-d2ec988e09b1/20250926T215626/ef6bb31b-88a5-4ab0-9f5c-d2ec988e09b1_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 19:56:49.961103

Roberts worked as superintendent in Iowa despite not having legal status and despite having a “final order of removal and no work authorization,” the ICE news release said.

Ian Andre Roberts, a Guyana national and superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, was arrested in an operation on Friday, ICE announced in a news release.

Roberts has helmed the district since July 2023, according to its website. It described him as a ""career educator"" with over two decades of experience as a teacher, school administrator and executive leader. He also previously served as superintendent in two different districts in Pennsylvania and Missouri.

Roberts worked as superintendent in Iowa despite not having legal status and despite having a “final order of removal and no work authorization,” the ICE news release said.

He had entered the U.S. in 1999 on a student visa, and was given a final order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, ICE said.

Roberts had existing weapon possession charges from Feb. 5, 2020, according to the release.

Agents approached Roberts on Friday in his vehicle after he identified himself, but he drove off, ICE said. The vehicle was later found near a wooded area, and Iowa State Patrol then assisted in the search for him Friday morning, and he was ultimately taken into custody, the release said.

The Iowa Department of Public Safety said it assisted ICE finding a person, identified as Roberts, who fled from a traffic stop.

At the time of his arrest he was found in possession of a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash and a fixed blade hunting knife, ICE said.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will handle the investigation into how Roberts acquired a handgun, ICE said, noting it’s against federal law for people in the United States without legal status to possess a firearm and ammunition.

“This suspect was arrested in possession of a loaded weapon in a vehicle provided by Des Moines Public Schools after fleeing federal law enforcement,” Sam Olson, director of the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations St. Paul Field Office, said in a statement. “How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal, and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district.”

It’s not immediately clear whether Roberts has retained an attorney.

Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris confirmed that Roberts was detained by ICE agents Friday morning. At a news conference, she asked for the community to practice “radical empathy.”

The Iowa Board of Educational Examiners issued Roberts a license to serve as superintendent in the state in July 2023, Norris said.

She said that while the district does not have all the facts, she affirmed Roberts has been “an integral part of our school community” since he joined. She also noted that he's held educational leadership positions in districts across the country for 20 years.

""We stand firm with our community, many of whom are feeling sad, outraged and helpless. We understand as we too are devastated by the news of his detainment,"" interim Superintendent Matt Smith said at the news conference.

Roberts' biography on the district's website stated that he was chosen as superintendent following ""an extensive nationwide search based on a leadership profile developed with input from the school board, teachers, families and others in the school community.""

It said he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and spent most of his ""formative years"" in Brooklyn, New York.

""Dr. Roberts is married, and enjoys hunting, reading, and spending time with family and friends,"" the biography said.

He got his bachelor's from Coppin State University, master's degrees from St. John’s University and Georgetown University, and received his doctorate in urban educational leadership from Trident University. He also has several education certificates, including one from Harvard University, the biography said.

Separately, he was also an Olympian, competing in track and field at the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia, and in the World Championships in Maebashi, Japan and Seville, Spain, according to the website.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250926-Ian-Andre-Roberts-Des-Moines-Public-Schools-Superintendent-se-541p-7369ee.jpg",N,,2025-09-26 19:57:09.228143

“The officer’s conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE. Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Hill.

Video shared on social media showed the confrontation at an immigration courthouse in Manhattan on Thursday, with a woman directly addressing an ICE officer after a man was separated and hauled away by masked officers. The woman and a girl can be seen clinging to the man before he was detained by federal officer.

Afterward, the woman confronted the ICE officer, telling him in Spanish, “You guys don’t care about anything.”

“Adios, adios,” the officer says in response as the woman appeared to put a hand on his chest.

The ICE officer is then seen shoving the woman, pushing her down a hallway and onto the ground. The officer then stands up and tells the woman to leave as the girl is crying. Others proceeded to ask officers to remove the woman from the building.

It is not clear from the video if there was other physical contact between the officer and the woman prior to her being shoved.

The altercation has sparked outcry from New York City officials and some congressional Democrats.

Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller who himself was detained by ICE agents earlier this year, said he was at 26 Federal Plaza when the incident took place. He said the ICE officer “violently threw this bereft woman to the ground in front of her kids.”

“She had not touched him. She did not pose any threat,” wrote Lander, a vocal critic of ICE. “She had to be taken to the hospital.”

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), whose district includes the courthouse, identified the woman as Monica. He said she “fled” to his office with her two children for “safety after she was assaulted by this @ICEgov agent in an egregious act of excessive force.”

“This is unacceptable conduct from this ICE agent. @Sec_Noem must take appropriate disciplinary action and implement measures to prevent this from happening again,” Goldman said in a Thursday post on social platform X, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Goldman on Friday welcomed news of the officer being put on leave.

“The Secretary must take action to prevent something like this from happening again by DHS, here in NYC or anywhere in America,” he wrote.

The woman said she and her family came to the U.S. from Ecuador in 2024.

“Over [in Ecuador], they beat us there too. I didn’t think I’d come here to the United States and the same thing would happen to me,” she told reporters after the incident, ProPublica reported.

He added that he doesn’t know the circumstances of his brother’s detention by ICE, but said he was there to be deported.

Garcia-Hernandez is on life support after he was shot three to four times – including in the neck – his brother, Fernando Gutiérrez, said in an interview with KUVN. Garcia-Hernandez was in the US illegally and previously convicted for “giving fictitious information, evading arrest, driving while intoxicated, and fleeing police,” the source said.

Doctors are not giving the family hope of recovery, according to his brother. Garcia-Hernandez, who is originally from San Luis Potosi, Mexico, has lived in the United States for two decades, where he worked as a painter, Gutiérrez said. He added that he doesn’t know the circumstances of his brother’s detention by ICE, but said he was there to be deported.

The source also said Bordones-Molina was in the US illegally and had a criminal history that includes a traffic offense and property theft.

The third shooting victim, Guzman-Fuentes, was previously arrested “for battery, improper exhibit of a firearm or dangerous weapon, criminal mischief, driving while intoxicated, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,” the source told CNN.

Authorities have said one detainee was killed and two were injured during Wednesday’s attack, in which a gunman fired at the ICE facility from a nearby roof. The source did not identify the deceased victim.

The victims were shot while they were in a van at the facility’s fortified sally port, a controlled entry point commonly found in prisons and on military bases, the Department of Homeland Security said.

ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan told Fox News the three victims were awaiting transfer to a longer-term facility, she said.

The shooter has been identified by investigators as Joshua Jahn, 29.

Investigators believe the gunman – who died from a self-inflicted gunshot at the scene – harbored “hatred for the federal government” and intended to target ICE personnel and property – even though all three victims were detainees , officials said.

“The tragic irony for his evil plot here is that it was a detainee who was killed and two other detainees that were injured,” Nancy Larson, acting US attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said at a news conference on Thursday.

The other detainees who witnessed the shooting were unharmed and will continue immigration proceedings, officials said on Thursday.

Garcia-Hernandez’s mother was deported two months ago and is asking to be able to return to the US to see her son, Gutiérrez said.

Garcia-Hernandez is married with children – including one on the way – and “is the sole provider for his family,” according to a verified GoFundMe campaign.

Without making an individualized determination as to whether he posed a flight risk, federal officers ""pulled N.S.
""They're not even doing the bare minimum as far as asking individual questions about a person's immigration status,"" CASA Legal Director Ama Frimpong, told The Washington Post.","In August, President Donald Trump instituted a federal takeover of the D.C. police department after declaring a ""crime emergency"" in the city. Thousands of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard members were deployed, resulting in a surge of not only criminal arrests but also civil immigration arrests. Over 40 percent of the arrests made during Trump's 30-day federal takeover of D.C. were immigration related, according to the Associated Press. Now, a lawsuit is challenging these arrests, saying that many of them violated federal law.

The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by four plaintiffs and CASA, a national immigration rights organization, alleges that federal immigration officers did not follow proper procedures when making arrests during Trump's D.C. crackdown. Although immigration agents are allowed to make an immigration arrest without a warrant, the officer must have ""reason to believe"" that the individual is in the U.S. in violation of any immigration law or regulation and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. This ""reason to believe"" standard is considered equivalent to probable cause in immigration cases.

Four of the five named plaintiffs in the case were arrested without a warrant, detained, and ultimately released on immigration charges during Trump's federal takeover. In each instance, federal officers failed to either inquire about the plaintiff's legal status or assess whether they were a flight risk, or both, before making an arrest.

One plaintiff, Jose Escobar Molina, was approached and immediately handcuffed by plainclothed unidentified federal agents outside of his apartment building on the morning of August 21, despite having a valid Temporary Protected Status for El Salvador since 2001 and living in D.C. for 25 years. The officers did not have a warrant and never asked for Escobar Molina's name, identification, immigration status, or about his ties to the community—ties that are often used to assess whether someone is a flight risk.

According to the lawsuit, when he told the officers that he had legal immigration status, they replied, ""No you don't. You are illegal."" After being put into a vehicle, he pressed the issue again and told the officers he had ""papers."" To which the driver responded by yelling, ""Shut up, bitch! You're illegal.""

After spending the night in immigration detention, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervisor realized that Escobar Molina did, in fact, have legal status, and he was finally released.

Another plaintiff, named only as ""N.S."" in the suit, spent nearly four weeks in immigration detention before being released, despite having a pending asylum application after fleeing Venezuela. Federal agents arrested N.S. in a Home Depot parking lot without asking any questions about where he lived, for how long, or anything else about his ties to the community. Without making an individualized determination as to whether he posed a flight risk, federal officers ""pulled N.S. out of the driver's seat, threw him against the car, handcuffed him, and provided him a clear bag in which to place his belongings, before placing him in the back of a van,"" according to the complaint.

Both men, along with the other plaintiffs arrested without a warrant, now live in fear of being arrested and detained again as immigration arrests continue in the nation's capital.

In a post on X, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserted that the lawsuit's allegations are ""disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE,"" and defended DHS law enforcement's use of ""reasonable suspicion"" to make arrests, rather than conducting ""indiscriminate stops.""

But the issue at the heart of the complaint is not whether the officers had the ""reasonable suspicion"" to make the stops—stops that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote could be made by considering factors like race, ethnicity, and speaking Spanish—but whether officers had probable cause to make the warrantless arrests that followed.

Kate Klonick and Alan Rozenshtein analyzed the TikTok divestiture deal’s compliance with the TikTok ban.

Wittes unpacked President Trump’s rush to push out and replace acting U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert with a more compliant judge following Siebert’s determination that no charges were warranted against Comey. Wittes identified a looming statute-of-limitations expiration on possible charges as a likely reason for the urgency and commented on the president’s habit of proclaiming his political enemies’ guilt on social media.

Wittes and Anna Bower analyzed paths forward for Lindsey Halligan, the former White House aide who replaced Erik Siebert as AUSA for the Eastern District of Virginia this week. Wittes and Bower explore the viability of different cases she could pursue against Comey and James, the fast-ticking clock that accompanies certain charges, and the backwardness of pursuing a case this way at all.

Stevie Glaberson argued that the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) fast-growing DNA collection program—which does not consistently require agents to get a warrant or file charges—violates the Fourth Amendment. Glaberson further held that asking for consent during DNA collections is insufficient to make the program constitutional, because the coercive power of DHS over detainees renders free consent impossible.

Illinois’ Democratic members of Congress had asked for a meeting with ICE Chicago Field Office Director Russell Hott. They were seeking to learn more about ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s immigration enforcement operations known as Operation Midway Blitz in the Chicago area.

The congressional delegation first asked ICE for an oversight visit to the agency’s Broadview facility that houses many people detained in the Chicago area. ICE declined that request, according to a statement from the delegation, but instead agreed to hold a separate meeting with the members of Congress on Friday.

Friday’s meeting was rescheduled to an unspecified day in October, the delegation said.

An ICE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE has previously denied Illinois’ members of Congress access to the Broadview facility. ICE established a new policy requiring members of Congress to provide seven days’ notice before visiting a facility after some members unsuccessfully tried to visit the facility in June.

Violet skirmishes once again broke out between protesters and Homeland Security agents at the Broadview facility in Chicago’s near west suburbs Friday. Agents shot pepper balls and tear gas at protesters, including many who tried to block DHS vehicles from entering or exiting the facility.

Earlier this month, federal agents briefly detained two U.S. citizens during a raid of an Elgin home while another agent shot and killed a man in Franklin Park. Body camera footage released this week cast doubt on DHS’ narrative about the shooting.

Mounting questions

State leaders say they still have many unanswered questions about the boarded-up Broadview facility.

“Oversight of this facility is desperately needed as legal service providers and our constituents have raised concerns about the poor conditions at Broadview,” the delegation said in a statement. “These reports allege unsanitary bathroom facilities; spreading illness; continued overcrowding; detainees sleeping on the floor or in chairs; a lack of access to food, water or hygiene products; restricted communications to family members and attorneys; and an inability to access medication.”

With Friday’s meeting canceled, the delegation sent a letter to Hott, the field office director, with a list of questions about ICE’s Chicago-area operations. They’d sent a similar one to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday. Friday’s letter also included several questions about the Broadview facility, including how detainees get medical services and access attorneys.

The letter also seeks answers about where else ICE is detaining people arrested in the Chicago area. The delegation wrote constituents have reported people being detained in Lombard, hotels near O’Hare and prisons in Indiana.

Gov. JB Pritzker released his own questions through the media for a second straight week, seeking broad information about DHS’ plans for Operation Midway Blitz.

“Illinois taxpayers deserve to know why the federal government is spending their hard-earned money to promulgate a state-sponsored fear campaign against our people instead of supporting public safety efforts,” Pritzker said in a statement.

Several elected officials are demanding a criminal investigation and say it is not enough that the officer was fired, they say his actions in that video may well be criminal.

The violent confrontation happened in the hallway of 26 Federal Plaza where some politicians argue ICE has inhumanely detained thousands of immigrant New Yorkers in deplorable conditions.

In the video, federal agents are first seen struggling to arrest an Ecuadoran man as his traumatized family pleads for them to stop. Once the man is in custody, and dragged away, his wife confronts one of the officers who grabs her and shoves her into a wall.

On Friday afternoon, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani condemned the agent's actions.

""After taunting her with the response of 'adios, adios,' suddenly that agent threw her to the ground,"" Mamdani said. ""The kids began to cry, traumatized by the sight of their mother being assaulted in a government building. And when she was released, she said, 'In Ecuador, they beat us there too. I didn't think I'd come here to the United States and the same thing would happen to me.'""

Homeland Security officials called the agent's actions ""unacceptable"" and said he has been ""relieved of current duties"" as the case is investigated.

Brooklyn Congressman Dan Goldman says that's not good enough.

""This conduct is unacceptable and we need to make a deterrent effect by seriously investigating it for criminal wrongdoing,"" Goldman said.

Mayor Eric Adams met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday and then released a statement through his deputy press secretary.

""Like so many, we have seen the upsetting images,"" she said, ""and we are pleased to hear this incident is being investigated. Our entire city is less safe when immigrants are afraid to use basic services and attend court hearings.""

The incident has become a flashpoint in the race for City Hall.

Andrew Cuomo's campaign released a statement saying, ""Unlike Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo has not just forcefully condemned the misuse of ICE for years, but took action, signing the executive orders restricting New York's cooperation with them on non criminal matters, successfully guarded NY's drivers license database from them and has continuously called out their abuses on the campaign trail. But if fraudster Mamdani is in a talkative mood, he should answer direct questions about his campaign promise to decriminalize prostitution, his refusal to apologize for calling the NYPD racist as promised and his vow to 'seize the means of production,' i.e. abolishing private property.""

Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa told reporters that otherwise law-abiding migrants should not be deported.

The facility, located in the small Chicago suburb of Broadview, faces allegations of inhumane practices and operating as a de facto detention center.

Roughly 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, and the demonstration remained peaceful until about 7:30 a.m. local time, when agents attempted to drive down a road that was blocked by the group, according to NewsNation’s local affiliate WGN-TV.

Agents responded by firing pepper balls, prompting many protesters to retreat. No injuries have been reported. Additional pepper balls were fired at demonstrators gathering at another entrance, the same location where several protesters had gathered earlier this week.

The confrontation appeared to end when agents retreated behind a gate, though protesters remained outside chanting, some in face masks, in what appeared to be a continued standoff.

Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Border Patrol’s commander-at-large and former El Centro Sector chief, is on the frontline of agents protecting the facility. He is in charge of more than 200 federal immigration officers whom the Trump administration has tasked with making Chicago safer.

‘There’s no accountability’: Protester

Protesters have repeatedly clashed with authorities at the center during the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement in Illinois, which has led to the arrests of more than 400 people since its early September inception.

Demonstrators told NewsNation on Friday that they don’t want a repeat of last week’s protest when officers used tear gas and pepper balls on those gathered outside the brick building’s gates.

An ICE spokesperson told NewsNation that demonstrators slashed the tires of federal vehicles and blocked paths before the use of chemical agents.

Protester Daniel Shouse told WGN that a car carrying three federal immigration officers drove over a curb to hit him on Wednesday.

“There’s no accountability. The officers came up to me at the hospital and asked if I’d be able to point the person out in a lineup,” Shouse said. ” How can I do that when they all wear masks? They have no name tags. They have nothing.”

The truck reportedly continued driving toward the ICE facility’s parking lot, witnesses told Broadview police.

Illinois officials have backed so-called “sanctuary city” policies in and around Chicago, preventing local authorities from assisting in federal immigration enforcement.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed two executive orders aimed at protecting the rights of city residents who protest, and Gov. JB Pritzker has criticized the administration’s “terrible plans” for the state.

The details of this threat — called a “pocket rescission” — may sound technical, but the ramifications are significant.
Under ordinary circumstances, after a president submits a request, Congress has 45 days to approve it.
If Congress does nothing, the rescission request expires and the funds get spent.
While very rare, this is not the first time an administration has made a rescission request late in the fiscal year.","Another needless government shutdown may soon be upon us. Politically, these events have proved fleeting. But this funding deadline carries a long-term threat to the separation of powers, and Republicans would be wise to take it seriously.

The Trump administration is making a frontal challenge to Congress’s power of the purse, and Congress seems either unwilling or unable to do anything about it. This reflects a broader, troubling trend. Our legislative branch has become subordinate to the executive through years of passivity. Congress must stand up to this exigent threat or risk losing more of its power.

The details of this threat — called a “pocket rescission” — may sound technical, but the ramifications are significant. This is about who controls government spending and whether a president can single-handedly cancel money appropriated by law.

The issue at hand is the White House’s effort to reverse nearly $5 billion included in this year’s foreign aid budget. Late last month, President Trump submitted what’s called a rescissions request under the Impoundment Control Act. Passed in response to the Nixon presidency, this 1974 law exists to ensure presidents do not ignore the will of Congress by failing to spend appropriated funds.

The law also formalized a procedure for presidents to propose canceling funds. Under ordinary circumstances, after a president submits a request, Congress has 45 days to approve it. If Congress does nothing, the rescission request expires and the funds get spent. This is because spending laws aren’t just suggestions: Congress must agree to cancel the spending.

But in this case, the White House submitted its rescissions request near the close of the fiscal year, essentially running out the clock. Agencies can hold onto those funds while a request is being considered, but are barred from spending money after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.

So by the time the 45-day window is up, the White House can claim this foreign aid money is no longer available to spend — even if Congress did not approve the White House’s request.

It’s a clever gambit, designed to help presidents game the system and undermine the appropriations process. But there are ways to stop it.

In the past, the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s watchdog agency, has called this maneuver illegal. The courts are reviewing its legitimacy; on Friday, the Supreme Court allowed the cut to go forward, but the decision was not a final determination on the merits. Congress still should act on this now.

The administration is testing Congress’s mettle. It made a shrewd political decision to request a relatively small package of cuts to foreign aid, a section of our budget often cited by voters as expendable. The administration appears to be making a bet — perhaps a good one — that Democratic leaders would not be willing to fight a government shutdown over such a small budget line, and that Republicans will continue to value party loyalty and their own desire to cut foreign aid over protecting their own constitutional powers.

That would be grievously shortsighted. Even if Republicans in Congress believe in cutting this spending, they must consider what they would be giving up. Passive acceptance of pocket rescissions today could lead to a future progressive president refusing to spend appropriated dollars on, say, immigration enforcement or military procurement.

Some proponents of a pocket rescission approach might claim that it is necessary after so many years of Congress failing to cut spending fat. But this is not how you balance a budget. Rescissions apply only to discretionary spending, not our entitlement programs, and agencies cannot withhold all their funding until the end of the fiscal year. What Congress would be doing by accepting this pocket rescission is giving away its authority.

More than these budget savings, what the administration appears to be seeking is to establish a precedent. It presumably wants to make this process seem legitimate, so that Mr. Trump can come back in future years to take out larger sections of the budget without approval from Congress.

The power of the purse is perhaps Congress’s most important tool to hold the executive in check. For decades, Congress has used the threat — or act — of withholding funds to compel administrations to comply with congressional policy priorities or oversight requests.

Unfortunately, Republicans have already begun ceding congressional power on other fronts — a trend that seems likely to continue. Since the start of the president’s second term, the administration has tried to eat away at Congress’s authorizing and appropriating roles. The administration even tried to shield from public view how it was spending appropriated dollars, a violation of federal transparency laws. This year, we have seen with tariffs what can happen when a seemingly narrow authority is granted to a president.

This is the moment for members of Congress to stand up and defend their institution. Whether before or after a government shutdown, Congress will ultimately send the president a bill that funds the government. It can and should include language either approving or rejecting this rescission of foreign aid and putting into law that a rescissions request cannot be made at the end of a fiscal year.

While very rare, this is not the first time an administration has made a rescission request late in the fiscal year. But during the Ford and Carter administrations, Congress acted on those requests, and at least one Ford administration official made clear it was not the intent to run out the clock.

By contrast, this looks like a power grab. And as Congress knows well, once power is ceded to the executive, it is almost impossible to wrest it back.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/28/opinion/28buck/26buck-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 18:56:28.188015

A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump referred questions to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment on the matter.
Ms. Beckwith has appealed her termination, arguing she could not be fired without cause and without due process.","For 15 years, Michele Beckwith oversaw some of the toughest federal prosecutions in California. She went after transnational terrorists, sex traffickers and the Aryan brotherhood.

She became the acting U.S. attorney in Sacramento this year when her boss, a Biden appointee, stepped down in January.

But her career crumbled in July, she said, after she issued a warning to Gregory Bovino, the California face of President Trump’s immigration crackdown.

The dismissal of Ms. Beckwith appears to be another example of how Mr. Trump has fired top federal prosecutors who did not help carry out his political agenda.

Her ouster came weeks before Mr. Trump fired a U.S. attorney in Virginia who determined there was insufficient evidence to indict James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, both political targets of the president. The Virginia prosecutor was replaced by a Trump loyalist who convinced a federal grand jury on Thursday to indict Mr. Comey on two counts.

Documents reviewed by The New York Times show that the July 15 firing of Ms. Beckwith occurred less than six hours after she told Mr. Bovino, the Border Patrol chief in charge of the Southern California raids, that a court order prevented him from arresting people without probable cause in a vast expanse that stretches from the Oregon border to Bakersfield. She was removed not only from her post as acting U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of California, but from the office altogether.

“It’s unjust,” she said of the firings across the federal government this year, in an interview. “We have to stand up and insist the laws be followed.”

“Folks, there is no such thing as a sanctuary city,” Mr. Bovino said in a video he shared on social media, with a holstered gun at his hip and canisters secured to his vest as he stood in front of the State Capitol.

“Whether it’s here in Sacramento or nationwide,” he continued, “we’re here, and we’re not going anywhere.”

The end of Ms. Beckwith’s federal career was precipitated by a phone call from Mr. Bovino on July 14. He told her that he was bringing his officers to Sacramento, about 600 miles north of the Mexico border, and wanted to know whom to notify in her office if they were assaulted, she recalled.

Ms. Beckwith said she reminded him that the Border Patrol was under a federal court order prohibiting it from stopping people indiscriminately in her district. It was clear, she said, that he knew about the order but did not seem to think it would stop his raid.

At 10:57 the next morning, she emailed Mr. Bovino to reiterate she expected “compliance with court orders and the Constitution.”

Hours later, her work cellphone went dark. Then her computer did, too. She checked her personal email account.

At 4:31 p.m., she received an email from Saurabh Sharma, special assistant to Mr. Trump.

“Michele,” it stated, “On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as First Assistant United States Attorney and employment with the Department of Justice is terminated, effective immediately.”

Ms. Beckwith was promptly marched out of the office.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump referred questions to the Department of Justice, which declined to comment on the matter.

A Department of Homeland Security official, who was part of the Sacramento operation and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that federal officials were offended by Ms. Beckwith’s suggestion that immigration agents were going to violate the rights of migrants.

What’s more, the official said, Mr. Bovino felt Ms. Beckwith was refusing to provide his team the legal support it needed to safely conduct the operations.

In a statement, Mr. Bovino said, “The former Acting US Attorney’s email suggesting that the United States Border Patrol does not ALWAYS abide by the Constitution revealed a bias against law enforcement.”

Ms. Beckwith’s impasse with Mr. Bovino was rooted in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union after his border agents conducted the unannounced raids in Bakersfield, where they arrested day laborers outside a Home Depot and farmworkers in orchards in January.

A federal judge in April ruled that the Border Patrol could detain people only if they had a reasonable suspicion that they were violating federal immigration law.

“You just can’t walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Give me your papers,’” U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer Thurston said. She granted an injunction stopping the Border Patrol from detaining people without probable cause while the case proceeds.

But that order did not apply to Southern California, where federal officials intensified their crackdown in June, leading to protests and Mr. Trump’s deployment of the National Guard against the wishes of California leaders. A Los Angeles judge in July also placed restrictions on immigration raids in Southern California, but the Supreme Court overruled her decision this month.

There are 93 U.S. attorneys overseeing federal prosecutions in districts throughout the country. It is common for them, as appointees, to resign after a new president is elected.

It is not common, however, for presidents to demand that prosecutors carry out certain acts as a condition of employment, said Nina Mendelson, a professor of law at the University of Michigan with expertise in administrative law. U.S. attorneys are supposed to be able to operate freely from political pressure.

“We still have a norm of prosecutorial independence and even-handedness and integrity at the federal level,” she said. “Political pressure to prosecute enemies or shield friends would not typically be considered cause for removal.”

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Eric Grant, who defended the Trump administration against major environmental lawsuits during the president’s first term, as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of California. Mr. Grant replaced Ms. Sanchez, who is now second in command in the office, the position that Ms. Beckwith once had.

Ms. Mendelson said the firing of longtime civil servants without cause, as in the case of Ms. Beckwith, is rare. Ms. Beckwith said that while the president had the right to remove her as acting U.S. attorney, he should have allowed her to return to prosecutorial work in the Eastern District.

Ms. Beckwith has appealed her termination, arguing she could not be fired without cause and without due process. She is seeking that her removal be expunged from her record, as well as back pay with interest and attorneys’ fees.

Ms. Beckwith said she was motivated by justice, not politics.

She was raised in Ohio by a father who worked in a fiberglass factory and a mother who stayed home to take care of her and her sister. They did not talk about politics.

She and her husband, also a lawyer, moved to California in 2004 for work and eventually decided to raise their family in Davis, a college town west of Sacramento, where she is a member of the school P.T.A. Though she is a registered Democrat, she pointed out that she has served Republican and Democratic presidents alike.

“I’m an American who cares about her country,” she said. “I’m a public servant. That is my calling.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/26/multimedia/26nat-doj-firing-mcjl/26nat-doj-firing-mcjl-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 18:56:50.918301

There have been growing tensions between federal law enforcement and the public in immigration courts as federal agents are tasked with making more arrests. Over the last five months, ICE has increased its footprint inside immigration courthouses, which are operated by the Justice Department. The agents' presence and arrests in courthouses, particularly in New York, have resulted in conflicting mandates and instances of explosive anger, as NPR previously reported.

In August, as NPR and a court observer — an immigrant advocate — entered the hall, federal enforcement brushed past. The agent, who was unmasked and had been sitting in the waiting area earlier, yelled at NPR: ""stop f****** following me! Why are you f****** following me?"" before turning and yelling the same thing at the court observer.

""It's not f****** about you!"" she retorted.

As they turned the corner, more shouting could be heard.

""Don't f****** touch me,"" the court observer yelled. ""Why are you pushing me? Why are you shoving me? I am not following you!""

Trump paused about $30 billion in foreign aid in one of his first acts back in the White House, prompting the groups to swiftly file suit.
It’s the latest chapter in the convoluted legal battle over Trump’s efforts to slash foreign aid.

The unsigned order indefinitely extends the pause on U.S. District Judge Amir Ali’s injunction that was put in place earlier this month by Chief Justice John Roberts, who handles emergency appeals from the nation’s capital by default, as the high court considered the appeal.

The court gave a brief explanation of its reasoning, saying that the government “at this early stage” made sufficient showing that the lawsuit is precluded under the Impoundment Control Act and that the plaintiffs can’t force the government to pay up.

The court also said that the asserted harm to Trump’s foreign policy powers appeared to outweigh potential harm faced by the respondents.

“This order should not be read as a final determination on the merits,” the order read. “The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief.”

Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson that the application raises “novel issues fundamental to the relationship between the President and Congress.”

Solicitor General D. John Sauer had argued that letting Ali’s injunction stand would force the administration to obligate the money at “breakneck speed,” even as Trump has proposed cancelling the aid to Congress.

The president’s proposal is known as a “pocket rescission,” a rare and legally murky bid to avoid spending appropriated money by asking Congress to cut the budget late into the fiscal year. It means the 45-day window lawmakers have to act on the request could be cut short by the budget year’s end, leaving the funds to expire. If lawmakers reject the request, the funds must be released.

Kagan wrote that the “stakes are high,” pinning down the central issue as the allocation of the power of the purse between the president and Congress. She criticized the majority for granting any emergency relief with the weighty issues at play.

However, the administration’s outrage amounts to “the price of living under a Constitution that gives Congress the power to make spending decisions through the enactment of appropriations laws,” she argued.

“If those laws require obligation of the money, and if Congress has not by rescission or other action relieved the Executive of that duty, then the Executive must comply,” the justice wrote. “It cannot be heard to complain, as it does here, that the laws clash with the President’s differing view of ‘American values’ and ‘American interests.’

“That inconsistency, in other words, is not a cognizable harm, to be weighed in the equitable balance,” she continued. “It is merely a frustration any President must bear.”

Roberts’s temporary order only paused Ali’s injunction as it pertained to the funds subject to Trump’s Aug. 28 rescission proposal to Congress.

Global health and aid groups challenging Trump’s efforts to freeze the funds rejected the notion it would interfere with Congress’s decisionmaking to make the government pay up.

“Any emergency is of the government’s own making, as it has been under an obligation to spend the appropriated funds for specified purposes since at least March 2024,” the plaintiffs’ response to the government’s emergency application read.

Trump paused about $30 billion in foreign aid in one of his first acts back in the White House, prompting the groups to swiftly file suit.

About $10.5 billion of the total $30 billion is set to expire Sept. 30, but the government planned to obligate $6.5 billion of those funds by the deadline, Sauer said. That left the roughly $4 billion in play.

“The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,” Sauer wrote in the government’s request for a stay.

It’s the latest chapter in the convoluted legal battle over Trump’s efforts to slash foreign aid.

Though the plaintiffs only sued in February, the case reached the Supreme Court for the first time in March. At that time, the justices rejected the president’s request that nearly $2 billion in blocked foreign aid payments remain frozen in a 5-4 decision.

Last month, a panel of U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit judges found the challengers did not have standing to bring their lawsuit, striking down Ali’s ruling ordering the administration to spend billions in aid work.

That ruling was later amended, which left a pathway for the plaintiffs to ask for a preliminary injunction on different legal grounds. After that, Ali granted a new preliminary injunction, the subject of this appeal.

The Trump administration’s appeal of that ruling yielded a 2-1 decision from the appeals court in the plaintiffs’ favor, prompting the emergency application to the justices. Roberts issued his administrative stay earlier this month.

Our congressional correspondent, Lisa Desjardins, and White House correspondent Liz Landers are here with the latest.
Geoff Bennett: That's right.
We tried to find what those contingency plans would look like, and from a lot of the major federal agencies, we didn't see any updated contingency plans.
Geoff Bennett: All right, Lisa Desjardins, Liz Landers, our thanks to you both.","Amna Nawaz:

The White House is threatening to use a looming government shutdown to drive mass layoffs at federal agencies.

Geoff Bennett:

And that's with the funding deadline that lawmakers appear almost certain to miss just days away.

Our congressional correspondent, Lisa Desjardins, and White House correspondent Liz Landers are here with the latest.

So, Liz, we will start with you.

Last night, the OMB director, Russ Vought, he told agencies to prepare shutdown plans that include permanent layoffs? What more do we know?

Liz Landers:

We obtained this memo late last night. It was sent over by the Office of Management and Budget.

And, in it, it says that they are preparing for a potential shutdown. And some of this is normal and they have had some planning calls apparently about this week. And there's some politics in here, some finger-pointing that the administration is doing, Democrats, in particular, saying that they are inching closer to a shutdown over a series of insane demands, including a trillion dollars in new spending.

But this note goes farther, and what it suggests is that the agencies could use this moment to do mass layoffs. It says: ""Agencies are directed to use this opportunity to consider reduction in force.""

And, as you know, Geoff, this agent — this administration, I should say, has really relied on these RIF notices, these reduction in force mechanisms, to really slim down the federal government in the last seven or so months of the Trump administration.

Geoff Bennett:

That's right. And we should make clear that the threat of permanent cuts is new. How do these agencies typically prepare for a possible shutdown?

Liz Landers:

So it's normal for an agency to put out a contingency plan, and they usually post those on a Web site. And the White House currently has some of this up right now, saying that agency contingency plans for a lapse in appropriations are hosted on each agency's Web site.

We tried to find what those contingency plans would look like, and from a lot of the major federal agencies, we didn't see any updated contingency plans. So, basically, what that means right now is, we don't know who is going to be deemed an essential worker who keeps the government functioning, critical issue — critical functions of the government that we need, who may be furloughed, and who may be part of this reduction in force.

So, right now, federal employees around the country are waiting to find out if they are impacted by this RIF or not.

Geoff Bennett:

Yes, lots of confusion.

So, Lisa, you have been talking with your sources on the Hill, as well as the unions that represent federal workers. How do they see this threat of mass layoffs by the Trump administration?

Lisa Desjardins:

Somehow, we yet again are in uncharted territory. And you're right. Federal workers are right in the middle of it.

So, talking to the largest union for federal employees, which is the American Federation of Government Employees, they put out this statement they sent to me and to others, saying that: ""The only path forward is compromise. Federal employees are not bargaining chips.""

And that gets to this idea of RIFs being on the table. They see RIFs as patently illegal. Now, the argument there, talking to a former official with the Office of Personnel Management, is that the law governing shutdowns says that, when you're shutting down, H.R. for each agency is only supposed to be doing shutdown activities, figuring out who stays and who goes, and that a permanent RIF is not a shutdown activity.

What it is, is reorganizing government. And that's the argument this is illegal. Now, in reality, as we have seen the Trump administration do, they will make their argument that he has that power and they will wait for courts to act, which will take much longer.

Meanwhile, federal employees who have been promised to be paid after shutdown now have a new concern, which is that they could lose their jobs entirely. Now, I also want to mention about Democrats, where they are all with this federal workers being in the crosshairs moment. They right now are saying this is an intimidation scheme. It's not changing their strategy for the shutdown.

But, privately, some Democrats admit they are worried that maybe some aspects of a shutdown could lead to worse consequences, things they don't want to happen for government.

Geoff Bennett:

So let's talk more about that. Where do things stand? Because the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, was on this program last night. He described President Trump as derelict in the way that he's going about handling all of this. Is either side budging? It appears they're not.

Lisa Desjardins:

Yes, this is a high-stakes game of chicken right now. And what we're seeing is Democrats actually emboldened, because they think Republicans have made some missteps, including the president canceling not meeting with them.

Today, we saw Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, again go in front of microphones. He is trying to make a statement here by having news conferences every day at the Capitol saying, hey, I'm here. I'm ready to meet.

Now, in reality, also, Republicans have canceled not just the first couple of days of session next week, but all of next week. I spoke to a Republican member tonight. And I said, aren't you nervous about not being in town during the shutdown? He said, no, I don't think voters are going to care after this is over.

That's the risk that Republicans are taking. I also want to walk people through, because this is a lot to talk about, a basic 101 of what is needed to avoid a shutdown, because it hasn't happened yet, right? So, first of all, the first thing obviously is the House majority has to pass a funding bill. That has happened. House Republicans passed that bill.

Now, this is what Democrats have rejected. And the Senate needs to have 60 votes to pass a funding bill. Now, they're eight votes short right now of getting that done. So that's really where the holdup is. That's where Democrats have leverage, because you don't need a lot of Democrats, but you do need more than they have right now.

Where are we with the shutdown? I'm sticking with my 80 percent chances. They could maybe have a short-term funding bill, but no one's even discussing it right now.

Geoff Bennett:

Yes.

And quickly back to something you said, Lisa. House Republicans, they canceled the session for next week. What reason did they give?

Lisa Desjardins:

They said they don't think there's any reason to come back once they have passed their bill for funding, and they're leaving it up to the Senate. They're really just trying to jam Democrats in the Senate. But they say, we have done our job. They need to do theirs.

Geoff Bennett:

All right, Lisa Desjardins, Liz Landers, our thanks to you both.

Background

In 2006, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) brought a lawsuit against a series of parties under CERCLA to recover past and future response costs it had incurred and would incur investigating and remediating the New Cassel/Hicksville Groundwater Contamination Superfund Site (Site) in Hempstead and Oyster Bay, New York.3 In 2016, the court found Next Millennium Realty LLC and 101 Frost Street Associates, LP (collectively, Plaintiffs) liable under CERCLA.4 Plaintiffs then entered into a consent decree with NYSDEC as a result.5 Utility Manufacturing Co.

In 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a UAO to Plaintiffs and Defendants, which was amended in 2019, ultimately requiring the parties to implement another remedial investigation and a remedial design for a portion of the Site.6 Plaintiffs alleged they have incurred response costs at the Site to comply with the UAO but Defendants have not, and sought to recover those costs through both a CERCLA Section 107(a) cost recovery claim and a CERCLA Section 113(f)(1) contribution claim.7 Defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.8

Analysis

As an initial matter, the court acknowledged that CERCLA cost recovery and contribution claims provide “complementary yet distinct” relief.9 Reviewing decisions from other federal courts, the court held that if a party has a CERCLA contribution claim, that party cannot also assert a CERCLA cost recovery claim for the same costs.10

The court then evaluated whether receipt of a UAO constitutes a civil action under CERCLA, such that it triggers the recipient’s right to assert a CERCLA contribution claim (and bars a cost recovery claim).11 Applying principles of statutory interpretation, the court concluded that a UAO is not a civil action under the meaning of Section 113(f)(1).12

In reaching that conclusion, the court relied on the plain language of Section 106, which authorizes the issuance of UAOs. Section 106 “distinguishes between two avenues of enforcement: by a lawsuit brought in federal district court or by taking ‘other action,’ such as an administrative order” (i.e., a UAO).13 As Section 113(f)(1) uses the phrase “civil action” and not any “action,” the court held that receipt of a UAO does not entitle the UAO recipient to contribution under CERCLA.14 The court also noted that the statute of limitations for CERCLA contribution claims run from the date of either a “judgment” or a “settlement,” neither of which contemplates receipt of a UAO.15 Consequently, the court dismissed Plaintiffs’ CERCLA contribution claim for UAO compliance costs.16

The court next addressed whether costs incurred to comply with a UAO could be recovered through a CERCLA cost recovery claim.17 Although some precedent describes a Section 107 cost recovery claim as one to recover costs incurred “voluntarily,”18 the court held that “nothing in the plain language of § 107(a), Supreme Court, or Second Circuit authority requires a reading that the [party] incurred response costs ‘voluntarily.’""19 Further, barring Plaintiffs from recovering under both Section 113 for contribution and Section 107 for cost recovery “would be inconsistent with the statute’s purpose of ensuring that each party bears its fair share of cleanup costs and encouraging cooperation with government agencies.”20 The Court thus held that Plaintiffs could assert a Section 107 cost recovery claim for UAO compliance costs.21

Potential implications

The District Court’s decision provides clarity that in the Eastern District of New York, costs to comply with a UAO are recoverable solely through a CERCLA Section 107 cost recovery claim, as opposed to a CERCLA Section 113 contribution claim. The court’s holding may incentivize parties to undertake cleanup under UAOs, forgoing opportunities to settle with the government, given the breadth of possible recovery, the longer statute of limitations, and the potential that such a CERCLA Section 107 action is not barred by CERCLA “contribution protection.”22

The conflict over several hours is the latest pushback by federal authorities against protesters focused on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, about 12 miles west of Chicago, amid a surge of immigration enforcement that began early this month.

Agents repeatedly fired chemical agents toward protesters after some of the group attempted to block a car from driving down a street toward the ICE building. The pepper balls and tear gas canisters went into the entire crowd, most of them standing far back from the fence and not blocking any traffic.

Protesters fell to the ground and ran as agents repeatedly fired, dispersing most of the crowd of dozens.

In previous weeks, protesters had also tried to block agents’ vehicles from moving in or out of a yard next to the building. A fence installed Tuesday pushed Friday’s demonstrators farther away.

Earlier in the morning, a handful of protesters yelled and rang bells at a section of the fence closer to the building. Agents shot the first round of pepper balls Friday morning toward protesters using ribbons to tie handwritten messages of support for detainees onto the fence, including “No human is illegal,” and “We stand with you! You are not illegal!”

Protesters and agents yelled expletives at one another when federal immigration agents pulled signs and flags off the fence surrounding the building.

Bushra Amiwala, a 27-year-old elected official on the Skokie Board of Education, said she was shot by pepper balls while tying notes on the wall, causing her to cough and have trouble breathing.

“They caught us so incredibly off guard,” she said as remnants of the white powder clung to her pants and hijab. “We literally were just tying notes on the wall.”

Amiwala called the use of chemical agents “fully unprovoked.”

Village officials have demanded the “illegally built” fence be removed over security concerns from the fire department. It remained in place Friday.

It was not immediately clear if anyone was arrested. Federal officials said multiple people were arrested in last week’s protests at the same location and characterized those arrested as “rioters.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de2e1d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1620x851+0+115/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Ff9%2F97c46b9042679132b42e3ae2cbf0%2F2ae0363130f34120864214e6e68282a2.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 17:57:11.297801

This comes one week after ICE and Homeland Security Investigations executed a criminal warrant at a Mexican restaurant in Frisco.

The Summit Daily reports the U.S. Marshals Service had agents supporting ICE in Thursday’s operation. The USMS did not respond to Denver7’s request for confirmation.

Sources told Denver7 that multiple people were detained in the operation, but it’s not clear who, how many, or if any criminal warrants were involved.

Denver7 pressed ICE for those answers. The agency sent Denver7 a statement in response:

Summit County is not the only Colorado mountain community seeing reports of federal law enforcement activity. The Routt County Sheriff’s Office and Steamboat Springs Police Department sent a joint statement to Denver7:

In Summit County, some community members expressed concerns about Thursday’s operation, saying it has led to widespread fear. Summit County, one of Colorado’s most popular tourist destinations, is home to many immigrants.

“I've been here over 25 years, and we've never seen something like this,” said Summit County resident Victor Almeida, who owns an excavation company. “It doesn't surprise me because it's been on the news everywhere else, but we weren't expecting it.”

Bethany Hughes, a Summit County resident who works in the construction industry, called Thursday’s operation “heartbreaking and it's terrifying.”

“There's been a lot of reaction and stress and anxiety within the community,” she said. “The voices of those who are affected and being disenfranchised by this have very effectively been silenced. I think when that silencing happens, there's a great loss of power and a great loss of confidence.”

Summit County Commissioner Tamara Pogue said the operation leads to “a human toll here that feels cruel and inhumane.”

“I think for Summit County, this is not a political issue; this is a humanity issue,” she said. “Everybody knows everybody here. It's a very real experience. It's not about some sort of random person on the news. It's about who your kid plays soccer with, and who you might see at church, and suddenly, people are not here anymore.

“When events like what happened this morning happen, our community devolves into chaos, and it is heartbreaking,” Pogue added. “Businesses close, soccer practice gets canceled. Students are afraid to leave their schools because they don't feel safe, and parents are worried about being separated from their kids.”

Many across the country support President Donald Trump’s administration taking a strict approach to immigration enforcement.

“We all come to this country to make it better. If you come to this country to break the law, I think you should be sent back,” said Almeida. “But if you're just trying to make a living and making this country great like we have for so long, I just don't see why we're doing this.”

Community members also raised concerns that more ICE activity will have a negative economic impact on Summit County residents and the state as a whole.

“As much as this is a place of leisure for others, those of us who live up here, it's very hand-to-mouth, and you really have to be fighting it, and you have to be able to be at work every day just to make rent,” said Hughes.

“People are afraid,” Almeida added. “People don't want to go to work anymore. That's going to affect us as business owners when we don't have enough manpower to complete jobs… It’s going to affect everybody.”

“Tourists who come here and expect a certain level of service simply won't be given that level of service because we don't have the people available to do that,” said Pogue. “And that's going to generate an economic impact for the state as well.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a66bc2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+643/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2F49%2F9ebfaa8148d8827767abc001dc41%2Fimg-0930.JPG,N,,2025-09-26 20:56:57.289908

Comment letter on the Department of Education’s efforts to restrict nonprofit employer eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness – Sept. 4, 2025.","Founded in 2007, the program was designed to cancel any outstanding debt for borrowers who dedicated a significant portion of their careers to areas such as public health education, public safety and the defense of civil rights while making loan payments.

Both UnidosUS staff members were among 872,000 borrowers to have their debt wiped clean in 2024 during the final year of the Biden administration, while just 7,000 graduates achieved the same goal in the 17 years prior. But now an executive order by President Donald Trump threatens to upend this program for hundreds of organizations by asserting activities such as advocating for the rights of undocumented immigrants and other historically underserved populations, broadly defined as DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), as illegal.

“This action seeks to unfairly punish nonprofit workers who are serving communities all across the country, just because the president doesn’t like the mission of the organizations they work for,” says Chamorro. “Through PSLF, the federal government made a promise to public servants who made financial sacrifices that there would be light at the end of the tunnel, and that promise should be kept.”

In order to enact the president’s executive order, the Department of Education must engage in a rulemaking process, in which the department updates the rules and procedures that dedicate how PSLF is administered by employers and the federal government. During this process, the department is required to hold public hearings and engage stakeholders to discuss the proposed changes.

Under the new rules, employers that engage in what the department defines as “substantially illegal activities” would no longer be considered a qualifying employer for borrowers under PSLF. Many advocates point out that the department’s broad definitions would include organizations that advocate for gender-affirming care; immigration rights; civil protest; and diversity, equity and inclusion.

Over the last six months, UnidosUS and dozens of civil rights organizations have rallied to protect their participation in PSLF, testifying in letters and oral arguments that these assertions run contrary to the U.S. Constitution and the First Amendment.

During this regulatory rulemaking process, UnidosUS Senior Policy Analyst for Higher Education Magin Sanchez told the Department of Education that UnidosUS was strongly opposed to efforts to engage with “viewpoint discrimination,” noting that “PSLF was created as a vital investment in our country’s future, empowering talented graduates to strengthen the very foundation of our democracy through public service.”

“Our Constitution and its First Amendment remain the same,” former UnidosUS Education Policy Analyst Tania Valencia told department officials. At the time of the hearing, she was serving as a higher education senior program manager at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “The department does not have the authority to exclude employers based on their participation in disfavored speech and activities. Every major civil rights advancement, from the desegregation of schools to marriage equality, began as a viewpoint that challenged existing power structures.”

Throughout the rulemaking process, UnidosUS has been sounding the alarm that excluding certain organizations from PSLF not only defies constitutionally protected free speech but also significantly hurts the U.S. economy and societal wellbeing, which is exactly the opposite of what Trump argues in his executive order.

Historically, it is the Internal Revenue Service that determines employer eligibility, a level of expertise the Department of Education does not possess. UnidosUS was one of dozens of nonprofit organizations to submit letters or sign onto letters written in the same spirit of defense by other organizations to the Department of Education. In them, they questioned the Trump administration’s attempts to categorize advocacy work as “illegal” because of the way it centers historically underserved populations such as people of color, immigrants and the LGBTQ+ community.

“The law clearly establishes statutory authority for broad-based eligibility for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, and we reject politically motivated attempts to narrow this eligibility and break the longstanding commitment made to borrowers who have been faithfully making payments for years,” UnidosUS wrote in its individual May 5 letter.

“Under these rules, nonprofits offering such support risk losing PSLF eligibility — not because they engage in illegal conduct, but because their work conflicts with the administration’s ideological narrative,” stated a May 5 group letter sponsored by the Student Loan Borrower Protection Center and Democracy Forward and signed by UnidosUS and 185 socially inclusive non-profits.

Under the department’s proposed rule, the secretary of education has the power to make the determination if an employer engages in “substantially illegal activities.” If so, student loan payments made while employed under said employer would no longer count toward forgiveness, starting after said disqualification determination is made. Employers that lose eligibility would be able to regain eligibility after 10 years or upon the approval of a corrective action plan that stops engaging with said activities.

“It is deeply concerning that this rule provides extensive power to the secretary with little to no independent oversight, nor recourse for disqualified organizations,” says Sanchez.

Leveraging PSLF while working in schools, community clinics, fire and rescue, and other public-serving sectors has allowed borrowers to settle their debt in exchange for community service that is often underpaid. In so doing, these borrowers can achieve and contribute to the American dream by buying homes, starting businesses or even planning families whose children are the future workforce.

“This program not only addresses severe staffing shortages in essential sectors like education and public safety but also ensures access to careers without crushing debt,” says Sanchez. “Latinos, like too many Americans, are currently unable to meet their basic needs.”

The Department of Education released its draft rule on Aug. 18. From that time, a new 30-day period of public comment began, wherein interested individuals and parties may submit written feedback. UnidosUS submitted two comment letters:

Comment letter on changes to employer eligibility under Public Service Loan Forgiveness – Sept. 19, 2025.

That protest also saw federal agents tear gas and shoot pepper balls at protesters.","BROADVIEW — Federal agents shot rubber bullets at and tear gassed demonstrators during a Friday morning protest outside the Broadview ICE facility.

Demonstrators have regularly gathered outside the facility, 1930 Beach St., in recent weeks as part of resistance to federal operations Midway Blitz and At Large, which are targeting undocumented people in Chicago and throughout Illinois. But the protests have grown violent recently as agents have used force against protesters who try to block access to the facility.

About 8 a.m. Friday, agents threw tear gas canisters at protesters and shot at them with rubber pellets and pepper spray balls near 25th Avenue and Harvard Street. Local and state police had shut down an adjacent section of Harvard Street before 8 a.m.

“Someone’s gotta stand in the front,” said Kurt Evans, who carried an American flag and led a group of protesters as agents bombarded them.

After the initial tear gas deployment, outraged demonstrators crowded a narrow parking lot adjacent to the facility. For the next hour and a half, federal officers fired off pepper spray balls and tear gas canisters, hitting organizers, journalists and photographers in the process.

Around 10:30 a.m., a sniper positioned on the roof of the facility fired baton rounds toward the crowd, shattering the windows of a nearby business and splitting open one protester’s guitar. Baton rounds are less-lethal ammunition, similar to rubber bullets and typically used for crowd control by officers.

At one point, an armed officer fired multiple tear gas canisters into the air, immediately dispersing the crowd. One protester tossed a canister back at officers and was shot at with less-lethal rounds.

“Everything was peaceful before the pepper bullets. I was helping people tie handwritten notes of encouragement to detainees to the fence outside,” Democratic congressional candidate Bushra Amiwala said in a statement Friday, describing the moment she said she was struck by pepper bullets.

Tensions flared again about 11 a.m. as agents forced protesters back onto the street as vehicles drove into the facility’s lot.

Throughout the morning, protesters tossed plushies and stuffed animals at cars driven by federal agents.

Demonstrations have been held every Friday morning since Operation Midway Blitz began this month; this week, some organizers called for people to gather daily in a bid to shut down the facility.

For this Friday’s protest, organizers were forced to move locations because federal immigration officials put up a fence in the street near the processing center. Broadview officials have said the fence was put up illegally and have demanded ICE remove the fence, but it was still up as of Friday morning.

People passing by in cars and trucks honked their horns, seemingly in support of the protest. Demonstrators marched in a circle from one sidewalk to the other, chanting, “How do you spell racist? I-C-E!”

Ten protesters were detained and later released in last week’s protest, according to the National Lawyers Guild.

That protest also saw federal agents tear gas and shoot pepper balls at protesters.

And on Wednesday, protesters said an ICE agent hit a protester with a car. Block Club has not been able to verify the driver was an agent. Broadview police are investigating.

Levi Rolles said he was one of the 10 people arrested during last week’s protest — but he returned Friday morning. Agents yelled at Rolles to “go home” and shot him with pepper balls.

Rolles said that after he was detained, he was taken to an empty section of the facility for several hours. At one point, he saw another protester, who was Latino, and saw an agent hit that protester and call him slurs because the agent thought that person “was an immigrant,” Rolles said. But Rolles, who is white, was treated respectfully, he said.

On Friday, Rolles stood at the front of the gathering and was shot dozens of times with pepper spray balls. He took his shirt off, revealing a patchwork of welts on his back. A federal officer knew Rolles by name and pleaded with him to move backwards away from agents, to little avail.

“If I die out here, someone’s gonna have to step in and replace me,” Rolles said as another protester cleaned his wounds with soap and water. “I will die for this.”

Agents warned the crowd that those who didn’t move back would be arrested. One protester, who some identified as a medic, was wrestled to the ground by several agents and was walked into the facility in handcuffs.

About 11:30 a.m., a woman who tried to block an ICE-affiliated van by standing in front of it was pulled to the ground by an officer before being released back into the crowd.

“We just want to do our jobs and go home,” an agent said to one protester. “We don’t want to turn this into a fight.”

The protest began to die down around noon, as protesters slowly trickled away and agents, many with riot shields, continued to hold the line before walking back to the facility.

The superintendent of the largest school district in Iowa has been detained by federal immigration officials. Superintendent Ian Roberts of Des Moines Public Schools was detained Friday morning by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to a message to the district from DMPS Board Chair Jackie Norris.

Norris said the district has not confirmed why Roberts was detained or what ""next potential steps"" will be.

According to a listing of detainees on the ICE website, Roberts is being held in Pottawattamie County Jail in Council Bluffs, although a jail employee said Roberts is not located there. The website lists his country of birth as Guyana.

Roberts was named superintendent in 2023. A district profile states he was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and grew up in Brooklyn, New York.

Per board protocol, DMPS Associate Superintendent Matt Smith will serve as interim superintendent until further notice. Norris said the district will share more updates as they confirm more information.

The following email was sent to the district shortly after 12:20 p.m.

""On behalf of the Board of the Des Moines Public Schools, I wish to share information of immediate importance to the DMPS community.

Pursuant to the Board-approved DMPS leadership succession plan, Matt Smith, Associate Superintendent, will immediately step into the role of Interim Superintendent until further notice.

The email was signed by Jackie Norris, DMPS board president.

Who is Ian Roberts?

Roberts was hired as the superintendent of DMPS in July 2023. When he arrived, he faced a slew of challenges. The district was divided over the actions taken by the previous superintendent, Thomas Ahart, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, DMPS kept students and staff out of buildings longer than most other Iowa school districts during the pandemic.

Roberts oversaw the completion of the district’s 4,000-seat Mediacom Stadium, which was a collaboration with Drake University. All five of the district’s high schools compete there. Roberts also expanded the district’s Montessori preschools beyond Cowles Elementary School in Windsor Heights.

He has been leading the Reimagining Education campaign, a five-year plan that “outlines major changes and improvements designed to strengthen student outcomes” in the district.

In terms of district challenges, Roberts has been tasked with managing an ever-tightening budget, which includes closing several school buildings. Another one of his goals is to raise algebra proficiency rates among Black males.

Before coming to DMPS, Roberts was a track and field athlete who competed for Guyana in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Roberts is known to challenge DMPS students to footraces, often dressed in his signature suits with matching pocket squares. He frequently tells reporters that he enjoys reading, writing, running and hunting—especially Iowa’s deer.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8946c21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1620x851+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2Fd8%2F54e3e59b4c95b3651c718cf8fea4%2Fdr-ian-roberts.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 15:56:40.211992

“Over the past month and a half, plain-clothed, masked, and armed federal agents have flooded the streets of the nation’s capital, indiscriminately arresting without warrants and without probable cause District residents whom the agents perceive to be Latino,” says the complaint.

The complaint was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the ACLU of D.C., the National Immigration Project, and others, on behalf of the plaintiffs.

In August, President Trump declared a crime emergency in D.C., despite record-low rates of violent crime. During that press conference, Trump made numerous misleading statements about the prevalence of crime in the city, and announced that D.C. will “no longer be a sanctuary for illegal alien criminals.”

“We will have full, seamless, integrated cooperation at all levels of law enforcement, and we’ll deploy officers across the District with an overwhelming presence,” he said.

A few days later, on August 15, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed D.C.’s mayor to use local resources to assist with “enforcement of federal immigration law,” including “locating, apprehending, and detaining aliens unlawfully present in the United States.”

Between the time of the emergency declaration and September 9, more than 40 percent of the arrests in D.C. were for alleged civil immigration violations, more than any other cause for arrests, according to the suit. The complaint says that federal officers have indiscriminately targeted anyone who appears Latino, including one person who was taking the trash out and another who was walking out of a grocery store.

Agents abducted one resident when he was on his way to dialysis treatment, according to the groups’ press release announcing the lawsuit. He was detained for over eight hours, without food or his medication.

“They ignored my U.S. driver’s license and left me without critical treatment that day, putting my health in immediate danger,” he said in a statement. “Since then, I have lived in fear that I could be torn from my family and deported to a place where I cannot get the medical care I need to survive.”

All four of the individual plaintiffs in the case were abducted by federal agents who did not have warrants for their arrest.

José Escobar Molina, who has had Temporary Protected Status (TPS) since 2001, was taken by federal agents as he was about to get into his truck and start his work day.

“The agents immediately handcuffed Mr. Escobar Molina, grabbed him by the arms and legs, and called him ‘illegal’ repeatedly,” the suit says. “When he responded that he has ‘papers’ (in other words, immigration status), they replied, ‘No you don’t. You are illegal.’”

After they put him in a vehicle, he told them again he had “papers.”

The driver reportedly yelled at him, “Shut up, bitch! You’re illegal.”

He was detained overnight and released the next day after a supervisor realized Molina had valid TPS.

Federal agents abducted another plaintiff, identified in the complaint as N.S., as he sat in his car in a Home Depot parking lot after he finished shopping.

“The agents pulled N.S. out of the driver’s seat, threw him against the car, handcuffed him, and provided him a clear bag in which to place his belongings, before placing him in the back of a van,” the complaint says.

N.S., who has a pending asylum application, was detained for almost four weeks in detention centers around the country until he was released on his own recognizance.

“His knee is swollen due to being shackled for several hours at a time and sitting on several long flights as he was repeatedly transferred while detained,” the complaint says. “He is unable to sleep through the night. He is scared to walk outside or drive and has stopped driving his grandchildren and youngest son to school.”

In another case, a plaintiff identified as R.S.M. and her husband were driving to work when federal agents surrounded their car. They detained R.S.M for about 10 hours, and released her with an ankle monitor. R.S.M. has a pending asylum application.

Trump’s emergency order expired on September 11, but “mass immigration stops and arrests in D.C. are continuing,” the complaint says.

After D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said local police would stop cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) once the emergency declaration expired, Trump lashed out at the mayor, who he had previously praised for her cooperation.

“It has been a beautiful thing to watch but, now, under pressure from the Radical Left Democrats, Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has presided over this violent criminal takeover of our Capital for years, has informed the Federal Government that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens,” Trump posted on Truth Social.

“If I allowed this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN,” he continued. “I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!”

Most of the city’s residents, however, are opposed to the president’s takeover. In August, D.C. resident Sean Dunn, who threw a sandwich at a federal agent, became a folk hero, and a grand jury refused to indict him.

“Fuck you! You fucking facists!” he allegedly yelled before throwing the sandwich. “Why are you here? I don’t want you in my city!”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025-9-26-free-dc-protest.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 13:56:50.258443

The exchange was captured on video. It starts in the hallway.

A man who officials say had just attended an immigration hearing is seen standing with his family, holding his daughter's hand, when ICE agents tell him to let go of the girl.

""Let go of the girl, you're being detained,"" one is heard saying.

It wasn't clear why the man was being detained or why, specifically, he was at Federal Plaza.

His wife, Monica Elizabeth Moreta, then links arms with her husband, her daughter sandwiched between them. She said if her husband had to go, she and her daughter would go too. The agent dismissed her.

Meanwhile, the husband is heard in the background pleading his case, saying, ""I didn't do anything wrong.""

A tussle breaks out as federal agents try to pry the family apart. The husband is eventually pried away, his daughter left crying. As the husband is taken away, video soon shows his wife tussling with ICE agents.

At times, she yells, ""Let me go!"" as her daughter stands nearby. Then an agent in a plaid shirt and baseball cap is seen lifting her and carrying her to a room. The children are ushered in, while their mother repeatedly yells, ""No."" The door is then slammed closed, blocking out the cameras.

The video then cuts to the wife and that same plaid-shirted agent, now standing near an elevator bank. He repeatedly yells, ""Bye!"" as she tries to talk to him. At one point, the woman says, ""My hair was pulled. You don't care about anything.""

Suddenly, the agent lashes out, shoving the woman backwards, into a wall, and down onto the floor, then yells at her while she is on the ground. He yells for people to get her out of the building.

Moreta went to the hospital afterward. She's expected to be physically OK. Later, Moreta told reporters she came to the U.S. after being ""nearly killed"" in her home country and had to go into hiding. Moreta says she thought her family would be protected in America.

At an ICE protest Thursday night, City Comptroller and activist Brad Lander says he was in 26 Federal Plaza, which houses the New York immigration court and an ICE processing site, when the incident happened but he didn't witness it. Lander says seeing the video is enough.

""We are here in non-violent, non-cooperation to what ICE is doing, but every day there’s violence in that building being perpetrated by ICE agents,"" Lander said. ""Whatever your point of view on immigration, watch that video.""

Video from the incident captured another agent shown moments earlier shoving a press photographer.

The incident was caught on camera Thursday at an immigration court in New York City - sparking outrage amid growing concern across the country about ICE's increasingly aggressive tactics in arrests of immigrants.

""The officer's conduct in this video is unacceptable and beneath the men and women of ICE. Our ICE law enforcement are held to the highest professional standards and this officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,"" ICE Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Friday.

CNN has asked ICE to clarify what ""relieved of his current duties"" means - and whether the officer is still employed elsewhere within ICE.

In one video of the incident shared on social media, a woman and a girl are seen clinging with locked arms to a man, reportedly the woman's husband, who is being detained, in a hallway of 26 Federal Plaza, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement District Office in Lower Manhattan.

One masked agent grabs her hair as someone says, ""Just grab her, grab her and pull her away."" Moments after separating the woman and the man, she is removed from the hallway into a nearby room.

It's unclear how long she stayed in the room.

The video resumes with her in the hallway speaking to a federal agent, saying in Spanish, ""You guys don't care about anything!"" The agent says, ""Adios, adios,"" as the woman pleads and motions her hands towards the agent.

The agent grabs the woman and forces her several feet down the hallway, into a wall. He then continues shoving the woman down the hallway and pushes her to the ground.

The agent then stands over her and says, ""Leave!"" in Spanish, and asks nearby officers to remove her from the building.

Several videos shared by other news outlets captured the interaction from different angles. In one video, court security officers were seen escorting the woman from the scene.

The federal building in Manhattan, where the interaction took place, has become the epicenter of immigration crackdown efforts in New York City. It is home to an immigration court, the FBI's New York field office and other federal agencies, and has been a place ICE agents routinely apprehend migrants after court appearances.

Rep. Dan Goldman, a Democrat whose district includes the courthouse, said in a statement on X that the woman - whom he identified as Monica - and her two young children ""fled to my office for safety after she was assaulted.""

He called on Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to ""take appropriate disciplinary action and implement measures to prevent this from happening again."" ICE falls under DHS.

Brad Lander, the city comptroller and frequent ICE critic who has previously been arrested for trying to prevent the agency from arresting migrants, said on X he was at the plaza when the incident took place.

""An ICE agent violently threw this bereft woman to the ground in front of her kids,"" he wrote. ""She had not touched him. She did not pose any threat. She had to be taken to the hospital.""

CNN has reached out to DHS, Goldman and Lander.

The masked ICE agents did not identify themselves, did not present a warrant and did not give any lawful grounds for detaining the man, Lander said.

""Regardless of motive or targets, we must condemn political violence,"" he wrote. ""But let's be clear: every day, masked ICE agents are acting violently against our neighbors, illegally abducting them, holding them in cruel and inhumane conditions. Treating them as less-than-human, and not deserving due process.""

The Democratic nominee for New York mayor, Zohran Mamdani, called the incident ""sickening"" in a post on social media.

The woman, speaking to reporters after the interaction, said: ""Over (in Ecuador), they beat us there too. I didn't think I'd come here to the United States and the same thing would happen to me.""

Third, the challenged executive orders violate the separation of powers by usurping Congress’s authority over spending and appropriations.
The Fourth Circuit should reject President Trump’s attempt to seize Congress’s power of the purse.","This case is about whether our Constitution, which grants the power of the purse to the people’s representatives in Congress, allows the President to unilaterally impose conditions on federal funding not found in any law. The answer is no.

Yet shortly after taking office, President Trump issued an executive order commanding federal agencies to “immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end” gender-affirming medical care for people under the age of nineteen. That order built upon another, which proclaimed that “[f]ederal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.” Together, these orders resulted in a sudden and devastating shutdown of medically necessary care for children and teenagers across the country experiencing gender dysphoria.

Advocates for LGBTQ families, health care professionals, and parents of young people receiving gender-affirming care challenged the administration’s actions in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, which granted a preliminary injunction blocking the unlawful conditions. The government appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In September 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in the Fourth Circuit in support of the plaintiffs. Our brief made three principal points.

First, the Framers gave Congress control of appropriations and spending to guard against the risk of a tyrannical president. They took pains to deny the President the sweeping powers that the King of England had historically enjoyed, such as the power to spend without Parliament’s approval. By the time of the Constitutional Convention, there was a clear consensus that the legislative branch would have the power of the purse. In the Taxing and Spending Clause, the Framers granted Congress the affirmative power to raise revenue and to spend funds, while the Appropriations Clause limits the executive, stating that “[n]o Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” The text of the Constitution is clear that the executive branch cannot make an end-run around the legislative process, including in the realm of spending and appropriations.

Second, for hundreds of years, Congress has passed federal legislation guarding its control of the purse. Since the earliest days of the Republic, when the Tenth Congress passed the Purpose Statue requiring appropriations to be “solely applied to the objects for which they are respectively appropriated,” Congress has made clear that the President cannot disobey its spending decisions. The Anti-Deficiency Act reiterates that the executive branch cannot make spending decisions outside of what is authorized by law. And after President Richard Nixon unlawfully refused to spend billions of dollars in federal appropriations, Congress passed the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA) to create special procedures the President must follow to seek congressional approval for delays or cancellations of federal funding. Recently, in response to the first Trump administration’s efforts to withhold foreign aid, Congress strengthened the ICA with new transparency requirements.

Third, the challenged executive orders violate the separation of powers by usurping Congress’s authority over spending and appropriations. Though Congress has the exclusive power to attach conditions to federal funding, it may delegate that authority to the executive branch through a statute. In this case, however, there is no statutory delegation, so the executive orders are lawful only if authorized by the Constitution itself. And, as discussed above, the Constitution requires that appropriations be “made by Law,” which is to say, through the constitutionally prescribe process of bicameralism and presentment. The President may not use an executive order to make an end-run around that process. To the contrary, the Constitution requires that the President “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” even when he disagrees with those laws or thinks they should say something that they simply do not say.

Protestors moved to 25th Avenue, where they are trying to block federal vehicles from entering and leaving the facility. That's already led to some pretty tense moments.

Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) accused the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement of stonewalling lawful congressional oversight at the new Camp East Montana detention center on Fort Bliss, raising alarms about what she called “illegal” obstruction and dangerous conditions inside the still-unfinished facility.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

In a sharply worded letter Friday to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, Escobar said her staff’s September 23 inspection visit was abruptly canceled—less than 24 hours after being confirmed—under the vague justification of “operational tempos.” She warned that the move violates Section 527 of federal law, which guarantees members of Congress access to detention facilities for oversight.

“This is an unacceptable response from an agency that is currently in violation of the law and illegally barring Members of Congress and their staff from their oversight duties,” Escobar wrote.

The El Paso congresswoman, who has been a leading critic of Trump administration detention policies, detailed a pattern of ICE obstruction since Camp East Montana opened in August. Initial tour requests were denied on alleged safety grounds, even as migrants were already being held on-site. During visits that did take place in August, Escobar and her staff reported rotting food, foul drinking water, insufficient medical care, and broken communication systems.

Her account matches a Washington Post investigation earlier this month documenting at least 60 federal standards violations, including detainees without access to functioning toilets, sinks, or adequate space, and staff failing to monitor medical conditions.

Escobar’s office says it has 21 unanswered case inquiries with ICE about detainees at the facility and has yet to receive responses to formal questions submitted on September 3. Among them: staffing levels as the camp scales to 5,000 beds, details of food vendors, water safety testing, and why detainees’ legal calls routinely go unanswered.

The congresswoman has set deadline of October 3 for DHS and ICE to respond.

The Biden administration’s Camp East Montana, described by advocates as “Alligator Alcatraz in the desert,” has quickly become a flashpoint in the immigration wars. For Escobar, who represents El Paso, the issue is personal:

“My staff and I observed serious issues… detainees told us about being served rotten food and raised urgent concerns over the quality of the drinking water, which they reported had a bad smell and made them feel sick,” she wrote.

With construction still ongoing, detainees remain inside a facility federal watchdogs and lawmakers alike are calling unsafe, opaque, and unlawfully shielded from scrutiny.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1G9r!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa8553417-70aa-4b0e-a984-ecb9bc82b645_780x449.webp",N,,2025-09-26 13:56:34.057117

Broadview ICE protest

What we know:

The protests began around 7 a.m. at two locations near the facility, including Beech Street and 25th Avenue. Some demonstrators surrounded an ICE vehicle as it tried to reach the building, prompting agents to deploy pepper spray and bring in a military-style vehicle.

At least 50 protesters were seen midday Friday at the facility. An ICE spokesperson told Fox News that two were arrested, one of whom was carrying a firearm.

Parts of 25th Avenue were temporarily locked down as gas lingered in the air and officials prevented access to the area.

Bushra Amiwala, a congressional candidate who joined the protest, said she was struck by pepper pellets while attaching signs to a security fence.

""The residue that comes up makes it incredibly difficult to breathe,"" Amiwala said. ""There was nothing provoked on our side. The three of us were literally signing on the fence and we were the direct targets of the shooting.""

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, who was also present, said agents fired without warning.

""We were standing here with a group of people literally doing nothing,"" Biss said. "" There was no disturbance. There was no chaos. There was no effort to move a car in or out. They just shot at us as though for sport. They are trying to dominate and intimidate, and we are not going to be intimidated.""

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson has warned that use of the facility could last 45 days and might disrupt nearby businesses and emergency routes.

Dig deeper:

One of those being held at Broadview ICE facility is Laura Murillo. She was detained Thursday morning near a BP gas station at 47th Street and Western Avenue in the city's Back of the Yards neighborhood, according to her fiancé, Jaime Perez.

Murillo is originally from Tamaulipas, Mexico but has lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, Perez explained.

He shared that Murillo often sells tamales on that corner, but on Thursday, he received a frantic call from her at 7:32 a.m.

""She was being detained and there was somebody behind her,"" Perez said. ""I told her to hold on, that I was going to come to her, I’m only a few blocks away but traffic was so bad and all I kept hearing her saying was, ‘You’re hurting me, you’re hurting me.’""

Perez told FOX 32 that Murillo does not have a criminal record. Since her arrest, he learned she is being held at ICE’s processing facility in Broadview.

""She's a single mother and she just is out there trying to make a living,"" Perez said.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/snapshot-18.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-26 14:57:13.960929

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hey.
INSKEEP: NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt.","STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We are four days away from a government shutdown.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

And a memo from the White House promises to punish federal workers if that happens. The Trump administration is threatening large-scale layoffs if Democrats don't provide the necessary votes to avoid a shutdown. We don't know exactly which jobs would be targeted or how many federal workers could lose their jobs, but the deadline to come up with a solution is fast approaching.

INSKEEP: And NPR congressional correspondent Barbara Sprunt will be covering whatever happens. Barbara, good morning.

BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Steve.

INSKEEP: OK. So this is kind of a departure from the normal shutdown scenario where the government says, we're going to increase the pain. What prompted this?

SPRUNT: Well, there's a line in the memo that I think is telling here, essentially saying, we're hopeful that Democrats in Congress don't trigger a shutdown, and then this won't be necessary. So I think this is partly aimed at making any funding lapse as difficult as possible for Democrats.

INSKEEP: Got it.

SPRUNT: Normally in a shutdown, you know, agencies furlough federal workers temporarily until a deal is brokered and a stopgap funding bill is passed. This is next-level. It's instructing agencies to look for workers to fire permanently, people whose work is not consistent with the president's priorities.

INSKEEP: How are Democrats responding?

SPRUNT: Well, they view it as an intimidation tactic to get them to accept the continuing resolution that House Republicans passed that would fund the government through November 21. I spoke with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, about this yesterday. Here's what he had to say.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is nothing less than Mafia-style blackmail. Essentially, the president is threatening to fire dedicated federal employees who have nothing to do with the ongoing political and policy dispute.

SPRUNT: Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer says that if these firings do go forward, he suspects they'll eventually be overturned in court.

INSKEEP: Although we've learned when the president fires someone, even if a court finds illegality, it's difficult to reverse the firing, so we'll see. Is anybody talking about getting a deal out of this?

SPRUNT: Well, top congressional Democrats were supposed to meet with President Trump yesterday at the White House, but the president canceled that meeting, saying it would be pointless to meet because Democrats, in his view, are making unreasonable demands.

INSKEEP: Which are what?

SPRUNT: Well, Democrats want to roll back some Medicaid changes that were part of the big tax and spending bill that the president signed earlier this summer, and they want to extend tax credits from the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries has said a verbal agreement that comes in any sort of negotiation isn't enough. Democrats want to address these issues in written legislation. Here he is yesterday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAKEEM JEFFRIES: We're able to sit down any time, any place with anyone, not hard to find. I'm here in the Capitol, willing to go to the White House at any time in order to have that conversation.

SPRUNT: But, you know, Steve, yes, this is about the shutdown. It's a very real possibility, and it would have very real consequences for people who rely on certain services and workers who might find themselves without a job permanently. But this is also about an ongoing conflict between the White House and Democrats in Congress who feel the administration has continued to overreach in its authority and diminish the legislative branch's power of the purse. So yes, this memo is unprecedented, but it also very much follows the administration's philosophy that we've seen play out again and again this year.

INSKEEP: Well, Barbara, I hope you're ready for a busy few days here.

SPRUNT: Looking forward to it. Thanks, Steve.

Even before the new fees, only a limited number of employers would hire student visa holders.","An astronomical hike on visa fees for highly-skilled workers will impact an important industry in Florida: higher education.

When Donald Trump announced last week that applying for an H-1B visa would now cost $100,000, much of the focus was on the tech industry, which heavily relies on this category of foreign workers.

But federal data shows that in Florida, universities, colleges and schools in the state employ thousands of workers on H-1B visas. That includes professors, researchers and staff.

A Miami Herald analysis of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data found that in the last five years, Florida universities and schools have had 2,589 workers with H-1B visas in the educational services category.

One-quarter of them are from the University of Florida, and 13 percent are University of Miami employees. Other top sponsors include Florida State University (236), Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (217); University of South Florida (207); and Florida International University (111).

That tally excludes renewals, job changes, petitions involving multiple employers and other circumstances. When those categories are factored in, the number of approvals for H-1B visas in the educational services category in Florida jumps to 4,709 in the same time period.

“Universities will most certainly take a hit from this policy change,” said Bruce Baker, a University of Miami professor who studies education policy and funding.

One international student enrolled at FIU from India who studies business analytics, said the fee increase will likely prevent him from working in the United States after graduation. He’s on a student visa right now, but like many other foreign-born students, he hopes to explore work opportunities here after graduation. Even before the new fees, only a limited number of employers would hire student visa holders. The new application costs are another hurdle amid an already challenging job market.

“It’s ten times the price, it’s absolutely mind-blowing,” said the third-year student. The visas have historically cost between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees paid to the U.S. government. In addition, companies often have to pay lawyers to process the applications.

Many international students who come to the United States to study count on transitioning from their student visa and Optional Practical Training (OPT) to an H-1B visa status. Critics of the fee increase say that this change could deter international students from enrolling in universities in the United States if their plans included seeking employment here after graduation.

The student told the Miami Herald the fee increase is already discouraging foreign students from making plans to stay in the U.S. He has two friends, one from Pakistan and the other from India, who left the United States for their home countries. “They just couldn’t take it,” he said of the constantly changing laws and rhetoric around immigration. He said he believes this change will devastate universities.

The University of Florida, Florida International University, and the University of Miami did not respond to Miami Herald requests for comments about how the new visa application fees could impact their staffing, hiring or international student enrollment.

Several middle and high schools in South Florida, including in Aventura, Hialeah and Miami, also have H-1B holders among their employees.

White House points to ‘systemic abuse of the program’

During a press conference last week, Trump said this change will provide an incentive to companies to hire American workers.

But the original intention of the H-1B visa category, which Congress created during President George H.W Bush’s administration, was to address worker shortages by bringing in highly-skilled foreign workers. To qualify, the applicant must generally hold a bachelor’s degree or higher and perform a job that requires specialized knowledge. There are also separate H-1B categories for Department of Defense workers and for models, which requires the person to be “of prominence” in the fashion world, according to USCIS. First Lady Melania Trump, a former model, was an H-1B worker in the late ‘90s.

Under the law, only 65,000 new visas are awarded every year. Another 20,000 visas are awarded to people with master’s degrees or higher in the U.S. under a special exemption. And H-1B workers who are petitioned for or employed at an institution of higher learning or nonprofits or governmental entities involved in research are not subject to this cap.

Trump acknowledged that there are instances where companies do need specific skilled international labor. In those instances, he said, the company should pay the higher fee to bring them in. The executive order became active on Sept. 21, and does not apply to people with previously issued H-1B visas or petitions submitted prior to that date.

The Department of Labor is also opening investigations into companies the agency says are abusing the system.

“The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security,” reads a proclamation from the White House.

“Stop the nonsense of letting people just come into this country on these visas that were given away for free,” said Howard Lutnick, United States Secretary of Commerce, at the press conference.

Homeland Security is also proposing a change so the lottery to select H-1B visa holders favors applicants who earn higher wages.

Juan Gomez, law professor and director of the Carlos A. Costa Immigration Human Rights Clinic at FIU, called President Trump’s move self-destructive for the country.

“They didn’t go through Congress, they just basically erased it without legislating,” he said.

But some immigrants rights groups recognize that H-1B visas have been problematic in many ways. Rene Gomez, the civic engagement coordinator with the Farmworkers Association of Florida, said many workers who receive H-1B visas are mistreated by their employers through harassment, wage theft, and safety concerns, which are difficult to report because of their immigration status.

“The focus and priority should be on fixing the broken system we have now,” said Rene Gomez.",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/lydqze/picture303773346/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_6DAV_FIU_DUNN,N,,2025-09-26 12:58:00.333938

One case involves a 73-year-old widow deported after decades in the US.

The other concerns a murder accused denied permission to leave India for medical care abroad.

These stories are reminders of how immigration and justice systems across borders can impact lives caught between legal rigidity and humanitarian concerns.

Harjit Kaur’s story began in 1991. She reportedly arrived in the US as a single mother. She worked as a seamstress in an Indian saree store, paid taxes, and volunteered at gurdwaras.

She applied for asylum, an effort that was eventually rejected. Kaur continued to live in the US, attending regular ICE check-ins. She renewed her work permits each year while awaiting travel documents from the Indian consulate. Her lawyer, Deepak Ahluwalia, told a media house that a removal order had been issued in 2005. Her final asylum appeal was rejected in 2012.

Not allowed to say good-bye

She had a clean record and longstanding community ties. Naturally, her detention on September 8 came as a shock.

Kaur was arrested during what she thought was a routine check-in at the San Francisco ICE office.

Her family revealed she was transferred between detention centers in Fresno and Bakersfield. Not just that, she was held in bare concrete cells. She was reportedly even denied consistent access to prescribed medication for her high blood pressure and diabetes.

She was not even allowed to say goodbye to her family or collect her belongings, said Ahluwalia in an Instagram post, describing the deportation as “inhumane”.

Kaur was flown from Bakersfield to Los Angeles, and then via a chartered ICE flight to Georgia, Armenia, and finally to Delhi, arriving at Indira Gandhi International Airport on September 23. “We had just two demands: first, to send her back on a commercial flight, and second, to let her meet her family for a few hours. But they refused to listen,” the lawyer told media houses.

Beyond unacceptable

The Sikh Coalition, a US-based rights group, called ICE’s actions “beyond unacceptable”, especially given Kaur’s age and medical condition.

While many protested in California with placards reading “Hands off our grandma” and “Harjit Kaur belongs here”, ICE stuck to its stand.

Kaur has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and LOST each time. Now that she has exhausted all legal remedies, ICE is enforcing US law and the orders by the judge; she will not waste any more US tax dollars, it told the BBC.

Kaur’s deportation is part of a broader wave under President Donald Trump’s second term, which began in January 2025.

Reports, citing data by the Ministry of External Affairs, revealed that at least 1,703 Indian nationals had been deported by late July, over 90 per cent from just five states: Punjab (620), Haryana (604), Gujarat (245), Uttar Pradesh (38), and Goa (26).

A February 5 flight with 104 shackled deportees to Amritsar drew widespread outrage, followed by another similar flight that same month.

We turn to another page.

Dargahwala’s worsening condition

Meanwhile, in Gujarat, the High Court denied Jafar Dargahwala’s plea to travel to the US for cancer treatment. A US citizen for over four decades, Dargahwala faces charges of murder and criminal conspiracy in a 2022 dispute over ancestral property in Navsari. Though he was granted regular bail on health grounds in March 2024, the court restricted his movement to Gujarat and medical visits to Mumbai, requiring him to surrender his passport.

According to reports, in a fresh application, Dargahwala claimed that his condition had worsened. He had spent over Rs 20 lakh on treatment, suffered a cardiac arrest and a paralytic stroke, and was now bedridden.

Arguing that he needed to be with his family in the US for better care, he requested a six-month relaxation in bail conditions.

His lawyer noted that his absence wouldn’t delay trial proceedings, as he had not been attending hearings recently due to poor health. The complainant’s counsel, however, opposed the plea, calling the case a “supari killing” and warning that Dargahwala might abscond permanently if allowed to leave. The prosecution highlighted that 61 extradition requests from India to the US were still pending.

Rejecting the plea, Justice DA Joshi has said that medical facilities are available in India and the applicant can easily avail of the same.

Kaur’s deportation has sparked protests. Dargahwala’s medical plea drew legal scrutiny. Both cases reflect the frictions at the intersection of health, justice, and migration policy.

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

Though still very low, Border Patrol apprehensions increased 38 percent in August: Border Patrol’s apprehensions of undocumented migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border increased 38 percent from July to August, the first increase in four months, although apprehensions remain near 60-year lows. The increased number of family and child arrivals to south Texas appears to account for much of the growth.

”Mass deportation” and human rights: CNN documented a new family separation crisis as ICE is not giving some parents enough time to make arrangements for their U.S. citizen children before deportation. ICE’s version of what happened during a fatal shooting in Chicago came under tight scrutiny. The number of people who have died in ICE detention this year appears to have grown to 16.

In the Courts: Throughout the federal courts, legal challenges are proliferating against the administration’s early-July policy of denying bond to nearly every undocumented immigrant in the United States who arrived illegally, which is mandating a growing number of detentions of people who have been living in the United States and pursuing immigration cases for years.

THE FULL UPDATE:

Though still very low, Border Patrol apprehensions increased 38 percent in August

Migration

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published data about its encounters with migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in August, with a release issued late on Friday, September 19.

The number of people apprehended by Border Patrol last month remained near its lowest monthly level in about 60 years, due to a near-total ban on asylum access and a growing climate of fear among migrants in the U.S. interior. Still, apprehensions increased for the first time since April.

Border Patrol apprehended 6,321 migrants between ports of entry (official border crossings) at the U.S.-Mexico border in August, or 204 per day, up from 4,596 (148 per day) in July and 6,068 (202 per day) in June, but down sharply from 58,009 (1,871 per day) in August 2024.

Data table

Seventy percent of Border Patrol’s apprehended migrants in August were citizens of Mexico, similar to the percentage in July (67 percent). That is far greater than the 35 percent share of the apprehended migrant population that has come from Mexico since fiscal 2020. As in July, 87 percent of Border Patrol’s August apprehensions were of citizens of Mexico or northern Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador), much more than those nations’ 61 percent share since fiscal 2020.

Of nationalities over 50 in either month, Border Patrol reported increases in apprehensions of nearly all from July to August:

Colombia 44—>102, 132%

Cuba 50—>99, 98%

Nicaragua 33—>53, 61%

Honduras 301—>440, 46%

Mexico 3,071—>4,431, 44%

El Salvador 97—>120, 24%

Venezuela 149—>182, 22%

Other Countries 148—>165, 11%

Ecuador 71—>72, 1%

Guatemala 508—>500 -2%

The reason for the increase is not clear. However, the New York Post, citing a “Homeland Security source” in late August, raised the possibility of recently deported people “trying to sneak back into the United States.”

CBP’s statement noted that Border Patrol did not release a single asylum seeker or other migrant into the U.S. interior with parole or a notice to appear in August. There have been no such Border Patrol releases since April. All apprehended migrants were detained, deported, or, in the case of unaccompanied minors, sent to the Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement.

Border Patrol’s apprehensions of family unit members and unaccompanied minors increased 48 percent from July to August, faster than the rate of increase for single adults (35 percent). Still, family and unaccompanied minor apprehensions (1,139) accounted for only 18 percent of August’s total, similar to the 17 percent in July (769). Eighty-four percent of families and unaccompanied children entering Border Patrol custody in August were from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador, up from 58 percent since fiscal 2020.

Overall, CBP—which combines Border Patrol agents operating between ports of entry and Field Operations officers operating at the ports of entry—took 9,740 people into custody in August, up from 7,824 in July and 9,302 in June, and down sharply from 107,473 in August 2024. The August 2024 figure had included 45,500 people with CBP One appointments at ports of entry—a program that no longer exists.

Data table

Migrants encountered at the ports of entry remained few in August, as the Trump administration stopped using the CBP One smartphone app to help asylum seekers make appointments. CBP’s port of entry encounters totaled 3,419 people or 110 per day in August, up 6 percent from 3,228 in July, which was almost identical to 3,234 in June. Ninety-four percent of migrants encountered at ports of entry in August were citizens of Mexico, similar to 94 percent in July and 92 percent in June.

Of the nine geographic sectors into which Border Patrol divides the border, the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas displaced El Paso, which had been the number-one sector for the previous six months (since the Trump administration took office). The Rio Grande Valley sector’s August apprehensions (1,363) increased by 43 percent from July and made up 22 percent of August’s border-wide total. El Paso (Texas-New Mexico, 1,305) was second, followed by Tucson (Arizona, 1,068) and Laredo (Texas, 742). Laredo, which is adjacent to the Rio Grande Valley and typically one of the least busy sectors, also saw a 43 percent increase from July to August.

”Mass deportation” and human rights

Family separations

A multi-author investigation from CNN found over 100 cases of U.S. citizen children, “from newborns to teenagers, who have been left stranded without their parents,” whom Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported without giving them adequate time to make arrangements for their kids’ care.

ICE’s “Detained Parents Directive,” revised on July 2 with weaker protections for undocumented parents, calls for agents to give parents time to make arrangements for U.S. citizen children if they choose not to be deported with them. “Yet, some detained parents have alleged they were not given such accommodations,” CNN found.

This echoes allegations that WOLA and Women’s Refugee Commission (WRC) heard repeatedly in interviews with people who receive deported migrants in Honduras and Guatemala in late July. “This is the new family separation crisis,” Zain Lakhani of WRC told CNN. (We discuss these separations with Lakhani in an August episode of WOLA’s Podcast.)

The report includes accounts of children being abruptly left with teenage siblings, acquaintances, or even strangers who are now grappling with how to care for them. CNN reporters found many of the families through GoFundMe pages for the children’s new guardians.

An ICE spokesperson said: “CNN is trying to obscure the fact that each of the illegal alien parents they are defending willingly chose to break our nation’s criminal and administrative laws and as a result of those choices, are responsible for what happens to their children—just as any U.S. citizen parent who breaks the law is when they are taken to jail.”

Chicago

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues sending ICE and other agencies’ agents to pursue undocumented immigrants in Chicago, a surge of personnel, sweeps, and raids that it is calling “Operation Midway Blitz.” Over its first two weeks, ICE claimed that it had arrested nearly 550 people with “no end date in sight.”

More surveillance and body camera footage, among other details, have become available about the fatal September 12 ICE shooting of an undocumented Mexican man in a Chicago suburb. These have called into question ICE’s initial account that an agent used lethal force in self-defense when firing his weapon at the vehicle of Silverio Villegas González, age 38, who allegedly dragged an agent “a significant distance” with his car as he sought to flee the scene.

Villegas died of gunshot wounds in Franklin Park, shortly after dropping his two children off at school and day care. The New York Times posted a detailed analysis of footage from the incident, showing Villegas pulling his sedan into reverse, not driving at two agents standing on either side of the vehicle. One agent escalated quickly, pulling out his gun. One of the agents suffered a wound while off-camera. Footage showed him with a scraped knee and torn jeans. Both agents can be heard in radio communications saying the wound was “nothing major.”

The Chicago Sun-Times was unable to determine which agency—local police, the FBI, or perhaps another—might be leading the investigation into the incident.

ICE considered temporarily shutting its facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, the site of intense protests, but decided to keep it open. Many citizen videos from the protests showed agents freely using tear gas and pepper-spray bullets, and slamming demonstrators to the ground to clear the way for vehicles. One woman caught on camera being thrown to the ground was a local Democratic congressional candidate with a large social media following.

Rosalio Pelayo Salgado, a father detained at Broadview since ICE arrested him at his home on September 10, told his daughters that he is “being held in a room with at least 150 other men as ICE officers constantly yell at them and call them slurs. He also told his daughters detainees are only given food and water based on good behavior,” the Chicago Sun-Times reported. “They’ve refused to give him his anxiety medication and said they threw his glasses away, so he can’t see.”

Deaths in ICE detention

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old DACA recipient, died on September 21 at the Adelanto Processing Center, an ICE detention facility run by the GEO Group in California. “The Adelanto facility has been the subject of ongoing complaints from detainees, attorneys, and inspectors regarding medical care, segregation practices, and mental health services,” recalled Austin Kocher at his newsletter.

Ayala-Uribe, Kocher said, was the 14th person to die in ICE custody since the Trump administration began. On September 23, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) announced two more deaths, increasing the total to 16.

Pregnant women in detention

In a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, 29 Senate Democrats requested information, with a September 26 deadline, about the mistreatment of pregnant women in ICE detention facilities. The letter cited reporting on 911 calls from pregnant detained women in “distress, bleeding or suffering severe pain,” and a recent Senate Judiciary Committee staff visit that found 14 pregnant women detained at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center, “a shockingly large number…with many of them receiving little to no medical care.”

Abuse of migrants who can’t be deported to their home countries

A Mother Jones investigation by Tanvi Misra revealed a growing number of cases of migrants whom ICE will not release from custody, or whom DHS seeks to deport to third countries, even after immigration courts grant them protection from deportation to their countries of origin. “ICE officers are no longer using their discretion, but just applying this blanket policy of, ‘We’re just not going to release you at all unless, basically, a court tells us that we have to,’” said attorney Evan Benz of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights.

Detention of crime victims

Among those caught up in the “mass deportation” campaign are immigrants who were victims of crime; ICE has been detaining and deporting them more often, after rescinding a policy that shielded them from detention and removal. The change, the Associated Press reported, may affect “thousands of immigrants who would likely never have been arrested by ICE under other administrations, let alone held without a chance to post bond.”

Detainees missing in Florida

Florida’s state government is now operating two very large detention facilities for migrants, and well over a thousand did not appear in ICE’s locator system as of September 18. In many cases, loved ones and attorneys have no way to find them, Reason and the Miami Herald reported.

New York arrests

In downtown Manhattan, 11 local elected officials were among dozens of activists and religious leaders arrested after carrying out a non-violent direct action. They were demanding access to observe conditions in a short-term ICE holding facility on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza, which has become notorious for prolonged stays and miserable conditions. Those arrested included Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, who was also arrested there in June.

On September 25, video showed a federal agent violently pushing an Ecuadorian woman to the floor of the hallway of the immigration courthouse at 26 Federal Plaza, as she and her daughter clung to her husband, whom the agents were detaining.

Immigration judges

The Trump administration has fired nearly 20 immigration judges so far in September, adding to the over 80 judges already cut this year, NPR’s Ximena Bustillo reported. More than 125 judges have quit or been fired since the beginning of 2025; as of September 30, 2024, there had been a total of 735. As of June 30, that corps of immigration judges had a backlog of 3,797,662 cases to consider.

Racial profiling

Naturalized citizens in the United States are now carrying their passports during their daily routines as a shield against ICE’s tactics and racial profiling, even though they have full legal status in the United States, Ruben Castañeda reported at Palabra. The fear of being targeted by ICE agents has led to concerns about belonging and safety. “ICE agents are acting with a lot of hate. They don’t care if you show them a passport; they don’t want to see it,” said “Claudia,” a Chilean-American woman in the Washington, DC area. “They’re using violence against people walking on the street or driving in their cars.”

Terrorism charges

Now that the Trump administration has added several Mexican and Latin American organized crime groups to the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations, migrants who pay Mexican smugglers to enter the United States could end up being charged with aiding terrorism. “If people are paying these criminal organizations, you could say they are lending financial support to these terrorist groups,” CBP official Robert Dominguez told a virtual news conference covered by Border Report.

ICE masking in California

California passed a law, the “No Secret Police Act,” banning law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from concealing their faces while on duty. It would take effect on January 1. “California officials and immigrant-rights advocates say the law is aimed at restoring transparency after months of viral videos showing masked teams detaining residents during Los Angeles operations—images that [California Governor Gavin] Newsom (D) likened to ‘a dystopian sci-fi movie,’” noted Migrant Insider. “The State of California has no jurisdiction over the federal government,” tweeted the Trump-appointed acting U.S. attorney for California’s Central District.

Strawberry delivery driver

Brittny Mejía of the Los Angeles Times narrated what happened to Angel Minguela Palacios, who was detained while delivering strawberries in downtown Los Angeles on August 14 near the site where Border Patrol agents were putting on a show of force outside a news conference with Gov. Newsom. The 48-year-old father, who fled Mexico 10 years ago, spent six weeks in an Arizona ICE facility before a judge ordered him released on bond. Before that, immediately following his arrest, Minguela had spent six days in an ICE temporary processing center called “B 18,” where conditions appeared intentionally made severe to convince those held there to self-deport.

ICE recruitment and office space

Helen Li of the Intercept visited a DHS Career Expo in Provo, Utah, to explore the question of “who wants to join ICE.” Those who showed up to apply for jobs at ICE, CBP, and elsewhere “ran the gamut from college students seeking debt relief to those parroting white nationalist talking points.”

The U.S. government’s General Services Administration is “scrambling” to find office space for the rapidly growing ICE presence around the United States, forming an internal “ICE Surge” team to seek office space in 19 cities, according to NPR.

Worksite raids

ICE is shifting its focus to target undocumented people at job sites, to round up large numbers of individuals at once, like a controversial recent raid of a Hyundai plant in Georgia where ICE arrested 300 people from South Korea. An official told Anna Giaritelli at the Washington Examiner that the administration considers this a new phase, following operations focused on migrants with criminal records and those targeting cities.

In the Courts

Denying bond for people with active immigration cases

At Politico, Kyle Cheney and Myah Ward reported on federal judges’ overwhelming rejections of a Trump administration policy, launched on July 8, that allows indiscriminate detention of undocumented immigrants with active immigration court cases, regardless of how long they have lived in the United States or their lack of criminal history.

The policy seeks to reinterpret the law to mandate detention (deny bond) for undocumented immigrants who entered the United States improperly, by reclassifying them as “applicants for admission.” The measure threatens the freedom of millions of asylum seekers who crossed the border between ports of entry and turned themselves in to Border Patrol agents, and have since been living and working in the United States while their cases proceed.

The Justice Department immigration court system’s Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which now has a supermajority of Trump-appointed judges, upheld the policy earlier this month.

Some are now kept in detention even after immigration judges grant their release, using an infrequently employed mechanism called an “automatic stay.”

This has led immigrants’ lawyers to recur to the federal court system. “Their lawsuits have led to dozens of recent rulings from gobsmacked judges who say the administration has violated the law and due process rights and is threatening to do so for millions more,” Cheney and Ward wrote (the hyperlinks in the quote are theirs). They added, “Immigrant advocates say the goal is clear: make the process so excruciating that people give up and accept deportation—even if they have meritorious asylum claims or pathways to legal status.”

Four ACLU offices, the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, and two law firms filed a class-action lawsuit in Massachusetts federal court to challenge the policy. The suit calls the denial of bond hearings “a violation of statutory and constitutional rights, upending decades of settled law and established practice in immigration proceedings.”

TPS for Venezuelan citizens

The Trump administration’s solicitor-general asked the Supreme Court on September 19 to reinforce its May “shadow docket” decision allowing the administration to proceed with canceling Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for about 300,000 citizens of Venezuela in the United States. That decision had lifted a stay imposed by Judge, Edward Chen of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. In early September, Judge Chen again put a hold on the TPS cancellation: “He said he was not bound by the Supreme Court’s order in May, noting that it ‘did not provide any specific analysis,’” the New York Times explained.

Sharp cracks of gunfire pierced the morning air, loud, jarring pangs that echoed off the concrete. Inside the building, officials shouted warnings: a sniper was firing.

From the rooftop of a nearby building, the gunman, later identified as Joshua Jahn, was unleashing bullets, targeting the facility.

The shooting began at about 6:30 a.m. and bullets “sprayed the length of the building, the windows and law enforcement vans that were in the sally port area,” of the ICE facility, Nancy Larson, acting US attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said. Sally ports are controlled entry points commonly found in prisons and on military bases.

“It was a very traumatic moment for everyone there,” a Venezuelan woman, who CNN is not identifying due to safety concerns, said. Gripped by terror, she braced for the worst.

“Honestly, a lot of things go through your mind. I can’t even explain … Who would imagine something like that would happen in such a guarded, protected facility?”

With one detainee dead and two others seriously injured, according to Larson, fear has infiltrated the immigrant community. Many are now returning to the facility with anxious hearts, desperate to do the right thing but haunted by what happened.

Still, fear of deportation outweighs the fear of bullets for many.

Eugenio Uscategui, who has been in the US for nearly four years and is also from Venezuela, arrived at the building after the shooting and was told he would have to come back the next day.

He was scared, but still came back, he said, “out of fear of being deported.” He doesn’t want to risk missing a step in his immigration process.

“There’s uncertainty because you never know if there’s another shooter nearby or if something could happen. Honestly, the city feels very dangerous today,” he said.

Blanca Jimenez, an immigrant from Mexico, was inside the facility when the shooting began. The gunshots were deafening, “like bombs,” she said.

Still, she returned the next day, fear in her chest but resignation in her steps.

“I am afraid, yes,” she says. “But I had to come.”

Immigration appointments end in fear, not answers

Shane Reynolds was sitting on a bench outside the Dallas ICE facility, waiting for a friend’s immigration appointment, when the sound of gunfire shattered the morning.

As people around him ran for cover, Reynolds stayed frozen, unsure where the bullets were coming from.

“Running out into the open parking lot just seemed like a bad idea,” Reynolds told CNN. “I said a prayer. I looked around to try to assess our options, which there weren’t a whole lot.”

He tried to hide, crouching behind a nearby chain link fence as shots continued to ring out; at least six, maybe ten, he recalled.

Denises Robleto was also outside the facility when the shooting began. She was on a video call with her sister, waiting in the car while her mother attended an appointment.

As gunfire erupted, her sister begged her to stay inside the vehicle, but Robleto stepped out, trying to understand what was happening. She heard screaming from the facility.

Reynolds said he couldn’t communicate with others nearby during the shooting because they didn’t speak English. But their calm demeanor helped him stay grounded, even as the chaos unfolded.

After a brief lull, he heard a smaller pop noise, which he believes was the sound of the gunman taking his own life.

The shooter, Jahn, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was from Fairview, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, Larson said. He was a US citizen.

A woman who was at the facility for her annual appointment when the shooting started, said she doesn’t think it was motivated by anti-immigrant sentiment. “We still don’t know if it was against us. I don’t think it was because … we waited outside for about an hour before the building opened and nothing happened. Everything happened once we were inside,” the woman, who CNN agreed to not identify, said.

Handwritten notes left behind by Jahn indicated “hatred for the federal government” and led investigators to believe he intended to target ICE personnel and property, even though all three victims were detainees.

“The tragic irony for his evil plot here is that it was a detainee who was killed and two other detainees that were injured,” said Larson.

‘This is not a Republican or a Democrat issue, it’s a humanity issue’

Authorities have not released the names of the victims. However, Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed one of the injured detainees is a Mexican national.

While statements from authorities have so far largely focused on the investigation, Dallas-based immigration attorney Jaime Barron, who isn’t representing any of the victims, said the injured and killed detainees should be included in more of the conversation.

“We should focus on the humanity,” Barron told CNN. “These were human beings, and they were killed and severely hurt while being under the protection of the US government.”

Democratic state Rep. Rafael Anchía, who represents Dallas, said his community “stands united against targeted gun violence” following the shooting.

“This is not about politics — every person who values their neighbor must denounce violence in all forms and commit to meaningful action to address the gun violence epidemic,” he said in a post on X.

Barron echoed that sentiment.

“This is not a Republican or a Democrat issue, it’s a humanity issue where innocent people, be it law enforcement or immigrants, are targeted for who they are,” Barron said.

Dallas Mayor Eric L. Johnson called for healing and unity after the shooting.

“We are better than this craven act of violence,” the mayor said in a statement. “In moments like this, our city must stand together and support one another. We must heal.”

He said violence like Wednesday’s shooting should never happen and that it affected an entire community, not just law enforcement and the victims.

“It is an attack on our community and on our nation’s heritage of civil and democratic discourse,“ Johnson said. “We should all condemn violence intended to serve a political agenda and work together to end it.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-25t162644z-2066247173-rc2iygazcru3-rtrmadp-3-usa-shooting-ice.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-26 11:57:49.462556

FBI officials said the gunman fired from a nearby rooftop at vehicles carrying federal agents and detainees.
The gunman also fired multiple shots into the windows of the office building where immigration enforcement employees were working.
The Dallas facility also serves as a processing center for detainees arrested by immigration agents.","The suspected gunman in an attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas said he wanted to inflict ""real terror"" on agents, a federal prosecutor said Thursday.

Handwritten notes retrieved from the home of suspected shooter 29-year-old Joshua Jahn expressed ""hatred for the federal government"" and a desire to give ICE agents a taste of terror, Nancy Larson, acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said on Sept. 25.

The latest details shared by federal investigators are the firmest details yet of what inspired the shooting that left one person dead and two critically injured.

""This, what he did, is the very definition of terrorism,"" Larson said.

The notes described a ""gameplan of the attack"" and a wish to ""terrorize ICE employees and interfere with their work, which he called human trafficking,"" said Larson, adding Jahn also wished to ""minimize any collateral damage or injury to the detainees.""

Instead the attack on Sept. 24 at the Dallas immigration agency field office left a detainee dead and two critically injured. Larson called the result a ""tragic irony for his evil plot."" No law enforcement agents were injured. Authorities say Jahn was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene.

FBI officials said the gunman fired from a nearby rooftop at vehicles carrying federal agents and detainees. The gunman also fired multiple shots into the windows of the office building where immigration enforcement employees were working. The Dallas facility also serves as a processing center for detainees arrested by immigration agents.

The release of information based on the suspected shooter’s writing comes a day after the attack. Initially, the only information regarding what inspired the shooting that authorities shared came from an unspent shell casing located near Jahn’s body. The casing has the phrase ""ANTI-ICE"" written on it, according to FBI Director Kash Patel.

Authorities believe Jahn acted alone. Larson said Jahn claimed full responsibility for the attack, writing ""Yes, it was just me and my brain."" Investigators did not find evidence of ""membership in any specific group or entity.""

Jahn also allegedly wrote ""good luck with the digital footprint,"" which authorities are taking to mean Jahn deleted evidence from his devices, according to Larson.

The attack is the latest shooting to stir a tense national debate over political rhetoric and acts of violence. Two weeks earlier, conservative activist and President Donald Trump ally Charlie Kirk was killed with a single shot during a speaking event at a Utah university.

As a result of the Sept. 24 shooting, ICE facilities are ramping up security, officials said.

Her work permit was renewed annually while ICE officials tried to secure the documents she needed to go to India.
“When she asked to have (food) or even water to take with her medication, she was given a plate of ice,” Ahluwalia said.
And of the 204,297 people detained by ICE in that period, 65% had no convictions at all.","Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old East Bay woman who was detained for 15 days by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after a routine check-in, was deported to her home country of India this week. She had been living and working legally in the United States for more than three decades and had no criminal history.

Kaur, who came to the Bay Area as a single mother in 1991, lived in Hercules, regularly attended the El Sobrante Sikh Gurdwara and worked for two decades as a seamstress at Sari Palace in Berkeley.

Kaur, a grandmother of five, was denied asylum and tried to appeal several times. When her appeal was denied at the federal appeals court, she was willing to self deport but in 13 years was never able to secure travel documents from the Indian Consulate, her family said.

Every roughly six months, Kaur “faithfully” visited the ICE office in San Francisco to check in, her family told Richmondside. Her work permit was renewed annually while ICE officials tried to secure the documents she needed to go to India.

So, on Sept. 8, when she was detained at one of those check-ins, she and her family were shocked, along with the wider community, which held a rally on Sept. 12 in El Sobrante to show their support for her.

On Sept. 9, Kaur was taken to the Mesa Verde Detention Facility in Bakersfield. She was then moved to a detention center in Lumpkin, GA., on Sat., Sept. 20 and ultimately deported without any notice on Monday.

“Around 2 a.m., without notifying the attorney, without any advance notice to anybody, (ICE) took her from Bakersfield, drove her to (Los Angeles) while in handcuffs yet again, and put her on a flight to Georgia,” her Fresno-based attorney Deepak Ahluwalia said in a video he shared on social media.

Ahluwalia said at one point no one knew her location for more than 24 hours. She was able to call her family Sunday.

“I’ve been to Lumpkin, and it’s as remote as remote can be,” Ahluwalia said, referring to Kaur as “Bibiji, a Punjabi term of respect. “And (when) she had called us, she was not able to tell us herself where she actually was.”

East Bay woman, 73, said she wasn’t given toilet paper and slept on floor during ICE detention

What Kaur did share was that she was held in cells without a bed or a chair for hours and made to sleep on the floor. She was refused vegetarian meals in accordance with her religious beliefs (she is Sikh) during the first six days of detention and was only provided with her medicine several days into detention.

“When she asked to have (food) or even water to take with her medication, she was given a plate of ice,” Ahluwalia said. “She explained she had dentures and she couldn’t eat it. The guard told her, ‘That’s your fault.’ ”

Ahluwalia noted that two individuals tried to meet Kaur at the detention center on Sunday when they learned where she was, but ICE denied the visit.

Kaur also wasn’t given access to basic hygiene supplies such as toilet paper and wasn’t allowed to shower. When she was about to board her ICE chartered flight to India on Mondays she was given wet wipes to clean herself, Ahluwalia said.

He said the family was willing to comply with the deportation and had two requests: Kaur be released (with an ankle monitor) for 24 to 48 hours to tie up any loose ends and/or that she be allowed to fly on a commercial plane and be accompanied by a member of her family due to her age and medical conditions.

Her family even purchased a plane ticket to India for her while she was detained in Bakersfield, Ahluwalia said, but those requests went ignored. He said ICE eventually responded to his multiple requests, saying the family could visit her on Tuesday — the day after she was deported.

The attorney also noted that he is filing a complaint regarding the conditions of Kaur’s detention.

“Some might call (what I’m saying to be) ICE bashing. Some might call it, you know, obviously speaking out. But at the end of the day, I’m speaking facts,” Aluwalia said. “I’m telling you, matter of fact, what took place.”

ICE defends deportation of Harjit Kaur, saying she will no longer “waste” tax dollars

In an emailed statement to Richmondside, which misspelled her name and called her an illegal alien, an ICE official said Kaur litigated her case for more than 34 years and was ordered to leave the country an immigration judge in 2005, so “to say her arrest by ICE is somehow unjust or lacking in due process is absurd.”

“(Kaur) has filed multiple appeals all the way up to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and LOST each time,” the statement says. “Now that she has exhausted all legal remedies, ICE is stepping in to enforce the law and orders by the judge; she will not waste any more U.S. tax dollars.”

Ahluwalia pushed back on the notion of Kaur wasting tax dollars.

“This is how a 73-year-old grandmother was treated with no criminal record … she worked, she contributed to the U.S. taxpayer system and didn’t live off social security or any other sort of benefits,” Ahluwalia emphasized. “And everyone can keep saying she had a final order removal and she was asked to leave. Correct — she was asked to leave, and she was complying.”

Kaur’s case drew attention due to her particular circumstance, but she is one of thousands who have been detained by ICE this year alone.

As of the last status update on Sept. 7, the last U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was holding 58,766 individuals in detention facilities, according to TRAC reports. Of those being detained, 70.8% do not have a criminal conviction. Many of those who do were convicted of minor offenses, including traffic violations.

The number of ICE detentions and deportations have skyrocketed since President Donald Trump’s reelection. The president has repeatedly said he wants to crackdown on illegal immigration, focusing on getting rid of criminals, and has increased ICE’s budget — making it the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency.

But data from the Cato Institute found that more than 93% of detainees from the 2025 fiscal year (October 2024 to June 2025) were not convicted of any violent offenses. And of the 204,297 people detained by ICE in that period, 65% had no convictions at all. Most convictions fell into three main categories: immigration, traffic, or nonviolent vice crimes.

Kaur’s granddaughter Sukhmeet Sandhu took to social media this week to thank everyone “from the bottom of my heart for standing with us.” She said her grandmother’s detention was very difficult for the family and her safe deportation was only possible because of the advocacy from the community.

“While we are thankful for her safe return, it’s important to remember the many other innocent individuals who remain detained for months or even years,” Sukhmeet Kaur wrote. “Please continue to raise your voices and fight for them the same way you stood with our grandmother.”",https://richmondside.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/harjitcrop-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 13:57:09.320617

Katie Blankenship, director of SOS, says that authorities are repeating the same “recipe” used at Alligator Alcatraz at Deportation Depot.
“He was transferred to this facility two weeks ago and says he’s almost ready to sign a deportation order.
SOS is aware that at least two of its clients were transferred to Deportation Depot from other detention centers.
Deportation Depot was previously a state prison west of Jacksonville, near the border with neighboring Georgia, which closed five years ago due to staffing shortages.","Less than a month after the start of operations at Deportation Depot, the new immigrant detention center set up in a former men’s prison in Baker County, northern Florida, complaints have started to emerge about the poor conditions and treatment at the facility — very similar to those reported at Alligator Alcatraz, the infamous tented jail west of Miami. Detainees at Deportation Depot (as it was dubbed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis) have complained of limited access to medical care, including emergencies, poor and insufficient food, lack of drinking water, and no privacy to speak with their lawyers, according to testimonies collected by the legal network Sanctuary of the South (SOS).

They have also reported having no mechanisms to file complaints or store legal documents or religious items, that staff threaten them with solitary confinement as retaliation, and that, because there are multiple contractors, it’s unclear who is in charge — raising questions about oversight, due process, and basic standards of care at the facility.

Immigrant detention centers in Florida have been criticized in human rights reports for “dehumanizing” overcrowding and blatant violations of immigration detention standards. Nearly half a dozen people have died in immigration custody in Florida so far this year — half of the total nationwide. The state has sought to position itself at the forefront of the anti-immigrant measures pushed by the Trump administration, which include mass deportations and detention quotas, and leads the nation in the number of agreements with local authorities to detain immigrants.

Katie Blankenship, director of SOS, says that authorities are repeating the same “recipe” used at Alligator Alcatraz at Deportation Depot. “It’s being repeated in the detention centers they’re opening over and over again throughout the country, and you see the same problems.”

Authorities want to detain a “crushing amount of people” because “it’s very profitable, and so they rush to create these detention centers without any thought if, whether they’re actually able, capable, set up to humanely house human beings,” Blankenship charges. “It’s quite literally the same recipe over and over again,” she adds, describing the detention centers as “basically cages with no postal service, no reliable air conditioning, no reliable medical care, no reliable food, or anything like that set up.”

No water, scarce food, and no privacy

A man previously detained at the Krome processing center, southwest of Miami — flagged in a Human Rights Watch report for poor conditions and where at least two people have died in recent months — said Deportation Depot is far worse, according to Alejandra Puerto, an SOS legal assistant who spoke with the detainee by phone. “He was transferred to this facility two weeks ago and says he’s almost ready to sign a deportation order. The conditions are unbearable,” she notes.

Another detainee reported losing 10 pounds (4.5 kilos) in the two weeks he’s been there. Another said he has a restricted diet but has not been provided with appropriate food. The tap water at the facility is undrinkable, and detainees are only allowed to drink from a dispenser.

Puerto has also received complaints that “they’re taken out at 5 a.m. with no jackets or anything to keep warm. They’re forced to walk outside in those conditions and wait to enter the dining hall, with nothing to protect them from the cold, because of overcrowding — since not everyone fits in the cafeteria at the same time.”

There is no place or system to file complaints: “They are not allowed to have pens. They haven’t been able to write their requests or complaints, which is exactly the procedure officials tell them to follow. They’re told, ‘Write your complaints,’ but then they aren’t given pens or paper,” Puerto explains. “In addition, their legal documents are being withheld.”

Images from inside the facility show rooms with long rows of bunk beds, no other furniture, and no place to store personal belongings. One detainee said his only possession is a Bible, which he is forced to place on the floor, Puerto says.

SOS has tried to determine whether detainees can send or receive legal mail, but authorities at the site said they don’t know. Because multiple companies operate on-site — one for laundry, another for the kitchen, three or four security firms, a medical company — “it’s not clear who’s in charge, and no one has any answers. There’s no one person in charge,” Puerto says.

Clients can communicate with their lawyers in conference rooms, where “they are placed in a space with a laptop. But some are cautious because they don’t trust how secure the communication is. They lower their voices when officers pass by,” Puerto adds.

SOS is aware that at least two of its clients were transferred to Deportation Depot from other detention centers. Hundreds of detainees do not appear in the online database of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and these transfers — along with the opacity in record-keeping — have raised alarms about potential violations of immigrants’ constitutional rights and due process.

Deportation Depot was previously a state prison west of Jacksonville, near the border with neighboring Georgia, which closed five years ago due to staffing shortages. Blankenship, director of SOS, says her clients have complained that the facility “was not fit for use” and “they did nothing” did nothing to address the situation. “They just threw people in there. It hasn’t been cleaned at all and there’s mold and filth everywhere. It’s really cruel, terrible treatment,” she adds.

Stephanie Hartman, communications director for Florida’s Division of Emergency Management (FDEM), which oversees the facility, said these allegations “are false” and that “detainees receive three meals a day, have access to indoor and outdoor recreational facilities, continuous access to a fully staffed medical clinic with an on-site pharmacy,” as well as clean facilities and the ability to schedule appointments with their lawyers, “both in person and virtually.”

FDEM did not respond to questions about how many detainees are at the center or how many have been deported. The Department of Homeland Security and ICE also did not respond to this newspaper’s inquiries. Authorities have said the facility has a capacity of 1,300 detainees, which could be expanded to 2,000.

The deportation machine

When announcing at the end of last month that he would repurpose the prison to detain immigrants, Florida Governor DeSantis highlighted its proximity to Lake City airport, just minutes from Baker, as a strategic point, and said the goal was not to “hold people indefinitely” at the site, “but to process and deport them.” The former prison required fewer resources — around $6 million — to operate as a detention center than the other option considered by the state, a military base southwest of Jacksonville.

Immigrant advocates have claimed that poor conditions and long periods of detention are part of a strategy to pressure people into accepting deportation. Authorities insist that those who agree to voluntary deportation are given a plane ticket and $1,000. But Blankenship says the real reason they want to keep people detained is money.

In July, President Trump signed his tax reform law, which allocated more than $100 billion to ICE, including around $45 billion to expand detention center capacity.

“That’s the reason. I don’t think Trump or the people behind this care at all about immigrants. It’s a political move. That’s where there’s a lot of money and political power. So what do you do? You start talking about immigrants, you set up the whole anti-immigrant propaganda machinery that’s been running in this country for years, and suddenly you have billions pouring out of Congress,” she says.

“So it’s money first. Like that old saying: ‘It’s the money, stupid.’ Look at that, and everything else fall from there,” she concludes.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/3EMBQ5LQLVF73OYMAEFFU2AARM.jpg?auth=de58ab9e078c0a5fa8b2c52a14282124176d50fa15e290c45db691dbeac6b9cd&width=1200,N,,2025-09-26 11:56:55.148158

It’s the home of GEO Group, a 40-year-old company that operates more than four dozen immigrant detention facilities and prisons across the country.

The firm, which was founded by a Greek immigrant who entered the United States through Ellis Island, has cultivated relationships with top figures in the Trump administration, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and immigration czar Tom Homan.

Few companies have made a bigger killing from the administration’s turbocharged efforts to detain and deport undocumented migrants.

Ten days after Trump won last year’s presidential election, the company hired top Trump advisor and former Florida state congressman, Carlos Trujillo as a lobbyist. Trujillo’s firm, Continental Strategy, employs the daughter of Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff.

The company contributed more than $500,000 backing President Trump’s election effort last year and then chipped in an additional $500,000 to support Trump’s inauguration this year.

It’s been money well spent.

The company has already landed contracts worth up to $500 million since Trump’s second inauguration on January 20, 2025, a Miami Herald analysis of federal contracting records found.

“We believe our company faces an unprecedented opportunity at this time to play a role in supporting President Trump’s new administration policy,” said George Zoley, GEO’s founder and executive chairman, in an earnings call in February. He added that GEO was “well positioned” to “scale up” its portfolio of detention and transportation facilities and electronic monitoring products in this “unique moment” in the company’s history.

The federal contracts include a renewal to a prior contract to operate the Broward Transitional Center, a detention facility in Pompano Beach.

Four months ago, the firm also agreed on a 15-year contract to operate an immigrant detention center in Newark, New Jersey. GEO told investors that it expects to generate $60 million in revenue from that deal in the first year alone and up to $1 billion over 15 years.

For-profit detention centers like those run by GEO have drawn intense scrutiny, especially over the last decade. For instance, a 2020 Congressional report documented numerous problems at privately-run facilities, including delayed and inadequate medical care, deficient sanitation and management of infectious diseases, overcrowded conditions, limited mental health support and lack of transparency.

In April, 44-year-old Marie Ange Blaise, a Haitian, died while being held at GEO’s Pompano Beach facility after complaining of chest pains. Her son told medical examiners that she had “chest pains and abdominal cramps” but detention staff refused her request to see a physician.

More recently, four detainees escaped from GEO’s Newark detention center, according to the New York Times. While the exact timing of the escape is unclear, detainees at the facility had faced off against guards over meager and dismal meals, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding that same day.

The company said that it is proud of the role it has played in supporting the law enforcement mission of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a GEO Group spokesperson said.

“Our innovative support service solutions have helped the federal government implement the policies of seven different Presidential Administrations,” he said.

Detainees at GEO’s facilities are provided “robust access” to medical facilities and professionals and off-site specialists, emergency services and access to local community hospitals is also provided when needed.

GEO did not respond to specific questions about cultivating relationships with influential figures in the government. George Zoley declined an interview request from the Herald.

Immigration is typically a civil ⁠— not criminal ⁠— matter under U.S. law but facilities that hold undocumented migrants remain places of confinement. Critics argue that the profit-driven model prioritizes occupancy over the welfare of detainees.

“No matter how you spin it, these are prisons,” said Faisal Al-Juburi of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, a Texas-based immigrant rights group.

“There is no way to humanely detain people, especially families.”

Capital connections

GEO’s prospects looked very different a decade ago.

On August 18, 2016, Sally Yates, Obama’s attorney general announced that the Justice Department would be looking to phase out the use of private prisons.

“They simply do not provide the same level [compared to federally run Bureau of Prisons facilities] of correctional services, programs and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and … they do not maintain the same level of of safety and security,” she wrote in a memo directing the bureau to “either decline or substantially reduce” contract renewals with for-profit prison companies.

GEO’s stock tumbled immediately.

The next day, GEO made a $100,000 contribution to Rebuilding America Now, a super PAC supporting Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and a further $125,000 a few months later, filings with the Federal Election Commission show. The company also contributed $250,000 for Trump’s inauguration in 2017.

Trump’s surprise 2016 victory would boost the company’s fortunes.

Jeff Sessions, then Trump’s attorney general, rescinded Yates’ guidance soon after Trump took office and the company has received hundreds of millions more in federal contracts since then.

Since 2016, GEO has also spent around $12 million in lobbying agencies like the Homeland Security and Justice departments.

Roughly two weeks after Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2017, the firm employed the services of Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm owned by Brian Ballard, who POLITICO dubbed the “most powerful lobbyist in Trump’s Washington” in 2018. Ballard lobbied the White House on the company’s behalf.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, then a lobbyist for Ballard Partners, also lobbied the White House and Department of Homeland Security in 2019 on the “use of public-private partnerships in correctional services.”

Tom Homan, the current immigration czar, disclosed providing consulting services to a subsidiary of GEO Group before he took office this year. He was paid at least $5,000 but the report does not specify the nature of his work for the company. MSNBC and the New York Times reported last weekend that Homan was the subject of an FBI investigation last year for allegedly accepting cash in exchange for help with winning government contracts in a second Trump administration.

Both Homan and the White House have strongly denied any wrongdoing and dismissed the investigation into Homan as politically motivated by the Biden administration.

“Tom Homan has not been involved with any contract award decisions,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. “He is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country.”

Joe Biden, like Hillary Clinton before him, ran in 2020 on a platform that promised the end of the federal government’s use of private prisons. Stocks of contractors like GEO plummeted immediately after he was elected president.

But while Biden did end the use of prison contractors by the Justice Department, he did the opposite for immigration facilities and allowed ICE to expand its work with for-profit companies.

The move paved the way for Donald Trump to rapidly expand their use to hold undocumented migrants. The passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” in May this year earmarks a further $45 billion — more than three times what the government spent during the Biden and Trump’s first administration ⁠— to expand immigration detention centers in the country.

“Who stands to gain from such policies? It is the GEO Groups of the world,” said Al-Juburi of RAICES.

Zoley’s fortune

GEO Group was founded in 1984 by George C. Zoley. It went public ten years later.

The company received its first federal contract for immigration detention in Aurora, Colorado in 1987. Ten years and expansions into Australia and the United Kingdom later, it received a U.S. federal Bureau of Prison contract to operate a correctional institution in Taft, California ⁠— the first privately-run federal prison in the country.

Today, the firm’s portfolio includes more than 50 immigrant detention centers and correctional facilities in the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom and South Africa. It also runs a migrant detention facility in the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The company offers transportation services for inmates and detainees, electronic monitoring products, privatized healthcare for those in detention as well as financing, design and construction services for correctional facilities.

Zoley’s personal fortune has grown by $50 million since Trump got elected in 2024, according to Bloomberg estimates. It is now $304 million.

Zoley himself is an immigrant. Born in Greece, he arrived at Ellis Island aged three with his 28-year-old mother and five-year-old brother on September 19, 1953, archived passenger manifests from the ship Nea Hellas show. The historic ship helped thousands of Greeks make the two-week sea voyage from Athens to New York and often served as an escape route for hundreds fleeing the Nazi occupation and later, the difficult postwar years in Europe.

Zoley’s last name at the time was Zolis. The family travelled to Ohio and Zoley grew up in the small township of Copley, a 15-minute drive from Akron.

At the time, the path to naturalization was much easier: Individuals need only have been a resident in the United States for five years, not committed murder, not been in an American jail for more than 180 days and had to be “attached to the Constitution” and of “good moral character.” When he turned 18, Zoley was a shoo-in.

Six decades later, the Zoley family ⁠owns a nine-bedroom waterfront mansion and another four-bedroom single-family home in Boca Raton, both near the Royal Palm Yacht and Country Club. The properties, which the Zoleys had bought for a total of nearly $12 million, are now worth roughly $26 million, records show.

GEO facilities

Less than 10 miles southwest of the Zoley’s waterfront mansion stands one of the facilities that helped pay for it.

The flamingo pink Broward Transitional Center hides in plain sight on a stretch of road in Pompano Beach lined with palm trees and modest commercial buildings. There are no spools of barbed wire atop its fences or looming guard towers to announce its purpose.

Right below the American flag at the facility’s entrance is a flag emblazoned with the GEO Group’s logo.

Hundreds of people looking to emigrate to the United States sit inside the facility’s walls in limbo, waiting for a legal process that often stretches on for weeks, months or even years.

Detainees include asylum seekers, visa overstayers and those apprehended in Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. Many of them have no history of violent crime.

Among them was Harpinder Singh Chauhan, a 56-year-old British entrepreneur, who recently went bankrupt, had tax problems and was arrested by ICE this spring. He was transferred to BTC on April 20.

He told Human Rights Watch, an international civil rights watchdog group, that staff at the facility deprived him of his insulin for nearly a week even though he had serious medical conditions including diabetes, pancreatitis and asthma. He collapsed while lining up for dinner one night and had to be rushed to a hospital with signs of cardiac arrest. Chauhan has since been deported to the United Kingdom.

GEO Group did not respond to the Herald’s questions about allegations of mismanagement and lack of care in its facilities. The company emphasized that its services are monitored by the Homeland Security Department and said that issues that arise are quickly addressed.

Sworn declarations by detainees filed in federal court and obtained by the Herald on condition of anonymity allege negligent medical care and crumbling infrastructure at GEO’s facility in Karnes, Texas. They also reveal the wide swath of people getting caught in ICE’s dragnet: An Iranian teen fleeing an abusive father, a Venezuelan looking for a safer life in the United States and a Mongolian family seeking asylum.

A Colombian detainee at Karnes stated in one declaration was arrested by ICE in Pompano Beach, had a fracture in his tibia ⁠— a bone in the leg. While at Karnes, he was taken to an offsite orthopedic clinic whose “walls were falling down.” The doctor ordered his crutches to be taken away and said the swelling and pain were “mental.”

Another testified that she, along with her mother and two younger brothers were detained at Karnes for some weeks. One of her brothers has severe autism and she said his symptoms got much worse in custody ⁠— he was angry, nervous and stopped eating. She herself started having panic attacks. Her mother and brothers were later released and she is now detained alone.

A Venezuelan who was arrested in Austin and detained at Karnes, said in another declaration that she has seen “people be carried out after passing out.” She said that officials always ignored her complaints about the cold temperatures inside affecting her asthma and that the food at the facility often smells off. The guards never answer detainees’ questions, she said, and yell at them to go back to their rooms.

“We came here looking for safety, a peaceful life where we are not living in constant fear,” she testified. “I want my freedom.”

In the shadow of Congress and the current Trump administration driving up health care costs and booting Americans off their coverage, the court’s decision makes clear that communications between federal agencies and congressional staff cannot avoid FOIA’s reach simply because a congressional staffer pastes boilerplate language onto emails labeling them “congressional records.”

“This ruling is a significant victory for transparency at a time when Congress and the Trump administration are driving up health care costs and stripping people of their coverage,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “If congressional staff could shield agency communications from disclosure with a simple boilerplate disclaimer, the public would lose access to policymaking debates with life-and-death consequences, like the fight over health care access. The court was clear: FOIA’s spirit of disclosure cannot be undermined by such gamesmanship.”

In 2017, just months after opening its doors, American Oversight sued the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Management and Budget for records related to the Trump administration’s attempt to roll back the Affordable Care Act. Among the documents produced were emails from House Ways and Means Committee staff that included attachments and a boilerplate footer asserting the materials belonged to the Committee and were exempt from FOIA — even though the agencies had relied on the materials in crafting legislative strategy. The Committee intervened to block disclosure of the records, but after years of litigation, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has ruled that Congress cannot use such tactics to circumvent FOIA and prevent the release of records agencies use in their decision-making.

In concluding its opinion, the court underscored the importance of maintaining public access to policymaking records:

“[A]gencies frequently communicate with Congress about a range of budgetary and policy matters, and . . . FOIA’s protections do not shield all of those communications from disclosure simply because of Congress’s involvement. To deem the actions here — staffers simply copying and pasting a catch-all disclaimer into any communication they find appropriate — as a clear assertion of congressional intent would significantly broaden the scope of FOIA exemptions. Such an approach would contravene the D.C. Circuit’s admonition that Congress’s FOIA exemption cannot be interpreted to ‘undermine the broad spirit of disclosure that animates the Act.'”",https://americanoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/Copy-of-Web-image-template-1.png,N,,2025-09-26 15:56:35.415781

All are believed to be in the United States illegally, the FBI says.

Officials report nine of those who were arrested Thursday were targeted for their suspected involvement in the sexual assault and/or trafficking of minor American girls.

FOX 11 is working to get more details on the arrests. It's unclear where these people were living in Manitowoc County, if these alleged crimes were happening in the county and what level of involvement those arrested had in the alleged crimes.

FOX has also asked officials when and how the FBI and ICE got involved and when these individuals will appear in court.

Manitowoc County is in the 6th Congressional District, represented by Republican Rep. Glenn Grothman. FOX 11 spoke with Grothman Thursday afternoon, asking him what he knows about the arrests and the ongoing ICE investigations in the area.

""We're still trying to collect information. As we understand it, many of them were involved in human trafficking, which usually is another way to say prostitution. Others may have been working in the field of agriculture. ICE has so much work to do, as you know,"" Grothman said. ""And this is an example of the fact the problems, particularly with prostitution involved, the problems are not just along the Mexican border. The people come all the way up here, then to Manitowoc.""

Crusaders of Justicia, the Manitowoc affiliate of Forward Latino, a nonprofit and nonpartisan advocacy organization that has groups in 29 states, decried these ICE operations, calling it, ""the unjust targeting of innocent, hardworking immigrant community members and the separation of families.""

Jennifer Maldonado, executive director of Crusaders of Justicia, said in a news release, ""We all want safe communities. However, it is both reckless and harmful to connect all those detained today with allegations of sex trafficking.""

At least one of today’s actions targeted a group of dairy workers who gather every morning in the same place and ride together to work. They do this day in and day out. They are hardworking, church-going individuals who are only looking to provide for their families. Not only do they contribute to our communities, but they are sustaining Wisconsin’s family-owned dairy farms.

Darryl Morin, national president of Forward Latino, added:

As documented by numerous independent sources, this administration continues to prioritize the detention and deportation of immigrants with no criminal record. The reasoning is simple.

First, the vast majority of immigrants are not involved in criminal activity. Second, detaining individuals who go to work every day and come home to their families every night is easier than apprehending someone actually engaged in unlawful behavior.

At a time when Wisconsin faces a severe labor shortage, we should be focused on expanding legal pathways, not tearing families apart. Hardworking, tax-paying, law-abiding immigrants should be part of the solution, not demonized and separated from their families.

Grothman told FOX 11 he understands many Wisconsin farms need migrant workers. He said Congress may need to consider approving more workers coming into the country to help dairy farms, but added that Wisconsin farms shouldn't be hiring people in the country illegally.

Voces de la Frontera, a Milwaukee-based immigrant rights organization, says it is aware of the arrests and is working with the affected families and conducting a full investigation.

Ayala-Uribe’s death marked the 15th detention death officially reported by Ice, part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.
In response to Alaya-Uribe’s death, Ice said in a statement, in part: “ICE remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.
Only [approximately] eight months into the second Trump term … we’ve already seen 15 deaths, or nearly two detainee deaths per month (1.88).
Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director of the Detention Watch Network, said in a statement to the Guardian: “Ice detention is inherently inhumane, and we’ve documented horrendous conditions for decades.","Deaths occurring in the custody of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) have reached at least 16 since January amid increasing mass detention across the country and growing concerns over conditions.

On Sunday, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a 39-year-old Mexican national and former “Dreamer” – those given protections after being brought to the US as undocumented children in the past – died after being held at an Ice facility in Adelanto, California, according to a statement from the federal agency.

Ayala-Uribe’s death marked the 15th detention death officially reported by Ice, part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.

However, an incident then followed in Texas on Wednesday when a detainee was killed by a gunman and two others were wounded at an Ice facility in Dallas, even though prosecutors said the suspect was targeting Ice, not detainees.

And Ayala-Uribe’s death followed a 42-year-old Honduran national who died last week while held by Ice in Nassau county, New York.

In response to Alaya-Uribe’s death, Ice said in a statement, in part: “ICE remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments. Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.”

According to the latest data from the Guardian, which has been tracking immigration enforcement under Trump, Ice was holding 59,762 people in detention as of 25 September. The number exceeded 60,000 in August, a record. On 26 January, roughly a week after Trump assumed office for a second term, Ice was holding 39,238 in detention and the total had been below 40,000 throughout 2024, although rising steadily later in the Biden administration.

Adam Sawyer, a migration data scientist with Relevant Research, based in Maryland, reviewed the current and prior administrations.

“A total of 26 people passed away during the 48 months of the Biden administration. That’s a bit more than one death every second month (0.54 deaths per month). Only [approximately] eight months into the second Trump term … we’ve already seen 15 deaths, or nearly two detainee deaths per month (1.88). About half of the detainee deaths (12 of 26) during the Biden administration took place last fiscal year 2024, so detainee death rates were ramping up before Trump took office in 2025,” he said.

Sawyer said even considering the increase in Ice detentions, the rising death toll remains worrying.

Earlier this week, Georgia US senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, Democrats, wrote to homeland security secretary Kristi Noem and acting Ice director Todd Lyons demanding information.

Citing the deaths of two detainees in Ice custody in Georgia, the senators said: “We write with serious alarm regarding the rise in the number of deaths in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody nationwide … We request that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE immediately provide information about these individuals’ deaths and about the Trump administration’s plan to prevent further fatalities.”

Concerns surrounding detention conditions are rising.

Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director of the Detention Watch Network, said in a statement to the Guardian: “Ice detention is inherently inhumane, and we’ve documented horrendous conditions for decades. What we are seeing now is an exacerbation of these conditions that is resulting in more deaths.”

Despite criticisms from immigration rights groups and lawmakers who have been denied entry to detention centers, Ice and DHS assert that conditions in detention are safe.

“All people in ICE custody receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergent care,” Ice said in a statement online.

Advocates are alarmed, however.

Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights in Washington DC, said: “The detention in America is higher than it’s ever been … If you were a xenophobic, racist wannabe dictator and you wanted to deport as many people as possible, you’d want to make sure that the detention system is in a place where people get as little help as possible.”

And Sawyer pointed to detention levels.

“When increasing the size of a population, in this case the national [Ice] detainee population, we would expect it to increase the total number of people experiencing health complications that might lead to death if not monitored … While the demographic and statistical aspects of Ice detention definitely impact mortality rates, the actual conditions at Ice detention centers might be more immediately relevant,” he said.

The Guardian has reached out to Ice and DHS for comment about the 2025 death toll.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/849f08e65dfe2f6afc5bdfea043c67db9525cf4b/0_0_5718_4576/master/5718.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=25446f6b728703d68a520a3fff88c696",N,,2025-09-26 09:56:19.212039

""","A 39-year-old former DACA recipient died in ICE custody this week. Ismael Ayala-Uribe had been detained at Adelanto ICE Processing Center near Victorville since August, when he was arrested by immigration agents.

Ayala-Uribe is the 14th person to die in immigration custody in the U.S. this year. ICE said in a statement that an investigation into the cause of death is underway, and community groups are demanding an independent report on what happened.

The death comes as Adelanto has seen a surge of hundreds more detainees since immigration agents ramped up enforcement in Southern California this summer. The privately run detention center has faced accusations of medical abuse and neglect, and some lawmakers recently were turned away when they tried to enter the facility.

But experts told LAist that they doubted much would come from ICE's investigation into the death. Sergio Perez, the executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said government oversight of deaths in its detention centers is limited and flawed.

"" Accountability and transparency in this space following a death in custody has always been severely lacking. It's even more lacking now,"" Perez said.

What happened?

Ayala-Uribe died in the early hours of Monday morning, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The agency said he was evaluated by a medical provider at Adelanto on Sept. 18, given medication and returned to his dorm. Three days later, on Sunday, he was sent to a nearby hospital, where he was evaluated for an ""abscess on his buttock"" and scheduled for surgery.

The next day, he was dead.

The center has been under scrutiny for its treatment of people detained there for years and has been in the spotlight again in recent months as it received a surge of people detained in this summer's immigration sweeps.

The advocacy group Disability Rights California visited the facility in June and interviewed 18 people detained there. It then issued a report claiming that detainees faced ""inadequate access to medical treatment, such as life-saving medication and wound care, and exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses.""

""Due to the surging numbers of people at Adelanto, conditions appear to have quickly deteriorated,” that report reads.

What is ICE required to do after a death in custody?

When a person dies in immigration detention, ICE is required to post the news within two business days. The agency is then legally required to publish all its reports on the death within 90 days. Those reports are posted online.

According to ICE's policy posted online, the agency ""conducts medical reviews, as well as oversight and compliance investigations,"" and its Office of Professional Responsibility examines the circumstances of the death. ICE's review is then given to Homeland Security's Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Critics have questioned the accuracy of ICE investigations into in-custody deaths for years. In 2024, the ACLU issued a report looking at the deaths of 52 people in ICE custody between 2017 and 2021.

""ICE’s investigations, formal and informal reports and recommendations in response to deaths in custody are structured to avoid fault and disclaim agency accountability for the death of detained immigrants,"" that report reads, in part.

Two immigration experts told LAist that the offices at the Department of Homeland Security responsible for investigating deaths like Ayala-Uribe's have been eroded under the second Donald Trump administration.

Heidi Altman with the National Immigration Law Center cited recent job cuts in DHS offices such as the offices for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman.

Assistant Security Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement to LAist that those offices obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS' mission.

""Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations,"" according to McLaughlin.

The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman conducts oversight and will ""independently examine immigration detention to promote safe, humane conditions,"" according to its government website.

"" You start seeing things like the dismantling of the oversight bodies that provided the very, very little accountability that was there for abuses and medical negligence and custody,"" Altman said. ""And you just know that these detention centers are becoming increasingly dangerous places for people to be.""

McLaughlin wrote that all legally required functions continue to be performed and that DHS remains committed to civil rights.

What about lawmakers?

There are other paths for oversight of conditions at detention centers. Lawmakers can launch their own investigations. In July, Sen. Jon Ossoff issued a report on the experiences of pregnant women and children in immigration detention, including inadequate medical care. That investigation is ongoing.

""Obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees,"" that report claims.

In a statement provided to LAist, Rep. Raul Ruiz called for a full investigation into Ayala-Uribe's death.

""Congress has a duty to provide strong oversight to ensure that all individuals in custody are treated with dignity and receive timely, appropriate care,"" Ruiz said.

His district includes Eastern Coachella Valley, and parts of Imperial and San Bernardino counties.

What’s another path forward?

Perez, with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said these limitations on government oversight meant a private lawsuit might be the most effective route for families, such as Ayala-Uribe’s, to take. But he noted that lawsuits are costly and shifts the burden to individuals rather than the state.

""Lawsuits are slow. Lawsuits are expensive. Lawsuits are emotionally trying,"" Perez said, adding that it means those who have lost loved ones are ""continuously traumatized"" and must be the ones to labor in getting justice.

The briefing follows the Government's June publication of its Industrial Strategy, which includes £625 million in funding to train 60,000 skilled construction workers by 2029. Despite this investment, the Construction Industry Training Board estimates that an additional 240,000 workers will be needed over five years to meet house building targets.

Under the proposed immigration reforms in the Government's White Paper, construction roles will be included on the new Temporary Shortage List, allowing recruitment at lower skill levels. The then Home Yvette Cooper confirmed that ""construction workers will be on the Temporary Shortage List because they are clearly crucial to growth in our economy."" Workers in these roles will face restrictions, including being unable to bring dependants and limited eligibility for settlement.

WoRC noted: ""[N]ew workers arriving in the UK in Temporary Shortage List construction roles will not be able to bring dependants with them. Similarly, the government currently plans for recruitment from this list to end by 31 December 2026. The government's intention is for access to this labour pool to be temporary by nature. This, combined with the government's other plans to extend the qualifying periods for settlement in the UK, mean it is currently unlikely that those sponsored to work in Temporary Shortage List roles will in the future be eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain.""

WoRC later adds that the introduction of the Temporary Shortage List is ultimately part of a growing policy trend that treats migrant workers as a disposable labour force, undeserving of the rights and entitlements that would lift them out of work and immigration-related precarity.

The report compares the construction sector's vulnerabilities to those seen in social care, where the expansion of the Health and Care Worker visa to cover a shortage of care workers led to widespread exploitation and abuse. WoRC finds there are a number of important similarities between construction and social care with regard to the UK's work sponsorship system, and warns it could likely lead to similar problems for construction workers.

WoRC highlights, for example: ""The transient and flexible work arrangements that exist within the construction sector and the prevalence of self-employment make it poorly aligned with the rigidity of existing sponsorship rules. This is similar to what transpired in the care sector, where a large number of available roles were actually in domiciliary care (characterised by hyper flexible work and contractual arrangements), which did not align to rigid rules around the requirement for full-time hours to be provided. If subsequent enforcement action is taken on this issue, it is likely to plunge a large number of workers into limbo at short notice.""

The report also cautions against adopting a labour provider model akin to the Seasonal Worker visa, citing risks such as debt bondage and concentrated power among operators. WoRC calls for flexibility to be central when it comes to building safeguarding measures into immigration rules. Drawing on extensive casework, the organisation highlights how rigid visa sponsorship rules, particularly those that tie workers to individual employers, not only undermine workers' human rights but also create significant practical barriers that fail to reflect the realities of how work is carried out on the ground.

To mitigate the risks, WoRC briefing proposes removing employers from the visa grant process entirely, thereby allowing workers greater mobility. As a more cautious alternative, it suggests sector-based sponsorship, echoing recommendations previously made by Unison in the social care sector. While acknowledging that this would not resolve all underlying issues, WoRC says it would at least prevent immigration rules from worsening conditions. It also calls for complementary safeguards, such as extended timeframes for workers to change sponsors and the introduction of a ""Workplace Justice visa."" Although the Government's Immigration White Paper hinted at exploring such measures, the report notes that ""nothing concrete has materialised thus far.""

In concluding, the report notes that the Government is stuck in an impossible balancing act: maintaining the veneer of a hostile immigration rhetoric while simultaneously relying on migrant labour to drive economic growth before the next general election.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/UK_Visa.jpg/640px-UK_Visa.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:57:25.460648

The party has also promised it would make migrants reapply for their visa every five years and would stop anyone other than British citizens from accessing welfare benefits.

Overall, the party claims that it could save the British public 234 billion pounds (about 267 billion euros) over the next ""several decades.""

InfoMigrants takes a closer look at the party's claims and how realistic they are.

Asylum seekers in the UK scapegoated amid economic precarity

What are the claims?

In a paper published last year for the general election, Reform UK says they are aiming for ""smart immigration, not mass immigration."" They say that ""all non-essential immigration"" would be ""frozen to protect public services, boost wages, end the housing crisis and cut crime.""

Tackling migration -- what Reform UK is promising:

Channel crossings: The party promises to ""detain and deport"" all those who arrive in the UK via small boat, and ""if needed, migrants in small boats will be picked up and taken back to France.""

A ""four-point plan"" to stop boats from crossing the Channel. This would include leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, forbidding the possibility for ""illegal immigrants to be resettled in the UK."" It would also create a ""new department for immigration,"" and pick up ""illegal migrants out of boats and take them back to France.""

Asylum process: ""All asylum seekers that arrive illegally from safe countries will be processed rapidly, offshore if necessary."" Furthermore, Reform UK says that ""Those entering from a safe country will also be barred from claiming asylum or citizenship.""

There would be ""no legal aid for non-citizens,"" and ""those rejected will be returned.""

Dealing with criminals: Reform UK says that any ""foreign criminals"" would be ""immediately deported, after their prison sentence ends"" and proposes to ""withdraw citizenship from immigrants who commit a crime with the exception of some misdemeanor offenses.""

Residency: Student dependents, so dependents of those on a student visa in the UK, would be ""barred.""

A ""five-year residency and employment"" hurdle to anyone wishing to claim benefits in the UK.

An ""immigration tax"", making the national insurance rate (the current tax paid by all UK employees towards their healthcare and pension) 20 percent of their earnings for all foreign workers. This, claims Reform, ""would incentivize business to employ British citizens whose National Insurance rates would stay at 13.8 percent."" Only those regarded as ""essential"" (for instance healthcare workers) would be exempt from the tax. According to Reform, these measures could raise ""more than 20 billion over five years"" that would then be used to ""pay for the apprenticeships and training for young Brits.""

All in all, Reform claimed that these proposals would help save the UK between five and ten billion pounds (between 5.7 and 11 billion euros) per year.

Abolishing ILR

Reform UK this week also announced the party intends to abolish indefinite leave to remain (ILR). Farage claimed this would make sure that those who were allowed to stay in the UK for the duration of their visas were contributing to the British economy, as having to reapply for a visa every five years would ensure they fulfilled hurdles like being in full employment, having a high standard of English and earning above a certain salary threshold in order to qualify for their visas.

ILR, said Farage, also gave people an automatic right to benefits and conferred upon people all the rights enjoyed by other British citizens. Something he wants to be harder to come by.

Farage told reporters that he believed that Britain should not be ""the world’s food bank,"" and ""it is not for us to provide welfare for people coming in from all over the world.""

How realistic and implementable are these claims?

Many of the policies outlined by Farage would require law changes and treaty changes to rescind rights and status already granted, in some cases, to hundreds of thousands of people.

His costings and potential savings have also been called into question by experts and politicians.

Returning people to France, or removing them from boats mid-voyage would currently be impossible under international maritime law and conventions, not to mention, it is unlikely that the French would accept such a proposal. The current Anglo-French accord allows for a 'one in, one out' policy. So far, four migrants have been sent back to France under the pilot scheme and the French authorities admitted to the French news agency Agence France Presse (AFP) this week that finding eligible migrants to send to the UK is proving difficult.

The first three migrants from France were sent to the UK this week.

Processing migrants offshore has so far proved impossible to do. The Conservative government's Rwanda plan failed, after costing billions and was scrapped by the current Labour government. Italy's attempt to process asylum seekers in Albania has also not proved to be the success anticipated by the Italian government. Most attempts run into legal challenges, even though the EU and even the current British government have expressed interest in finding ""third country"" solutions to dealing with asylum claims.

Leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) would be complicated and could have far-reaching consequences, placing the UK apart from most other Western countries, which could affect its international standing, as well as day-to-day legislation and case law.

According to the UK in a Changing Europe, an academic think tank providing impartial research-based analysis of the UK’s relationship with the EU and hosted by King’s College in London, ""if the UK withdrew from the ECHR there would be inevitable international consequences.""

These would range from affecting the Belfast/Good Friday agreement, which brought a peace settlement to Northern Ireland after years of violence, killing and deaths. It would also further strain relations with the EU and could affect the UK-EU trade and cooperation agreement, the think tank points out in a report published in May 2024.

""Experts also agree that withdrawal would be at odds with the UK’s integrated review of security, defense, development and foreign policy,"" all things that are based on the UK’s commitment to international law and universal human rights.

Leaving the ECHR would also affect law in the UK, since the British Human Rights Act (passed in 1998) is based on the rights enshrined in the ECHR. So, in order to leave the ECHR, the government would also have to repeal the HRA, which would require the government to pass another act to replace it. And that would also require parliamentary approval.

Being a signatory to the ECHR is a condition for membership in the Council of Europe. So, if the UK were to leave the ECHR, it would also have to leave the Council of Europe, the report authors state. Both steps would involve legislative changes at the international and domestic levels.

Formal notification of the intention to withdraw from the ECHR would take six months. On the domestic level, the government would need the approval of parliament.

Are legislative changes possible?

Passing bills in the UK can take months if not years. Some don’t pass within a full parliamentary term, since they require not only majorities to vote for them, but also a series of debates in both parliamentary houses and with all MPs and lords involved, of all political persuasions. Bills are subject to rounds of modifications and more votes before they finally make their way to seek royal assent and are passed into law.

However, even when a bill passes the lower house of parliament, the upper House of Lords can order more modifications before sending it back to the lower house for another round of votes that often result in some of the more extreme policies being modified quite heavily.

Only governments with very strong majorities are able to pass legislation slightly more quickly, as if all MPs in the ruling party or coalition agree, then there might be fewer modifications.

The UK electoral system, which operates a first-past-the-post electoral system, has favored the two main parties (Labour and Conservative) up until now. Even in the 2024 election, where Reform came second in terms of the number of votes in many constituencies, they didn't gain many actual seats. They currently hold five in the UK parliament. This is compared to Labour's 399.

Past experience also shows that previous attempts to introduce an alternative Bill of Rights floundered in parliament. In June 2022, the then Conservative Minister of Justice Dominic Raab attempted to introduce a Bill of Rights that he hoped would make it harder for people to bring claims via the ECHR. Even though the UK clarified it did not at that point intend to leave the ECHR, the bill failed to progress through parliament.

UK riots: How far-right actors capitalized on public anger

'No basis in reality'

Britain’s current Chancellor (Finance Minister), Rachel Reeves, declared that Farage’s claims ""have no basis in reality,"" and that the UK government is already looking at restricting migrants' welfare access. The British government is also, according to the BBC, already consulting on whether or not to double the average wait for migrants applying for ILR from the current five years to ten.

The Labour government has also noted that some of the financial figures used by Farage came from a report authored by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), a think tank founded by former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

The figures used in that report were later challenged by the Office for Budget Responsibility, a watchdog set up to assess and calculate government budgets and later the CPS admitted that these figures ""should no longer be used.""

'Half-baked and unworkable'

Ben Chu, a correspondent with the BBC’s Verify department, told viewers that he would be ""very very wary"" of the figures claimed by Farage. Firstly because the CPS had withdrawn their own figures and said that they would put out another set later, but haven’t yet, and secondly because it is very difficult to estimate exactly how many people might be affected by a policy, how much they might or might not contribute to, or cost, the UK economy, or even whether withdrawing a right, might end up costing the country more than allowing for those with ILR to continue with their current status.

Chu also points out that the estimates were not for any given year, but for how much people who might get ILR might cost the British taxpayer over ""their lifetime"" which is ""difficult to estimate."" Chu explained on BBC’s Newscast, ""Speaking to labor market experts who are looking at how that estimate was arrived at, and the actual numbers of what recent migrants to the UK are earning, and could reasonably be expected to continue earning, over their lifetimes, they don’t think it’s a credible figure.""

Reeves told the BBC ""the numbers that Reform have come out with overnight have already begun to disassemble.""

The Conservative Party's shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp also branded Reform’s plans ""half-baked and unworkable.""

Philp told the BBC that he believed Reform are ""a one-man band with no experience of government, and their reckless, left-wing economics mean more debt, more spending, more tax.""

The Liberal Democrats also said that Reform’s proposals were ""not serious."" Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey spent much of his party conference speech picking apart why it would be dangerous to allow Reform into power. Reform are currently ahead in the polls, were there to be an election held right now.

How many people might Reform’s policies affect?

Reform claims that the changes would lead to ""hundreds of thousands of people having to apply and ultimately losing their settled status in the UK.""

Head of Policy for Reform, Zia Yusuf, said the party believed that ""many of those who will lose their leave to remain are entirely dependent on the welfare state and will leave voluntarily upon losing access to benefits.""

Those who don’t leave, Yusuf promised, ""would be subject to immigration enforcement as part of our mass deportation program.""

The exact number of people who might be affected is difficult to quantify, since it is based on people who might potentially apply for ILR in the future, and not all migrants might stay long enough, or want to apply for that.

However, data obtained from the Home Office by the BBC demonstrates that there has been a gradual increase in the number of people granted ILR in the UK over the last decade.

At the end of 2024, estimates from the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford showed that the total population of non-EU citizens with ILR stood at 430,000. These people, under Reform’s plans, could be the ones targeted to lose their ILR status and be forced to apply for visas.

Reform has said that EU nationals granted ILR under the European Union Withdrawal Agreement (whereby EU citizens who had been living and working in the UK could apply for settled status there), who number around four million, would not lose their status under their policy proposals. However, EU nationals not benefiting from those provisions, reported the BBC, would be subject to the new system.

In July this year, the Department for Work and Pensions published figures suggesting that 213,666 people with ILR were claiming Universal Credit (welfare) benefits. According to the BBC, EU nationals with protection, who are not being targeted by Farage’s policies, actually make up the ""majority of benefit claimants by people with ILR.""

According to Ben Chu of BBC Verify, ""in the year ending June 2025, there were 163,000 grants of ILR to non-EU citizens."" As for those who might go on to claim ILR in the future, at the end of 2024, Chu reports that there were around four million people in the UK on temporary visas. These people arrived between 2015 and 2024.

Experts at the Migration Observatory, reported Chu, believe that just over half of those four million (2.1 million) could claim a potential path to settlement. Although Chu says it is really difficult to quantify how many people it might affect, Farage’s proposals could end up splitting families and affecting a ""very very large number of people currently residing in the UK.""

Despite other parties' quick dismissal of his policies, Farage claims that his proposals will force the other parties to take note and adopt some of his policies to regain popularity among the British electorate.

Current policies to reduce migration

The Labour government says that it is already pursuing policies to reduce migration and ""bring down illegal migration."" Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC that her government has ""sent a record number of people who have no right to be in our country home. We’re reducing the use of hotels for asylum seekers and we’ve made an agreement with France to send people back who come over on small boats.""

Reeves added that ""those are all steps towards our ambitions to get a grip of this situation that we inherited.""

Information provided to InfoMigrants by the Home Office this week underlines that the current Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, introduced a bill in parliament, when she was still Minister for Justice, that would allow for ""immediate deportations"" of foreign criminals, and would obviate the need for them to serve any of their sentence before being deported.

The government also introduced secondary legislation that came into effect on September 23, which allows for the deportation of prisoners with no right to be in the country once they have served 30 percent of their sentence. Currently, they can be deported after serving 50 percent of their allotted time in jail.

The Home Office underlines that since taking office on July 5, 2024, they have deported 5,179 foreign national offenders, which marks a 14 percent increase compared to the 4,532 returns operated in the last year of the Conservative government’s rule.",https://scd.infomigrants.net/media/resize/my_image_small/74864afef331e2a4d3af02f3eba72013eef16698.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 11:57:31.674000

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS — PROSECUTIONS

A federal grand jury yesterday indicted former FBI Director James Comey on one count of making a false statement and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding in relation to the testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020. The indictment was signed only by Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s former attorney and the new interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who personally presented the case to the jury. According to court records, the jury rejected Halligan’s attempt to indict Comey on a second false statement charge. Devlin Barrett, Glenn Thrush, and Alan Feuer report for the New York Times.

In response to the indictment, Comey yesterday proclaimed his innocence, stating “I have great confidence in the federal judicial system, and I’m innocent, so, let’s have a trial.” Comey added that “My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but … [w]e will not live on our knees, and you shouldn’t either.” According to sources, Troy Edwards, a senior federal prosecutor who is Comey’s son-in-law, announced his resignation in response to the indictment, saying that he is quitting “to uphold my oath to the Constitution and country.” Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

A senior official in the office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Monday instructed more than a half dozen U.S. attorney’s offices to draft plans to investigate the Open Society Foundations, a grant group funded by George Soros to support democratic initiatives around the world, the New York Times reports. According to the Times, the official’s directive suggests that the DOJ leaders are following orders from Trump that specific people or groups be subject to criminal investigation. Devlin Barrett reports.

Senior DOJ leaders are also pushing for charges to be filed against Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton this week, according to sources. Some of the DOJ leadership see Bolton’s case as a means of bringing forward one of the criminal cases sought by Trump, a different source added. DOJ prosecutors currently think they could bring a stronger case against Bolton by the end of the year. Katelyn Polantz and Hannah Rabinowitz report for CNN.

OTHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth yesterday ordered hundreds of U.S. military generals and admirals to gather at Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, next week, without stating his reasons for issuing the directive. A Pentagon spokesperson affirmed that Hegseth “will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,” but provided no additional details. Several sources who spoke to the Washington Post about Hegseth’s directive voiced concerns about the security implications of the impromptu gathering, and the potential it could collide with a government shutdown. Tara Copp, Dan Lamothe, Alex Horton, Ellen Nakashima, and Noah Robertson report.

In a presidential memorandum, Trump yesterday ordered the DHS, the DOJ, and the Treasury Department to tackle alleged “domestic terrorism” and “organized political violence” by coming up with a “strategy to investigate, prosecute, and disrupt entities and individuals engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation” and their funders. The memorandum singles out an alleged rise in left-wing political violence. Ivan Pereira reports for ABC News; Devlin Barrett reports for the New York Times.

Attorney General Pam Bondi this week summarily fired the third federal prosecutor working in the Southern District of Florida. According to multiple sources, Bondi fired the prosecutor, Will Rosenzweig, because he said negative things about Trump on a social media blog while working for the prominent law firm Kobre & Kim in Washington during Trump’s first term. Jay Weaver reports for the Miami Herald.

The federal Bureau of Prisons yesterday announced it is ending a collective bargaining agreement with its workers, stripping them of union rights. “The whole purpose of ending this contract is to make your lives better,” the Bureau’s Director, William Marshall, said in a message to employees. Michael R. Sisak reports for AP News.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s (D-NJ) military records to an ally of Jack Ciattarelli, her GOP opponent in the New Jersey governor’s race, CBS News reports. The records include Sherrill’s Social Security number, performance evaluations, life insurance information, and her and her parents’ home addresses. A National Archives spokesperson said the records were released “in error.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries yesterday demanded a criminal investigation to be launched in response to the “unauthorized and illegal release.” James LaPorta reports; Andrew Solender reports for Axios.

The Epstein estate has released new materials to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in response to the Committee’s recent request for cash ledgers, message logs, calendars, and flight logs, according to an aide. Hailey Fuchs reports for POLITICO.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

The Trump administration yesterday signed a deal with Elon Musk’s xAI which allows the AI tool to be used widely across the government. “I thought it was nice, he came over, we had a little conversation,” Trump said about his meeting with billionaire Musk. Joe Miller reports for the Financial Times.

The Trump administration is considering a plan to reduce the United States’ reliance on semiconductors produced overseas. The aim is for U.S. chip companies to manufacture the same number of semiconductors as their customers import from abroad, with those failing to maintain a 1:1 ration paying a tariff, sources told Wall Street Journal. Amrith Ramkumar reports.

Amazon yesterday agreed to an unprecedented $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, resolving allegations that the company had deceived users signing up for its Prime service. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson called the settlement a “record-breaking, monumental win for the millions of Americans who are tired of deceptive subscriptions that feel impossible to cancel.” Brendan Bordelon reports for POLITICO.

U.S. cyber officials issued an emergency directive yesterday ordering federal agencies to protect their networks, particularly Cisco devices, against hackers as at least one agency has been breached. The directive will help officials understand “the full scope of the compromise across federal agencies,” said Chris Butera, a senior official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency. Sean Lyngaas reports for CNN; Sam Sabin reports for Axios.

The U.N. yesterday announced that it is implementing a “global dialogue on artificial intelligence governance,” by forming a 40-member panel of scientific experts to analyze research on AI risks and opportunities. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said he hoped the AI initiative would lead to a “new architecture of technology governance.” Steve Lohr reports for the New York Times.

TikTok will be valued at about $14 billion under Trump’s deal to split the social media app from its Chinese parent ByteDance, Vice President JD Vance said yesterday. As Trump signed the executive order to provide 120 days to finalise the agreement with Beijing, he said he “had a good talk” with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and that “he gave us the go ahead.” Alex Rogers, Demetri Sevastopulo, Antoine Gara, James Fontanella-Khan, and Cristina Criddle report for the Financial Times.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau proposed changes to radically reform the global system for asylum seekers and refugees, speaking yesterday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Landau said reform was necessary as the asylum system “serves as a mechanism to make mass illegal migration legal,” arguing that nations should be under no obligation to accept asylum seekers. Adam Taylor reports for the Washington Post.

The United States will reject the U.N. declaration on chronic diseases because it ignores “the most pressing health issues” and includes policies that “promote abortion” and “radical gender ideology,” Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said yesterday. Andrew Jacobs reports for the New York Times.

Trump yesterday announced that starting Oct. 1, the United States will impose a new set of tariffs on heavy trucks, kitchen cabinets, and pharmaceuticals. Each of the sectors listed by Trump were the target of a Commerce Department Section 232 Trade Expansion Act of 1962 investigation earlier this year. Ari Hawkins reports for POLITICO.

The State Department yesterday announced U.S. sanctions on a network it said generated revenue for Pyongyang’s weapons programs by enabling a Myanmar-based arms procurement firm to buy North Korean arms. Reuters reports.

Nine U.S. fighter jets identified and intercepted four Russian war planes flying near Alaska yesterday, the North American Aerospace Defense Command announced in a statement. NORAD said that such Russian activity near Alaska occurs regularly and is not seen as a threat. Aamer Madhani reports for AP News.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

A New York City Department of Correction investigator violated sanctuary laws by sharing sensitive data with federal authorities about two migrants in custody, the New York City Department of Investigation found in a report published yesterday. The DOI report states that the investigator was unaware that he was assisting in civil enforcement, blaming lack of training about local laws that limit cooperation between city law enforcement and federal immigration officers. Emily Ngo reports for POLITICO.

On Wednesday evening, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and ranking member Dick Durbin (D-IL) sent letters to Amazon, Apple, JPMorgan Chase and others, requesting information on their continued use of H1-B visas and whether U.S. workers have been displaced as a result. Anvee Bhutani reports for the Wall Street Journal.

FBI Special Agent Joseph Rothrock said yesterday that the gunman who opened fire on an ICE facility in Dallas this week “wanted to cause terror” and “specifically intended to kill ICE agents”, citing handwritten notes found at the man’s home. U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas Nancy Larson said the gunman’s actions were the “very definition of terrorism.” Sean Murphy and Corey Williams report for AP News; J.David Goodman and Christina Morales report for the New York Times.

U.S. authorities earlier this week deported Harjit Kaur, a 73 year old grandmother who has lived in the United States for over 30 years, to India.

The law was put to use on September 12, when three Turkish citizens were convicted of illegal residence and handed stiff jail sentences. Two men were given two years of imprisonment and fines of 5,000 euros ($5,870), while the third, aged 19, the youngest of the group, was handed a 10-month prison sentence.

Athens plans to test-drive the law through a likely minefield of legal challenges in the coming months. Humanitarian organisations say the measure unfairly includes children and stigmatises refugees and migrants as criminals.

Greek Minister for Migration and Asylum Thanos Plevris told Parliament on September 2 that the law was “the strictest returns policy in the whole EU” and claimed there was “a lot of interest from European countries, especially EU members, to adopt this law as a law that will force an illegal migrant to return”.

Rights groups, which are gearing up to challenge the legislation, say it far outshoots a draft Returns Regulation the European Commission wants to make binding on all member states by June 2026.

The new law has shortened deadlines and raised penalties for unauthorised residence.

For example, rejected asylum applicants will be fitted with ankle monitors and given just two weeks to remove themselves voluntarily. If they do not, they face, like the two Turkish nationals, a 5,000-euro ($5,870) fine and between two and five years of confinement in closed camps.

Children, more than a fifth of arrivals this year, are not exempt. If people wish to appeal, they have to do it in four days.

“We always claim that it’s not legal to put children in detention,” said Federica Toscano from Save the Children. The law is “not aligned with the [UN] Convention on the Rights of the Child”, and is “absolutely challengeable”.

The Greek Ombudsman, an independent authority monitoring public services, also objected to the law’s maximum reprieve of 60 days, down from 120, so children can complete their school year.

The Ombudsman suggested the law sets out to prove the proposition that all undocumented people are criminals.

Ankle monitors, it said, which are not mentioned in the draft Returns Regulation, “deepen the view of migrants as criminals and put their treatment on a par with that reserved for indictees, convicts and prisoners on leave”.

Electronic tagging is “a massive programme that costs a lot of money and involves a whole web of private actors. So I think that would be pretty difficult to set up”, said Hope Barker, an independent researcher on migration.

“Refugees are entitled to effective access to international protection without punishment for violating migration policy,” says the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Under the Geneva Convention, “the quest for asylum … is not a criminal offence, but a human right”.

The EU approves about 45 percent of asylum applications on average.

Of the remainder, 90 percent end up staying on European soil because there is no effective policy to return them, say European officials.

“Without a returns policy, no migration policy has any meaning,” said Greece’s then-migration minister, Makis Voridis, presenting the new proposals in Parliament’s European Affairs Committee on May 15.

Irregular entry into the country has been raised to a felony. Anyone arriving without documents can be detained for two years, up from 18 months.

A provision that legalises anyone after seven years of undocumented residence is being abolished.

Greece’s predicament

Plevris has defended the hardened law, arguing that Greece guards external EU borders.

“It’s easy to defend borders when there’s three or four countries people have to cross to get to you. Compare us to other first reception countries,” he said.

Since 2015, Greece has been the arrival point of 46 percent of more than 2.8 million undocumented people entering Europe, according to UNHCR.

Many have moved on to other EU member states, but because of EU rules, rejected asylum seekers or asylum recipients who lose their protected status would be returned to their country of arrival in the EU for deportation.

Greek officials admit they do not expect refugees and migrants to spend five years in detention. The draconian rules, they say, are designed to force them to return voluntarily once they are convicted.

That is because it is legally difficult to deport anyone forcibly.

The law has a second aim – to deter what Greece views as so-called economic migrants travelling to Europe when there are Geneva Convention signatories closer to home.

Greece’s Union of Administrative Judges objected that the law did not define flight risk, leaving incarceration decisions to the discretion of the police. The law “needs to provide a comprehensive list of criteria, not an indicative one”, it said.

The Council of Bar Associations of Greece also weighed in with objections to tightened deadlines for appeal and the criminalisation of undocumented entry.

“Danger to life and limb vastly outranks whatever law is broken by entering Greece illegally,” it said.

The EU’s guinea pig?

Repeatedly, these bodies pointed out, the new law violates the existing EU Returns Regulation, which dates back to 2008, but observers of EU migration policy say the European Commission is deliberately allowing Greece to push the boundaries.

“Greece has become something of a testing ground for many EU measures, especially on the Greek islands,” Amnesty International’s Olivia Sundberg told Al Jazeera, citing the Closed Controlled Access Centres built to house thousands of asylum seekers.

“In a lot of ways, Greece is a place that has tested things out before they became EU law, and if they worked well, they were carried over into [EU] directives,” she said.

The EU is now looking for ways to implement returns.

“There is this whole push for what they call ‘innovative solutions’,” said Barker. “So one of these is obviously return hubs in third countries, another is getting people to sign up to voluntary returns,” she told Al Jazeera.

Italy has been testing third-country hubs through a deal with Albania, but Italian courts have ordered some of the asylum seekers sent there for processing returned to Italy.

Greece’s law casts a wider net, suggesting returnees should seek protection in any safe country closer to their country of origin.

But Greece’s Ombudsman has objected to this.

Passing the burden “allows a return process to a country the returnee doesn’t come from, or hasn’t passed through and has no connection to, except that it is geographically close to his country of origin. In this case, it’s no longer a ‘returns’ procedure but a ‘displacement’ procedure”, the Ombudsman said.

Some observers say Europe is in danger of falling short of its own human rights charter.

“Migration is becoming a rule of law issue rather than an implementation of law issue,” said Amnesty’s Sundberg.

Others point out that Europe is an ageing continent in need of more workers to sustain its tax base and social security systems in the coming decades.

“How are we going to create an environment of reception of the people we need, when we take this type of measure?” asked Lefteris Papayiannakis, who heads the Greek Council for Refugees, a legal aid charity. “If you can’t attract them, what’s your next move?”

Besides, he said, the measures exude desperation.

“You’re creating an impression now that you’re not in control. But if we compare the situation now with 2015, or the [flight of] Ukrainians in 2022, it’s a completely different situation,” Papayiannakis said.

“How can you justify being up in arms now about a very small number of migrants compared to the number … you’re going to need?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-09-02T181557Z_27109918_RC2UJGA0V288_RTRMADP_3_MIGRATION-GREECE-PROTEST-1758793786.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-26 11:57:35.790936

Professional photographer Raphi Talisman’s video shows officers detaining a man at the business intersection of Hamilton Street and Queens Chapel Road in Hyattsville. Officers are seen trying to handcuff a man on the ground. At one point, an officer's gun dropped to the ground, and he lunged to pick it up and appeared to point it.

Talisman had dropped his child off at school just before 8:30 a.m. when he saw what was happening and started to record.

“It could have gotten way out of control very quickly,” he said. “It was such a dangerous situation.”

Drivers honked their horns, and some yelled at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers as they struggled to put the man in handcuffs.

The detainee's cries were heartbreaking, Talisman said.

“I love America,” the detainee is heard saying on video showing two officers holding him down.

“The real thing was the brutality of it all. It's disgusting,” Talisman said.

The video spread on social media.

Prince George’s County Council member Wanika Fisher said she was angered and saddened by it. She emphasized county police do not work with ICE in making arrests.

“I don’t think it's something that we accept,” she said, “and I think filming interactions like that show the community what their federal government is doing in this constant dog and pony show. I think it’s important to bring awareness to our community.”

The arrest was in an area with a diverse population and several popular Hispanic businesses and restaurants. State Del. Deni Taveras, D-Prince George’s County, said the incident makes some fearful to go out and support those businesses.

“This administration is not creating a safe environment,” she said. “We feel very afraid for our lives, literally.

ICE has said officers identify themselves when making arrests and can wear masks to protect their identities.

Police eventually placed the man in handcuffs and put him in a van. It’s unclear why the officers arrested the man or if he's facing charges.

News4 reached out to ICE but has not received a response.

Talisman said videos like his are spreading awareness of what ICE is doing in the community.

“If ICE is attacking one part of the community, they're attacking all of us,” he said.

The U.S. adheres to a global asylum system first laid out in the 1951 Refugee Convention and enshrined into U.S. law in 1980.","NEW YORK -- The Trump administration pitched several other countries Thursday on its view that the global system for seeking asylum, in effect since World War II, has been rampantly abused and urged them to join the United States in cracking down on such migration.

Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau led the discussion on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly alongside representatives from Kosovo, Bangladesh, Liberia and Panama. Landau's gathering allowed American officials to gauge early support and interest for what could be a massive revamp of the asylum system.

“If you have hundreds of thousands of fake asylum seekers, then what happens to the real asylum system?” Landau said in his opening remarks. “Saying the process is susceptible to abuse is not xenophobic; it is not being a mean or bad person.”

The U.S. said changes must, at a minimum, embrace asylum as a temporary status and dictate that those seeking protection should eventually return home. The Trump administration also emphasized that there is no right to receive asylum in a country of choice and that decisions are governed by individual nations, not multinational organizations.

Human rights groups watched from the sidelines with unease.

Bill Frelick, Human Rights Watch’s director of refugee and migrant rights, said the U.S. proposal “looks like the first step in a bid to tear down the global refugee system.” He faulted the proposal for not embracing a core principle of the current system that people should not be sent to countries where they face persecution.

Filippo Grandi, the U.N. refugee chief, sat in the audience as the world leaders on the panel applauded the Trump administration’s controversial approach to asylum and migration. Grandi, whose organization advocates for those in forced displacement, used the Q & A portion of the event to plead with Landau to take advantage of organizations like his as the U.S. moves forward with this shift in nearly 80 years of policy.

“The right to seek asylum, which my organization upholds, is not incompatible with sovereignty,” Grandi said to the panel. He added that instead of rushing to halt the global asylum process, “the key is to address the root causes” that force people to flee in the first place.

The U.S. has been the top destination for asylum-seekers by far since 2017, with Germany a distant second, according to 2024 figures from the U.N. refugee agency. President Donald Trump and his allies say people with weak cases have abused the system to gain entry to the United States, obtaining work permits while their cases take years to wind through backlogged immigration courts.

The U.S. adheres to a global asylum system first laid out in the 1951 Refugee Convention and enshrined into U.S. law in 1980.

People seeking refuge in the U.S. are able to apply for asylum once they are on American soil, regardless of whether they came legally. To qualify, they have to show a fear of persecution in their own country because of specific reasons, such as their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Refugees meet a similar standard by applying abroad.

Once someone is granted asylum, they can't be deported, they can work legally, bring immediate family, apply for legal residency and eventually seek U.S. citizenship. It offers a permanent future in the U.S.

The panelists Thursday, despite their countries facing varying degrees of migration, appeared to agree that economic migration, in which an individual flees to another country for better financial opportunities, has been conflated with individuals seeking asylum for safety purposes.

Vjosa Osmani Sadriu, the president of Kosovo, talked about her own refugee experience, saying that people like her who are experiencing real dangers and persecution are suffering from loopholes of the asylum system.

“We all came to the conclusion is that it is the illegal migration that must be challenged in order to protect and preserve the integrity of those who are real asylum seekers, of those who are legal citizens and those who respect the rules and respect the law,” she said.

The number of people coming to the U.S.-Mexico border seeking asylum has ballooned in recent years, overloading immigration courts and leading to cries that the system is being abused by people who are coming for jobs or other reasons that don't meet the standards for asylum.

Facing mounting criticism over the large numbers of migrants coming to the border, the Biden administration took steps that severely curtailed asylum access.

The first day in office, Trump signed an order declaring an invasion at the southern border and said he was “suspending the physical entry” of migrants and their ability to seek asylum until he decides it is over. Immigration advocates have sued, and the issue is before the courts.

Homeland Security this week said that more than 2 million unauthorized immigrants have left the United States during the second Trump term.
Unauthorized immigrants want to avoid detention and deportation, advocates say.
Typically, unauthorized immigrants who want to return to the U.S. lawfully can face yearslong bans.","Years ago, José saw America from above – cleaning windows of skyscrapers in New York. He held several jobs since entering the country illegally in 2008, often afraid to out himself by speaking Spanish.

José says he fled to the United States from El Salvador as a teenager after he faced violence from gangs, which he didn’t want to join. So strong was the call of the American dream, he says, that after he crossed the southern border and U.S. officials flew him home, José crossed a second time.

Now, José sees America at a distance once again. He voluntarily left this summer to avoid detention. He and his family, now in Europe, plan to start a new life there through legal pathways. Like other immigrants interviewed for this story, he asked the Monitor to omit his full name for privacy and security concerns.

Why We Wrote This

Part of the Trump administration’s immigration clampdown involves encouraging unauthorized immigrants to “self-deport” by offering cash and other incentives. A growing number are deciding to leave the U.S. on their own.

José, whom the Monitor met through his attorney, found no clear way to legalize his status in the U.S., though his wife and 8-year-old daughter are citizens. He watched as President Donald Trump ramped up a nationwide deportation campaign, including sending men to a notorious Salvadoran prison. He mulled his family’s future. Like José, millions of immigrants – with and without lawful status – are thinking through whether to leave on their own.

“The American dream was a lie,” José says. “I don’t have to work 72 hours a week.” Not only does he have less stress since leaving, he says, “Nobody’s hunting me anymore.”

The Department of Homeland Security has spent over half a year urging unauthorized immigrants like him to leave, offering travel assistance, a $1,000 “exit bonus,” and forgiveness of immigration-related fines if they use a certain app. A public relations campaign by top government officials, and posters in the nation’s immigration courts, emphasize a call to “self-deport.” It’s part of the overall message that the U.S. is inhospitable to people who don’t have proper documents.

“If you don’t [leave], we will find you. And we will deport you,” Secretary Kristi Noem said in a DHS ad campaign this past winter.

The government’s call to self-deport has raised fear and confusion in the homes of some immigrants, along with difficult questions about where they belong: to the original country they left or to the U.S., where they’ve made a life. Their advocates warn of unknowns – such as how data will be used – if they use a promoted government app to schedule a free departure. Immigration enforcement proponents take a different view, praising President Trump’s “Project Homecoming” campaign as a way to save money on detention costs.

For all the anti-immigrant campaigns throughout U.S. history, most people have not “packed up and left the country,” says Adam Goodman, a professor at the University of Illinois Chicago and author of “The Deportation Machine.”

Yet, under this administration, he says, “I don’t think we’ve ever seen anything that is so coordinated, in terms of orchestration, of encouraging people to self-deport and then documenting their departure.”

How many immigrants are leaving the U.S.?

Homeland Security this week said that more than 2 million unauthorized immigrants have left the United States during the second Trump term. Most – an estimated 1.6 million – are self-deportations, said the government, while the rest are deportations. An estimated 14 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. as of 2023.

The administration has not published monthly data on deportations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, instead issuing periodic press statements. Last month, the administration cited a 1.6 million figure on all unauthorized immigrant departures so far, from an estimate by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank promoting reduced immigration. While it’s difficult to discern the full scope of departures, given data limitations, the nonpartisan Pew Research Center published a similar estimated decline for the immigrant population overall.

The U.S. has used coercive campaigns to oust immigrants for more than a century, says Dr. Goodman. A “repatriation” effort to remove Mexicans – including Mexican Americans – emerged during the Great Depression. In some cases, local, state, and federal agencies incentivized departures by paying for travel tickets, a precursor to today, he says.

In March, the U.S. government repurposed an app called CBP One that the Biden administration had used to schedule appointments for asylum-seekers and other migrants as a way to enter the country lawfully. Conservatives argued that the process enabled a back door for otherwise illegal immigration. Now called CBP Home, the app is touted by the Trump administration as a way for unauthorized immigrants to document their intent to depart voluntarily, avoiding fines and arrest.

In May, Homeland Security said an initial “voluntary charter flight” of 64 people took off to Honduras and Colombia.

The self-deportation campaign is “genius,” says Scott Mechkowski, a retired Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. Funding voluntary travel home is cheaper than “the cost of detaining somebody – and then removing them,” he says.

Unauthorized immigrants want to avoid detention and deportation, advocates say. Still, “There’s a lot of fear around using the app” to leave, says Christina Wilkes, an immigration attorney in Maryland.

Part of that fear stems from confusion around how the app works. A DHS webpage says noncitizens requesting assistance will have their departures arranged within an estimated 21 days. It’s unclear whether someone who alerts the government, but leaves on their own, faces the same deadline. There are also questions around how their data will be used, including if someone tries to reenter in the future. Typically, unauthorized immigrants who want to return to the U.S. lawfully can face yearslong bans.

José filled out his information on CBP Home and had an in-person appointment to take his photo and fingerprints. After weeks passed without further instructions, José bought his own ticket abroad. He couldn’t verify his departure through the app, and says he never received the $1,000.

The app is “very confusing,” says José.

“Tens of thousands” of unauthorized immigrants have used the CBP Home app, according to Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS. The department has not directly answered several questions sent by the Monitor – including how many people have received travel assistance and the exit bonus.

Brothers decide

Many immigrants, like Santos, aren’t ready to leave.

The college-aged construction worker says he crossed the southern border illegally, years ago, to avoid the cost and bureaucracy of a visa. Santos says he used to work for a Trump-supporting dairy farmer without days off.

At the start of the new administration, his brother returned to Mexico. That departure was “very difficult for me,” says Santos, now alone in the United States.

“I have friends and acquaintances, but it’s not the same as having your family here,” he says.

Santos says he fears deportation, and now leads a “more hidden life” in which he sticks close to work and home. Staying is a financial decision.

“Someone from the family needs to stay here and subsidize expenses in Mexico,” including care for his parents, he says. Santos has been seeking a way to legalize his status through a special visa.

When finding a job in the U.S. isn’t so easy

Some Haitians have decided to return home, despite gang violence and a political crisis, because they can’t support themselves here, says Sabyne Denaud, senior program and contract manager at the International Institute of New England.

“Back home, they wonder about safety. But here, they wonder about housing. They wonder about jobs,” she says. The Trump administration has also moved to end temporary legal status for Haitians and Venezuelans, cases that face ongoing litigation.

Gina flew back to Haiti on her own a few months ago, without notifying the U.S. government. She didn’t see any other option.

Her cousin sponsored her to come to New York last year through a Biden-era parole program that offered work permits. But her cousin’s family excluded her from meals, she says, leaving Gina to seek food on the street. A friend recommended Massachusetts, a hub of the Haitian diaspora. Even there, Gina struggled to find a job.

“I couldn’t sleep at home because I was very stressed out,” Gina says in Haitian Creole through an interpreter. She also learned she was pregnant with her first child.

Gina, whom the Monitor met through a group that helped her in the U.S., says she feels safe in her coastal town away from the capital, Port-au-Prince, even though she calls the overall situation in her country “very, very bad.” She wants to find a job, and make sure her child “has a good life.”

A previous effort yielded little results

Under President George W. Bush, ICE tried to incentivize those exits through a pilot program known as Scheduled Departure.

The agency had spent significant time and money to identify people who had removal orders, but hadn’t left, according to Jim Hayes, a former ICE official who says he came up with the pilot program in 2008.

Scheduled Departure was meant to test ICE critics’ theory that the agency could deport people in a manner “less painful, less difficult for the people who were in the country illegally,” he says.

It didn’t attract many takers. During the campaign, which lasted three weeks, NPR reported at the time, only eight people took advantage. Roughly half a million people had been eligible.

The current administration’s self-deportation campaign is part of a “comprehensive enforcement strategy” that differs from the Bush approach in part through its use of technology, says Mr. Hayes, now vice president at Guidepost Solutions, a risk management firm.

As he tries to put down new roots in Europe, José says he’s shielded his 8-year-old daughter from much of his immigration saga so far.

“We just told her that we had to leave, and we’re going to a better place,” he says. “She understood.”

The EU’s renewed push to contain transit migration through Libya provides an oppor­tunity to assess the workings and consequences of its migration policy in the coun­try.
Although a change of course is unlikely – given the absence of alternative strategies to reduce arrivals – a sober evaluation of the political costs is essential.","A modest rise in irregular arrivals via Libya over the past two years has prompted a flurry of European shuttle diplomacy, which intensified in the summer of 2025. Whereas irregular arrivals along other migration routes to the EU declined in the first half of the year, there was a sudden surge from eastern Libya to Crete, generat­ing alarm in Greece. In response, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen dis­patched Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration Magnus Brunner to Tripoli and Benghazi. Joined by ministers from Greece, Italy, and Malta, Brunner met with representatives of the internationally recog­nised government in Tripoli in July to press for tougher measures to block departures – without any concrete results. The subsequent visit to Benghazi was cut short after the region’s de facto ruler, Khalifa Haftar, made an audience conditional on having the delegation officially meet his parallel government, which is not internationally recognised. When the Europeans refused, they were compelled to leave. Since then, Greece has launched training programmes for Haftar’s forces, following Italy’s lead. But European efforts to court Haftar go even further. At the end of July, the EU naval operation Irini intercepted a container ship whose inspection in a Greek port found that it was carrying armoured vehicles to Benghazi. Although this was a clear viola­tion of the United Nations (UN) arms em­bargo, the Greek government made sure that the vessel proceeded to Libya, appar­ently fearing that seizing it would jeopardise cooperation on migration. Meanwhile, crossings from eastern Libya to Crete con­tinue, even though Haftar’s forces could prevent them.

This sequence of events illustrates the state of EU migration policy in Libya. The EU’s cooperation on migration with Libyan authorities, which it has pursued since 2017, has become increasingly ineffective, even when measured by the number of arrivals. Yet, European policymakers are doubling down on their strategy of seeking arrangements with Haftar and western Libyan militia leaders to halt departures. In doing so, they are making themselves dependent on partners who are escalating their demands. The fact that a relatively small number of arrivals in Crete – just 7,336 in the first half of 2025 – triggered such alarm in Europe is only likely to embolden actors such as Haftar to raise the price for their cooperation.

The EU’s renewed push to contain transit migration through Libya provides an oppor­tunity to assess the workings and consequences of its migration policy in the coun­try. Beyond Haftar’s growing demands, there are further signs that the EU’s approach is reaching its limits.

No ICE officers were hurt in the shooting, Dallas police said at a news conference.
The anti-ICE messaging surprised Joshua Jahn’s brother, Noah Jahn.
“He was one of those people that I would call for help, just in different situations, whether it be emotional support or physical support,” the troop member said.
According to Noah Jahn, his brother was “not a marksman” but knew how to use their parents’ rifle.","A 29-year-old Texas man opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas on Wednesday, the second instance in two weeks of a gunman setting up with a rifle on a rooftop, opening fire and communicating a message through writing on bullets.

Multiple senior law enforcement officials briefing on the investigation identified the shooter as Joshua Jahn. He was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Vice President JD Vance said evidence that is “not yet public” indicates the shooter was “politically motivated” to go after law enforcement and people enforcing the border.

Vance called Jahn “a violent left-wing extremist.” Authorities have yet to release an official motive. The FBI special agent in charge in Dallas, Joe Rothrock, said the attack was “targeted violence.”

Three detainees in a van in the facility’s sally port were shot. No ICE officers were hurt in the shooting, Dallas police said at a news conference. One person was killed, and two others are in critical condition, according to federal officials.

A bullet found near the shooter had the words “anti-ICE” written on it, according to the FBI. Other recent shooters, including those who assassinated Charlie Kirk and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, have also engraved messages on bullets.

The anti-ICE messaging surprised Joshua Jahn’s brother, Noah Jahn.

“He didn’t have strong feelings about ICE as far as I knew,” Noah Jahn said of his brother, who DHS officials said fired at the ICE building “indiscriminately.”

Public records show that Joshua Jahn registered as an independent in Oklahoma and last voted in November.

In 2016, he was charged in Texas with delivering marijuana in an amount greater than ¼-ounce but less than 5 pounds. He pleaded guilty to the felony charge, records show.

Noah Jahn described his brother as “unique” but said he was not one he ever would have thought would be involved in a politically motivated shooting.

“I didn’t think he was politically interested,” he said. “He wasn’t interested in politics on either side as far as I knew.”

He said they grew up about 30 miles away in Allen, Texas. He said that they were Boy Scouts and that his brother took an interest in coding but was unemployed. Joshua Jahn had been planning to move onto their parents’ property in Oklahoma, his brother said.

Noah Jahn said that the last time he saw his brother was two weeks ago at their parents’ house and that nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

A man who said he had known Joshua Jahn since his early teens as a member of the same Boy Scout troop in Texas said Jahn did voice his opinions about politics, and he recalled a conversation several years ago about migrant caravans entering the United States.

“He was just upset about how people were not understanding people’s desperation to get out of bad situations and how immigration was being handled as a whole,” the troop member said.

The troop member, who asked not to be named for fear of harassment, said that the shooter was “passionate” about his stance on issues but that he did not know him to be “the action type of person.”

The troop member was surprised that Jahn had been identified as the shooter.

“He was pretty against it,” the fellow troop member said of the notion of gun violence, “so that’s why this is making it even more surprising. He was not somebody that would condone those kind of actions.”

The troop member said he remained friends with him as an adult but lost touch about five years ago when Jahn said he was planning to move to Oklahoma.

He said the shooter’s father was an active troop leader. He said Jahn had helped him move a couple of times.

“He was one of those people that I would call for help, just in different situations, whether it be emotional support or physical support,” the troop member said.

According to Noah Jahn, his brother was “not a marksman” but knew how to use their parents’ rifle. Noah said he did not think his brother would have been able to fire accurately from a nearby roof.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250925-ice-facility-3x2-rs-49ddda.jpg",N,,2025-09-26 01:56:58.180423

The Trump Administration is specifically targeting Latino communities and racial profiling Hispanic and Latino families. These military-style raids, with masked and unidentified enforcement, are separating children from families and are simply un-American.

America is a country built by immigrants with the promise of freedom, equality and the pursuit of justice. The Trump Administration has made a mockery of that as it moves the United States toward an authoritarian state.

Our immigrant community is full of hard-working people who have come to this country to make a better life for themselves. A study by the independent think tank California Budget and Policy Center, published last year, found that undocumented immigrants paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state and local tax revenue in 2022 despite being shut out of the programs their taxes fund.

In California, undocumented immigrants contributed $8.5 billion in state and local taxes in 2022 — which would rise to $10.3 billion if these taxpayers were granted work authorization, according to the study.

Instead, the Trump Administration has painted undocumented immigrants as criminals, “killers, rapists and drug dealers,” and used that as justification for sending in the National Guard and conducting military-style immigration enforcement agents into cities such as Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Chicago — unsurprisingly, cities run by Democratic administrations.

They continue to claim they are arresting “the worst of the worst” criminals. But the data, as documented in a study by the Brennan Center for Justice published in May 2024, does not support the claim that the United States is experiencing surging crime caused by immigrants. In fact, many studies have shown lower crime rates among immigrants compared to natural-born citizens. Instead, it is often hard-working, tax-paying members of our community who are the ones being taken away from their families — sometimes in the middle of their workday.

What’s clear is that the Trump Administration is using illegal immigration as a tool to further divide our country and to attack Democratic states and cities — he is inciting division. Standing up to Trump is not just about standing up for our values or political differences, it’s about protecting all Californians, including our immigrant families.

With a Republican majority in Congress and a Trump-packed Supreme Court, the American system of checks and balances in the federal government has broken down. What has emerged is a system of checks and balances in which states and cities are serving as the check on the Trump Administration. States are challenging the Trump Administration through the courts. Over the first six months of this presidency, the California attorney general filed 37 lawsuits against the federal government.

We must stand up to Trump — in the courts, at the ballot box, and on the streets to protect our immigrant families and communities. Trump has been terrorizing communities and breaking families apart.

Hundreds of bodies could have been buried at a mass grave discovered in Egypt’s Sinai province by human rights campaigners. Bodies lying on the surface and others buried barely 30cm below were found at a burial site near a military outpost by the Sinai Foundation for Human Rights (SFHR). The group discovered the mass graves while conducting research into disappearances and extrajudicial killings of civilians during a decade of conflict in the Sinai region between Egyptian security forces and Islamic State-aligned militants. “This discovery not only sheds light on the scale of violations committed by the Egyptian army during the conflict, but also demonstrates a systematic pattern of unlawful killings and the secret burial of victims, carried out with total impunity,” said Ahmed Salem, the executive director of SFHR.",https://rfkhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1-4-1024x576.png,N,,2025-09-26 00:56:59.556559

The investigation thus far, Mr Patel said on Thursday, ""indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning"".
According to Mr Patel, a handwritten note recovered from Mr Jahn's home read: ""Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'Is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'""","The gunman who opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, Texas, left behind a collection of notes at his home saying he acted alone in an attack that was intended to terrorise ICE agents and minimise harm to detainees at the facility, officials say.

He was identified as Joshua Jahn, 29, a Dallas-area resident who previously attended a community college and had worked as a solar panel installer.

Nancy Larson, acting US attorney for the northern district of Texas, said at a news conference that the shooter's writings were found during a search of his home in Fairview, Texas, following Wednesday's pre-dawn shooting.

Ms Larson said the notes included a game plan of the attack targeting ICE employees and areas at the facility and an admission from the sniper that he was acting alone.

""He wrote that he intended to maximise lethality against ICE personnel and to maximise property damage at the facility,"" she said.

""He hoped to minimise any collateral damage or injury to the detainees and any other innocent people …

""It's clear from these notes that he was targeting ICE agents and ICE personnel.""

Earlier in the day, FBI Director Kash Patel said the suspect had searched for apps in August that track the location of ICE agents and downloaded a list of local Department of Homeland Security facilities.

One immigration detainee at the Dallas site was shot dead and two others were critically wounded.

No federal personnel were injured in the incident.

Within hours of the shooting, the FBI released a photo of an unused bullet found inscribed with the phrase ""ANTI-ICE,"" an early piece of evidence, officials said, that the immigration enforcement agency was the target.

The perpetrator, who the FBI said had opened fire from the rooftop of a nearby building, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound afterwards, Ms Larson said.

The investigation thus far, Mr Patel said on Thursday, ""indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning"".

Mr Patel also outlined additional evidence reinforcing the theory that the attack appeared to have been aimed not at the detainees who were shot but at ICE, the primary enforcement agency of President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown.

According to Mr Patel, a handwritten note recovered from Mr Jahn's home read: ""Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'Is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'""

He did not provide photos or other documentation of the evidence.

Mr Patel also said the suspect had downloaded a document titled Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management, containing a list of DHS facilities and, during a period of several days in August, the perpetrator had searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.

One of the seriously injured victims is a Mexican citizen, according to Mexico's foreign ministry.

The Dallas shooting came two weeks after Charlie Kirk, co-founder of the conservative political group Turning Point USA and a close ally of Trump, was shot dead by a rooftop sniper during a speaking event in Utah, fuelling fears of a new wave of violence in the United States.

Mr Trump and members of his administration immediately blamed left-wing activists for Wednesday's attack, even though there has been no evidence released to suggest the suspect was linked to any outside groups or individuals.

""The radical left is causing the problem, they're out of control,"" Mr Trump said.

""They're saying things and they're really dumb people … and it's going to get worse and, ultimately, it's going to go back on them.

""I mean, bad things happen when they play these games …

""And I don't want to see that happen either, I'm the president of all the people.""

In a joint statement, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives condemned the attack and called for less divisiveness.

""The political and ideologically motivated violence in America has reached a breaking point this year,"" they said. ""We need leaders who bring the country together in moments of crisis — and that is what is required right now.""

Political violence has risen in the United States in recent years, with high-profile attacks targeting figures on both the right and the left, including Mr Trump himself, who endured two assassination attempts during his 2024 presidential campaign.

The older brother of the suspect in the Dallas attack spoke with a Reuters reporter on Wednesday as Joshua Jahn's name began circulating online in connection with the shooting.

Noah Jahn, 30, said he was not aware that his brother harboured any negative feelings about ICE.

Here’s what else you need to know to get up to speed and on with your day.

1️⃣ ICE facility shooting

A shooting at an immigration facility in Dallas has left one detainee dead and at least two others in critical condition. The FBI is investigating the shooting as an “act of targeted violence,” after a “sniper” on a nearby rooftop fired “indiscriminately” at the ICE building. One of the injured detainees is a Mexican national, according to the Mexican government. The shooter was identified as a 29-year-old Dallas resident who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CNN that the shooter was “very much against” ICE agents based on the evidence that has been gathered. The secretary’s comments come as President Donald Trump is blaming the shooting on rhetoric from “radical left Democrats.”

2️⃣ Government shutdown

The federal government could shut down next week if Congress fails to pass a spending bill by the end of the month. While essential services would remain in operation, many government agencies would come to a halt on October 1, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees would go without pay until the deadlock is resolved. The White House budget office is instructing federal agencies to prepare plans for mass firings in the event of a government shutdown, with instructions to target programs they are not legally required to continue. The threat of mass job losses is likely to escalate the partisan funding showdown over the next several days, with Democrats demanding key concessions — most notably, an extension of Obamacare enhanced subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.

3️⃣ Hurricane season

Tropical Storm Humberto has formed in the Atlantic, and another system near the Bahamas could develop soon, putting the East Coast on alert heading into the weekend. Humberto — the eighth named storm of the season — is currently about 500 miles away from the Leeward Islands and is expected to strengthen into a Category 2 or 3 hurricane in the coming days. While it’s forecast to curve out to sea, it’s still too early to rule out potential impacts on Bermuda or elsewhere. Meanwhile, forecasters are closely monitoring a disorganized cluster of storms over the northeastern Caribbean, which is intensifying as it moves toward the Bahamas.

4️⃣ Cyberattacks

An airport in northern Denmark was forced to close today due to unauthorized drones in its airspace — the second such incident this week. The drone sightings come amid a surge in cyberattacks and suspected Russian airspace violations across Europe. Just days ago, sightings of two or three large drones halted all takeoffs and landings for hours at the airport in Copenhagen, in what Denmark’s prime minister called a “serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure.” It’s unclear if the incidents are linked, but the pattern was similar, police said. This also follows a major cyberattack over the weekend that disrupted automatic check-in systems at several of Europe’s busiest airports, including London’s Heathrow.

5️⃣ Powerball winner

A lucky man in Missouri who won half of the nearly $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot has come forward to claim his prize. He held one of only two tickets that matched all the numbers in the September 6 drawing, the second-largest lottery jackpot in US history. The man, who the lottery did not identify, opted for a one-time payment of $410.3 million (before taxes). While accepting the massive prize, he described himself as a homebody and said he’s looking forward to spending quality time with his wife. “The perfect day is sitting at home doing what I do — relaxing,” he said. Referring to his wife, he joked that “she’s going to drag me out of town now.” The man purchased the winning ticket at a gas station in St. Louis. The other winning ticket was sold at a convenience store in Fredericksburg, Texas.

A group of more than 60 Democratic legislators sent a letter to the Trump administration Wednesday that expresses “grave concerns” about ongoing removals to so-called third countries to which immigrants have no connection.

The legislators are requesting that the Trump administration provide “basic information” about the scope of the third-country removal program, which the administration has aggressively pursued. In many cases, people have been sent to nations to which they have no connection and have remained in detention abroad. The Trump administration has fought legal efforts that seek to block—or give people more time—to challenge their removals to unstable countries like South Sudan.

The letter from Democrats asks the administration to explain how frequently it is first attempting to send people to their country of origin, a list of all the countries with which the State Department has agreements to send immigrants, and the number of people sent to third countries without “diplomatic assurances that they will not torture or persecute deported individuals.”

The letter is addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The effort is being led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), along with Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Troy Carter (D-La.), and Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.).

“We are concerned that the Trump Administration is offshoring the immigration detention system in an apparent attempt to evade the due process requirements of the US Constitution,” the members of Congress warned in the letter. “Increasingly, individuals are being ‘whisk[ed]…off the street and onto buses or planes out of the country,’ and into detention facilities in unfamiliar countries, with virtually no notice and no opportunity to have their cases adjudicated or to assert a fear of persecution or torture.”

The most prominent third-country removals conducted by the Trump administration so far involved sending more than 200 Venezuelans to El Salvador’s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. As Mother Jones reported, Venezuelans sent there told us that they faced horrific conditions there; they were released in July as part of a prisoner swap deal. The administration has also used other Latin American countries, along with African nations like Eswatini and South Sudan, for third-country removals.

Under the law, third-country removals are supposed to be used only when it is “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible” to send someone to their country of origin. But there have already been multiple cases in which the Trump administration appears to have made little or no effort to deport people to their home country before sending them to African nations instead.

“In reality, these operations appear to be, at least in part, an attempt to evade the statutory, regulatory, and constitutional due process requirements of the US immigration adjudication process—which President Trump has complained can take years to complete,” the members of Congress wrote. “Fast-tracked expulsions and deportations to third countries allow DHS to deport planeloads of people practically overnight, to whatever country has agreed to receive or detain noncitizens en masse.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25075583393829.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-26 07:57:43.476925

Fairview resident Joshua Jahn, 29, opened fire with a bolt-action rifle at a Dallas ICE field office around 6:30 a.m., shooting across the length of building, through windows, and toward law enforcement vans, where he hit three detainees being transferred.

One died and two were taken to a nearby hospital, where they are undergoing treatment, acting U.S. Attorney Nancy Larson said at a press conference Thursday.

Law enforcement obtained warrants for devices and locations associated with Jahn, and at his home, found a collection of notes. One said: “yes, it was just me and my brain,” Larson said. He referred to ICE agents as ""people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck,” and said he wanted to maximize harm against ICE while minimizing collateral damage.

The fact that he killed a detainee and injured two others was a ""tragic irony,"" Larson said.

“This, what he did, is the very definition of terrorism,"" she said.

RELATED: Dallas ICE office shooting heightens fears among immigrants

It’s unclear how many shots were fired, and the identities of the victims have not been revealed as of Thursday. At least one injured victim was a Mexican national, according to the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Jahn’s notes allegedly revealed he planned the shooting months in advance, and that he wanted to “cause terror” to law enforcement, FBI Dallas Special Agent Joe Rothrock said at Thursday’s press conference.

“He doesn't want to just impact the ICE agents and the law enforcement agents that were carrying out that mission yesterday,” Rothrock said. “He wants to impact ICE agents and law enforcement across the country.”

When asked if Jahn’s suicide was part of his plan, Rothrock said his notes, “indicate that he did not expect to survive this event.”

Evidence shows Jahn used ICE tracking apps designed to spot, track, and locate ICE officers, according to an ICE official. He also downloaded information about several Department of Homeland and Security facilities, said Marcos Charles, ICE executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations.

Charles added there will be increased security at facilities, something Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem already ordered for agencies to do as well.

Earlier that morning, around 3 a.m., Jahn was reportedly seen on camera footage driving with a large ladder in his car, which the DOJ believe is what he used to ""position himself"" on top of an adjacent building. After the shooting started, the Dallas Police Department responded, and eventually found Jahn dead on the roof of that building with a self-inflicted wound.

Found at the scene, according to the DOJ and FBI, were unspent shell casings, one of which was scrawled with the words, ""Anti-ICE.""

The FBI did not find evidence he was a member of any specific political group, and the notes did not single out any agency other than ICE. Other notes found in Jahn's home, according to Larson, made clear he didn’t intend to kill detainees or harm them.

He also wrote, ""good luck with the digital footprint,” Larson said — indicating he likely destroyed digital evidence or otherwise scrubbed his online presence.

While the shooting was likely intended to be an attack on ICE, it also fueled the North Texas immigrant community’s fears of being targeted amid anti-immigrant rhetoric.

It’s also just the latest incident of alleged political violence in recent months.

On Aug. 25, the same Dallas field office received a threat from a man who walked up to the building claiming to have a bomb in his backpack, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The man has since been arrested and charged with making terroristic threats, the agency said.

Less than two months earlier, on July 4, a group of people went to the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado as part of a noise demonstration, according to official complaints. But court documents say things took a turn when a shooter in the nearby woods opened fire at police and correctional officers, hitting one police officer.

Seventeen people have been arrested in connection to what happened that night.

The claim names the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Border Patrol, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as defendants.

Rafie Ollah Shouhed, a longtime Valley Car Wash owner, said he was inside his business at 7530 Van Nuys Blvd. when masked agents stormed the premises. Surveillance video reviewed by KTLA shows a federal agent shoving Shouhed to the ground inside a hallway.

Shouhed told KTLA he stepped outside to speak with the agents, offering proof that his employees were legally authorized to work, but was instead cursed at, pushed back, and body slammed onto the pavement. According to the civil rights claim, three agents then jumped on his back, with one forcing a knee onto his neck while others restrained his arms.

“They grabbed one of my guys, and I told them, hold on, some of these people have papers, they have the documentation here. And the only thing they said was, ‘You don’t F with ICE. We are here,’ and they threw me on the floor … and three of them, they jumped on me and they were sitting on me,” Shouhed told KTLA in a previous interview.

Shouhed claims he told agents he had recently undergone heart surgery, had three stents, and could not breathe, but that his pleas were ignored.

He was handcuffed, transported to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, and held nearly 12 hours without medical attention, he alleges. Despite agents later acknowledging he was a U.S. citizen, Shouhed said he was denied phone calls to his family and released without charges.

After his release, Shouhed was treated at a local hospital for multiple broken ribs, elbow injuries, contusions, and post-concussive symptoms of a traumatic brain injury. He says he continues to suffer both physical and psychological effects.

Attorney V. James DeSimone, who filed the claim on Shouhed’s behalf, said in a statement that federal agents’ actions were “outrageous and unlawful” and violated both federal and California civil rights laws.

The $50 million claim alleges assault, battery, violation of the California Bane Act, deliberate indifference to a serious medical condition, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and other torts. It also claims that DHS, ICE, and CBP maintain policies that tolerate the use of excessive force.

Shouhed’s family said five of his employees were also detained during the raid.

Live Events Why Did Immigrants Vanish from Alligator Alcatraz?","Synopsis

The mysterious disappearance of hundreds of immigrants detained at the Alligator Alcatraz immigration processing center near Miami, Florida, has raised serious concerns. About 800 detainees who were held there no longer appear in ICE's online database, and around 450 others have no listed location, showing only the message to ""Call ICE for details."" Their lawyers and families have been unable to track or contact them, raising fears regarding their whereabouts and welfare.

Florida’s remote detention center in the Everglades—known widely as “Alligator Alcatraz”—is once again under the spotlight. Reports are mounting that hundreds of detainees who were once inside can no longer be traced. Families, lawyers, and immigrant advocates are sounding the alarm, warning that people appear to have simply disappeared from official records.

Alligator Alcatraz, a detention center built rapidly on a former airstrip in the Everglades and endorsed by President Donald Trump during its inauguration in early July 2025, has become known as a ""black hole"" in the immigration system.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and immigrant advocacy groups highlight that detainees are effectively ""off the radar,"" which obstructs due process and attorney-client communication. There have been multiple lawsuits against the facility, challenging Florida’s authority to detain immigrants there and raising issues of poor conditions and mistreatment.

Following a judge’s ruling to dismantle the camp, now stayed by an appeals court, the detainee population at Alligator Alcatraz has significantly decreased. State officials and DHS have stated the facility would soon be empty, with transfers to other centers and some deportations occurring. However, it is unclear how many detainees have been deported or transferred, and reports indicate pressure on detainees to sign voluntary deportations. Incidents such as accidental deportation of detainees have been reported, adding to the confusion.

The Department of Homeland Security claims detainees have opportunities to communicate with attorneys and family and that the number of detainees fluctuates due to deportations and transfers. Nevertheless, advocacy groups criticize ICE for not promptly updating detainee locations and maintaining transparency. The lack of clear information has caused distress among families and legal representatives, with some attorneys needing days to schedule visits.

Live Events

Why Did Immigrants Vanish from Alligator Alcatraz?

The story begins quietly, in the wild heart of the Florida Everglades. There, a new immigration detention center rose up almost overnight. Locals started calling it “Alligator Alcatraz.” Its official name hardly mattered. What people saw and heard mattered more.

At first, thousands were held inside—mothers, fathers, sons, daughters. Most had come from Latin America, many fleeing difficult lives only to find themselves surrounded by heat, humidity, and fences. Inside, stories filtered out: food shortages, drinking water complaints, medical care delays. Some told of cages packed wall to wall, with dozens of people called by number and not by name. The fear was constant—of storms, of illness, of never seeing family again.

But by late summer, almost as suddenly as it filled, the vast camp began to empty. Families waiting for news found the phone calls stopped. Online, the detainees’ names vanished without record. Mothers, fathers, and lawyers called but got no answers. Rumors spread that many had been deported, or shipped elsewhere, or released in secret. Nobody could say for sure. With no public lists and no paper trail, loved ones began asking: “Where did everyone go?”

Searching for Answers in the Shadows

Even government officials struggled to explain. One week the center was bustling with nearly two thousand people; weeks later, that number dropped by more than half. Inquiries to agencies went in circles. Sometimes the official advice was simply, “Call back later.” Families camped out, hoping for word. Lawyers scrambled to track their clients. Human rights groups sounded alarms about disappearing people and secret removals. Was it a data glitch—or a deliberate blackout?

For those stuck outside, the days grew tense and fearful. Family members described the agony of trying to learn whether loved ones were alive and safe, or even within U.S. borders anymore. Some feared the worst. Stories of medical emergencies, denied lawyer visits, and lost court dates made the uncertainty feel even more urgent.

Inside the complex, pressure mounted. Lawsuits accused the facility of violating the rights of detainees and risking lives with poor conditions. Judges weighed in, demanding ICE at least slow down the removals and provide more information. But appeals and bureaucratic delays pushed real answers further away. Meanwhile, buses kept rolling out of the swampland. Each departure brought a swirl of new questions.

What Next for Alligator Alcatraz—and Its Missing Detainees?

As the summer closed, officials announced the site would soon be empty. News crews showed up hoping for interviews. Protesters and faith leaders gathered at the gates, lighting candles for those lost in the shuffle. In courtrooms and city halls, debate raged over the future of detention in America and the growing number of people swept away by changes in policy.

What stands out, in the end, is how quickly lives can disappear from view. When records vanish and systems close their doors, real people are left searching for hope. The fate of those who passed through Alligator Alcatraz is still unknown to many families. Some attorneys say they may never know what happened to all of them.

This story isn’t just about one controversial building in the swamp. It’s about the ongoing struggle over borders, belonging, and basic human rights. What happens when the system loses track of people it was supposed to keep safe—no matter where they came from or why they came here? How long will families and advocates go on searching for answers that may never come?

This mystery, born in the isolation of the Everglades, now follows a trail across the nation—a trail faded by time, confusion, and silence. For those who care about justice, the next chapter is clear: the search must continue until every missing name is found, and every voice has the dignity to be heard.

Barnes, Devlin Barrett, Chris Cameron, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Ephrat Livni",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/24/us/trump-news,"Some administration officials said they believed that the officials whose clearances were revoked would be unlikely to cooperate with prosecutors.
This weekend, Mr. Trump insisted that his attorney general, Pam Bondi, act quickly to prosecute people that he considers his enemies.
So far, the committee, which is the House’s principal investigative panel, has largely received files from the Justice Department that were already public.
Still, many Republican lawmakers have used the committee’s investigation as cover to avoid recording a vote that would anger Mr. Trump.
All three women may face continued pressure from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Trump or their allies to withdraw their support.","In the letter, the White House Office of Management and Budget called on Congress to adopt a short-term measure that would preserve existing funding levels into November. Such a move would buy time for Democrats and Republicans to negotiate a longer-term agreement, which would fund the remainder of the 2026 fiscal year.

Absent that, the White House instructed federal agencies to prepare for a shutdown, setting in motion a process that may darken a vast array of vital government services while furloughing many federal workers without pay beginning Oct. 1.

But the Trump administration coupled its formal notification with an additional directive to agencies, telling them “to use this opportunity to consider Reduction in Force” notices to lay off federal employees. Since taking office, President Trump has invoked this process repeatedly in a campaign that began with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, though some affected workers were later rehired or contested their firing in court.

In the new memo, the White House told agency leaders to focus on eliminating positions where funding has expired, or could not be sourced under other laws, and had been deemed to be “not consistent” with President Trump’s political agenda.

On one hand, the White House signaled the potential firings would “not be necessary” if Congress could strike a short-term deal to avert a shutdown. House Republicans adopted such a stopgap earlier this month, but Senate Democrats quickly rejected it, as they sought to force Mr. Trump to extend a set of expiring health care subsidies.

The administration also indicated, however, that agencies should still “revise” their layoff plans once funding for the 2026 fiscal year is finalized, tasking them to maintain a work force with only “the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out” functions required by law.

“We remain hopeful that Democrats in Congress will not trigger a shutdown and the steps outlined above will not be necessary,” the memo said.

Politico reported the memo earlier Wednesday.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, swiftly rebuked the White House over the directive, describing the threat to fire workers in a statement late Wednesday as an “attempt at intimidation.”

“Donald Trump has been firing federal workers since day one — not to govern, but to scare,” added Mr. Schumer. “This is nothing new and has nothing to do with funding the government.”

Prosecutors have been looking into whether Mr. Comey should be charged with lying to Congress in connection to the F.B.I. investigation of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign’s ties to Russia, which the president claims was a witch hunt aimed at destroying him.

Ms. Halligan, who had no experience as a prosecutor before her recent appointment, could seek to bring charges as early as Thursday, but is expected to take action by Tuesday, when the statute of limitations on Mr. Comey’s congressional testimony expires, according to officials who requested anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.

Even if Ms. Halligan meets her deadline, there is no guarantee the grand jury will determine that the government has met the evidentiary threshold to indict Mr. Comey.

It is not clear if a career prosecutor would be willing to present the case to the grand jury — or if Ms. Halligan or another Trump-allied political appointee would appear in court.

“Perjury is a very difficult crime to prove,” said John P. Fishwick, who served as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia from 2015 to 2017. “The department must show that a particular statement was false and that the defendant knew it was false at the time he or she testified. Because of the difficulty of proof, it is not often pursued.”

Career prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia investigated Mr. Comey and informed Mr. Trump’s political appointees at the Justice Department that there was insufficient evidence to obtain a conviction, according to several people briefed on those discussions.

Over the past week, Mr. Trump has greatly intensified his pressure campaign on the Justice Department by publicly demanding that top officials prosecute Mr. Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general who accused Mr. Trump of inflating the value of his assets.

It is not clear where prosecutors may seek to bring a case against Mr. Comey. The headquarters for the district is in Alexandria, but investigators have been active in other parts of the state, according to two people familiar with the situation.

On Friday, Erik S. Siebert, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney overseeing both investigations, stepped down after Mr. Trump told reporters he had lost faith in Mr. Siebert’s willingness to bring criminal charges.

In his place, the president installed Ms. Halligan, who had been serving as a White House aide.

Mr. Siebert had recently told senior Justice Department officials that investigators found insufficient evidence to bring charges against Ms. James, and had also raised concerns about a potential case against Mr. Comey, according to officials familiar with the situation.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general who runs the day-to-day operations of the Justice Department, had privately defended Mr. Siebert against officials, including William J. Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who had urged that he be fired and replaced with a prosecutor who would push the cases forward, according to a senior law enforcement official.

Devlin Barrett contributed reporting.

The suit was prompted by a February directive from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordering agencies under her purview to stop sending federal money to jurisdictions that do not assist the federal government in immigration enforcement. Many of the states involved in the lawsuit have laws or policies that bar local or state police from assisting federal immigration enforcement.

On Wednesday, Judge William E. Smith of Federal District Court in Rhode Island granted the plaintiffs a permanent injunction in the case. In his 45-page ruling, he rejected the Department of Homeland Security’s contention that the agency was focusing on its core mission of immigration enforcement, and called placing conditions on disaster money “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional.

“Such platitudes cannot substitute for an actual explanation of why it is necessary to attach sweeping immigration conditions to all the grants at issue here,” wrote Judge Smith, an appointee of President George W. Bush.

The Rhode Island attorney general, Peter F. Neronha, noted that the same coalition of attorneys general had been challenging Trump administration policies in court almost since the moment the president took office in January.

“These cases can feel long and daunting, and we still have a long road ahead of us, to be sure,” Mr. Neronha said in a statement. “But today’s decision reminds us that this president cannot impose his will where he does not have the lawsuit power to do so.”

Rob Bonta, the California attorney general, said the ruling also protected state access to Department of Homeland Security grants that help state law enforcement agencies fight terrorism.

“This permanent injunction is a huge win in our case that will protect funding for our communities to defend against terrorist attacks and prepare for emergencies,” Mr. Bonta said in a statement. “This is a good day for the rule of law and public safety.”

The administration has not indicated whether it will appeal, though an aide to Ms. Noem responded to the ruling in a defiant tone on Wednesday evening.

“Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding,” Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, said in an email. “The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”

That move reflected a broader campaign by Mr. Trump to pursue his perceived political enemies, as he has openly pressured the Justice Department to bring cases against them. But in recent weeks, federal prosecutors in Maryland and Virginia have failed to do so, prompting the ouster of at least one U.S. attorney, in the Eastern District of Virginia.

The stalled effort against Mr. Brennan, in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, would be the most recent setback for such prosecutions.

Senior administration officials said on Wednesday that prosecutors believed they were making progress in the investigation of Mr. Brennan. But the decision last month by Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, to revoke the security clearances of current and former national security officials has deeply hampered the inquiry.

The officials said a number of the people stripped of their clearances were likely to be interviewed by Justice Department prosecutors over their involvement on the intelligence community assessment of Russian influence. At least three officials, all of whom worked at least indirectly on the assessment, lost their jobs after their clearances were revoked.

Those firings took many senior intelligence officials by surprise, and were done over the objection of at least one agency head.

But other officials denied that. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has provided huge amounts of material to prosecutors, they asserted, and the most important potential witnesses were not among those who had their security clearances revoked. These officials added that prosecutors, struggling to make a case, were looking for a scapegoat.

A spokesman for the Justice Department said it was committed to working closely with Ms. Gabbard’s agency to end what the administration calls the “weaponization” of intelligence and law enforcement by the previous administration.

Axios earlier reported that the revocations had hobbled the Justice Department inquiry.

Ms. Gabbard said in August that the revocations, which included a number of people who worked on the intelligence assessment, were in response to Mr. Trump’s orders, part of a wider purge of national security officials.

A month earlier, Mr. Ratcliffe, a sharp critic of Mr. Brennan, released a tradecraft review of that assessment before making a criminal referral to the F.B.I. Officials said that the review suggested that Mr. Brennan may have misled Congress about the role that a discredited dossier assembled by a former British spy had played in the assessment.

The revocations complicated the investigation of Mr. Brennan, the senior administration officials said, because it swept up many people involved in the assessment, including those with concerns about how it was handled. Some administration officials said they believed that the officials whose clearances were revoked would be unlikely to cooperate with prosecutors. Others said they believed their credibility with juries might be impaired.

But the revocations did not include the C.I.A. officers who worked most closely with Mr. Brennan and wrote the bulk of the classified report that was issued in December 2016, an unclassified version of which was released in January 2017, two weeks before Mr. Trump took office for his first term.

Mr. Brennan has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and his public comments on the dossier and the intelligence assessment have been consistent. His actions were examined by multiple congressional committees and a special counsel appointed during the first Trump administration. Legal experts have raised questions about whether any prosecution of Mr. Brennan would be possible.

Current and former intelligence officials involved in the assessment are skeptical that Mr. Brennan violated any law, but some believe he did mishandle parts of the assessment. In hindsight, some have said, the dossier should not have been used at all or referred to in the assessment. And Mr. Brennan’s push for providing an intelligence assessment to President Barack Obama before he left office meant that some intelligence officers had little opportunity to shape the document’s conclusions.

Judge Reyes reasoned that the officers’ “inability to perform their duties for 30 days” did not rise to an “irreparable harm” that would justify intervening in the case. She also noted that if they were reinstated, Mr. Trump could move to put them on leave, “rendering them functionally unemployed.”

“The Court recognizes plaintiffs’ exceptional service,” Judge Reyes wrote, adding that the officials “deserved better from their government. They still do. Unfortunately, this court cannot provide plaintiffs more.”

In effect, the ruling was a victory for the Trump administration, even though Judge Reyes largely agreed with the inspectors general that the president had broken the law and flouted their congressionally mandated job protections. The officials performed oversight of the Departments of Defense, State, Education, Agriculture, Labor, Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services, as well as the Small Business Administration.

The ruling also closed a case that began with Judge Reyes scolding the plaintiffs’ lawyers for the manner in which they brought the case. With federal courts overwhelmed earlier this year by a fire hose of presidential actions — met with a corresponding wave of lawsuits by Mr. Trump’s opponents — Judge Reyes excoriated the lawyers for filing the case through emergency procedures that she said had wasted the court’s limited time.

During a hearing in February, Judge Reyes, who was appointed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., went as far as to threaten the plaintiffs with court sanctions if they did not immediately withdraw their emergency request so the case could proceed on a slower timeline. The lead lawyer initially refused but eventually relented after withering criticism from the judge.

The longer Russian statement emphasized “understanding” between Russia and the United States, noted their “mutual interest in finding peaceful solutions” and agreement to continue talking, and denounced “schemes promoted by Kyiv and certain European capitals, aimed at dragging out the conflict.”

Somewhat abstractly, the Russian statement also referred to a “synchronization of watches” on “the entire range of the bilateral agenda.”

The U.S. statement struck a very different tone. According to Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman who issued a terse, 40-word statement on the meeting, Mr. Rubio “reiterated President Trump’s call for the killing to stop and the need for Moscow to take meaningful steps toward a durable resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war.”

Mr. Trump abruptly reversed his stance on the war on Tuesday, posting on social media after a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that “Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

It was a big diplomatic win for Mr. Zelensky who has struggled to get support from Mr. Trump. Last month, after the American president met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Alaska, Mr. Trump insisted that Ukraine would have to make a deal, giving up territory to its powerful neighbor.

But some European diplomats also worried that Mr. Trump was distancing himself from the war — washing his hands of a conflict that he once promised to solve in days or weeks.

Mr. Trump had hoped for an immediate cease-fire out of the meeting with Mr. Putin. It did not happen. But the two leaders spoke effusively about each other and their relationship, leaving little doubt that Mr. Zelensky, who had not been invited to the conference, was the odd man out.

Now, after Mr. Trump’s turnabout — for which he has provided no rationale — Russia is facing a different situation in its dealings with the Trump administration.

Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that the war was “not distinguishing Russia,” and that the country’s failure to win after “fighting aimlessly for three and a half years” revealed weakness. He predicted that Russians would come to resent all the money being spent on the conflict and lauded Ukraine’s “Great Spirit,” which he said is “only getting better.”

On Monday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, referred to Mr. Mangione at a news conference as a “left-wing assassin.” And on Tuesday night, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, told Fox News that the executive was “brutally gunned down” by a so-called antifascist and was celebrated by “communist revolutionaries.”

The comments, made less than two weeks after the Sept. 10 assassination of Charlie Kirk, a right-wing activist, violated an order in April by the judge in Mr. Mangione’s case that explicitly warned Justice Department officials to refrain from speaking publicly about the case in order to ensure a fair trial.

Mr. Mangione is accused of shooting Brian Thompson, the chief executive of United Healthcare, minutes before an investors meeting at a Midtown hotel on Dec. 4. He was captured in possession of a manifesto decrying America’s system of for-profit health care and a “parasitic” insurance industry.

This month, a state judge in New York dismissed terrorism charges against Mr. Mangione, which included a count that could have put him in prison for the rest of his life, though he still faces a murder charge, to which he has pleaded not guilty. In the parallel federal case, he has pleaded not guilty to a murder charge, which could bring the death penalty.

Judge Margaret Garnett’s order on Wednesday comes as Mr. Trump continues to tear down walls between the White House and the Justice Department that were intended to protect its tradition of independence. This weekend, Mr. Trump insisted that his attorney general, Pam Bondi, act quickly to prosecute people that he considers his enemies.

The judge’s order shows how the president’s statements can swiftly affect active prosecutions — and the administration of justice.

The White House referred a request for comment on Judge Garnett’s Wednesday order to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office and Mr. Mangione’s lawyers declined to comment.

On Tuesday, Mr. Mangione’s lawyers, led by Karen Friedman Agnifilo, had complained to the judge that the recent comments by administration officials had “indelibly prejudiced Mr. Mangione by baselessly linking him to unrelated violent events, and left-wing extremist groups, despite there being no connection or affiliation.”

The lawyers said Mr. Kirk’s murder had “only increased this prejudicial rhetoric.”

“The attempts to connect Mr. Mangione with these incidents and paint him as a ‘left wing’ violent extremist are false, prejudicial, and part of a greater political narrative that has no place in any criminal case, especially one where the death penalty is at stake,” the lawyers wrote.

The judge’s original order in April directing Justice Department officials to stop commenting on the case came after Ms. Bondi’s announcement that the government would seek capital punishment “as we carry out President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again.” On Fox News Sunday, Ms. Bondi again discussed the decision. “The president’s directive was very clear: We are to seek the death penalty when possible,” she said.

Later that month, Judge Garnett made it clear that she wanted to depoliticize the atmosphere surrounding the case. The judge directed prosecutors to convey her warning against public commentary to Jay Clayton, the Manhattan U.S. attorney, whose office is handling the prosecution, and that he pass the message to Ms. Bondi “and any of her subordinates at Main Justice.”

In her order on Wednesday, Judge Garnett wrote that Mr. Mangione’s lawyers had cited statements by two high-ranking Justice Department officials that appeared to violate her April order, and a court rule barring lawyers from making comments that could “interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice.”

Judge Garnett directed the government to submit a sworn declaration from either a top official in either the Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office or the Justice Department in Washington explaining “how these violations occurred” and what steps were being taken to ensure none occur in the future.

Any further violations, the judge said, could result in sanctions, which could include personal financial penalties, contempt of court findings or what she called “relief specific to the prosecution of this matter.”

The judge did not elaborate, but Mr. Mangione’s lawyers have asked in court papers seeking dismissal of the indictment that the government be precluded from seeking the death penalty.

“On my very first day in Congress, I’ll sign the bipartisan discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files,” Ms. Grijalva said in a statement on Monday. “This is as much about fulfilling Congress’s duty as a constitutional check on this administration as it is about demanding justice for survivors.”

It is likely to take weeks for the measure — which is cosponsored by Representatives Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, and Ro Khanna, Democrat of California — to come to a vote, and the effort could falter if any of the three Republicans who have signed on withdraw their backing.

But should none withdraw, Ms. Grijalva’s signature would be all but certain to force Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican leaders to confront an issue that they had hoped to dispense with in the face of resistance from President Trump, sharp divisions within their ranks and pressure from right-wing supporters.

The Trump administration’s sudden reversal on a much-vaunted promise to make public investigative files on Mr. Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while facing sex-trafficking charges, prompted an outcry from many of Mr. Trump’s right-wing adherents, who had been primed to expect new revelations. G.O.P. lawmakers have been reluctant to break with the president on the matter, but also fearful of crossing their voters by opposing more transparency about the investigation.

Republican leaders will likely have time to determine their approach. Ms. Grijalva cannot sign the discharge petition until she is sworn in, which is not expected until early next month. Once the petition has 218 signatures, it still cannot be acted upon for seven legislative days when the House is in session. As of this week, the House is not scheduled to return to session until Oct. 7, though members were advised that they may need to return sooner as Congress works to avert a government shutdown.

While the clock ticks, Mr. Johnson has options at his disposal to head off a vote. House leaders generally have an array of procedural maneuvers they can use to thwart legislation. Earlier this year, the speaker turned to the powerful Rules Committee, which determines what legislation reaches the floor, to block another discharge petition he opposed by tying the issue to an unrelated bill.

Still, Republican members of the rules panel, including the chairwoman, Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, have suggested they were not inclined to subvert the will of the majority of the House and block an Epstein-related discharge petition that some of their right-wing constituents would likely want to see succeed.

Many Republicans in Congress have joined their constituents in calling for the full release of the files. But when Mr. Trump began dismissing questions about the issue as a Democratic hoax and urged his supporters to move on, many of the lawmakers quieted down, hoping to avoid having to record a position that would leave them jammed between right-wing voters and the president.

Mr. Massie, who is a vocal Trump critic, and Mr. Khanna teamed to try and force a vote on the issue, introducing a resolution that would demand that the Justice Department release its files within 30 days of passage.

The White House pressured lawmakers not to back the effort, and Mr. Johnson has explicitly opposed the resolution, claiming that its scope is too narrow and that it does not contain sufficient protections for Mr. Epstein’s victims. He has instead pointed to the House Oversight Committee’s ongoing investigation into the matter as a more appropriate vehicle for transparency.

So far, the committee, which is the House’s principal investigative panel, has largely received files from the Justice Department that were already public. The committee’s chairman has said that the department has committed to providing more material, but there is no clear timeline for doing so.

Still, many Republican lawmakers have used the committee’s investigation as cover to avoid recording a vote that would anger Mr. Trump.

As of Wednesday, only three other Republicans had signed onto Mr. Massie’s effort: Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina.

All three women may face continued pressure from Mr. Johnson, Mr. Trump or their allies to withdraw their support. At an event in Kentucky on Wednesday, Mr. Massie told the news outlet Semafor that Republican leaders had already “threatened them politically” and “tried to get the four of us to take our names off of the petition.”

The city’s unemployment rate is now nearly 6 percent, well above the national rate as well as the rate in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs. But while unemployment in the region as a whole is still below the national average of just over 4 percent, the report says, this would soon change “if rates continue to rise at such a rapid pace.”

Though a substantial majority of federal jobs are outside the capital region, no area of the country is more reliant on government work than Washington. With the mass layoffs and cancellations of thousands of federal grants and contracts, many of them recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency and later solidified by Congress, the region has taken a disproportionate hit.

The analysis, as well as a report recently released by the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, found that private sector job growth and entrepreneurial activity in the region have stagnated this year. The job categories that have seen new hires — construction, hospitality and health care — do not align with the skills of many former federal employees who are now looking for work.

Even as the supply of workers has ballooned, the demand for them has not: Job listings in the region lag other metro areas around the country, the Brookings report found, and postings for internships have dropped by 36 percent over the past year. According to a recent survey by the D.C. Policy Center, expectations from business owners and executives about the short-term business outlook of the city have become “quite pessimistic” compared to early 2025.

In a possible sign of this turmoil, the Brookings report found that the year-over-year increase in active home sales listings in the D.C. area was double that of other large metro areas.

In the early days of the Trump administration, when federal job cuts seemed to rise by the day, local leaders emphasized that the capital was moving away from its dependence on federal work, toward jobs in fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing. But this report has little consolation to offer on that point: After a period of marked success in attracting venture capital money, the stream of investment dollars into the region slowed sharply as 2025 unfolded.

Last year “was actually an amazing year for venture capital flow,” said Tracy Hadden Loh, a fellow at Brookings Metro and one of the report’s authors. “So what happened in between 2024 and 2025?”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/24/multimedia/24trump-news-promo-2a-zmtk/24trump-news-promo-2a-zmtk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 21:56:24.539589

In many respects, the United Nations declaration on chronic diseases that world leaders are expected to adopt on Thursday offers bold recommendations to combat soaring rates of hypertension, cancer, diabetes and other health conditions that kill a combined 43 million people a year. The document calls on its 193 member states to adopt universal health coverage and to increase access to mental health services. It also urges countries to add health warnings to cigarette and nicotine products, in an effort to reduce the number of premature deaths from tobacco. (Jacobs, 9/24)

A federal judge in Washington on Wednesday declined to reinstate eight inspectors general fired by President Donald Trump as part of a purge of government watchdogs in the early days of his second term, though she agreed the terminations were unlawful. In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes said it was “obvious” that Trump violated the 1978 Inspector General Act with the firings because he did not provide Congress with a 30-day notice of the dismissals or a valid reason for the removal of the Senate-confirmed inspectors general.

Politico: The Trump Administration Is Pushing Courts To Make More ‘New Law’

Federal courts tend to avoid tackling unprecedented questions that strike at the heart of the separation of powers — the large and small mysteries left by the framers (and amenders) of the Constitution. Judges at every level are painfully aware that their decisions in cases of “first impression” risk unintended consequences that could destabilize the nation’s balance of power. So when those questions present themselves, they often find ways to resolve the cases without issuing far-reaching rulings, or making “new law.” (Cheney, 9/24)

Dallas ICE shooter attacked from a rooftop with engraved bullets, authorities say

A shooter opened fire at an ICE field office yesterday, killing one detainee and leaving two others in critical condition. The gunman was found dead with a self-inflicted gun wound. He has been identified as Joshua Jahn, according to authorities.

No ICE officers were hurt, Dallas police said. The victims' identities have not been publicly released. One of the injured victims is a Mexican national, Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry said.

The motive or what the shooter was targeting was not immediately clear. A bullet found near Jahn bore messages that were “anti-ICE in nature,” special agent in charge of the Dallas FBI office, Joe Rothrock, said. He said the attack was an act of “targeted violence.”

The victims were struck while in a van in the facility’s sally port while the shooter fired multiple rounds from a nearby roof, the second instance in two weeks of a gunman setting up with a gun on a rooftop, opening fire and using bullets with writings.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said more ICE agents and law enforcement officers will be hired in response to the attack.

“My heart goes out to that detainee’s family. We’re charged with their protection, their custody. Nothing like that should happen,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said.

Trump set to sign TikTok deal

President Donald Trump is expected to sign a deal today to facilitate the sale of TikTok from a Chinese-based company to a group of American investors, two senior White House officials said.

The White House has signaled for days that a deal was being finalized, in compliance with a bipartisan law that sought to ban the popular social media platform if it wasn't sold to U.S.-based owners.

One official said as part of the agreement, American users' data will be stored in the U.S. and overseen by Oracle, a software and cloud computing company. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Dell CEO Michael Dell and the Murdoch family would all play a role in the deal, according to the president.

Democratic candidates frustrated with their party see an opportunity

A trend of Democratic outsiders end-running party leaders to launch their campaigns, sometimes in explicit opposition to them, looks set to define the 2026 primaries.

A crisis of confidence among Democratic voters has given encouragement to the types of nontraditional candidates who have been walloped by leadership-aligned rivals in the past, creating a number of crowded and competitive-looking Senate primaries.

Democratic angst following the loss to Trump last year has contributed to the trend in at least five races that could determine the majority, from core battlegrounds like Michigan and Maine to long-shot targets like Iowa and Texas.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has not endorsed in any competitive Senate primaries so far, though Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., who chairs the committee, has not ruled out doing so. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who serves as a DSCC vice chair, said the committee would only intervene in primaries if it was necessary to stop a politically toxic candidate.

WASHINGTON — Today, in response to reports that U.S. Department of Justice officials are preparing to launch a federal investigation into the Open Society Foundations, Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, issued the following statement:

“The accusations levied against the Open Society Foundations are the latest example of just how far the Trump administration will go to silence its critics. It’s clear that the president intends to weaponize the U.S. Department of Justice to seek retribution against his perceived enemies.

“We are living in a modern-day McCarthy moment, as President Trump turns the full weight of the Department of Justice against organizations speaking out against his administration’s increasingly un-American agenda.

“The Open Society Foundations represent a stark contrast to the president’s agenda. Founded by philanthropist George Soros, and now led by his son Alex Soros, the Open Society Foundations champion the creation of open and democratic societies, based on the rule of law, market economies, transparent and accountable government, freedom of the press, and respect for individual human rights. George Soros epitomizes the American dream – a poor immigrant who succeeds beyond anyone’s wildest dreams and then commit his riches to make ours a more perfect union. Alex Soros, who now heads the foundations, represents the best of principled and upcoming leaders. Grantees of the Open Society Foundations are some of the world’s greatest altruists – seeking to level the playing field for the world’s poor, dispossessed, and powerless. The United States government should be lauding the work of the Open Society Foundations, not attacking them.

“The Trump administration’s baseless attack against the Open Society Foundations is a challenge to the values that make this country great. In this time of increased peril for our democracy, all Americans of conscience need to stand with the Open Society Foundations.”

What Expedited Removal Gives the Trump Administration Like its predecessors, the Trump administration is relying on expedited removal to increase deportations quickly, unimpeded by lengthy adjudications or judicial review.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have waited in the hallways to arrest people immediately upon the case’s dismissal.
Court Challenges to Trump’s Expansion The Trump administration’s expansion of expedited removal was quickly challenged in court by groups alleging the moves exceed statutory authority.","The Trump administration has expanded the use of fast-track deportation powers in unprecedented ways to remove unauthorized immigrants in as little as a few hours, on the decision of individual Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel, and without judicial review. This transforms what previously had been a more limited authority for recent arrivals at the border into a far-reaching and potent deportations tool.

The process, known as expedited removal, historically had applied primarily to unauthorized immigrants who had just arrived across a U.S. land or sea border. The administration has sought to expand use of the fast-track authority nationwide, has reportedly used it to order removals of longtime U.S. residents, and has orchestrated maneuvers to use it on individuals previously covered by various temporary protections as well as those with asylum cases pending at immigration courts and asylum offices.

The expansion of expedited removal, which is being challenged in court, offers the administration a major tool to meet its goal of 1 million deportations annually as well as reduce the backlog of almost 4 million removal cases pending in immigration court.

Under the administration’s expanded vision, the powers could, in theory, be applied to at least 2.5 million noncitizens, according to Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates. This includes approximately 1 million migrants who arrived at the southwest border without authorization and were allowed into the United States during the second half of the Biden administration, as well as 1.5 million noncitizens previously granted temporary protections such as humanitarian parole, whom the Trump administration argues are now eligible for expedited removal. The MPI estimates cannot model the entire number of noncitizens who may be subject to expedited removal, for example the population of those who evaded arrest after crossing the border without authorization.

The Trump administration has vigorously justified the expanded use of fast-track removal authority as a much-needed policy to reverse what it terms the migrant “invasion” that occurred under President Joe Biden. Immigration lawyers and others warn the procedure, which comes with limited due-process protections and inhibits immigrants’ quick access to legal counsel, exacerbates the odds that asylum seekers’ fears of persecution will be overlooked—and will also inevitably scoop up some U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, with important costs to civil liberties and constitutional rights.

This article reviews the history of expedited removal and the Trump administration’s efforts to expand its application.

A Contested Interpretation of a Longstanding Authority

Congress authorized expedited removal three decades ago, with the passage of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Since then, more than 3 million noncitizens have been removed under the authority—chiefly individuals encountered at the border or inland ports of entry (such as airports).

President Donald Trump in his first term sought to extend the process nationwide but was slowed by a federal court, and his administration ultimately moved its attention to COVID-19-related border challenges. Just 17 noncitizens were removed through expanded expedited removal procedures during the first Trump term. Early in its second term, the administration quickly revived its more muscular interpretation of the authority, but a federal judge in August blocked geographic and other expansions. The Justice Department swiftly appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit may soon reinstate some of the changes; one member of the three-judge panel considering the nationwide expansion case has indicated he would have already removed the block.

Yet even if the nationwide expansion remains halted, DHS can use expedited removal within a 100-mile zone of U.S. land and sea borders, an area that encompasses two-thirds of the U.S. population. Its mission may be aided by a recent Supreme Court order allowing authorities to apprehend noncitizens to check their immigration status based on their race or ethnicity, language, or type of work.

Box 1. Not All Deportations Are Removals

Removals are only one type of deportation, which is not a legally defined category. Returns constitute the other major type, typically occurring at the U.S. border or a lawful port of entry.

Removals accounted for most deportations during the Obama and first Trump administrations, but returns were more numerous before that time and under President Joe Biden.

Expansion of Expedited Removal Was Slow, then Sudden

Following a period of high-profile and increasing unauthorized arrivals at sea and land, Congress in 1996 established expedited removal for certain noncitizens who arrived without valid entry documents and had been in the country for less than two years. While the statute grants leeway in using the authority, administrations mostly used it for recent border arrivals, concerned that its application in the U.S. interior would raise significant operational and civil liberties concerns.

It quickly accounted for a significant share of removals (but not necessarily of all deportations; see Box 1). The fast-track process accounted for more than half of removals during the Biden administration, from fiscal year (FY) 2022 to FY 2024 (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Expedited Removals and Total Removals from the United States, FY 1997-2025*

* Data for fiscal year (FY) 2025 cover only the first two months of the fiscal year; full data are not available.

Note: The number of Total Removals is not the total number of deportations, which is a non-legal term (see Box 1). Figure does not include data on returns.

Sources: Data for expedited removals from FY 1996 to FY 2013 are from U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Homeland Security Statistics (OHSS), “Immigration Enforcement Actions Annual Flow Reports 2004 – 2013,” updated February 11, 2025, available online; data for total removals from FY 1996-2013 are from DHS, OHSS, “2023 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics,” updated September 16, 2024, available online; data for FY 2014-25 are from DHS, OHSS, “Immigration Enforcement and Legal Processes Monthly Tables-November 2024,” updated January 16, 2025, available online.

Pre-1996, all unauthorized arrivals were processed for removal in immigration court, where mounting backlogs and asylum applications led to lengthening proceedings. With the advent of expedited removal, officials could order noncitizens deported without a hearing before an immigration judge; people making asylum claims were to be quickly screened by asylum officers. The Clinton administration used the authority mostly for migrants arriving without authorization on planes, boats, and at official border posts. Its usage rose rapidly, from 23,000 deportations in FY 1997 to 89,000 in FY 1999, when it accounted for 49 percent of all 183,000 removals.

Subsequent administrations expanded the use of expedited removal, in limited ways. In 2002, President George W. Bush’s administration extended use to migrants who arrived without authorization by sea and had been in the United States for less than two years. In 2004, the process was extended to migrants who had crossed a land border without authorization, had been in the United States for less than 14 days, and had been apprehended within 100 miles of the border.

The Obama administration ramped up use of expedited removal, especially after an increased emphasis on border enforcement in 2011. In FY 2013, DHS conducted 198,000 expedited removals (the most ever in a fiscal year), accounting for 46 percent of all 432,000 removals (also the most in one year). In 2017, before leaving office, the Obama administration extended expedited removals to Cubans; previously, Cubans who reached U.S. soil had been granted parole to enter.

Border Policies Move into the U.S. Interior

The Trump administration in 2019, during its first term, expanded expedited removal across the U.S. interior. The policy was initially blocked by then U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson (now a Supreme Court justice) who ruled the administration had not followed proper administrative procedures. In 2020, an appeals court reversed her order, finding that the administration was not required to provide advance notice of the policy. Though cleared to resume the expanded use during its final months in office, the administration by then had largely turned elsewhere; amid the COVID-19 pandemic, DHS shifted enforcement focus to border expulsions under the Title 42 public health order.

In 2022, Biden rescinded the Trump-era expansion to the U.S. interior and instead focused on using expedited removal at the border, especially after the May 2023 end of Title 42. At that point, expedited removals accounted for the most removals since the Obama administration; 194,000 of all 330,000 removals in FY 2024 (59 percent) were under the fast-track authority.

Upon retaking office, Trump sought to pick up where he had left off. On his second day in office, he expanded expedited removal to “the full scope of its statutory authority.” DHS has not released data on the number of expedited removals carried out from the U.S. interior since then, but the vast majority of migrants arriving at the border have been placed in expedited removal. With record low unauthorized border arrivals, Border Patrol agents have also been assigned to assist with interior arrests and removals, bringing with them their knowledge of the fast-track process.

What Expedited Removal Gives the Trump Administration

Like its predecessors, the Trump administration is relying on expedited removal to increase deportations quickly, unimpeded by lengthy adjudications or judicial review. Issuing an expedited removal order can take just a matter of hours: An immigration official quickly determines whether a noncitizen has a lawful basis for remaining in the United States; if not, the official serves a removal order. There is no administrative hearing or right to an appeal. Once approved by a supervisor, expedited removal orders are final and not reviewable.

In many cases, noncitizens opt to avoid expedited removal by voluntarily leaving the United States without receiving a formal removal order and the consequences it brings, including a bar on re-entry for at least five years. Hundreds of thousands of noncitizens have taken voluntary return over the years.

Box 2. Exceptions to Expedited Removal

Expedited removal cannot be used on all individuals who otherwise might be eligible:

Officers must attempt to verify the claim of someone who purports to be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident (also known as a green-card holder), or hold refugee or asylee status. If they cannot verify the claim, the individual may seek administrative review before an immigration judge.

Unaccompanied immigrant children from countries other than Mexico and Canada may not be placed into expedited removal.

A noncitizen expressing a fear of return to their origin country or who intends to apply for asylum must be referred to an asylum officer for a screening interview.

Proponents of expedited removal underscore the fact that typical removal proceedings in immigration court take more than two years on average, and twice as long in an asylum case, before appeals. Noncitizens wait a decade or more for an asylum interview at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which handles claims by individuals not in removal proceedings. These delays are due to record backlogs, which swelled after historic border arrivals in recent years. (By law, asylum cases are supposed to be completed within six months, but this provision has been violated for years). Approximately 3.8 million cases were pending at immigration courts as of June 2025, of which 63 percent (2.4 million) were asylum cases. Another 1.5 million asylum applications were pending at USCIS as of March. By expanding expedited removal, the administration appears to be trying to avoid adding more cases to these backlogs.

How the Net Has Expanded

Coming into office, the Trump administration pledged to deport a record 1 million unauthorized immigrants per year, and expedited removal was a ready tool to meet this aim. An immediate target: unauthorized immigrants who came during the Biden administration, even if they had been explicitly allowed into the country. A hallmark of the Biden administration’s immigration approach was to use humanitarian parole and other legal processes to allow certain individuals into the United States on a temporary basis, providing protection from deportation and access to a work permit but not a pathway to a green card, in order to relieve record pressure at the border.

During the two-year period beginning in September 2023, MPI estimates that approximately 1 million migrants were released into the United States after arriving without authorization between border posts. An additional 937,000 individuals were, from January 2023 to December 2024, permitted entry through the CBP One app, which the Biden administration used to allow asylum seekers and others to schedule appointments at official border crossings. Another 532,000 noncitizens were admitted through the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan (CHNV) parole program from October 2022 through December 2024. The Trump administration terminated or ended these grants of humanitarian parole and now seeks to place former recipients in expedited removal. It has argued the law allows it to do so regardless of when the parolees entered the country. As such, these groups could theoretically be facing the prospect of fast-track deportation.

Noncitizens who entered through parole programs or via CBP One were required to provide their contact information and U.S. addresses. This now makes it easier for authorities to track and arrest them.

Furthermore, the administration has sought to end some grants of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and deferred action, which may make more people subject to expedited removal. Litigation and ensuing court orders have resulted in a confusing legal landscape, with courts blocking the termination of TPS for more than 900,000 Venezuelans and Haitians, for example. It is unclear whether the Trump administration will allow the renewal of lapsed protections for groups such as Ukrainians who fled the 2022 Russian invasion. These and other populations are not included in MPI’s calculations of those who could be subjected to expedited removal, in part because of the likelihood of overlap with parolees as well as the ongoing litigation.

Notably, expedited removal has historically been applied principally to Mexican and Central American nationals, and it is much easier to quickly remove someone across the U.S.-Mexico border than fly them to a faraway, overseas location. But as the origins of irregular immigrants have diversified in recent years, the administration’s attempts to quickly deport people through expedited removal could become complicated.

Arrests at Immigration Courts and Asylum Offices

In another shift, authorities are targeting noncitizens during their scheduled appearance in immigration court or their USCIS asylum merits interview. When a noncitizen appears for these hearings, government attorneys have in some cases moved to dismiss the case, arguing that doing so allows them to place the individual in expedited removal. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have waited in the hallways to arrest people immediately upon the case’s dismissal.

The actions have a two-fold benefit from the administration’s perspective, helping reach its deportation goal and reducing the asylum case backlog. In expedited removal, migrants expressing fear of return are referred to a USCIS asylum officer for a screening known as a credible fear interview, which can be scheduled as soon as 24 hours after arrest. Interviews are typically held by phone while an individual is detained. Asylum seekers who do not pass this interview can seek a judge’s review, which may be scheduled in the subsequent days. If a judge affirms the individual is not eligible for asylum, they may be immediately removed without further right to appeal.

On the other hand, individuals who pass the credible fear interview are taken out of expedited removal and placed in immigration court proceedings where they may apply for asylum. As such, some migrants whose court cases were dismissed so they could be put in expedited removal may end up back in immigration court, essentially restarting the process. Still a significant percentage appears to be screened out and removed.

Arrests of Long-Settled Immigrants

According to MPI analysis, most of the 13.7 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States as of mid-2023 have lived here for at least a decade. While the general understanding had been that noncitizens who have resided in the United States for more than two years are exempt from being placed in expedited removal, the Trump administration has pushed the legal boundaries. ICE has argued in court that certain noncitizens may be placed in expedited removal past the two-year mark, depending on how they initially entered the country. For instance, certain noncitizens released into the country under a monitoring program and told to check in at an ICE office may years later be placed in expedited removal, ICE said in an internal directive.

Unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the United States for long periods have also reportedly been summarily deported. In one case, a Guatemalan woman who had lived in the United States for 30 years was placed in expedited removal after a traffic stop in Phoenix. In another, a Mexican mother and her adult son, both of whom had been in the country for a decade, were deported 24 hours after their arrest during a traffic stop in Texas. Immigration attorneys have reported other cases, indicating that these may be more than isolated events.

One reason these cases may be occurring is that the burden in expedited removal is on the individual—not DHS—to show that they have lawful immigration status, have been in the country for more than two years, or have an asylum claim. This burden and the speed of the process can lead to serious errors. In the past, U.S. citizens have been removed through expedited removal, such as in a 2000 case when Sharon McKnight, a U.S. citizen with a mental disability, was deported to Jamaica a day after returning to the United States from a long trip.

The lack of legal representation can also exacerbate challenges for noncitizens who may not know how to exercise their rights. Most individuals facing deportation lack legal representation, and many have been issued removal orders before they can make a phone call. Lack of language interpretation can also create challenges, since approximately one in every 12 U.S. residents—including millions of U.S. citizens—had limited English proficiency as of 2023.

Many of these issues have been persistent. In 2005, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom found that 15 percent of requests for an asylum interview were not referred to asylum officers; follow-up reviews in 2016 and 2025 found continued issues, but did not quantify the lack of referrals. “[F]lawed screening and documentation practices, a lack of training and quality control,” and other issues “remain unaddressed 20 years later,” the commission concluded in 2025.

Court Challenges to Trump’s Expansion

The Trump administration’s expansion of expedited removal was quickly challenged in court by groups alleging the moves exceed statutory authority. In August, a federal judge in Washington, DC blocked the application of expedited removal to parolees, ruling the government had exceeded its authority. Days later, the same judge blocked the expansion of expedited removal into the U.S. interior, finding that the administration’s policies violated constitutional due-process rights. The Justice Department has appealed both rulings. In New York City, a federal judge in September allowed the administration to continue arresting noncitizens at immigration court hearings but made it harder for immigration judges to dismiss cases, declaring they needed to provide individualized reasons.

While the expansion of fast-track removal authority remains paused, officials can continue to apply expedited removal to migrants encountered within 14 days of their arrival and within 100 miles of U.S. borders, as has been policy for more than two decades. This 100-mile border zone includes the largest U.S. cities—New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston—as well as all or the vast majority of 11 states. In total, about two-thirds of the U.S. population (213 million people) reside in this zone.

A Slippery Slope

Expedited removal is key to the administration’s goal of quickly removing a maximum number of deportable noncitizens with minimal judicial scrutiny, while also addressing a large case backlog.

This approach contains inherent risks. ICE officers are being compelled to meet arrest targets, and this year the administration aims to hire more than 10,000 new officers, many of whom will arrive with no immigration experience. Combined with the Supreme Court’s order allowing stops based on characteristics such as race and ethnicity, language spoken, and workplace, there is a real risk of racial profiling and arresting U.S. citizens. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh contemplated this possibility in concurring with that order, which allowed federal enforcement operations to resume in Los Angeles. A U.S. citizen or other legally present immigrant may conceivably be caught up in enforcement, Kavanaugh reasoned, but the identity check will be fast and “that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter.”

Left unsaid is that the guarantee of a quick release necessitates all U.S. residents—including citizens and green-card holders—carry proof of their status at all times. The administration’s actions, with the Supreme Court’s assent, will almost surely lead to cases in which U.S. citizens are detained for long periods of time because they cannot quickly prove their status.

As such, by using fact-track removals as its default deportation process, the Trump administration may be changing not just the system for removing unauthorized immigrants, but altering the way in which many U.S. residents now must interact with their government.

Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a vocal critic of President Trump, said Thursday he “fully” expects to be prosecuted by the Trump administration over his criticism but said he refuses to shy away from exercising his right to free speech.
Swalwell and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — who previously served alongside each other in the House — were named “at the very top” of the list “as the two worst,” Swalwell said.
But Swalwell said he’s not going to be intimidated by the Trump administration.
Director, considering that you’ve identified these people as, quote, government gangsters, will you recuse yourself from making any investigation decisions about these individuals?” Patel said “no” he would not and lashed out at Swalwell.
“I’m going to borrow your terminology and call bulls‑‑‑ on your entire career in Congress,” Patel said.","Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), a vocal critic of President Trump, said Thursday he “fully” expects to be prosecuted by the Trump administration over his criticism but said he refuses to shy away from exercising his right to free speech.

“I’m ready for it. I fully expect it,” Swalwell said on “CNN News Central,” when asked if he’s concerned that “down the road you may be prosecuted for your criticisms of this White House.”

Swalwell noted that FBI Director Kash Patel previously wrote a book in which he listed 60 individuals he described as “government gangsters” and said should be investigated.

Swalwell and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — who previously served alongside each other in the House — were named “at the very top” of the list “as the two worst,” Swalwell said.

But Swalwell said he’s not going to be intimidated by the Trump administration.

“Adam Schiff is under investigation now, so, I’m ready for it. I expect it, but I’m not going to flinch. I’m not hiding under the bed. I’m not going to shrink because that’s the aim. That’s why they do this, is they hope that dissent and oversight goes away.”

“And if I shrink and if Adam Schiff shrinks, then why wouldn’t everyday Americans shrink?” he continued. “And so, I’m not going away. And they can come at me, but it’s not going to silence me, and it’s not going to stop me from working every day to put Democrats in the majority so we can finally pump the brakes on the corruption we’re seeing in this administration.”

The remarks come after Trump said Thursday that he didn’t know if the Justice Department would be pursuing charges against former FBI Director James Comey. Comey was indicted later Thursday.

Over the weekend, Trump addressed his attorney general directly in a social media post, complaining that “nothing is being done” to bring cases against several of his political opponents, including Comey and Schiff, adding, “They’re all guilty as hell.”

The president has long called for charges against Comey, a Trump critic, based on his congressional testimony on Sept. 30, 2020, related to the investigation into possible Russian ties to Trump’s 2016 campaign. The five-year statute of limitations on the testimony expires Tuesday.

During a congressional hearing last week, Swalwell asked Patel about the list in his book and whether he would commit to recusing himself from making any decisions on potential investigations into people named on his list. But he declined.

“You identified 60 individuals in that book,” Swalwell said last week. “You put me on that list at the top of the list.”

“Thank you. My children find it flattering. Twenty of those individuals have been investigated or have had adverse actions. Director, considering that you’ve identified these people as, quote, government gangsters, will you recuse yourself from making any investigation decisions about these individuals?”

Patel said “no” he would not and lashed out at Swalwell.

“I’m going to borrow your terminology and call bulls‑‑‑ on your entire career in Congress,” Patel said.

Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said at a news conference in Dallas that the actions of the gunman were the “very definition of terrorism.”

Officials at the news conference tried to resolve what had been a lingering question of a motive behind the shooting on Wednesday, in which no law enforcement officers were hurt but one detainee was killed and two others were critically injured. The gunman, identified by the authorities as Joshua Jahn, 29, killed himself.

Ms. Larson said that Mr. Jahn “very likely acted alone” and had left many notes, which investigators found while searching his home. One read, “‘Yes, it was just me,’” and another referred to ICE agents as “people showing up to collect a dirty paycheck,” according to Ms. Larson.

Ms. Larson said that the notes indicated that he did not intend to harm or kill any detainees, saying that it was a “tragic irony” that only detainees were struck. Officials on Thursday said the detainees who were shot had been restrained in a transport van and could not escape the gunfire, though Marcos Charles, who leads enforcement and removal operations for ICE, hailed the agents at ICE and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for their actions to save other detainees.

The officials declined to identify the detainees who were struck in the shooting. One of the wounded who was hospitalized is a Mexican citizen, according to the government of Mexico.

The city located three-and-a-half hours northwest of New Orleans with a population of 43,000 doesn’t show up on terminal screens; its draw is that it is an ICE deportation flight hub.
While RIC’s activity has increased 10% overall in 2025, per FlightAware’s statistics, the ICE deportation flights may not be included in those statistics.
Immigrant Justice’s online publication “Exposing ICE Detention Contracts and Inspections Transparency Project” lists 96 ICE detention centers nation-wide that sometimes use space in government-run local or state facilities.
To watch an ICE deportation flight at RIC raises numerous questions of accountability about what just occurred and who was involved.","Hidden in plain sight, behind the Richmond Jet Center and less than a mile from the Richmond International Airport terminal, throngs of shackled people have been loaded onto airplanes with no attributed owner about 80 separate times so far this year, according to a human rights organization and Citizen observations.

Human Rights First reports that those people then have in many cases been flown (either directly or indirectly) to the country’s largest U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement hub in Alexandria, Louisiana, where more than 1,000 deportation flights from cities throughout the U.S. have landed since January.

These are not flights that RIC passengers on Delta, American Airlines or Southwest routes will see listed on the arrival or departure screens in the main terminal. These passengers never enter the terminal’s doors, since Richmond Jet Center (the fixed-base operator facilitating the flights) operates as a private terminal.

But the deportation domestic transfer – or “shuffle” – flights, which facilitate movement of ICE-detainees between a growing network of domestic immigration detention centers, share the runway with the other commercial jets.

The HRF's recently released document “ICE Flight Monitor August 2025 Monthly Report” puts RIC among the top airports this year for such ""shuffles."" Through August, according to the report, RIC had witnessed 72 inbound ICE flights, ranking it 16th in the nation between Dallas, Texas (with 75 flights) and Las Vegas, Nevada (71).

Once they land, those flights pick up their passengers and fly either to another domestic airport to do the same thing or to a final U.S. destination (often Alexandria, Louisiana) to drop those passengers off.

Determining who the passengers on these types of ICE flights are, where they were detained and what evidence exists to demonstrate their illegal presence in the U.S. has proven difficult for a number of media outlets nationwide.

But there are many more of the flights this year than there were in 2024.

From Jan. 20 to Aug. 31, the HRF report shows there were a total of 4,422 domestic transfer flights in the U.S. – up dramatically from the 2,507 such flights during the same period in 2024.

This August alone, through open-source flight tracking platforms, ICE Flight Monitor tracked 805 shuffle flights across the country.

Human rights concerns

Besides the lack of awareness that unobserved deportation flights are occurring in communities such as Henrico, the HRF flags these flights as methods for the Trump administration to achieve mass deportations by means of expedited removal – including potentially terminating protected legal status, disappearing people without due process including transferring people to high security prisons in El Salvador and forcibly transferring people to other countries of which they are not citizens.

“These actions, many of which have been determined to be unlawful by federal courts, have been carried out with little to no transparency, while thousands of people’s lives are uprooted from communities across the country and their rights are systematically violated,” according to the HRF report.

The organization also raised concerns about the conditions in which people on immigration enforcement flights typically are handled, reporting that they “are generally restrained by handcuffs, waist chains and leg irons, including during any layovers and fuel stops.”

Some, it reported, have been shackled for as long as 30 hours on multi-country flights.

Additionally, numerous national media outlets along with the American Immigration Council reported $14.4 billion is being spent on ICE arrests, detention and deportation flights, and the recently passed H.R. 1 law dramatically increased ICE’s total annual budget from $9.9 billion in 2024 to $28.7 billion.

For many groups, that number is a concern.

Shackled people loaded onto 2 separate flights Sept. 17

Last week, before an unmarked, 55-seat, white EMBRAER EMB-145XR airplane with blue tail stripes and N974DC marking touched down at 11:22 a.m. on Wednesday morning on the Richmond International Airport tarmac, its route was shown on the app FlightAware as it left the Alexandria, Louisiana airport, with the unknown identifier TYSON59.

The city located three-and-a-half hours northwest of New Orleans with a population of 43,000 doesn’t show up on terminal screens; its draw is that it is an ICE deportation flight hub.

Investigations in publications such as the The New York Times show that the name more commonly associated with a chicken producer is being used by ICE and its contractor airlines to conceal deportation flights from public logs. Simple Flying reported the many airlines contracted by ICE are flying under false, so-called “dummy” call signs to avoid being tracked by watchdog civil rights groups and members of the American public.

By the time the plane pulled up to the private Richmond Jet Center terminal on that drizzly morning Sept. 17, three unmarked white vans with darkened windows awaited it.

As observed from outside fencing topped with concertina wire surrounding the FBO area, shackled men dressed in street clothes emerged one by one from the vans to walk up the airplane steps, being frisked on the way by people in dark and fluorescent unidentified uniforms, with no clear law enforcement markings.

As this process continued, another larger airplane arrived with the Eastern airline’s logo on its side and orange and blue swirling design on its tail. The taller and longer Boeing 777-200ER, accommodates 379 economy seats and is billed on the airline's website as being built for long-haul passenger flights.

Handlers and people who appeared to be guards dropped a collection of backpacks and red plastic bags on the tarmac with what might have been the belongings of the shackled men. Those bags then were loaded into the back of the EMBRAER airplane.

Once all the shackled passengers were loaded onto the plane from the vans, a man entered the plane, emerging minutes later with shackles that hung to the ground, which he threw inside one of the vans with finality.

Once full and loaded, the crew closed the door of the smaller plane and taxied to the runway for takeoff at 12:13 p.m. into the clouds in as perfunctory a way as it arrived.

A white bus and multiple vans then neared the Eastern Boeing 777-200ER airplane then ready on the tarmac for its shackled passengers to board, repeating the process of sending shackled men from the vehicles to the plane with a pause for frisking. Delta, American Airlines and Southwest planes, as well as smaller planes, landed and took off at the airport during this process.

Again, crew dropped red plastic bags of belongings on the ground toward the rear of the plane and then loaded them as a fuel truck serviced the aircraft. Rain drizzled down. The men wearing street clothes continued to board in shackles.

Again, as the vehicles emptied and the plane filled, the red bags were loaded, and the mundane procedures of takeoff took place. A staffer wearing fluorescent clothing stood in front of the plane to wave it onto the runway as the Eastern airplane waited its turn on the runway.

At 1:12 pm, the Eastern airlines flight ascended, following an an American Airlines flight, disappearing into the clouds in the southwest direction as the rain continued to drizzle.

FlightAware again captured the route of the previous flight of the EMBRAER EMB-145XR airplane with blue tail stripes and N974DC marking, which landed in Alexandria, Louisiana not long after the Eastern plane took off.

'We don’t give information out'

Verifying if the scene was in fact a deportation “shuffle” flight proved challenging, as a special security classification was granted to ICE by the Trump administration. Though ICE did not respond by publication time to an email and Freedom of Information Act request from the Citizen seeking clarification about the scene at RIC or the numbers cited in the HRF report, it was still well within its legal 20-day window of time during which it may do so.

The receptionist at the Richmond Jet Center would not explain if the shackled men boarded onto flights on the tarmac in front of the location minutes earlier were part of an ICE deportation flight, either.

“Most of these are private and corporate jets, and these larger ones are private also. We don't give that information out,” the receptionist said.

When asked if the Richmond Jet Center records flights and could provide a record of flights directly or through the airport log, the receptionist said, “We don’t have to record anything.” Reporting movement, she said, was up to the carrier.

An RIC spokesperson also said he did not have knowledge or information about ICE deportation flights, although he said he was familiar with the The New York Times report naming Richmond as an airport from which ICE deportation flight originate.

Varina District Supervisor Tyrone Nelson (whose district includes the airport) and Fairfield District Supervisor Roscoe Cooper, III – both of whom are members of the Capital Region Airport Commission – told the Citizen Sept. 25 that they were not aware of ICE flights at RIC.

“I didn't know it was happening,"" said Nelson, who serves as vice chair of the commission. ""I need to learn more. I mean, it sucks. I don't like ICE, and I don't like these whole mass deportation efforts for political clout. I'll find out more.”

Vehicles and uniforms used on the tarmac point to the GEO Group, a private corrections contractor benefiting from the ICE expansion. A search into government contracts, other investigations and the GEO Group’s Richmond job listing descriptions matched the actions viewed Sept. 17.

The GEO Group is looking to hire Richmond-based transportation officers who “securely transport federal detainees between destinations in high-risk operations and high-profile federal government transportation contracts.”

The GEO Group also has job openings for flight security officers, based in Alexandria, Louisiana to perform activities seen in front of the Richmond Jet Center Sept. 17 – specifically, to load and unload people onto and off of aircraft and search the passengers. People in these roles also apply restraints and remove them as applicable.

An email response from Christopher V. Ferreira, the GEO Group’s director of corporate relations did not answer any questions posed about the company's activities at RIC – and specifically those seen Sept. 17 – and deferred questions to ICE.

An Aug. 14 report by CNN on the rise of ICE flights and the challenges of tracking them recorded similar scenes of shackled men boarding planes at the Richmond Jet Center. The reporter said the blocked tail numbers makes it impossible for families to track the detainees who might spend hours shackled.

HRF deportation flights data logged between 2020 and 2025 puts RIC in the top 20 spot of domestic departure cities, with a total of 326 ICE outbound flights. That means the number of flights tracked in 2025 compose about 25% of the total deportation flights from the airport during that time.

The HRF report concluded that in total this year through August, there had been been more than 7,700 removal, removal-related or domestic shuffle immigration enforcement flights.

The most recent ICE Air Flights tracking report by the Witness At The Border group, which bears witness to “the consequences of policies which inhibit the right of people to migrate,” documented a total of 1,214 ICE deportation flights in July 2025, with 727 being domestic shuffle flights, like the ones that flew out of RIC Sept. 17.

The report described domestic ICE air contracts with the airline broker CSI Aviation, which it said in turn subcontracts the flights to GlobalX, Eastern Air Express, Avelo Airlines, World Atlantic (Caribbean Sun), Eastern Air, OMNI Air, and Kaiser. Historically, and currently, the vast majority of the flights are operated by GlobalX, Eastern Air Express and Avelo, the report said.

International deportation flights have another set of organization and carriers.

Witness At The Border’s information is based upon securing all flight information from the publicly available FlightAware application, FlightRadar24, AirNav, and the ADB-S tracking system. Monitors then filter the flights to the likely ICE Air removal and destination locations to identify the removal flights.

The Alexandria, Louisiana airport’s activity has increased 60%, according to FlightAware. The app’s data demonstrates the role that the airport apparently plays on any given day in receiving ICE deportation “shuffle flights” from throughout the country and then deportation flights bound for destinations abroad.

While RIC’s activity has increased 10% overall in 2025, per FlightAware’s statistics, the ICE deportation flights may not be included in those statistics.

But deportation flights originating from RIC have been public knowledge for several months.

A July, investigative report produced by The New York Times explained “How Louisiana Became ICE Detention Central,” through which journalists tracked flights from around the country to the small community described as the top ICE transit hub for deportations in the country.

The video report called out RIC as a deportation flight destination.

No other Virginia airport is listed in the HRF report, and the two North Carolina airports listed received only a combined total of 10 inbound ICE flights through August this year, leading to the understanding that RIC is a hub to ship off detained people from area detention centers.

Immigrant Justice’s online publication “Exposing ICE Detention Contracts and Inspections Transparency Project” lists 96 ICE detention centers nation-wide that sometimes use space in government-run local or state facilities.

Six detention centers in Virginia, with locations throughout the state (including sites where ICE has contracts), include the Caroline Detention Facility, Hampton Roads, Immigration Centers of America Farmville, Northwestern Regional Juvenile Detention Center, Rappahannock Regional Jail and Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail.

In North Carolina, ICE has a detention contract at Henderson County.

ICE agents made 4,264 arrests in Virginia during the first seven months of the year, nearly three times the number for the entire previous year, according to an analysis of federal court records compiled by VPM, but most of those detainees did not have criminal records.

Other recent reporting cites the removal of dozens of immigration judges, raising concerns for some about the right to due process for those who are detained.

To watch an ICE deportation flight at RIC raises numerous questions of accountability about what just occurred and who was involved.

But as the Eastern Airlines flight departed RIC Sept. 17 in view of the airport administration building and the private terminals, disappearing into the clouds, few people were there to witness it.",https://www.henricocitizen.com/content/images/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-25-at-2.52.54-PM.png,N,,2025-09-25 22:56:41.224314

On Thursday, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau led a panel called “Global Refugee Asylum System: What Went Wrong and How to Fix It”, where he called upon other countries to crack down on asylum seekers.

“If you have hundreds of thousands of fake asylum seekers, then what happens to the real asylum system?” Landau said. “Saying the process is susceptible to abuse is not xenophobic; it is not being a mean or bad person.”

Trump has sought to overhaul the US immigration system and recruit other countries to join in its efforts. Thursday’s panel included representatives from Kosovo, Bangladesh, Liberia and Panama.

Among the changes the Trump administration has sought is a reimagining of the asylum system, which started to take shape following World War II.

Landau explained that the US would like to see asylum become a temporary status, with claimants eventually returning home.

The Trump administration also emphasised that there is no right to receive asylum in a country of choice.

Under the current system — enshrined in US law in 1980 — people seeking asylum are able to apply once they are on US soil, regardless of whether they arrived through legal pathways.

To qualify, applicants have to show a fear of persecution in their home country because of specific reasons related to their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinions.

Applications can sometimes take months, if not years, to be reviewed. Still, Landau argued that the system has become vulnerable to fraud.

“The asylum system has become a huge loophole in our migration laws,” Landau said. “I think we have to be realistic that these laws are now being abused.”

But suspected fraud in asylum claims accounts for a small fraction of unsuccessful claims, according to the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting in April.

Trump champions immigration crackdown

Since winning his second term in the 2024 elections, Trump has made stemming immigration a core focus of his presidency.

Part of that campaign has been tightening the asylum process. On January 20, his first day back in office, Trump issued a proclamation invoking the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as a means of restricting asylum at the southern US border.

“This authority,” Trump wrote, “necessarily includes the right to deny the physical entry of aliens into the United States and impose restrictions on access to portions of the immigration system.”

The proclamation was necessary, he argued, to halt what he described as an “invasion” of immigrants.

But in July, a federal court ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by barring asylum claims.

Congress, the court explained, had established the laws governing asylum. If the president were allowed to disregard those laws and establish his own asylum policies, he risked creating an “alternative immigration system”, according to the ruling.

That same month, a federal judge ruled the president could not block approved refugees from entering the country under the guise of a wider travel ban.

Critics have long argued that Trump’s policies risk forcing asylum seekers back into dangerous circumstances where their lives and wellbeing could be at risk.

In a statement to The Associated Press, Bill Frelick, the director of refugee and migrant rights at Human Rights Watch, said the US’s plan “looks like the first step in a bid to tear down the global refugee system”.

But Trump himself has used his platform to warn of the dangers he claims are associated with immigration.

In his speech to the UN General Assembly this week, Trump argued that accepting immigrants was “destroying” other countries. He pointed to Europe as an example.

“They’re being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble. They’ve been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody’s ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ap_68d2c00dd32e2-1758642189.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-25 19:57:56.258439

Ruling marks the significant milestone of winning final judgment and a permanent injunction from the District Court

September 25, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — Attorney General Ellison today announced an important victory in a multistate lawsuit he and a coalition of other attorneys general filed against the Trump administration over its attempt to illegally coerce states into sweeping immigration enforcement by threatening to withhold billions in federal funding for emergency preparedness and preventing and addressing terrorist attacks, mass shootings, wildfires, floods, cybersecurity threats, and more.

Yesterday afternoon, September 24, U.S. District Court in Rhode Island granted a motion for summary judgement that Attorney General Ellison and 20 attorneys general requested in their May 13, 2025 lawsuit against the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The court held that the agencies violated the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by conditioning all federal funds from FEMA and DHS on states’ agreement to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.

In yesterday’s decision, the court agreed that DHS violated the Administrative Procedure Act in adding the conditions, including because the agency failed to consider public safety in doing so and because the conditions are overly broad and ambiguous. The court further found that the conditions violate the Constitution’s Spending Clause. The court rejected DHS’ argument that placing immigration-related conditions on the grant funding was appropriate simply because many of the grants are designed to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. Instead, the court determined that DHS made no serious attempt to provide a fact-based reason for its action. In fact, the court found that the “vague and confusing language” used in the conditions made it nearly impossible for states to comply.

The state of Minnesota uses funds from FEMA to work with local law enforcement to fight crime, provide incident management support after natural disasters, purchase bomb squad equipment, train first responders, and more. Losing access to that funding would have jeopardized public safety across Minnesota.

""The Trump Administration tried to stop our tax dollars from coming back to Minnesota to fund law enforcement, prepare for natural disasters, and improve public safety. Fortunately, they did not succeed,” said Attorney General Ellison. “Minnesotans would be less safe if our police stepped away from their patrols, investigations, and community-engagement work to instead enforce Trump’s immigration priorities. I am pleased to have successfully blocked this unconstitutional attempt to divert police resources away from the communities they serve, and I will continue to defend the rule of law and protect the rights and safety of Minnesotans everywhere.”

In February, Secretary Noem directed DHS and its sub-agencies, including FEMA, to cease federal funding to jurisdictions that do not assist the federal government in the enforcement of federal immigration law. In March, DHS amended the terms and conditions it places on all federal funds to require recipients to certify that they will assist in enforcing federal immigration law. These sweeping new conditions would require states and state agencies to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts or lose out on billions of federal dollars that states use to protect public safety.

In filing the May lawsuit, Ellison and the coalition argued that the immigration conditions exceed DHS’s legal authority and violate the Constitution because the programs in question were established to help states prepare for, protect against, respond to and recover from catastrophic disasters, not for immigration-related purposes. The district court agreed, holding that imposing the condition on all DHS and FEMA programs, regardless of the purpose of those programs, was unlawful.

Joining Attorney General Ellison in the lawsuit, which was co-led by the attorneys general of California, Illinois, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, were the attorneys general from Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Vermont.",https://www.ag.state.mn.us/_Img/Logo_SM.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 20:57:48.022602
,Litigation,2025-09-25 21:26:56+00:00,Iowa Capital Dispatch,Woodbury County sued as ICE detainees remain jailed despite judges' orders,"Clark Kauffman, Tim Henderson",,,,,https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2025/09/25/woodbury-county-sued-as-ice-detainees-remain-jailed-despite-judges-orders/,"A western Iowa county is being sued over the federal government’s refusal to release jailed immigration detainees, even in cases where judges have ordered their release on bond.
When detainees request a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge, judges often deny the request on the basis that under DHS’ newest interpretation of federal law, they have no jurisdiction over the matter.
One of those cases involves Armando Garcia Picazo, who was arrested by ICE on Aug. 8, 2025, in Sioux City.
Court records indicate that after he was arrested, Garcia participated in a bond redetermination hearing in front of an immigration judge.
As part of that lawsuit, Woodbury County Sheriff Chad Sheehan is being sued due to his having physical and administrative custody over Garcia.","A western Iowa county is being sued over the federal government’s refusal to release jailed immigration detainees, even in cases where judges have ordered their release on bond.

The lawsuits claim that federal immigration officials have concocted a “scheme” whereby detainees with no criminal record can be jailed indefinitely despite judges approving their release upon payment of a bond.

The cases stem from a policy that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security adopted in July 2025, holding that all employees of DHS’ Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), were to consider anyone who is alleged to have entered the United States illegally to be subject to mandatory detention.

When detainees request a bond redetermination hearing before an immigration judge, judges often deny the request on the basis that under DHS’ newest interpretation of federal law, they have no jurisdiction over the matter.

In the past three weeks, a growing number of detainees have sought relief from such rulings by filing lawsuits that go before federal judges in U.S. District Court. That’s partly because of a Sept. 5, 2025, decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals. In that decision, the board adopted DHS’ latest interpretation of the law, finding that immigration judges lack the authority to even consider bond requests.

Now, another twist has been added to the legal conflict: Even in those cases where an immigration judge has set a bond for immigration detainees seeking release while their cases are pending, Homeland Security and ICE are refusing to accept payment of that bond and are keeping the detainees behind bars in county jails.

The result is that counties operating those jails are now being sued in federal court. In Iowa’s Woodbury County, for example, two such lawsuits were filed in the past week.

One of those cases involves Armando Garcia Picazo, who was arrested by ICE on Aug. 8, 2025, in Sioux City. According to court records, that arrest stemmed from an ICE and Drug Enforcement Administration surveillance operation that centered on another individual.

According to Garcia’s attorneys, the government has admitted that because Garcia “looked like” the individual being sought, he was detained and was later charged by ICE for having no legitimate immigration status in the United States.

Garcia has lived in Iowa for about nine years and has no criminal history, according to his lawyers.

Court records indicate that after he was arrested, Garcia participated in a bond redetermination hearing in front of an immigration judge. Citing Garcia’s lack of criminal history and his ties to the community, the judge on Sept. 12, 2025, ordered Garcia’s release upon payment of a $6,000 bond. Garcia’s family then attempted, without success, to post the bond.

“ICE will not allow them to post it,” Garcia’s lawyers argue in their newly filed lawsuit. “ICE refuses to release Mr. Garcia from custody, relying on a federal regulation giving DHS unilateral authority to block an immigration judge’s custody order.”

Garcia’s lawyers are now asking a U.S. District Court judge to intervene, rule that Garcia’s detention is unconstitutional, and order his release from jail upon payment of the bond.

As part of that lawsuit, Woodbury County Sheriff Chad Sheehan is being sued due to his having physical and administrative custody over Garcia. The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Sheehan at his office on Thursday.

“For nine years, Garcia has worked hard, paid taxes, and contributed to the Iowa community,” Garcia’s lawyers have told the court in seeking intervention. “Mr. Garcia has significant ties to the community … He has many friends and is a skilled mechanic who often helps his community while expecting nothing in return. He has no criminal record and has never had any legal issues whatsoever until the current civil proceedings. Mr. Garcia was arrested by ICE on August 8, 2025, while walking out of his home because he apparently resembled a different man the government actually intended to arrest.”

The other Woodbury County case involves Francisco Torres Aleman, 34, of Omaha, who was detained in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, on June 28, 2025.

According to his lawyers, Aleman was born in Guatemala and came to the United States at least 12 years ago. They say he has no criminal history and is the father of two daughters who are U.S. citizens.

Court papers filed by Aleman’s attorneys give conflicting accounts as to how Aleman was arrested. In their petition seeking intervention by U.S. District Court, they state that Aleman was “arrested following a traffic stop in Sioux Falls,” but in that same document they say he was “detained while washing his car on June 28, 2025.”

Court records indicate that on Aug. 19, 2025, an immigration judge authorized the posting of a $20,000 bond that would allow for Aleman’s release while his immigration case was pending. Aleman’s family then attempted to post the bond through the required computerized processing system called “ICE CeBonds,” but each attempt was allegedly denied.

Aleman remains behind bars in the Woodbury County Jail, his attorneys allege. In seeking court invention, they argue that his continued detention not only contradicts the judge’s order on bond, it also inhibits his ability to argue against his removal from the country in that he can’t communicate with potential witnesses or earn wages to afford legal representation in the case.

“This scheme,” Aleman’s lawyers argue in court, is “plainly designed by the executive branch to give DHS the power to circumvent both immigration judge and Board of Immigration Appeals orders … The regulations are written in such a way that it does not matter what either the immigration judge and Board of Immigration Appeals orders; if the government disagrees, the government can, through its own actions and per its own regulations, keep the noncitizen detained indefinitely.”

In addition to Sheriff Sheehan, the two Woodbury County cases name as defendants Peter Berg, the director of the ICE field office in St. Paul, Minnesota; Todd M. Lyons, the acting director of ICE; Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security; Pamela Jo Bondi, the attorney general of the United States and head of the U.S. Department of Justice; and President Donald J. Trump .

Novel nonpeptide SST2 agonist PALSONIFY advances the treatment paradigm as the first once-daily, oral therapy approved by the FDA to treat acromegaly

Approval based on data from two pivotal Phase 3 trials where PALSONIFY was well tolerated and resulted in rapid, durable, and consistent biochemical control and reduced symptom burden

Launch of lead product PALSONIFY marks a pivotal milestone for Crinetics as the premier endocrine-focused global pharmaceutical company

Investor call to be held today at 6:00 pm ET

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: CRNX) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved PALSONIFY TM (paltusotine) for the first-line treatment of adults with acromegaly who had an inadequate response to surgery and/or for whom surgery is not an option. PALSONIFY, a selectively-targeted somatostatin receptor type 2 nonpeptide (SST2) agonist, is now the first once-daily, oral treatment approved for adults with acromegaly.

""With the FDA approval of our lead therapy Palsonify, today marks a new era for those living with acromegaly and also for Crinetics as a company,” said Scott Struthers, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Crinetics. “We are very pleased to be fulfilling our commitment to transforming patient lives. This approval is the first to come from our deep pipeline of first-in-class, small molecule drugs. This would not be possible without the help and partnership of people living with acromegaly, their caretakers, our employees, and the clinical researchers and health care professionals who contributed to Palsonify’s successful development program. Thank you to all involved.”

The approval is based on data from the PATHFNDR-1 and PATHFNDR-2 Phase 3 pivotal trials, which evaluated PALSONIFY’s safety and efficacy in previously treated and medically untreated adults with acromegaly. Across both trials, PALSONIFY consistently demonstrated rapid onset, reliable biochemical control, and sustained efficacy.

Participants also reported significant reductions in signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly as measured by the Acromegaly Symptom Diary (ASD) — an FDA-aligned patient-reported outcome tool developed to capture the symptoms that matter to people living with acromegaly. Symptoms include headaches, joint pain, sweating, fatigue, weakness, swelling, and/or numbness/tingling. PALSONIFY was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in the randomized controlled portion of the trials.

Long-term results from the open-label extension (OLE) phases of both trials were presented at this year’s Endocrine Society’s annual meeting, ENDO 2025, providing further evidence of PALSONIFY’s ability to deliver durable IGF-1 control, sustained improvements in patient symptom burden, and a consistent safety profile. Ninety-one percent of patients from PATHFNDR-1 and 97 percent of completers from PATHFNDR-2 enrolled in the OLE.

“The PATHFNDR clinical development program set a new standard for acromegaly treatment by demonstrating the ability of Palsonify to drive both biochemical and symptom control, regardless of the degree of underlying disease severity,” said Dr. Shlomo Melmed, Executive Vice President of Medicine and Health Sciences and Dean of the Medical Faculty at Cedars-Sinai. “The approval of Palsonify is a significant advancement for our patients, as there is an unmet need for an easy-to-administer and safe therapeutic option with a rapid action and durable response that can consistently manage acromegaly.”

“For people living with acromegaly, treatment once meant burdensome injections, breakthrough symptoms, and lifestyle sacrifices just to stay on track,” said Jill Sisco, President of Acromegaly Community. “What matters most to our community – maintaining consistent control so the disease doesn’t control us – led us to partner with the FDA on Externally Led Patient-Focused Drug Development meetings. This new treatment reflects that our voices have been heard in shaping the next generation of acromegaly care.”

PALSONIFY is expected to be available in the U.S. in early October. Crinetics is ensuring broad access to PALSONIFY by working closely with payers, healthcare providers, and patient advocacy organizations to support those who may benefit from this treatment.

As part of this commitment, Crinetics has launched CrinetiCARE ® , a comprehensive support program designed to assist people living with acromegaly throughout their treatment journey. CrinetiCARE provides disease and product education, benefit verification, financial assistance resources, and access to dedicated nurse educators who can offer support with treatment onboarding and ongoing adherence. For more information, visit www.CrinetiCARE.com or the PALSONIFY product website Palsonify.com .

A Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for paltusotine in acromegaly is currently under review for use in the European Union, and the current timeline for the Committee for Medicinal Products and Human Use (CHMP) opinion is the first half of 2026. Crinetics is in partnership with Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyuso (SKK) to develop and commercialize paltusotine for acromegaly in Japan.

Paltusotine is also being evaluated for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome in the pivotal Phase 3 CAREFNDR trial.

About PALSONIFY™ (Paltusotine)

PALSONIFY, a selectively-targeted somatostatin receptor type 2 (SST2) nonpeptide agonist is the first and only once-daily, oral therapy approved for the treatment of adults with acromegaly who had an inadequate response to surgery and/or for whom surgery is not an option. In Phase 3 studies, once-daily, oral PALSONIFY maintained IGF-1 levels and symptom control in patients with acromegaly who were switched from monthly injectable medications (PATHFNDR-1) and rapidly decreased IGF-1 levels and symptom burden in medically untreated acromegaly patients (PATHFNDR-2). IGF-1 is the primary biomarker endocrinologists use to manage acromegaly patients. Paltusotine is also in Phase 3 clinical development for carcinoid syndrome associated with neuroendocrine tumors (CAREFNDR). Results from a Phase 2 study in carcinoid syndrome demonstrated rapid and sustained reductions in flushing episodes and bowel movement frequency, which are the most common symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.

Beijing, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kuke Music Holding Limited (NYSE: KUKE) (“Kuke” or the “Company”), a leading classical music services platform in China, today announced that it has acquired a controlling interest in Naxos Music Group, one of the world’s largest independent classical music companies.

Transaction Overview

Under the terms of the agreements signed on September 17, 2025, Kuke acquired on the same day a controlling interest in Naxos Music Group through two transactions involving Naxos One Holding Limited (“Naxos One”) and Desun Holding Limited (“Desun”), one of the two existing shareholders of Naxos One (the other shareholder is hereinafter referred to as the “Other Existing Shareholder”):

Share Subscription Agreement : Kuke firstly subscribed for 17,500 newly issued Class B ordinary shares of Naxos One at US$6,000 per share, for an aggregate consideration of US$105 million (the “Share Issuance Transaction”).

Share Purchase Agreement : Kuke secondly acquired 108 Class A ordinary shares of Naxos One from Desun (which automatically converted into 108 Class B ordinary shares of Naxos One upon transfer) at US$12,500 per share, for an aggregate consideration of US$1.35 million (the “Share Transfer Transaction”).

The total transaction value is approximately US$106.35 million, and was settled entirely through the issuance of Kuke’s Class A ordinary shares as consideration.

Transaction Structure and Consideration

Kuke issued 652,997,260 Class A ordinary shares and 8,395,679 Class A ordinary shares (collectively, the “Consideration Shares”) to Naxos One and Desun, as consideration for the Share Issuance Transaction and the Share Transfer Transaction, respectively. Each Consideration Share was valued at US$0.1608 (“Price Per Consideration Share”) based on the average closing price of Kuke’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) for the 60 trading days immediately preceding September 17, 2025, discounted by 30%.

Pursuant to the terms of the Share Subscription Agreement, the consideration may be settled either in cash (if Kuke has sufficient available funds at the closing) or through the issuance of Kuke’s Class A ordinary shares. When settled through share issuance, the shares issued to Naxos One include redemption provisions allowing either party to initiate cash redemption at cost under certain circumstances, with the shares subject to lock-up and dividend waiver provisions until redemption. Kuke has committed to pursue financing to enable cash redemption as soon as reasonably practicable.

Under the Share Purchase Agreement, the Consideration Shares held by Desun are subject to a lock-up period of 24 months.

Upon completion of the transactions, Kuke holds approximately 70.43% of the outstanding shares of Naxos One, which in turn controls Naxos Music Group.

Approvals, Shareholder Rights and Contingency of Unwinding the Transactions

The transactions have been approved by Kuke’s shareholders, Board of Directors and Audit Committee, following review by the Board of Directors and Audit Committee of an independent valuation report prepared by Jones Lang LaSalle Corporate Appraisal and Advisory Limited.

The Share Issuance Transaction was subject to the preemptive right of existing shareholders of Naxos One to subscribe for up to its pro rata portion of the Class B ordinary shares proposed to be issued by Naxos One, which if exercised would reduce the number of Class B ordinary shares available for issuance to third parties (including Kuke) by such number of shares with respect to which the preemptive right was duly exercised. The preemptive right expired at the end of September 25, 2025, Hong Kong time, and neither shareholder exercised its preemptive right prior to such time. The Share Transfer Transaction was subject to the tag-along right and an additional sale right of the Other Existing Shareholder which if exercised would require Kuke to purchase such number of additional Class B ordinary shares of Naxos One that the Other Existing Shareholder decides to sell to Kuke along with the Share Transfer Transaction. These rights also expired at the end of September 25, 2025, Hong Kong time, and the Other Existing Shareholder did not exercise such rights prior to such time.

Pursuant to a Supplement Agreement entered into on September 17, 2025, Kuke, Naxos One and Desun agreed that, if the Other Existing Shareholder had validly exercised its preemptive right, the parties would have taken all actions to cancel such number of Class B ordinary shares already issued to Kuke equal to the number of shares the Other Existing Shareholder proposed to subscribe, and would have concurrently cancelled the corresponding Consideration Shares issued by Kuke to Naxos One. Additionally, if the Other Existing Shareholder had exercised its tag-along right and/or additional sale right, Kuke undertook to purchase all Class B ordinary shares that the Other Existing Shareholder proposed to sell pursuant to such rights. As the aforementioned preemptive right remained unexercised prior to its expiration, the Share Issuance Transaction is no longer subject to any contingency that would result in an unwinding of this transaction. In addition, as the Other Existing Shareholder did not exercise its tag-along right or additional sale right prior to their expiration, Kuke is no longer under any obligation to purchase additional Class B ordinary shares in Naxos One.

– KOMET-001 in R/R NPM1 -m AML met its primary endpoint with ziftomenib monotherapy demonstrating significant clinical benefit and deep responses –

– Consistent activity across pre-specified subgroups, regardless of prior HSCT, prior venetoclax, lines of therapy, or FLT3/IDH co-mutations –

– Favorable safety and tolerability profile, including a lack of clinically significant QTc prolongation or myelosuppression –

– Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date for FDA Priority Review of ziftomenib in adults with R/R NPM1 -m AML set for November 30, 2025 –

SAN DIEGO and TOKYO, Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kura Oncology, Inc. (Nasdaq: KURA) and Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd. (TSE: 4151, “Kyowa Kirin”) today announced the Journal of Clinical Oncology published the full results from the pivotal KOMET-001 clinical trial ( NCT04067336 ) evaluating ziftomenib, an investigational, once-daily, oral menin inhibitor, in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) NPM1- mutated ( NPM1- m) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although newly diagnosed patients with NPM1 -m AML have high response rates to approved standard of care, relapses are common and survival outcomes are poor. There is currently no approved therapy to specifically target NPM1 -m AML. Ziftomenib is currently under priority review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of R/R NPM1 -m AML.

“Relapsed or refractory NPM1 -mutated AML remains very challenging to treat, particularly after venetoclax-based therapy or transplant,” said Eunice Wang, M.D., Chief of Leukemia Service, Professor of Oncology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY. “The manuscript describes deep responses, signals of clinical activity across relevant subgroups and a generally manageable tolerability profile, which is important in treatment of late line AML patients where accumulated toxicity can limit treatment options. The benefit-risk profile of ziftomenib is highly encouraging and, if replicated in additional treatment settings, has potential to be transformative for a large population of patients with menin pathway-driven AML.”

“Publication in ASCO’s Journal of Clinical Oncology is an important advancement for adult patients with NPM1 -m AML,” said Mollie Leoni, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Kura Oncology. “In addition to evidence of monotherapy activity, the safety and tolerability profile of ziftomenib from this trial is encouraging, marked by the absence of clinically meaningful QTc prolongation as well as low rates of both myelosuppression and treatment discontinuation. No clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions were observed, including with commonly used supportive-care medications, which may simplify co-administration in a polypharmacy setting. We continue to conduct studies in earlier line settings and in combination with multiple therapeutic agents in close collaboration with investigators, study teams and our partner Kyowa Kirin.”

Summary of the published data

The publication, entitled “Ziftomenib in Relapsed or Refractory NPM1 -Mutated AML”, includes positive data from 92 adult patients with R/R NPM1 -m AML in the phase 2 portion of the clinical trial as of the primary data cutoff date of October 28, 2024.

The KOMET-001 phase 2 trial met its primary endpoint with a complete remission with full or partial hematologic recovery (CR/CRh) rate of 22% (95% CI, 14 to 32; P=0.0058), which was significantly higher than the 12% historical standard-of-care response rate for patients with R/R NPM1 -m AML. One additional response of CRh occurred after the primary analysis data cutoff resulting in a cumulative CR/CRh rate of 23% (95% CI, 15 to 33). 61% of evaluable CR/CRh responders were negative for measurable residual disease (MRD). Overall response rate (ORR) was 33% (95% CI, 23 to 43), with a median duration of overall response of 4.6 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 7.4).

Median overall survival (OS) was 6.6 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 8.6). Among ORR responders, median OS was 18.4 months (95% CI, 8.6 to not estimable) vs. 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.7 to 4.2) among non-responders. Two responders received subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplant and both resumed ziftomenib maintenance after transplant. At the time of data cutoff, nine patients (two after transplantation) remained on ziftomenib treatment. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed comparable CR/CRh rates regardless of lines of therapy, prior venetoclax exposure, or presence of co-mutations, including FLT3m or IDH1/2m.

Ziftomenib was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with previously disclosed data. The most common grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse events were febrile neutropenia (26%), anemia (20%), and thrombocytopenia (20%). Differentiation syndrome occurred in 25% of patients (15% grade 3; no grade 4-5) and was manageable with protocol-defined mitigation. Three patients (3%) discontinued treatment because of ziftomenib-related adverse events.

These findings formed part of the data set used for the New Drug Application for ziftomenib as a potential treatment for patients with R/R NPM1- m AML. The FDA target action date is November 30, 2025. There is currently no FDA-approved treatment for patients with R/R NPM1 -m AML.

“The publication of the investigational ziftomenib data adds important scientific context for clinicians and patients,” said Takeyoshi Yamashita, Ph. D., Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Kyowa Kirin. “Together with Kura Oncology, we are committed to rigorous, globally coordinated evidence generation to support the benefit-risk profile of menin inhibition across the treatment landscape. Our shared goal is to advance development rapidly and generate the evidence needed to deliver ziftomenib to appropriate patients in need.”

The publication is now available on the Journal of Clinical Oncology website and in the Scientific Manuscripts section on Kura’s website.

Ziftomenib is currently under clinical development, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

Company maintains confidence in ReNu as innovative pain management therapy

Second Phase 3 trial demonstrates numerical improvement in baseline pain reduction over the first Phase 3 trial despite not meeting the primary endpoint

Statistically significant maintenance of function (p<0.0001)

Company will request pre-BLA meeting with FDA to discuss submission pathway

CANTON, Mass., Sept. 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Organogenesis Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: ORGO), a leading regenerative medicine company focused on the development, manufacture and commercialization of product solutions for the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical and Sports Medicine markets, today announced that the second Phase 3 randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ReNu, a cryopreserved amniotic suspension allograft (ASA) for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA), did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint, despite the ReNu results demonstrating a numerical improvement in baseline pain reduction over the first Phase 3 trial. Baseline pain reduction at six months for ReNu was -6.9 for the second Phase 3 study compared to -6.0 in the first Phase 3 study. Additionally, the ReNu results continued to demonstrate a favorable safety profile.

The primary endpoint for the study is the difference between ReNu and Saline groups in the reduction in knee pain at six months assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale. The study demonstrated a numerical improvement of -0.5 1 favoring ReNu (p=0.0393 one-sided p-value, compared to p=0.023 target threshold). The first Phase 3 trial achieved improvement of -0.7 2 favoring ReNu, which was statistically significant (p=0.0177, one sided p-value, compared to p=0.023 target threshold).

“Given the first Phase 3 trial achieved a statistically significant reduction in pain compared to Saline and the second Phase 3 trial demonstrated a numerical improvement in baseline pain reduction over the first Phase 3, we believe these results support the potential approval of ReNu for pain symptoms associated with knee OA, including those patients classified as most severe,” said Patrick Bilbo, Chief Operating Officer of Organogenesis. “As a next step, we will request a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA by the end of October to discuss the submission pathway, including using the combined efficacy analysis from both Phase 3 studies to support a BLA approval.”

ReNu has now been studied in three large RCTs of more than 1,300 patients combined. Organogenesis believes the totality of this data is compelling evidence for the FDA to review in a Biologics License Application (BLA). Additionally, the FDA granted ReNu Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation based on ReNu demonstrating the potential to treat an unmet medical need related to a serious condition.

“The results for ReNu support our continued confidence in the potential of ReNu as an innovative pain management product,” said Gary S. Gillheeney, Sr., President, Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board for Organogenesis. “We believe ReNu, if approved, will address a significant unmet medical need for the millions of Americans suffering from symptomatic knee OA.”

Knee OA is a degenerative joint disease that is estimated to affect more than 30 million Americans. It is ranked among the most common causes of disability and poor quality of life, generally characterized by pain and functionality deficits. End stage management of the disease in these patients is typically a total knee replacement when all other treatment options are exhausted.

The fully enrolled 594 patient second Phase 3 trial is a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, saline-controlled, parallel group, RCT of ReNu ASA, for the treatment of subjects with mild to severe symptomatic knee OA. Patients were randomized to receive a single intra-articular (IA) injection of either saline control or ReNu.

Additional top-line data tables from both Phase 3 studies are available in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which the Company filed today with the SEC and can be found at SEC.gov.

About ReNu®

ReNu is a cryopreserved, amniotic suspension allograft (ASA) developed for the management of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. ReNu consists of amniotic fluid cells and micronized amniotic membrane and contains cellular, growth factor, and extracellular matrix components. ReNu received FDA Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation for Knee OA in 2021.

About Organogenesis Holdings Inc.

Fleetco Dealer Expansion

We will be able to improve the expertise and commitment our clients expect from the Fleetco/Wabash team. Together we’re creating more opportunities to serve our clients, allowing them to keep on trucking.”

Preferred Partner Network Addition

The Preferred Partner Network model is central to Wabash’s strategy of making high-quality parts more accessible through a seamless national network.

The suit also argues that the DHS policy is unlawful due to the appropriations law.
Coogle pushed back and said that even the House’s seven-week continuing resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown, passed last week, contained the oversight provision.
He added that Congress has multiple tools to conduct oversight of DHS facilities, such as withdrawing funding from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or impeaching officials.
The provision later was expanded to include all immigrants detained at DHS facilities, not just children, and allowed for unannounced visits by members and the inclusion of congressional staff to enter with their members during oversight visits.","WASHINGTON — Attorneys on behalf of a dozen U.S. House Democrats Thursday pushed for a federal judge to force the Trump administration to comply with an appropriations law that allows for unannounced oversight visits at Department of Homeland Security facilities that detain immigrants.

“We don’t know what detention will look like in the future,” said Christine Coogle, a senior staff attorney for the group Democracy Forward, which represents the lawmakers.

Coogle argued before federal Judge Jia Cobb that because of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, the number of immigrants detained has ballooned. Coogle said that Democrats’ ability to conduct oversight visits without preapproval is not only needed, but already signed into law.

The suit, filed in the District Court for the District of Columbia, charges that the Trump administration has overreached its authority in creating a policy to require members of Congress give DHS seven days’ notice, plus approval from an agency official, before visiting a facility where immigrants are detained.

The suit also argues that the DHS policy is unlawful due to the appropriations law.

DOJ argues against Dems

Appearing on behalf of the Trump administration, Department of Justice attorney Alexander Resar said that the entire case will be moot in three business days, citing the looming government shutdown by next week. He argued that because the appropriations law will expire, lawmakers will not have the authority to conduct oversight provided under that provision.

Coogle pushed back and said that even the House’s seven-week continuing resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown, passed last week, contained the oversight provision.

“We expect it to be included,” in the fiscal year 2026 appropriations, Coogle said.

Resar also argued that because that provision is attached to appropriations law, the administration views it as not as enforceable as a separate law passed by Congress.

He added that Congress has multiple tools to conduct oversight of DHS facilities, such as withdrawing funding from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or impeaching officials. Republicans control both chambers in Congress as well as the White House.

Cobb questioned why two administrations, that of Biden and the first Trump administration, signed the appropriations bills into law for the past five years if they had an issue with the provision.

Resar said because the provision is attached to an appropriations bill, the Trump administration argues that it doesn’t reach the level of statutory authority.

Blocked from entry

Democrats detailed in their suit that since June, DHS officials have blocked them from entering facilities that detain immigrants.

Coogle said members of Congress being able to show up unannounced is an important tool, as in the past lawmakers have detailed how DHS has quickly made changes in preparation for planned visits.

She said some of those changes include painting facilities and moving detainees.

Resar argued that “if the facilities are being changed for the better,” then planned visits seem beneficial overall.

The oversight policy that allows members of Congress to show up unannounced at DHS facilities that detain immigrants, including ICE field offices, stems from the first Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents at the southern border in 2018.

At that time, Democrats such as Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas, who represents the border town of El Paso, were unable to conduct interviews with separated immigrant families and often denied entry into the facilities.

That led to the inclusion of a provision in the fiscal year 2019 appropriations law that codified a member of Congress’ ability to conduct in-person oversight visits at DHS facilities where minors were detained.

The provision later was expanded to include all immigrants detained at DHS facilities, not just children, and allowed for unannounced visits by members and the inclusion of congressional staff to enter with their members during oversight visits.

Twelve Democratic House members are part of the suit including Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J.

In March, DHS amended the terms and conditions it places on all federal funds to require recipients to certify that they will assist in enforcing federal immigration law.
These sweeping new conditions would require states and state agencies to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts or lose out on billions of federal dollars that states use to protect public safety.
Instead, the court determined that DHS made no serious attempt to provide a fact-based reason for its action.","Albuquerque, NM – Attorney General Raúl Torrez, along with a coalition of 20 attorneys general, announced an important victory in the multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration over its attempt to illegally coerce states into sweeping immigration enforcement by threatening to withhold billions in federal funding – funding designated for emergency preparedness, preventing and addressing terrorist attacks, mass shootings, wildfires, floods, cybersecurity threats and more.

The District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted the motion for summary judgement in the lawsuit against the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In its opinion, the Court held that the agencies violated the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by putting conditions on all federal funds from FEMA and DHS based on states’ agreement to assist in enforcing federal immigration law.

“It is unconscionable that the Trump Administration would threaten to withhold emergency relief funds as a way to leverage states to participate in their reckless policy of indiscriminate immigration enforcement,” said Attorney General Raúl Torrez. “We are pleased the Court has recognized that conditioning these funds on our state’s participation in this brutal and economically misguided policy is unlawful. Our citizens, like all Americans, are entitled to emergency relief from natural disasters without conditions.”

In February, the DHS was directed to cease federal funding to jurisdictions that do not assist the federal government in the enforcement of federal immigration law. In March, DHS amended the terms and conditions it places on all federal funds to require recipients to certify that they will assist in enforcing federal immigration law. These sweeping new conditions would require states and state agencies to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts or lose out on billions of federal dollars that states use to protect public safety.

In the decision, the court agreed that DHS violated the Administrative Procedure Act in adding the conditions, including because:

The agency failed to consider public safety in doing so

The conditions are overly broad and ambiguous

The conditions violate the Constitution’s Spending Clause

The court rejected DHS’ argument that placing immigration-related conditions on the grant funding was appropriate simply because many of the grants are designed to prevent and respond to acts of terrorism. Instead, the court determined that DHS made no serious attempt to provide a fact-based reason for its action. In fact, the court found that the “vague and confusing language” used in the conditions made it nearly impossible for states to comply.

In filing the lawsuit, Attorney General Torrez and the coalition argued that the immigration conditions exceed DHS’s legal authority and violate the Constitution because the programs in question were established to help states prepare for, protect against, respond to and recover from catastrophic disasters, not for immigration-related purposes. The district court agreed, holding that imposing the condition on all DHS and FEMA programs, regardless of the purpose of those programs, was unlawful.

,Policy,2025-09-25 21:02:28+00:00,Maryland Daily Record,Noncitizen veterans face deportation despite service - Maryland Daily Record,Associated Press,,,,,https://thedailyrecord.com/2025/09/25/noncitizen-veterans-deportation-threats/,"Democrats in Congress have raised alarm about instances of military veterans either forced from the country or whose family members were detained by ICE.
ICE had a policy at the time of considering U.S. military service when deciding whether to take immigration enforcement action.
The naturalization process for service members Immigrants with lawful permanent residency have long been able to gain U.S. citizenship through military service.
Completing that process can be difficult, especially when service members are moving between military bases or are stationed overseas.
Other Democrats are proposing ways to quickly extend green cards to the family members of service members.","After serving with the Marine Corps in Iraq, Julio Torres has the American flag and Marine insignia tattooed on his arms to show his pride in serving a country he calls home.

After post-traumatic stress syndrome, drug addiction and a criminal charge following his deployment, the 44-year-old has found new purpose as a pastor preaching a message of freedom to those facing similar issues.

But these days, his community in East Texas feels more like jail than the land of the free.

Torres, who was born in Mexico and migrated legally to the United States at age 5, is afraid to venture far from home as President Donald Trump works to carry out his mass deportation agenda. Torres has a green card residency permit and a record of service in the U.S. military, but he was detained by immigration authorities last year under the Biden administration. He fears that U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement raids under Trump could only mean more trouble.

“Do I want to leave this nation? No. I want to serve it. I want to continue to serve my community,” Torres told The Associated Press. “It breaks my heart that I fought for this nation to raise my children in this nation, and now I have to pull my children out of this nation if I get deported. Then what did I fight for?”

There are well more than 100,000 military veterans living in the U.S. who do not have citizenship, according to estimates in recent years by the Congressional Research Service. Despite military recruiters frequently describing service as a fast-track to citizenship for troops and their family members, the Republican administration’s immigration agenda is putting them at renewed risk of deportation.

Democrats in Congress have raised alarm about instances of military veterans either forced from the country or whose family members were detained by ICE. A bipartisan bill introduced Wednesday by Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., would require the Department of Homeland Security to identify whether immigrants are U.S. military veterans and provide them with an opportunity to apply for lawful immigration status.

“It’s very important for Americans to understand the contributions of noncitizens to our national security,” Takano told the AP. “They’re often posed as threats to our personal safety, but this is a story about how they play an essential role — tremendous numbers of our current military forces are noncitizens.”

The legislation, backed Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., and the GOP delegate for American Samoa, Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, would also make it easier for military members to apply for citizenship.

“Fighting for America is one of the greatest, most noble acts a person can do, and it breaks my heart that noncitizen veterans might be deported despite their service,” Salazar said in a statement.

From veterans’ honors to deportation threats

Torres remembers the anger when he was taken to an immigration detention center in Texas last year after being stopped by Customs and Border Protection agents at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. He was trying to reenter the country after visiting relatives in Mexico. The criminal charges from 10 years ago for drug possession violated the terms of his permanent residency.

“I was angry that I served a nation that now did not want me. I was angry that I served a nation that broke me, and after they broke me, they wanted to just throw me away,” he said, then added, “I’m still angry that I don’t have the liberty to go to the store with my kids because I’m afraid of ICE stopping me and arresting me.”

Torres was unsure why he was released after five days in detention. ICE had a policy at the time of considering U.S. military service when deciding whether to take immigration enforcement action. The administration has issued new policy memos to do away with that kind of discretion.

Fear of being deported has worsened his PTSD symptoms. He has night terrors. He cries when out of earshot of his wife and children, then tries to convince them he is doing OK. He fears that if deported to Mexico, he would be under threat from cartels because he is a veteran and minister.

Other veterans who have been deported say that those kinds of threats are real. David Bariu was deported to Kenya in 2008 after he had served in the Army and Air Force Reserve. An Army recruiter had enlisted Bariu while he was in the U.S. on a student visa — an offense for which the recruiter was court-martialed.

Bariu said he struggled with depression while detained for one year before he was deported to Kenya, where he struggled to find work. Living in an area where the al-Shabab militant group was active, Bariu did not want to tell anyone he had served in the American military.

“I didn’t want to risk putting my life into danger,” he said, adding, that “the U.S. government is deporting veterans to hostile environments.”

He eventually was able to apply for U.S. citizenship under a program set up under the Biden administration for deported veterans. Bariu moved back to the U.S. and today helps run Black Deported Veterans of America.

The naturalization process for service members

Immigrants with lawful permanent residency have long been able to gain U.S. citizenship through military service. Completing that process can be difficult, especially when service members are moving between military bases or are stationed overseas.

Takano’s bill would allow them to apply for citizenship during their basic training and establish a review process for immigration removal proceedings. Other Democrats are proposing ways to quickly extend green cards to the family members of service members.

Trump, in his first term, took steps to make it tougher to gain citizenship. He added mandatory waiting times for service members to apply for citizenship and closed U.S. immigration offices overseas and at several military bases. A federal judge ruled that his administration could not enact the mandatory waiting times, but Trump’s second-term team has tried once again to appeal.

Homeland Security has also stood by its actions when veterans have been forced to leave the country, saying it is enforcing the law.

Salazar said she was supporting the new bill out of concern that the administration is not making a distinction between “those who came to commit crimes and destabilize our country, and those who came here to work and build.”

“The vast majority of these veterans are in that second category, and they have put their lives on the line to defend this country. Congress is the branch that can lead the way on making these key policy distinctions,” she added.

Republican leaders have so far shown no willingness to challenge Trump’s immigration policies. Still, Torres is hoping that the push to have Congress take up the issue can avoid the contentious politics of immigration and be cast as a veterans issue, where there is sometimes bipartisan agreement.

“This is about a veteran,” he said. He then added: “I love my nation. And yes, even though this nation at this moment in time does not consider me part of this nation, I consider this to be my nation. I consider this my homeland.”

Nicaraguan activist Yadira Córdoba, a prominent member of the Mothers of April association, will face a final asylum hearing in San Antonio next month that could determine whether she is allowed to remain in the U.S. or be sent back to Nicaragua.

Córdoba, whose 15-year-old son was killed by regime snipers during the 2018 “Mother of all Marches” in Managua, was detained on August 20 during a routine immigration check-in with U.S. authorities in San Antonio. She had been living in exile first in Costa Rica and later in Austin.

Her lawyer, immigration attorney Arno Lemus, said Córdoba initially entered the United States in 2022 with a temporary parole document. When it expired, she was left only with her asylum claim, forcing her to pursue her case from detention.

“The fact that they detained her and they're threatening to deport her to Nicaragua after she's taken the time to file claims at an international level against the Nicaraguan regime … knowing that those kinds of actions can lead to torture, persecution, jail time — it’s unprecedented,” Lemus told TPR.

Lemus added that this case illustrates how the Trump administration’s expedited removal policy has placed many asylum seekers in mandatory detention unless granted humanitarian parole.

He said Córdoba’s case is “very well documented and highly publicized,” stressing that it has been presented at the Organization of American States, the United Nations, and the European Union. Lemus said it should be rare for judges to dismiss claims with such strong evidence.

An ICE official confirmed to TPR that Cordoba was detained in San Antonio on August 20. According to the statement, she first entered the U.S. illegally on Jan. 5, 2022, near Eagle Pass, Texas, and was released on an order of recognizance pending immigration proceedings. ICE said she will remain in custody until her case is reviewed by a judge.

GEO Group submitted a response the following month, proposing “the continued use” of the GEO Group-owned facility in Tacoma.","The 10-year contract for the private company operating the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma is set to end this month, but secrecy shrouds whether it’s been extended.

Immigration advocates and legal experts have heavily criticized the lack of transparency over the expected renewal of the contract between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and GEO Group, which owns and manages the 1,575-bed, jail-like facility.

Neither GEO Group nor ICE officials have released information about a new contract for running the detention center. The current contract, inked in 2015 as a one-year contract with an option to renew each year for nine years, is set to expire Sept. 27. The contract awarded GEO Group a minimum of $700 million over 10 years.

“It not only puts a veil over peoples’ eyes, but also prevents people inside the detention center from knowing what the future of this detention center is going to be,” said Josefina Mora-Cheung, director of organizing at La Resistencia, a local activist group advocating for the end of mass deportations and the closure of detention centers.

GEO Group and ICE officials did not answer emailed questions about whether a new contract was signed or whether the existing contract has been extended. Officials did not respond to reporters’ requests to provide copies of the new contract, should it exist.

“We cannot confirm pre-decisional contract selections, but we can confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current requirements,” said ICE spokesperson Chrissy Cuttita in an email Tuesday.

GEO Group spokesperson Christopher Ferreira referred questions about the contract to ICE.

“We are proud of the role our company has played for 40 years to support the law enforcement mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),” he said in a statement.

Numerous health and human rights violations have been documented at the facility over the years: Severe medical neglect, unsanitary food, swamp-like water, the deployment of “chemical agents” against detainees, sexual abuse and assaults, and excessive uses of force and solitary confinement.

Though many of these health and safety issues are prohibited under the current contract, GEO Group has never been sanctioned by the federal government for breaching those terms, researchers with the University of Washington’s Center for Human Rights found in a July report.

Nevertheless, a contract is an important tool for advocates to track violations and hold the facility accountable, said Kiku Hughes, an organizer at Tsuru for Solidarity, a social justice and immigrant rights organization that has also called for the facility to be shut down.

“ICE isn’t going to care about (violations) but maybe local politicians can put more pressure on GEO,” Hughes said.

U.S. Reps. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, and Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, have attempted to provide greater oversight at the detention center, with limited success. Jayapal on Friday called for a Government Accountability Office investigation into ICE’s detention center contracts with private corporations. State health officials have been repeatedly blocked from investigating the Tacoma facility, though they are poised to start inspections after a recent federal appeals court ruling.

While scrutiny over GEO Group’s management of the Tacoma detention center has intensified in recent months with the return of President Donald Trump to office, immigration advocates note many of the documented violations also occurred under the Obama and Biden administrations.

Still, the resources fueling Trump’s crackdown on immigration are unprecedented. Trump has vowed to double the number of beds for detained immigrants nationwide to at least 100,000, allocating $45 billion for immigrant detention over the next four years.

Trump’s immigration agenda could mean huge profits for private prison companies like GEO Group, the largest detention services operator for ICE. GEO Group has 21 detention facilities under contract across the country.

Between April and June, the number of beds used under existing ICE contracts across the country increased from about 15,000 to 20,000, “the highest level of ICE utilization in our company’s history,” GEO Group Chairman George Zoley said in an August earnings call.

In its most financial reports, GEO Group noted a 94% contract retention rate among its owned and leased properties over the last four and a half years.

ICE published a request for information to “identify possible detention facilities to house noncitizens” in Western states, including Washington, in August 2024. GEO Group submitted a response the following month, proposing “the continued use” of the GEO Group-owned facility in Tacoma.

“As the owner and operator of the Facility, GEO will continue to provide up to 1,575 beds to ICE under any subsequent contract,” the response stated, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union.

But ICE never published a formal solicitation for the new contract, immigration advocates said.

In April, ICE published a “strategic sourcing vehicle” requesting proposals to help “bring an additional allotment of detention beds online” in response to Trump’s declaration of an emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and related executive orders. It’s unclear whether this call for contractors covers the Tacoma facility.

As the current contract expires, the limited information thus far is a “missed opportunity” to assess GEO’s performance and address existing concerns, said Alejandra Gonza, executive director and founder of Global Rights Advocacy, a Seattle-based nonprofit that provides pro bono representation in human rights cases.

She, like other immigration advocates across the Seattle region, is not aware of any effort to do so publicly or with people who have raised concerns.

“We haven’t had a dialogue,” said Gonza, who also teaches human rights advocacy at UW.

The secrecy around the new contract may be connected to the enforcement of House Bill 1232, a state law signed earlier this year that imposes new health and safety standards at private detention facilities, including provisions to reduce the spread of infectious diseases and to ensure access to nutritious meals.

The state law supersedes a 2023 law that aimed to provide greater oversight at the facility, but which has been bogged down in litigation after GEO Group sued state officials over the law.

While the new state law does not apply to existing contracts signed before January 2023, it would be in effect for any new contract, said Tim Warden-Hertz, directing attorney at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

While the state can’t stop the Trump administration from continuing its mass detention and deportation campaign, “it can enforce basic standards,” he said.

Mike Fault, a spokesperson in the Washington state Attorney General’s Office, said in an email the agency would enforce House Bill 1232.

Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said a collection of notes found at Joshua Jahn's residence showed an animus toward ICE agents and that he had been planning the attack for some time. Jahn legally purchased the 8mm bolt-action rifle used in the shooting last month, officials said.

Larson said that early Wednesday morning, Jahn was seen driving his car with a long ladder. Officials believe he used the ladder to access the roof of an office building near the Dallas ICE facility, from where he started firing at about 6:30 a.m.

Larson said he fired rounds the length of the building and intended to damage property, as well as hurt or kill ICE personnel.

The three victims were detainees inside one of the vans Jahn targeted, Larson said. One of them died and the others are in critical condition. Officials did not provide any more specifics about the victims' identities.

Larson said law enforcement personnel from multiple federal agencies put themselves at risk to move other detainees who were in the vans to safety.

Many migrants embark on dangerous sea journeys in search of better lives in foreign countries. Too often, these voyages end in tragedy, with lives lost in the middle of the ocean far from any help. For migrants fleeing conflict or persecution, boarding an unseaworthy boat may seem like their only option when safer routes are unavailable. This form of migration creates grave risks of injury or death at sea, while presenting complex challenges for both states and private search-and-rescue organizations.

Tragic Events of Migrants Drowning

October 2013 marked a particularly devastating period for Mediterranean crossings. Two catastrophic shipwrecks within eight days claimed over 630 lives near the Italian island of Lampedusa. The first disaster occurred on October 3rd, when a vessel carrying migrants from Libya sank, killing 368 people. Just over a week later, another tragedy struck when a boat filled primarily with Syrian asylum seekers went down, drowning 268 individuals, including at least 60 children. These back-to-back catastrophes sent shockwaves through the international community and exposed the deadly consequences of dangerous sea crossings.

The crisis intensified in 2015, when the number of migrants dying at sea increased dramatically, with 3,771 reported dead, including over 1,200 migrants who perished while crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa in April alone.

Moreover, the recent data recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) accentuates that 2,452 deaths of migrants were documented in the Mediterranean Sea in 2024, although not the largest annual total ever. IOM has, therefore, called for adequate search and rescue systems, as well as safer migration routes as an alternative to dangerous journeys.

The October 2013 disasters prompted Italy to take immediate action. Within two weeks, on October 18, 2013, the Italian government launched “Mare Nostrum,” an ambitious military and humanitarian operation designed to prevent further loss of life in the Mediterranean while targeting human traffickers and migrant smugglers. The program proved remarkably effective at saving lives, facilitating the safe arrival of approximately 150,000 people to European shores.

However, Mare Nostrum faced significant obstacles. The operation carried enormous financial costs, requiring over $11 million monthly to maintain. Critics argued that the rescue missions inadvertently encouraged more dangerous crossings by providing a safety net for smuggling operations. Italian officials grew increasingly frustrated, claiming that European partners had abandoned them to handle the crisis alone.

These pressures ultimately proved insurmountable. Mare Nostrum officially ended on October 31, 2014, after just over a year of operation. The European Union replaced it with Operation Triton, a border management initiative run by Frontex with significantly reduced funding and personnel. This transition marked a fundamental shift in European policy—from prioritizing rescue operations to emphasizing border security and surveillance. Tragically, migrant deaths in the Mediterranean increased following Mare Nostrum’s termination. This sudden shift in Italy’s humanitarian cause has severely impeded civilian efforts to rescue the people in distress at sea.

In 2021, 21 crew members from various NGOs were charged in Italy for aiding and abetting illegal immigration, in the context of their search-and-rescue missions conducted between 2016 and 2017. This includes four crew members of the Iuventa, which had reportedly rescued around 14,000 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea.

The preliminary criminal proceedings, which began in May 2022, were criticized by Mary Lawlor, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders. In particular, she stated that the ongoing proceedings are “a darkening stain on Italy and the EU’s commitment to human rights.” She further denounced that “They are being criminalised for their human rights work. Saving lives is not a crime and solidarity is not smuggling.”

Although an Italian court in Trapani had dismissed the charges in 2024, there has not been any significant change in Italian government’s response to NGO efforts in search-and-rescue mission.

In July 2025, Human Rights Watch (HRW) similarly criticized the Italian Constitutional Court’s ruling, which upheld a law that imposed sanctions on sea rescue groups, as “cast[ing] a dark shadow over sea rescue.” Despite that, HRW had acknowledged a silver lining in the Court’s judgment, wherein “an order that leads to a violation of the primary obligation to save human life and is likely to endanger it is not binding, and failure to comply with it cannot be sanctioned.” It follows that if an order illegitimately violates migrants’ fundamental right to life, rescuers are justified in disobeying such orders.

Who should bear the responsibility of safeguarding the vulnerable migrants at sea?

The past events raise an urgent question from a humanist perspective: why did the surrounding countries not rescue the migrants drowning in the sea? A simple, yet profound, question serves to show the paradox of the class divide between legal and illegal migration. France, Greece, Italy, Spain and other countries situated around the Mediterranean Sea are state parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention, except for Lebanon and Libya. These countries undeniably provide better treatment to legal migrants, who serve their economic interests. By contrast, there’s a stinging silence in matters pertaining to the imperilled seaborne migrants who embark on illegal voyages.

We live in a world where civilization is treading backwards, with the persistent existence of a class society – the class that divides legal and illegal migrants. Often, the former who yearn for protection are being abandoned by States merely because they travel through illegal routes. These States micro-focus on the word “illegal” by casting off the morality of saving lives.

In contemporary society, where there are numerous ways to breach the fundamental human rights of individuals, a stronger humanization of such rights is a necessity to reflect the inextricably intertwined morality. The humanization of contemporary international human rights would mean imposing the responsibility of rescuing sea migrants on the surrounding countries in whose territory the migrants are found.

Indeed, the EU Assembly, in a recent report, reinforced the right to life guaranteed to sea migrants as entrenched in Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), referring to the European Court of Human Rights’ (ECtHR) landmark decision in Safi and Others v. Greece. In particular, the ECtHR underscored the States’ positive obligation to effectively investigate violations of Article 2 in the context of migrant rescue operations, adopting the test propounded in the case of Amaç and Okkan v. Turkey.

The test requires “the authorities knew or ought to have known at the time of the existence of a real and immediate risk to the life of an identified individual and that they failed to take measures within the scope of their powers which, judged reasonably, might have been expected to avoid that risk.”

The obligation supplements the existing international legal frameworks, such as Article 98 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which stipulates that member States must ensure that shipmasters promptly render assistance to anyone who is in distress at sea. Other similar instruments include the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (Palermo Protocol).

However, the Court refused to interpret Article 2 of the Convention as guaranteeing an absolute level of security to seaborne migrants where their right to life may be in jeopardy. This is particularly pertinent to migrants who bear a degree of responsibility for the accident that exposed them to an unjustified risk. The Court further took into account the unpredictability of human conduct and the choices of priorities and resources, to avoid imposing an impossible burden on national authorities.

From the decision, it can be discerned that although the law, as it stands today, preserves migrants’ right to life as long as they are within the constructive knowledge (or ought-to-know element) of the State authorities, it does not impose an absolute obligation on States. Besides, whether the State has violated the migrants’ right depends on the specific circumstances of each incident, having regard to the availability of resources of the country. In my opinion, while this approach balances the migrants’ right to life with States’ interests on a thin line, a comprehensive approach is required to address the root causes of the issue.

The best alternative solution to avert the tragic fate of seaborne migrants imperiled at sea is to establish safer routes for them. The question of illegality should be peripheral to the primary responsibility of protecting these vulnerable migrants. Moreover, there must be effective investigation into the deaths of the migrants, as well as swift procedures for handing over their bodies to the next of kin.

This aligns with the UNHCR’s 2015 report, in which the UN Refugee Agency urged European countries to adopt a comprehensive approach to illegal migration, reiterating that “fences and borders will not stop people fleeing for their lives. They will come. The question facing the international community is not whether to engage with this crisis, but how best to address it, and how humanely.” The UNHCR’s call substantiates the fact that toughening up border control will only contribute to more illegal migrants resorting to dangerous paths. Therefore, it is crucial for countries to adopt laws that mitigate such dangerous situations.

Furthermore, as reiterated by the Assembly, the States’ responsibility under Article 3 of the Convention extends to respecting the principle of non-refoulement, which was applied by the ECtHR in Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy concerning maritime search and rescue operations. The principle requires States to abstain from forcibly deporting rescued migrants to where they may face torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.

It is imperative that the countries in whose territorial waters migrants are found drowning shoulder the responsibility of guaranteeing their safety at all costs. The lives of those who travel dangerously, albeit illegally, are not just statistics. Their lives should be seen as equally valuable to those of people who enter a country lawfully. Instead of viewing them as enemy aliens, countries should start treating them as human beings with the right to life.",https://www.jurist.org/commentary/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/refugee_boat_1758830483.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 16:57:30.337503

Jahn allegedly went into this attack with the expectation of dying, and he was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.

“His handwritten notes indicate that he did not expect to survive this event,” Rothrock, FBI special agent in charge of the FBI’s Dallas field office, told reporters.

In the handwritten notes, Jahn allegedly wrote, “Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, ‘is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?’” according to a statement by FBI Director Kash Patel.

Patel said the FBI also uncovered the following so far in its investigation:

A document downloaded by Jahn containing a list of various Department of Homeland Security locations.

Evidence of ""multiple searches of ballistics and the 'Charlie Kirk Shot Video.' ”

In late August, Jahn allegedly ""searched apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents.""

Further evidence “indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning,” Patel said.

Three detainees in a van in the Dallas ICE facility’s sally port were shot.

A bullet found near the shooter had the words “anti-ICE” written on it, according to the FBI.

Vice President JD Vance has said evidence indicates the shooter was “politically motivated” to go after law enforcement and those enforcing the border.

He called the shooter a ""violent left-wing extremist.""

However, the region's top federal prosecutor said there's no proof that Jahn belonged to any organization.

""His words were definitively anti-ICE,"" said Larson. ""That said, we did not find evidence of membership in any specific group or entity, nor did he mention any specific government agency other than ICE.""

No federal agents were injured in the gunfire.

Officials said Jahn likely acted alone, out of his hatred for Washington.

Investigators said they've found video footage showing Jahn driving a car with a ladder on top of it as early as 3 a.m., Larson said.

He eventually used that ladder to climb to his rooftop perch and open fire at about 6:30 a.m., officials said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250925-police-car-dallas-ice-vl-1210p-9ccddd.jpg",N,,2025-09-25 18:57:53.338593

That was the take-home message from Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

Immigrants accounted for 15.8% of the U.S. population in January 2025, the highest percentage ever recorded. But Gelatt said those numbers are shrinking due to reduced arrivals and increased deportations.

Here are some frequently asked questions journalists should keep in mind when communicating the impact of immigration policies in their communities:

Will fewer immigrants help or hurt the U.S. economy?

Data shows that immigrants work at higher rates than native-born people and accounted for all of the net growth in the prime working-age labor force over the past two decades, Gelatt said.

“If it weren’t for immigrants and their kids, our primary working-age population would have shrunk,” Gelatt said. “To put that in another way, immigrants contributed to U.S. population growth, contributed to all of the growth in the labor force over the past 20 or so years.”

However, mass arrests and deportations have an impact.

“If fewer people are coming to the United States because you sent the message that they shouldn’t come and they can’t come, if you’re taking away work authorization from people who were granted work authorization, you’re slowing down the legal immigration system.”

How has immigration enforcement changed?

With the Trump administration’s “singular focus” on mass deportations, Gelatt said there was a dramatic increase in 287(g) agreements, which deputized local law enforcement to perform immigration enforcement functions. Florida mandated all its agencies to sign on to this policy.

Analysts like Gelatt are keeping a close eye on these policies.

“I’m going to be curious to see when we finally get the data to explain what’s happening this year, whether most arrests are actually happening through local prisons and jails, or whether a lot of arrests are happening out in the community,” she said. “Some people have been allowed with discretion to stay in the U.S., but they have regular check-ins with ICE. A lot of those people are getting arrested. That would be like a community arrest. People who have some kind of criminal court hearing, they’re getting arrested in those courthouses. People are getting arrested at work sites out in the community.”

Gelatt noted that non-immigration federal agencies, such as the IRS, FBI and U.S. Park Police, have also become involved in immigration enforcement operations.

What about employer-sponsored immigration?

The legal system for employment-based immigration was built in 1952 and hasn’t been updated since 1990.

“it’s hard to bring more immigrants legally to the United States because we have this really old system. We also have a system that has really specific categories. We have various immigration slots that people can try to slot themselves into, but lots of workers don’t fit,” she said. “We only have 140,000 employment based green cards available each year, even though our economy is absorbing hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year. And our immigration system is plagued with backlogs.”

Gelatt specifically mentioned H-1B visas, which Trump recently targeted with $100,000 fees.

“Many of their employers want to keep them, and many of those workers want to stay, but they’re facing backlogs – that are actually, at this point, I think it’s maybe 200 years long,” she said. “People won’t survive to get to the front of the line.”

Regardless of political affiliation, Gelatt and other analysts mostly agree on one point.

“If we want to grow our economy, if we want to keep prices low, if we want to keep growing our labor force, that’s going to take immigrants given that we’re having fewer kids collectively.”

Ben HattonWashington DC

Notes written by the person who opened fire on an immigration facility in Texas indicate he was targeting ICE agents and did not intend to harm detainees, officials said.

One detainee was killed and two others critically injured after a suspected sniper opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre in Dallas on Wednesday.

The suspected gunman died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, law enforcement officials said.

Speaking at news conference on Thursday, acting US attorney for the Northern district of Texas, Nancy Larson, identified the shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, of Fairview, Texas.

Notes found at the shooter's home show he intended to ""maximise lethality against ICE personnel and to maximise property damage at the facility"", she said.

""He hoped to minimise any collateral damage or injury to the detainees and any other innocent people,"" she added.

""It seems that he did not intend to kill the detainees or harm them. It is clear from these notes that he was targeting ICE agents and ICE personnel.""

The victims have not yet been identified.

But Mexico's foreign ministry has said one injured detainee is a Mexican national.

Officials had previously said that no law enforcement officers were injured or killed during the incident.

FBI director Kash Patel said in a post on social media earlier that evidence ""to this point indicates a high degree of pre-attack planning"".

Patel said one of the handwritten notes found said: ""Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, 'is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?""

At the news conference on Thursday, Larson said the shooter ""very likely acted alone"".

""That morning gunshots sprayed the length of the building, the windows, and law enforcement vans that were in the sallyport area,"" she said, adding detainees were hit.

The notes were found at the shooter's residence, and included a ""gameplan of the attack"", she said.

The suspected shooter described ICE employees as ""people showing up to collect a dirty pay check"" according to Ms Larson.

She said the shooter had hoped his actions would ""terrorise ICE employees and interfere with their work"".

""What he did is the very definition of terrorism,"" she added.

No evidence was found of membership of any specific group, and the shooter did not mention any specific government agency other than ICE, she said, but the man did express his hatred of the federal government.

She also praised ICE and other federal agents she said worked under fire to remove detainees from vans and get them to safety.

FBI special agent Joe Rothrock said it was a ""targeted, ambush-style attack on law enforcement"" that followed months of planning.

The shooter ""specifically intended to kill ICE agents"" and fired at transport vehicles carrying ICE personnel, federal and detainees, he said.

""Jahn also acknowledged the potential for other casualties. He knew with a high likelihood ICE detainees would be transported that morning in the exact location where he was facing from his perch on a nearby rooftop,"" he said.

""The clearest motivations at this point are the harm he wanted to cause to ICE. We're not aware of any specific relationships he had with anybody in detention,"" Mr Rothrock said, but noted the investigation was ongoing.

Jahn's hand-written notes indicate ""he did not expect to survive this event"", the agent said.

Marcos Charles, ICE field office director of enforcement and removal operations, said ""violent rhetoric"" against ICE has to stop.

""In contrast to those who would demonise our men and women, yesterday our brave officers ran back into danger,"" he said, alongside other federal agents, ""to save the detainees while shots were still being fired.""

He said the shooter used apps designed to track ICE officers, and said those producing and distributing them are ""well aware of the dangers that they are exposing to law enforcement"".

The Trump administration has also signaled that deportations will rise in the future, as the recently passed congressional spending bill allocated billions toward immigration enforcement.","On the campaign trail, President Donald Trump repeatedly pledged to carry out the “largest deportation program in American history.”

Now — eight months into his second term — his administration is touting new data, revealing what officials describe as a record-breaking rate of removals.

On Sept. 23, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that 400,000 non-citizens have been deported since Trump took office in January, setting the pace for 600,000 deportations by the year’s end.

An estimated 1.6 million non-citizens have also self-deported, according to officials.

“The Trump administration is on pace to shatter historic records,” the DHS said.

“The numbers don’t lie,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin added. “(Two) million illegal aliens have been removed or self-deported in just 250 days — proving that President Trump’s policies and Secretary (Kristi) Noem’s leadership are working and making American communities safe.”

How do these figures compare to those from past years and previous administrations?

ICE deportations

When focusing on data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Trump administration is indeed on track to outpace deportations carried out in previous years.

In fiscal year 2024 — which encompassed much of former President Joe Biden’s last year in office — ICE deported about 271,000 non-citizens, according to the agency’s annual report.

This figure was higher than every other year in Biden’s term and all four years in Trump’s first term, according to Reuters.

By comparison, during Trump’s first seven months in office, ICE deported just shy of 200,000 non-citizens, a DHS official told CNN in August. This puts the administration on track for a record-breaking rate of removals.

Total repatriations

When examining total repatriations — people returned to their country of origin — a more ambiguous picture emerges.

The DHS website lays out annual repatriation data going back to 2014.

This data includes not only ICE deportations, but those conducted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which “also deports people, including from within the 100 mile border zone,” Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a Migration Policy Institute (MPI) policy analyst, told McClatchy News.

The data is categorized into removals, enforcement returns, administrative returns and Title 42 expulsions — which were carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Removals are only one type of deportation, which is not a legally defined category,” according to the MPI. “Returns constitute the other major type, typically occurring at the U.S. border or a lawful port of entry.”

These figures indicate Trump’s deportation program may not be record-breaking.

“For reference, in fiscal year 2024, the Biden admin deported 685,000 (non-citizens),” eclipsing the 600,000 projected deportations this year, Bush-Joseph wrote in an analysis of the latest DHS figures. To reach this figure, she combined removals and enforcement returns.

This figure climbs to 777,580 when factoring in administrative returns — which include “people turned away at airports or who came to a port of entry,” Bush-Joseph said.

A DHS spokesperson did not immediately respond when McClatchy News asked if the latest deportation figures include removals and returns. Bush-Joseph said the latest data may include both.

Shift in strategy

“The difference with Trump is more people being arrested in the U.S. interior than before,” Bush-Joseph wrote in her analysis.

This shift in focus coincides with a rapid decline in unauthorized crossings at the southern border, according to NBC News.

Under Trump, daily ICE arrests have skyrocketed, increasing 250% in June when compared to the previous year, Reuters reported. And, while Trump has indicated he wants to remove “the worst of the worst,” ICE data reveals an increase in non-criminals being detained.

As of Sept. 11, 58,381 migrants were in ICE detention facilities throughout the country, about half of whom have criminal convictions or pending charges, according to NBC News.

The mass detention program has been contested in numerous federal courts, with dozens of judges declaring it illegal, according to Politico. The White House has maintained that it is operating within the confines of the law.

The Trump administration has also signaled that deportations will rise in the future, as the recently passed congressional spending bill allocated billions toward immigration enforcement.

“DHS is just getting started thanks to President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” the agency said in its press release, “which is surging hiring efforts and turbocharging the arrests and deportations of illegal aliens.”

Mario Guevara, a 48-year-old Salvadoran national, ran MG News, a Spanish language news outlet in metropolitan Atlanta. When Guevara livestreamed a June “No Kings” protest against President Donald Trump, local police arrested him. He has been held in detention for more than three months.

ICE didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously said Guevara is in the country illegally and thus subject to removal.

An immigration board recently issued a final removal order, based on failing to pay an immigration bond 13 years ago. His lawyers deny the allegation, calling the board’s decision “erroneous” in a letter to a federal judge in Georgia and providing proof of payment and the bond's subsequent cancellation.

""(Immigration and Customs Enforcement) refuses to release me because I represent a headache for them; a rock in their shoe as I exposed the injustices that federal agents committed on the state's streets against members of our vulnerable Latino community,"" he said in a message in Spanish. ""My dedication to my work cost me my freedom.""

Court records indicate Guevara is held in the Folkston ICE Processing Center, a privately run facility in southeastern Georgia. Sept. 25 is his birthday, according to a GoFundMe posted by his news outlet.

Advocates point to broader attacks on press freedom in the country.

Human rights group Amnesty International USA called his detainment “arbitrary.” Guevara's imminent deportation sent a “chilling message” that “journalists can be silenced, detained, and even deported for their reporting work,"" said Paul O’Brien, the group’s executive director, in a statement.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that Guevara's case had ""absolutely nothing to do with the First Amendment and any suggestion otherwise is laughable.""

""The Trump Administration will continue enforcing the law without apology,"" she said.

The nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists called the decision a “miscarriage of justice.”

“This is a clear attempt to silence his reporting and livestreaming activity, using immigration law as a pretext to allow for the deportation of a vital voice in the Atlanta metro area,” Katherine Jacobsen, a North American program coordinator for the committee, said in a statement.

Guevara fled his native El Salvador after receiving death threats for his journalism, his lawyer previously told USA TODAY.

For more than two decades, he has lived in the United States, earning an Emmy Award and garnering hundreds of thousands of followers covering growing Latino communities in the South. After the federal Board of Immigration Appeals in 2012 ended removal proceedings against him, he’s obtained work authorization. He recently applied for a green card through his son, an American citizen who turned 21 this year, his lawyers said.

Why was he arrested?

Guevara had been documenting increasing immigration enforcement in the region.

On June 14, Guevara was arrested at an Atlanta-area “No Kings” protest in DeKalb County.

Videos of his arrest show Guevara, in a red shirt with a protective vest reading “PRESS,” live streaming as police faced off against demonstrators. Guevara stood on the sidewalk with other journalists until a police line began moving toward a thinning crowd of protesters. One officer in a parking lot moved toward Guevara. As Guevara moved away, another officer ran toward him and grabbed him, bodycam footage showed.

Guevara can be heard telling an officer in English that he was a member of the press. His livestream continued recording in his pocket as he was taken away in a police vehicle. He called for a lawyer in his stream.

Following his arrest, initial charges of unlawful assembly, obstruction of law enforcement and being a pedestrian on the roadway against Guevara were dropped.

In early July, a Georgia sheriff’s office charged him with separate traffic-related misdemeanors stemming from another incident a month before his arrest at the protest. Those charges were dropped about a week later, yet he remained in detention as ICE began deportation proceedings.

On Sept. 19, the Board of Immigration Appeals ordered Guevara’s removal because he didn't post the voluntary departure bond within five business days in 2012. Guevara's lawyers have provided a 2012 ICE receipt showing Guevara paid the $500 bond to the agency and a 2015 ICE notice that later cancelled the bond. The board's removal order imposes daily civil penalties of $998 for each day Guevara hasn’t left the country.

“In a 1841 case, the Supreme Court described tariffs as a form of regulation.","America First Legal (AFL) has filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court supporting President Trump’s use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imported foreign goods. AFL filed this brief alongside co-counsel Boyden Gray PLLC and fellow amici Representative Darrell Issa, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts of the House Judiciary Committee and the Vice Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Brian Mast, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Coalition for a Prosperous America.

The consolidated cases before the Supreme Court, Learning Resources v. Trump and V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, challenge the President’s ability to exercise his national security and foreign affairs discretion by using tariffs to protect American interests.

AFL’s brief argues:

Congress clearly authorized the President to exercise the powers he did in this case. Using terms with longstanding and settled meanings, Congress specifically authorized the President to impose fees, like tariffs, on certain imported goods.

The statute at issue does not violate the separation of powers, such as the non-delegation doctrine or the major questions doctrine.

The Courts have no authority to second-guess the President’s determination here, where the determination relates to 1) whether a national emergency exists and 2) the emergency relates to the readiness of the armed forces in the context of foreign affairs. These are both core executive functions that are largely immune to judicial review.

“In a 1841 case, the Supreme Court described tariffs as a form of regulation. Given this precedent, the Court must read IEEPA as sufficiently cabining the President’s exercise of emergency discretion. This case is easily resolved by applying an over 175-year old precedent and the plain meaning of a statute,” said Dan Epstein, America First Legal Vice President.

The filing alleges that federal agents have systematically arrested people in Washington, D.C., without a warrant and without probable cause.
No one, including federal agents, can operate above the law, and the government must be held accountable.
The residents seek a court ruling to prevent the government from conducting such unlawful arrests against them and others in the future.
While the declared emergency period has expired, the federal government has continued its aggressive immigration arrests in the District.","WASHINGTON - Four Washington, D.C. community members and the national immigration organization CASA sued the Trump administration today on behalf of themselves and a class of similarly-situated individuals, alleging that the federal government has engaged in a pattern of illegal immigration arrests since August.

In their lawsuit, the residents challenge the administration’s policy of arresting people without a warrant and without probable cause of unlawful immigration status and flight risk, as required by immigration law. Agents can arrest someone without a warrant only when they’ve established probable cause that the person is in the United States in violation of the law and that they are a flight risk. The filing alleges that federal agents have systematically arrested people in Washington, D.C., without a warrant and without probable cause.

People who have experienced these illegal arrests will speak at a virtual press conference on Friday, September 26, 2025, at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time. Reporters can RSVP at the following link.

Each person who is a plaintiff in the lawsuit was indiscriminately arrested without a warrant, detained, and ultimately released. The national immigration advocacy organization CASA is also a plaintiff in the case. Its members have been impacted by the illegal arrests, and the organization has had to divert resources from its core social service work to engage in crisis response for people in detention.

The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia, American Civil Liberties Union, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, CASA, National Immigration Project, the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and the law firm of Covington & Burling LLP.

“On my way to a life-saving dialysis appointment, I was detained by ICE one mile from the hospital. They ignored my U.S. driver’s license and left me without critical treatment that day, putting my health in immediate danger,” said Elias, a CASA member. “I was detained for over eight hours without food or access to my necessary medicine. Since then, I have lived in fear that I could be torn from my family and deported to a place where I cannot get the medical care I need to survive. No one should be treated this way. I am standing up in this lawsuit to make sure ICE is held accountable and stops these unlawful arrests from destroying more lives.”

“Families should not have to live in fear that simply walking to school, going to work, or attending a doctor’s appointment will result in being abducted and dragged away by federal agents without cause,” said Adina Appelbaum, program director of the Immigration Impact Lab at the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. “ICE’s wide-sweeping arrests in D.C. are not just cruel; they are blatantly unlawful. No one, including federal agents, can operate above the law, and the government must be held accountable. This lawsuit seeks to ensure that immigrant families in the District are treated with the dignity, fairness, and due process that every community member deserves.”

The lawsuit has been filed as a class action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The residents seek a court ruling to prevent the government from conducting such unlawful arrests against them and others in the future.

“The government’s policy and practice of arresting people without probable cause are illegal and have disrupted everyday life in the District,” said Aditi Shah, staff attorney with the ACLU of the District of Columbia. “The policy and practice disregard important limits Congress has established for immigration arrests and have sown terror among immigrant communities and neighborhoods in D.C. Federal agents, like the rest of us, must follow the law.”

In August, President Trump declared a “crime emergency” in D.C. that led to significant deployments of federal law enforcement agents, including ICE agents, to patrol the District and invoked a clause in the Home Rule Act that allowed the Department of Justice to direct the Metropolitan Police Department to assist with immigration law enforcement. While the declared emergency period has expired, the federal government has continued its aggressive immigration arrests in the District.

“For weeks, immigrant communities in D.C. have been living in a state of terror and disruption caused by a policy of indiscriminate targeting being carried out by immigration officials,” said Yulie Landan, staff attorney with the National Immigration Project. “D.C. residents deserve better. Through this lawsuit, our plaintiffs seek the court’s intervention to put an end to this dragnet enforcement, which is not only unlawful but also cruel and inhumane.”

“CASA members who live and work in D.C. are being targeted by immigration officials simply for existing,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA. “With this lawsuit, our members are making it clear: they have had enough of the federal government’s lawlessness and abuse of power. They will not be intimidated or silenced. They will continue to fight until the government is held accountable.”

“The federal government has created a culture of fear in D.C., including among U.S. citizens and immigrants with legal status,” said Madeleine Gates, associate counsel at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. “People are justifiably afraid to go to work or even to walk their kids to school. We are determined to end this unlawful policy.”

The complaint filed in this case, Escobar Molina et al. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security et al., is available here: https://www.acludc.org/app/uploads/2025/09/Escobar-Molina_complaint_stamped.pdf

""Journalists should not have to fear government retaliation for doing their jobs, and showing up to work should not mean getting your family torn apart,"" said Scarlet Kim, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, in a Wednesday statement.

Kim was one of several lawyers who sent a letter to Benjamin Cheesbro, a magistrate judge of the US District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, late Tuesday, after the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) issued an order of final removal, which authorizes Guevara's deportation.

Guevara's legal team asked Cheesbro for ""immediate relief"" on the grounds presented in a Monday motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction. The lawyers challenged the federal government's claims about his asylum case from 13 years ago, offering evidence that he ""posted the voluntary departure bond on June 26, 2012,"" and ""ICE issued a notice of cancellation of the bond on April, 21 2015.""

""First, because he posted the voluntary departure bond, he should be subject to a voluntary departure order, and his detention is therefore unlawful under the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" the letter explains. ""Second, his detention is intended to gag and punish his speech and therefore continues to violate the First Amendment.""

Guevara's team is seeking his release while his federal court case challenging his detention plays out. However, as the jailed journalist wrote in a Monday letter made public by the ACLU, he is prepared ""to be deported from this country, a country I have loved and respected for more than two decades.""

""If I am deported, I will leave with my head held high, because I am convinced it will be for doing my work as a journalist and not for committing crimes,"" he wrote. ""That said, I will leave with a broken heart and my dignity tarnished, because I have been humiliated by both federal and local authorities, and I don't believe I deserve it. And because my family, the thing I love most in life, will be separated, although all my loved ones know it has all been because of my passion for my work.""

The journalist's adult children have publicly advocated for his release this week. His son, 21-year-old Oscar Guevara, who suffered a stroke during a 2021 surgery for a brain tumor, shared that ""he drives me to my medical appointments, helps me manage my care and, most importantly, lifts me up when I feel like giving in to the pain.""

Katherine Guevara, who is 27, said that ""no one should have to face this fear of punishment for their free speech in this country. Still, we are holding on to hope that the government will do the right thing and release him at once. His place is with his family and his community, not behind bars or facing deportation.""

Press freedom advocates have also rallied behind the journalist, with some pointing to the case of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel—who returned to his show on Disney-owned ABC on Tuesday after being yanked off the air by the company last week amid pressure from Federal Communication Commission Chair Brendan Carr, who objected to the comedian's comments about President Donald Trump and the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.

""If you were concerned about Kimmel, here's another for you,"" Zeteo's Prem Thakker wrote on social media Wednesday.

Free Press senior counsel Nora Benavidez similarly said on Bluesky Tuesday: ""Our opposition and upset over Jimmy Kimmel being taken off air have led to Kimmel coming back. Let's organize that much noise for reporters like Mario Guevara detained (despite being here legally) for filming police and ICE.""

On Monday, Free Press and the Committee to Protect Journalists led a coalition in releasing a statement that says in part, ""The government's prolonged detention of Guevara sends a chilling message to all journalists, citizens, and residents who record law enforcement, report on government activities, and seek to report the truth.""

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in January requiring the Department of Homeland Security and agencies under its command, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to stop providing federal funds to states that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

The move was designed to force states like Illinois to abandon laws that prohibit law enforcement from participating in civil immigration enforcement. Trump’s order could have applied to hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding Illinois receives for natural disaster responses and other emergencies. But a judge ruled it unconstitutional after Illinois and other states sued.

“I appreciate the court’s conclusion that DHS’ decision-making process was ‘wholly under-reasoned and arbitrary,’” Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. “The court’s ruling will ensure vital dollars that states rely on to prepare for and respond to emergencies are not withheld simply for political purposes.”

The 2017 TRUST Act, signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, prohibits Illinois law enforcement from arresting a person based solely on their immigration status. In most cases, law enforcement cannot assist immigration officials with detaining people based solely on immigration status, according to Raoul’s office.

The judge ruled that the order violates the Constitution because Congress controls spending. The attorneys general filed the suit in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island.

“Sweeping immigration-related conditions imposed on every DHS-administered grant, regardless of statutory purpose, lack the necessary tailoring,” U.S. District Judge William E. Smith wrote. “The Spending Clause requires that conditions be “reasonably calculated” to advance the purposes for which funds are expended … and DHS has failed to demonstrate any such connection outside of a few programs.”

Abortion funding

Raoul also filed a new motion on Wednesday alongside 21 other states and Washington, D.C., that seeks to stop a new federal law from blocking funding to Planned Parenthood and other health care facilities that provide abortion services.

The attorneys general originally filed the lawsuit at the end of July to challenge a provision in congressional Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill” that prohibits abortion clinics from using Medicaid funding for reproductive health services for one year.

The attorneys general argue the timeline of the law and details about which providers are included is too vague.

“We are urging the court to halt enforcement of the Defund Provision, which is clearly intended to shutter Planned Parenthood,” Raoul said in a statement. “Planned Parenthood facilities play a key role in our nation’s health and wellness by providing preventative care to more than 1 million Americans.”

The motion comes as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin announced Wednesday that it will pause scheduling abortions because of the bill, causing fears for Illinois abortion providers about a surge in demand.

CREW’s amicus brief argues that the Supreme Court does not need to weigh in on GEO’s proposed redefinition of sovereign immunity, but if it does so, it should reject this redefinition.
Government contractors cannot claim sovereign immunity because they are separate from the government and barred from exercising sovereign authority in the first place.
For these reasons, if the Supreme Court chooses to weigh in on whether government contractors have sovereign immunity, it should reject this claim.","The Supreme Court should reject GEO Group’s call to expand sovereign immunity to all government contractors, according to an amicus brief filed by CREW.

GEO Group has a contract with ICE to run the Aurora Immigration Processing Center in Colorado, where the federal government holds detained immigrants pending the resolution of their immigration proceedings. In 2014, detainees filed a class action against GEO under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and Colorado state law against unjust enrichment, alleging that GEO unlawfully required detainees to do unpaid sanitation and janitorial work in the detention center and punished them with revocation of privileges and solitary confinement if they refused. The plaintiffs also alleged that GEO instituted a work program that was nominally “voluntary” but paid only $1 per day, which the detainees urgently needed because GEO was not providing sufficient access to food, toiletries, or telephones.

In district court, GEO argued that it could not be held liable because its treatment of detainees was directed by its ICE contract. The district court heard evidence on that defense and rejected it, determining that GEO would be liable for any damages it is found to have caused at trial. GEO immediately appealed to the 10th Circuit. GEO tried to justify appealing immediately (instead of waiting until after trial) by invoking the collateral order doctrine, which is a legal principle that allows immediate appeals of important rulings that are separate from the merits of the case and will so badly harm a party that the appeal cannot wait until after the case is over. To convince the 10th Circuit that its appeal had to be heard immediately, GEO contended that government contractors have “derivative sovereign immunity,” which would prevent them from being sued at all for work done pursuant to a government contract and put them on the same legal footing as the government itself.

The Supreme Court has now taken up the question of whether an order denying a government contractor’s claim of derivative sovereign immunity is immediately appealable under the collateral-order doctrine.

CREW’s amicus brief argues that the Supreme Court does not need to weigh in on GEO’s proposed redefinition of sovereign immunity, but if it does so, it should reject this redefinition. Government contractors cannot claim sovereign immunity because they are separate from the government and barred from exercising sovereign authority in the first place. As the brief states, “the Constitution instills sovereign authority in the federal government alone for the singular purpose of pursuing the public interest unencumbered by the corrosive effect of private interest.” Further undercutting GEO’s claims to sovereign immunity, the federal government and federal law have long barred government contractors from performing “inherently governmental functions” which include those that “involve the exercise of sovereign powers of the United States” or “requires discretion” that “commits the government to a course of action.” Instead, federal law keeps contractors at arm’s length through extensive rules and regulations that protect and serve the public interest, manage and prevent conflicts of interest and penalizing misconduct, all of which is overseen by the Congress and the executive branch.

The Constitution and federal law recognizes that contractors are external private parties driven by their own financial interest to provide services to the government, not extensions of the government. For these reasons, if the Supreme Court chooses to weigh in on whether government contractors have sovereign immunity, it should reject this claim.",https://www.citizensforethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AdobeStock_259030820-1200x630.jpeg,N,,2025-09-25 14:56:46.275414

Instead of leaving the country based on his 1994 deportation and exclusion order under the name Dev Singh, Sohal used a different identity, with a new name, date of birth, and date of entry into the United States, to naturalize. He did not disclose his prior immigration history under the Dev Singh identity in any of his immigration applications or proceedings when he naturalized under the Gurdev Sohal identity. Expert analysis in February 2020 confirmed that the fingerprints submitted under both identities came from the same individual. The analysis was only made possible after DHS digitized the paper fingerprint submission documents from older immigration files.

“If you lie to the government or hide your identity so that you can naturalize, this Administration will find you and strip you of your fraudulently acquired U.S. citizenship.” said Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.

The complaint alleges that Sohal illegally procured his U.S. citizenship because he was never lawfully admitted for permanent residence and because the lies he told throughout his naturalization process rendered him unable to show the requisite good moral character to naturalize.

The shooting at daybreak Wednesday targeted the ICE building, including a van in a gated entryway that held detainees. One detainee was killed, and two other were critically wounded. No ICE personnel were hurt.

The gunman, who fatally shot himself, “carried out a targeted, ambush-style attack on law enforcement,” said Joseph Rothrock, the agent in charge of the FBI Dallas field office. He ”specifically intended to kill ICE agents,” firing at ICE vehicles and sending multiple shots into “the windows of the office building where numerous ICE employees do their jobs every day.”

The assailant appeared to have acted alone. Nancy Larson, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said investigators found a collection of notes at his residence. One of them said, “Yes, it was just me.” Other notes were sharply critical of ICE agents and indicated he hoped to avoid hurting any detainees.

Investigators have not found that the gunman was a member of any particular group or entity, Larson said. And while he broadly wrote about hatred of the federal government, he did not mention any federal agencies other than ICE, she said.

The shooter also left behind a note saying that he hoped the attack would “give ICE agents real terror,” the FBI Director Kash Patel said on the social platform X.

The gunman, who authorities said fired indiscriminately from a nearby rooftop, was involved in a “high degree of pre-attack planning,” Patel said, and agents have seized electronic devices, handwritten notes and other evidence from a Dallas-area home.

“One of the handwritten notes recovered read, ‘Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror, to think, is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?’” Patel wrote, quoting an apparent abbreviation for armor-piercing bullets.

The gunman had also downloaded a document titled “Dallas County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management” containing a list of Homeland Security facilities, Patel said.

Hours before the shooting, the assailant conducted multiple internet searches for ballistics information and video of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a Utah university campus this month, Patel said. Last month, the man searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents, he added.

Joshua Jahn, 29, was identified as the shooter by a law enforcement official who could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

On Wednesday, Patel posted a photo on social media showing a bullet found at the scene with “ANTI-ICE” written on it. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by the DHS on X.

The attack was the latest high-profile targeted killing in the U.S. It happened two weeks after Kirk was killed by a shooter on the roof of a building at Utah Valley University and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted a backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings “a stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety and respect.”

“Whether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,” the group said in a statement.

FBI says attack was ‘act of targeted violence’

Authorities have given few details about the shooting and did not publicly release the names of the victims. The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels.

Who was the gunman?

Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a home in suburban Fairview, outside Dallas, that public records link to Jahn.

The house sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in a neighborhood dotted with one- and two-story brick homes. The street was blocked by a police vehicle, and officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard.

A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there “at various times” between 2013 and 2018.

In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, said Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state.

“He’s a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn’t really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Sanderson told the AP.

Calls for an end to political violence

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence.

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, an advocacy group, said the shootings are “a heartbreaking reminder of the violence and fear that too often touch the lives of migrants and the communities where they live.”

Noem says ICE agents have been targeted

Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

On July 4, attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was wounded. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a responding police officer before authorities shot and killed him.

In suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Dozens of immigration field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody.

Security varies by location, with some in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.

I have brothers, sisters.
Many at the Sunday afternoon Mass told Angelus they felt helpless, hoping that God would intervene in the situation.
The Mass for Immigrants was a way to do that.
“It's important for us to stand together, to speak up, to have a loud voice to show them that they're not alone.","When Antonio Luna was 9 years old in the 1970s, his mother, out of desperation, sent him along with two brothers and two sisters from Mexico to the United States after his father had died.

Five years later, as a teenager coming home from junior high, he returned to an empty apartment. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door, and having already known the fear of immigration authorities, he peeked through the window to see the apartment manager.

She had sad news: His brothers and sisters had been deported.

“As soon as I closed the door, my stomach started just rumbling, and I had that fear,” said Luna, who afterwards had to live on the streets. “And the questions came to my mind: What am I going to do? Where am I going to go? Who is going to pick me up? Am I going to see my mom again? I have brothers, sisters. I belong to a family.”

Luna, now a deacon for the Diocese of Orange, shared his story at this year’s Mass in Recognition of All Immigrants, held Sept. 21 at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. Luna’s tale echoed what many immigrants in LA and around the US are facing today: Fears of deportation, fears of going outside, fears of what may happen to their children and loved ones if they were sent back to their home countries.

Many at the Sunday afternoon Mass told Angelus they felt helpless, hoping that God would intervene in the situation. But being at the Cathedral on Sunday, they also felt united in prayer.

Boni Lara and his wife, Celia Zamora, parishioners at Ascension Church in South LA, have come to the annual Mass the last three years, but said they felt called in a special way to come this year.

“There are a lot of us who are scared, who don't want to leave our homes,” said Lara, an immigrant from Michoacán, Mexico. “We hope that something good comes out of this Mass, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary.”

“There are many children now without their fathers, and the father is the pillar of the home,” Zamora said. “I feel very sad for the situation, but God gives me happiness and strength for the immigrants through this Mass.”

Luna believes Catholics, especially young people, need to take action to help those immigrants in need.

“We can do so much,” he said. “Our communities, they trust us. They see the Lord in us. We can open our hearts and listen to their voices and listen to what they need. Because, after all, us as Catholics, we are here to lift the dignity of human beings.

“To those who are undocumented, let me tell you one thing: Do not be afraid. Don't lose faith, trust the Lord, and pray. Pray, because this will have an end.”

In his homily, Archbishop José H. Gomez called on immigrants to tell their own stories in appealing to government leaders to remedy the country’s broken immigration system.

“It’s the story that’s been told since the beginning of this country,” Archbishop Gomez said. “It’s the story of good, hard-working men and women, people of faith.

“Let’s make that true again. Let’s tell our story to our leaders especially, and urge them to do what is right. To make it easier to come to this country, to create a path forward for those who have been here for many years.”

Isaac Cuevas, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles’ director of immigration and public affairs, said that archdiocesan parishes and groups have been working tirelessly to support immigrants, including food banks, “know your rights” workshops, and helping them create legal plans in case of emergencies or deportation. Leaders from One LA-IAF spoke before the Mass about their Freedom Schools strategy, which teaches people how to confront assaults on their civil rights and liberties.

But while larger groups do their part, Cuevas said it was important to show that members of the Church are standing up for them and are helping in their own way. The Mass for Immigrants was a way to do that.

“I hope people understand and recognize how important it is to just stand in solidarity with one another, to recognize those who are vulnerable right now, people who've been impacted by the raids and the enforcement that's happening,” Cuevas said. “It’s inflicting harm, and it's inflicting emotional stress. And doing that knowingly is sinful. We hope that as a church, we can do our part to support people in a time of need.

“Every single one of us has an opportunity to take action in some small way.”

Benton DiPasquale, who attended the Mass with a group of fellow Loyola Marymount University students, said he was inspired by seeing so many different people at the Mass and was confident the Church would keep pushing for a peaceful solution.

“There are so many people in the nation right now, not just in Los Angeles, that are afraid to leave their houses,” he said. “It's important for us to stand together, to speak up, to have a loud voice to show them that they're not alone. To offer our prayers to God and to the Virgin Mary Guadalupe that peace is something that we're all striving for, and it's something that we have to work for together.

In a letter obtained first by NBC News, Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee urged Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday to “immediately” release documents related to the probe that the Justice Department reportedly closed. Homan, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Donald Trump’s first term, owned a private consulting business at the time.

“The fact that the incoming Trump Administration reportedly closed this investigation prematurely raises further concerns that the Administration is weaponizing our system of justice to protect the president’s friends and to persecute his political foes,” the letter, led by Sens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., said.

In an operation last year, first reported by MSNBC, citing multiple sources familiar with the investigation and internal documents, FBI agents posing as business executives allegedly recorded Homan accepting a bag of cash after indicating he could help them with future federal contracts if he became the nation’s top immigration official during Trump’s second term. Trump appointees officially closed the investigation in recent weeks, MSNBC reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter.

In the letter, co-signed by Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Andy Kim, D-N.J., and Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., Democrats asked FBI Director Kash Patel to turn over documents and files, including any audio and videotapes of the transaction between Homan and the FBI agents.

The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied reports that Homan took the money, telling reporters this week, “This was another example of the weaponization of the Biden Department of Justice against one of President Trump’s strongest and most vocal supporters in the midst of a presidential campaign.”

She accused President Joe Biden’s FBI of “going undercover to try and entrap one of the president’s top allies and supporters, someone who they knew very well would be taking a government position months later” and reiterated that “Mr. Homan did absolutely nothing wrong.”

Homan has dismissed the report that he accepted a bribe as a “hit piece.”

“Look, I did nothing criminal. I did nothing illegal,” Homan said on Fox News on Monday.

Senate Democrats also pointed to $170 billion that Congress recently appropriated for border security and immigration enforcement in their letter.

“It is critical that the American people be able to trust that the influence of White House and other government officials has not been bought, and that contracts will be awarded to companies based on merit, not to those willing to pay bribes,” the letter said.

The letter marks Senate Democrats’ latest attempt to probe the Homan investigation. On Tuesday, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee demanded tapes and other materials from the DOJ and FBI.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250924-tom-homan-gk-f55eb5.jpg",N,,2025-09-25 15:56:59.540971

Suddenly, his camera was covered, and Mr. Guevara could be heard saying, “Officer, officer, I’m a member of the media, officer.” The recording continued for about 20 more minutes.","Lawyers for a journalist who has been in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since June asked a federal judge on Tuesday for a temporary restraining order to block his deportation, which they said was “imminent.”

The journalist, Mario Guevara, was arrested on June 14 while he was livestreaming from a “No Kings” protest against the Trump administration’s policies that was taking place outside Atlanta. Charges filed in connection to his arrest were dropped, his lawyers said.

Press freedom groups and civil liberties activists said that the detention of Mr. Guevara, who is originally from El Salvador, was another example of the federal government’s trampling on independent journalism and coverage that the administration viewed as unflattering.

In an emergency request made on Tuesday, Mr. Guevara’s lawyers asked Judge Benjamin W. Cheesbro of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to release Mr. Guevara, while the immigration case is decided. They also sought a court order barring federal authorities from removing him from the country until his status is settled.

“His detention is intended to gag and punish his speech and therefore continues to violate the First Amendment,” Mr. Guevara’s lawyers wrote, including those with the American Civil Liberties Union.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday about Mr. Guevara’s situation.

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review said that it did not comment on pending cases.

Mr. Guevara’s lawyers said in their letter to Judge Cheesbro that they received a notice on Tuesday from the Board of Immigration Appeals, also part of the Justice Department, finding that Mr. Guevara was subject to final removal from the United States.

But Mr. Guevara’s legal team argued that the board’s decision was based on erroneous information — that he had failed to post what is known as a voluntary departure bond of $500 when immigration enforcement actions against him began in 2012. Such bonds are often required of people who voluntarily leave the United States during immigration proceedings.

Mr. Guevara’s lawyers provided Judge Cheesbro a receipt from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, dated on June 26, 2012, for a voluntary departure bond that he obtained for $500.

In April 2015, D.H.S. canceled the bond, stating that its conditions appeared to have been “satisfied,” according to the department’s notice, which Mr. Guevara’s lawyers also submitted to the court on Tuesday. They argued that, in canceling the bond, the agency had administratively closed removal proceedings against Mr. Guevara.

Mr. Guevara was not a legal permanent resident or citizen of the United States, but he had a work permit and a Social Security number, according to one of his lawyers.

Mr. Guevara worked at the Spanish-language news organization Mundo Hispánico for several years before starting his own news organization, MGNews, a digital outlet that covers immigration and other topics for Georgia’s Latino community.

He is best known for chronicling immigration arrests in Georgia, and has built a large audience on social media, including more than 395,000 followers on TikTok and about 113,000 on Facebook as of Wednesday evening.

Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital justice and civil rights at Free Press, an advocacy group, said in an interview on Wednesday that Mr. Guevara’s case had reached a “dangerous inflection point.” She said that Mr. Guevara had a reputation in his community for exposing injustices perpetrated by ICE, and that his censorship was part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on dissent.

“As the government seems more and more willing to reject and ignore the rule of law, we are seeing that some of the most frontline individuals affected are reporters, and particularly immigrant reporters,” Ms. Benavidez said.

On June 14, Mr. Guevara was standing among a group of people when police officers started moving toward him, according to his livestream footage of the “No Kings” protest in Doraville, Ga., about 15 miles northeast of Atlanta.

Suddenly, his camera was covered, and Mr. Guevara could be heard saying, “Officer, officer, I’m a member of the media, officer.”

Phil Murphy and state legislators to pass the Immigrant Trust Act. The bill would limit how much state and local law enforcement and government agencies cooperate with federal immigration enforcement.

The resolution, voted on at the Sept. 17 Board of Commissioners’ meeting, marks the first time a county legislative body has made such a petition in the Garden State. Other New Jersey municipalities, including Bloomfield, Maplewood and South Orange, have approved similar resolutions.

Rebuilding Trust

The Immigrant Trust Act is built on the Immigrant Trust Directive issued by then-Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal in 2018.

The directive limits the voluntary assistance state and local law enforcement officers can provide to federal immigration agents. The directive, the office said, was meant to rebuild trust among immigrant residents who may have had fears about reporting crimes to law enforcement.

Passing the Immigrant Trust Act would codify the directive and include additional provisions, including blocking federal immigration enforcement action at “sensitive locations” such as churches, schools, and healthcare facilities, and stopping personal data from being shared with federal immigration agents outside of exigent circumstances.

‘Diverse County’

The resolution serves as a call to protect all of New Jersey’s residents, including the more than 2 million foreign-born residents, said Essex County Commissioner Brendan W. Gill, who introduced the legislation. Essex County is the second most diverse county in New Jersey.

“It provides safety and coverage for communities, so that our immigrant communities — I represent a very diverse county that consists of a large immigrant community — that they can feel safe to report things that they see which may be troubling to them and to the communities in which we all live, without fear of retribution,” said Gill. “So this is really an attempt to protect hardworking, taxpaying people of our county and of our state and making sure they don’t live in fear.”

New Jersey, and Essex County in particular, have felt the impact of President Donald Trump’s detention and deportation push.

The county seat Newark is home to Delaney Hall, the largest immigrant detention facility on the East Coast, and also where within days of Trump’s inauguration, ICE agents conducted a raid at a seafood distribution warehouse.

“In a lot of ways New Jersey is an epicenter of Trump’s mass deportation and detention agenda,” said Amol Sinha, executive director of ACLU New Jersey. “There are a lot of people that are being detained in New Jersey as they are awaiting being transferred to other facilities across the country, including Louisiana, Texas or others, as they’re coming from other states to be deported from one of the airports nearby.”

Just last month in the span of two days, three people were detained by ICE agents in South Orange and Maplewood.

Grassroots Push from SOMA Action

SOMA Action, a grass roots progressive advocacy group based in South Orange and Maplewood, has been vocal opposing Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda and was frustrated by the Immigrant Trust Act stalling in the Legislature, said Cynthia Galeota, co-chair of SOMA Action’s immigration committee.

The organization spoke to Gill about the resolution as a way to support Essex County immigrant residents and make it clear that the county legislature supported codifying the act.

“You have the power to publicly stand up for immigrants by passing this immigrant trust act resolution,” said Galeota.

Debate Intensifies Ahead of Governor’s Race

The resolution comes at a critical time for the future of the Immigrant Trust Directive and the Immigrant Trust Act.

During the runup to the gubernatorial primary election, the candidates each made clear their stance on the directive. Republican Jack Ciatarelli has said in no uncertain terms that he would repeal the directive on his first day in office.

Democratic candidate U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, of Montclair, has expressed reservations about codifying the directive, saying it had already withstood judicial review and that making it a law would open it to more legal challenges.

On Sunday night at Rider University, in Lawrence Township, at the first of two gubernatorial candidate debates, Ciatarelli and Sherrill were once again asked if they would continue the Immigrant Trust Directive.

Ciatarelli repeated his pledge to repeal the directive on his first day in office if elected. Sherrill declined to answer the question directly.

“What I’m gonna do is make sure we’re following the law and the constitution, so that’ll include due process rights and the constitution,” Sherrill responded when asked if she’d continue the directive.

Legal Challenges Expected

For immigrant advocacy groups like Make The Road NJ, codifying the Immigrant Trust Act is imperative to protect immigrant communities.

“The act that we have is a directive and so whoever comes to the next governor can either throw out the directive or create a new one,” said Diego Bartesaghi, spokesperson for Make The Road NJ. “And I think codifying it will ensure our communities are safe and that our resources and taxpayers do not go to ICE or any type of detentions here in the state.”

For Sinha, there is a strong legal basis for the Immigrant Trust Act that can withstand legal scrutiny. And while legal challenges are imminent, they should not stand in the way of codifying the act, he said.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that there’s going to be litigation,” he said. “As we saw with the Immigrant Trust Directive, as we see with every piece of legislation, there’s going to be litigation. You shouldn’t be governor if you’re afraid of litigation. We should stand firm on our principles. Do what’s right by the residents of New Jersey. And uphold it and defend it in court.”

For Make the Road NJ, the mission remains the same regardless of who wins.

“Regardless who comes to Trenton, we’re going to still to be fighting for the respect and dignity of our communities,” said Bartesaghi. “And that includes codifying the Immigrant Trust Act.”

The four were sent to Eswatini in mid-July as part of President Donald Trump’s push for the mass deportation of migrants and asylum seekers from the US.

Trump has controversially used so-called third countries to accept non-citizen deportees whose home countries are elsewhere.

Such “third countries” have included at least four African nations: Eswatini, South Sudan, Ghana and Rwanda. More than 30 people have been deported from the US to Africa since July.

But human rights advocates have questioned the constitutionality of such deportations, which leave deportees far from home, in countries where they may not even speak the language.

Some have expressed fears that the deportees will be denied their rights to due process in repressive or unstable countries abroad.

In the case of Eswatini, a small, landlocked country in Southern African, US-based lawyers claim that the four deported men who remain in custody have been denied access to legal counsel.

They have been held at the country’s top maximum-security prison, the Matsapha Correctional Complex, for more than two months.

No reason was given for Judge Titus Mlangeni’s absence from the court hearing on Thursday.

Zakhithi Sibandze — the national coordinator for the Swaziland Rural Women’s Assembly, one of the nonprofit organisations involved in Thursday’s legal challenge — accused the Eswatini authorities of using delaying tactics to avoid criticism over the case.

A second case brought by a lawyer seeking to provide legal counsel for the deportees has also been repeatedly delayed.

Eswatini is considered one of the world’s last absolute monarchies, and the king there rules by decree.

Earlier this week, on Tuesday, the nonprofit Human Rights Watch issued a statement denouncing the deportations to Eswatini and other countries, highlighting the financial transactions involved.

Human Rights Watch reported that the US has agreed to provide $5.1m to build Eswatini’s “border and migration management capacity” in exchange for the country accepting up to 160 deportees.

The nonprofit denounced the “harsh conditions” the four deported men face.

“These agreements make African governments partners in the Trump administration’s horrifying violations of immigrants’ human rights,” Allan Ngari, the group’s Africa advocacy director, said in a statement.

On September 19, Amnesty International, another human rights organisation, likewise slammed the conditions the deportees faced in Eswatini.

“Despite repeated attempts by counsel to secure confidential, in-person, unmonitored legal access to their clients, officials obstructed visits and on a later occasion proposed monitored/video-only contact, which does not meet international standards,” Amnesty wrote in a statement.

It called on officials in Eswatini to provide the men access to confidential legal counsel and “provide legal grounds for their detention”.

Originally, a total of five men were sent in the US’s initial deportation flight to Eswatini. But on Monday, the Eswatini government announced that one of the men had been repatriated to Jamaica a day prior.

The man was identified in the government statement as Orville Isaac Etoria.

“Mr Etoria has safely returned to Jamaica, where he was warmly welcomed by members of his family,” the Eswatini government said in its statement.

It added that the remaining four men are still being held in detention while efforts to repatriate them are ongoing.

Etoria, who arrived in the US as a child, had already completed a 25-year sentence for crimes in the US when he was deported to Eswatini and re-imprisoned there, according to the New York-based Legal Aid Society.

The US Department of Homeland Security said in July that the five individuals sent to Eswatini had been convicted of crimes “so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won’t take them back.”

Etoria had been convicted of murder, it said.

But Eswatini’s government said shortly after that some of the countries had reached out to say it was not true that they had rejected their citizens.

Despite Etoria’s recent return to Jamaica, groups like Amnesty International have continued to petition Eswatini to explain why he was held in prison without new charges for months.

Is your Member of Congress a cosponsor of the Block the Bombs Act to stop taxpayer-funded weapons fueling genocide in Gaza?","As Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza continues with U.S. bombs and diplomatic cover, one bill in Congress is gaining support – the Block the Bombs Act (H.R. 3565).

Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-IL), who introduced the Block the Bombs Act, speaking in Washington D.C. (IMEU)

NIAC Action has been a proud supporter of the Block the Bombs Act which would halt the transfer of offensive weapons to Israel so long as Israel is violating both U.S. and international humanitarian law. As Iranian Americans who have witnessed firsthand the devastating consequences of militarism and war, we stand firmly behind this historic effort to end U.S. complicity in the ongoing atrocities in Gaza.

Introduced in May by Representatives Delia Ramirez (D-IL), (D-CA), Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), and Mark Pocan (D-WI) the bill is now supported by 52 Democrats and has been endorsed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus in the House of Representatives.

Urgently Upholding Law and Human Rights

This is urgently needed as the United States has provided more than $30 billion in taxpayer-funded weapons, including an additional $6.4 billion in recent days to Israel as it has conducted what UN experts have determined to be a genocidal campaign against Palestinians in Gaza. American-made bombs, tank rounds, and artillery shells—the very weapons targeted by the Block the Bombs Act —have been used to kill tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians, including children. This flagrant violation of international humanitarian law makes the U.S. not merely complicit, but a partner in these war crimes.

U.S. law is clear: security assistance is prohibited to foreign militaries that have committed gross violations of human rights. The Biden administration’s own conventional arms transfer policy states that no arms transfer will be authorized where weapons will be used to commit genocide, crimes against humanity, or other serious violations of international law. Israel’s actions in Gaza—including the systematic targeting of civilians, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and the collective punishment of an entire population—clearly meet this threshold as underscored by many neutral observers, including the United Nations, Amnesty International and more.

Preventing More War with Iran

The civilian costs of war are borne most heavily by ordinary people, as demonstrated in Israel’s wars in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran. The toll of the June Israel-U.S.-Iran war was staggering, with at least 436 of the 1,100 Iranians killed being civilians —including dozens of children and women—and entire neighborhoods in Tehran reduced to rubble. This devastating loss and possibility for resumption of that war post snapback sanctions underscores the urgent need to confront U.S. complicity in fueling such conflicts. While the immediate priority is ending U.S. complicity in the Gaza genocide, the Block the Bombs Act also establishes crucial precedents for preventing future conflicts. The same legal mechanisms that would restrict weapons transfers to Israel could prevent a reckless U.S. war with Iran or American complicity in Israeli aggression against Iran. The principled application of arms transfer laws in one theatre of war in the Middle East could help prevent the kind of regional escalation that threatens both Iranian and American innocent lives.

The Iranian American community understands the pain of collective punishment and opposes war with Iran. NIAC polling conducted with YouGov in June 2025, before the war, found that 60% of Iranian Americans oppose Israel’s military actions in Gaza, with 44% strongly opposing them. We only expect community opposition to war with Iran to have risen after seeing the senseless human cost to the 12 day war. This opposition reflects our community’s deep commitment to human rights and our understanding that targeting civilian populations is both morally indefensible and strategically counterproductive.

Standing with the Broad Coalition for Peace and Accountability

The Block the Bombs Act has garnered unprecedented support from a diverse coalition of organizations committed to peace, human rights, and the rule of law. The Congressional Progressive Caucus—with nearly 100 members—has officially endorsed the legislation, marking the first time any major congressional caucus has backed legislation to end U.S. funding for Israel’s destruction of Gaza.

This coalition includes organizations representing millions of Americans: Jewish Voice for Peace, Veterans for Peace, AboutFace Veterans, IMEU, IfNotNow, the Center for Constitutional Rights, CAIR and Peace Action, the Friends Committee on National Legislation, Indivisible, among hundreds of others. These diverse voices share a common understanding that continuing to arm a military engaged in systematic human rights violations undermines both American values and global stability.

Recent polling data reinforces this coalition’s strength. A Quinnipiac poll from August 2025 found that 50% of voters think Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. 60% of voters oppose sending more military aid to Israel, the highest level of opposition since the question was first asked. This includes 75% of Democrats and 66% of independents who oppose continued military assistance. The American people are demanding accountability, and the Block the Bombs Act provides a concrete mechanism to achieve it.

Federal agents, the plaintiffs say, are making warrantless arrests in DC without making individualized determinations of immigration status.

The federal government’s practice has “sown terror in Latino and other communities,” the plaintiffs told the US District Court for the District of Columbia in a complaint filed Thursday.

The court should vacate and set aside the practice, the proposed class action complaint says.

The US Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The suit is the latest salvo by immigration advocates against the Trump administration’s policies. A recent suit targets denial of bond hearings to immigration detainees. It also comes amid a challenge to the administration’s use of the National Guard in Washington.

Mass immigration stops and arrests of Latinos are the result of “blatant” racial profiling by ICE officers and other federal agents, the complaint says.

José Escobar Molina, one of the plaintiffs, says he has maintained temporary protected status for El Salvador for over 20 years. He says he was about to get into his work truck near his DC apartment in August when plain-clothed, unidentified federal agents arrested him without a warrant, and without asking him for personal information.

ICE detained him at a Virginia processing facility overnight, but then released him when an ICE supervisor realized he had a valid TPS.

This encounter, and others like it, are part of a policy that violates a federal law that says agents can make an immigration arrest without a warrant only if they have reason to believe an individual is violating an immigration law, and an individual is likely to escape before agents can obtain a warrant for an arrest, the complaint says.

Federal agents, the plaintiffs say, are making warrantless arrests in DC without making individualized determinations of immigration status.

In addition to ordering a halt to this policy, the plaintiffs want federal agents to expunge all records collected and maintained about them, and an award of costs and fees, among other relief.

The resolution also condemns President Trump and his administration, including Kristi Noem, Tom Homan, and Stephen Miller, for carrying out physically and psychologically harmful policies. While urging Congress to hold the administration accountable, members of Congress demand that the Department of Health and Human Services collaborate with nonprofits to expand culturally comprehensive mental health services to impacted communities.

“Trump and Secretary Noem are abusing the Department of Homeland Security to terrorize our immigrant communities. Men in masks, arrests without valid warrants, and no certainty of due process are all tactics that put everyone in harm's way, undermine the rule of law, and create fear, trauma, and chaos,” said Congresswoman Ramirez. “Their actions contribute to widespread feelings of depression and anxiety among immigrants, their families, and their community. That is why I am proud to have introduced this resolution with my colleague Congresswoman Salinas to ensure Congress makes it clear that our communities are suffering at the hands of an out-of-control Administration and their terror force.”

""Across the country, the Trump Administration has instructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to racially profile, intimidate, and detain our Latino and immigrant communities. As a result, young children are missing school, parents are missing work, and families are living in fear due to the threat of deportation or, worse, separation from their loved ones,” said Rep. Salinas. ""These targeted orders from the Trump Administration are causing unnecessary stress, depression, and anxiety within our immigrant communities, and they must end. I am proud to support this resolution recognizing the negative mental health impacts of President Trump’s blatant immigration overreach.""

According to the American Sociological Association(link is external), family separation caused by incarceration can be more detrimental to children’s health, behavior, and academic achievement than parental death or divorce. Studies(link is external) also find that children impacted by deportation proceedings display higher rates of depression, anxiety, and academic withdrawal.

The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights said ICE agents detained and released two people who were outside the shelter at 3034 W. Foster Ave. in the North Park neighborhood. The building was once a U.S. Marine Corps reserve training center, but was purchased by the city in 2023 to transform into a shelter for asylum seekers, and now assists anyone experiencing homelessness in Chicago.

The group said targeting shelters is a new tactic ICE is using to arrest people.

Organizers also re-emphasized peaceful protests and condemned the shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday morning—a shooting the FBI called ""targeted violence"" by someone who ""fired indiscriminately"" at the ICE building from a rooftop.

The executive director for the Center of Immigrant Progress in Lake County said incidents like this are why their work is important, as recent events have created fear.

""We are part of a rapid response committee for Lake County and were seeing a lot of activity. There is more heightened activity and absolutely, there is more fear,"" said Jael Mejia, director of legal and civic engagement for the Center for Immigrant Progress.

""Getting involved locally is always the best way to do it, whether it's through an organization or a church, or a mutual aid group,"" said Brandon Lee, director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

In their lawsuit, the residents challenge the administration’s policy of arresting people without a warrant and without probable cause of unlawful immigration status and flight risk, as required by immigration law. Agents can arrest someone without a warrant only when they’ve established probable cause that the person is in the United States in violation of the law and that they are a flight risk. The filing alleges that federal agents have systematically arrested people in Washington, D.C., without a warrant and without probable cause.

People who have experienced these illegal arrests will speak at a virtual press conference on Friday, September 26, 2025, at 12:30 p.m. Eastern time. Reporters can RSVP at the following link.

Each person who is a plaintiff in the lawsuit was indiscriminately arrested without a warrant, detained, and ultimately released. The national immigration advocacy organization CASA is also a plaintiff in the case. Its members have been impacted by the illegal arrests, and the organization has had to divert resources from its core social service work to engage in crisis response for people in detention.

The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia, American Civil Liberties Union, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, CASA, National Immigration Project, the Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and the law firm of Covington & Burling LLP.

“On my way to a life-saving dialysis appointment, I was detained by ICE one mile from the hospital. They ignored my U.S. driver’s license and left me without critical treatment that day, putting my health in immediate danger,” said Elias, a CASA member. “I was detained for over eight hours without food or access to my necessary medicine. Since then, I have lived in fear that I could be torn from my family and deported to a place where I cannot get the medical care I need to survive. No one should be treated this way. I am standing up in this lawsuit to make sure ICE is held accountable and stops these unlawful arrests from destroying more lives.”

“Families should not have to live in fear that simply walking to school, going to work, or attending a doctor’s appointment will result in being abducted and dragged away by federal agents without cause,” said Adina Appelbaum, program director of the Immigration Impact Lab at the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. “ICE’s wide-sweeping arrests in D.C. are not just cruel; they are blatantly unlawful. No one, including federal agents, can operate above the law, and the government must be held accountable. This lawsuit seeks to ensure that immigrant families in the District are treated with the dignity, fairness, and due process that every community member deserves.”

The lawsuit has been filed as a class action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The residents seek a court ruling to prevent the government from conducting such unlawful arrests against them and others in the future.

“The government’s policy and practice of arresting people without probable cause are illegal and have disrupted everyday life in the District,” said Aditi Shah, staff attorney with the ACLU of the District of Columbia. “The policy and practice disregard important limits Congress has established for immigration arrests and have sown terror among immigrant communities and neighborhoods in D.C. Federal agents, like the rest of us, must follow the law.”

In August, President Trump declared a “crime emergency” in D.C. that led to significant deployments of federal law enforcement agents, including ICE agents, to patrol the District and invoked a clause in the Home Rule Act that allowed the Department of Justice to direct the Metropolitan Police Department to assist with immigration law enforcement. While the declared emergency period has expired, the federal government has continued its aggressive immigration arrests in the District.

“For weeks, immigrant communities in D.C. have been living in a state of terror and disruption caused by a policy of indiscriminate targeting being carried out by immigration officials,” said Yulie Landan, staff attorney with the National Immigration Project. “D.C. residents deserve better. Through this lawsuit, our plaintiffs seek the court’s intervention to put an end to this dragnet enforcement, which is not only unlawful but also cruel and inhumane.”

“CASA members who live and work in D.C. are being targeted by immigration officials simply for existing,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA. “With this lawsuit, our members are making it clear: they have had enough of the federal government’s lawlessness and abuse of power. They will not be intimidated or silenced. They will continue to fight until the government is held accountable.”

“The federal government has created a culture of fear in D.C., including among U.S. citizens and immigrants with legal status,” said Madeleine Gates, associate counsel at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. “People are justifiably afraid to go to work or even to walk their kids to school. We are determined to end this unlawful policy.”",https://www.acludc.org/app/themes/aclu-parent/img/press-release.png,N,,2025-09-25 11:59:23.097777

At least one immigration detainee was killed and two others were injured following a shooting yesterday at the Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office. The suspect is also dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Federal authorities have described the shooting as an ""act of targeted violence"" and ""an attack"" against ICE. This marks at least the third occurrence of gun violence at immigration facilities in Texas this year, as the Trump administration intensifies its crackdown on immigration.

🎧 Authorities haven't determined a motive for the deadly shooting but have released images of five unspent bullet casings from the scene, one engraved with the words ""ANTI ICE,"" Toluwani Osibamowo of NPR Network station KERA tells Up First. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons identified the shooter as Joshua Jahn on CBS News. NPR discovered that Jahn most recently lived in a suburb about 30 miles north of Dallas, and he had no history of any violent crimes. Sherry Davis, a neighbor of Jahn's, described the community as small and tight-knit but didn't know much about him. ""I would have never imagined that such a thing, you know, someone that felt so disenfranchised would live so close to me,"" Davis said.

As a government shutdown looms, the White House has issued a memo instructing federal agencies to prepare mass firing plans in the event of a funding lapse. The plan would permanently cut jobs in programs that don't align with President Trump's priorities, instead of temporarily placing employees on unpaid leave. A key sticking point between Republicans and Democrats regarding the short-term funding bill revolves around health insurance premiums for the millions of Americans who rely on the Affordable Care Act.

🎧 On Nov. 1, open enrollment begins on the ACA marketplaces for those without employer-provided insurance. If Congress doesn't extend ACA ""enhanced premium tax credits,"" which keep premiums affordable, many people will experience sticker shock during open enrollment in the next week or two, says NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. People will also see that the monthly amount they pay for health insurance will go up for next year. Simmons-Duffin says one West Virginia resident informed her that they plan to put money aside that would have gone to retirement to prepare for potential higher premiums next year. A Florida resident informed her that he is considering finding a new job with benefits if his premiums become unaffordable.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York yesterday, warning of a global arms race. He called on world leaders to help stop Russia's invasion of his country and for global rules on how artificial intelligence can be used in weapons. Zelenskyy stated that we are currently in ""the most destructive arms race in human history"" because of AI. His speech comes a day after Trump shifted his public opinion in support of Ukraine defeating Russia.

🎧 NPR's Joanna Kakissis reports that the Ukrainians she's talked to are grateful for Trump's acknowledgement that Russia is the aggressor in the war. Oleksandr Kraiev, the director of the North American program at the Ukrainian Prism Foreign Policy Council, tells Kakissis that while Trump seems to suggest that action needs to be taken to end the war, he has not provided any additional support from the U.S. Kraiev says the Trump administration might be distancing itself from the peace process and shifting the responsibility to the European Union. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has dismissed Trump's belief that Ukraine could win the war.

Anxiety can feel overwhelming, but it serves an important purpose by signaling to our body that we're in danger or out of alignment with our true feelings. But when anxiety hits, it can be challenging to remember its significance. Psychotherapist Britt Frank shares tips with Life Kit on how to turn down the dial on your anxiety symptoms, so you can better understand what they are trying to communicate.

🧠 When you feel overwhelmed, ask yourself, ""What are some things that help you feel safer?"" It can be a show you like to rewatch or a person you like being around. Once you pick one, engage in it.

🧠 Try this grounding exercise: Name five things you can hear, taste, touch, smell, or feel. You can splash cold water on your face or smell something strong like lavender.

🧠 Acknowledge how you feel physically. If you feel anxiety in your stomach, say how you feel, and then pick a part of your body not in active pain and notice that neutral feeling.

CASA, Inc. that nationwide injunctions must be limited to those necessary to protect parties before the court. While the ruling drew criticism from Trump opponents, the problem of nationwide injunctions is nothing new—and it reaches across partisan lines, frequently bearing on national security debates.

Judge shopping for nationwide injunctions has bedeviled the Obama, Biden, and both Trump administrations. Courts have enjoined, for example, Obama’s Deferred Action on Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program as inconsistent with federal immigration law, Trump’s first travel ban (presented as a counterterrorism policy), and Biden’s attempt to end the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” policy—each implicating national security, foreign affairs, and other important areas of executive discretion. Opponents of sitting presidents are able to virtually ensure that their suits end up before sympathetic judges who can impose provisional declarations of national policy that, if not overturned on appeal, compel the Supreme Court’s premature intervention on the emergency docket.

Empirical evidence strongly indicates a partisan skew to these injunctions: Between 2017 and 2025, 93.6 percent of national injunctions issued were issued by judges appointed by presidents of the opposing party. During the first 100 days of the second Trump administration, of 25 recorded national injunctions, 16 came from just three district courts—Maryland, D.C., and Massachusetts. The active benches on those three courts are overwhelmingly Democratic-appointed (90 percent, 73 percent, and 100 percent, respectively), underscoring the degree to which partisan judge shopping has become institutionalized.

The proliferation of nationwide injunctions has, in turn, conscripted the Supreme Court into resolving major policy disputes on its emergency docket, often with limited briefing and without a written opinion. This is bad for both parties, bad for sound government, and bad for the quality of the Court’s jurisprudence and, consequently, the law.

This problem operates across three distinct dimensions: judge shopping within district courts (including strategic refiling), circuit shopping, and premature nationalization of difficult legal issues. Both Republican- and Democratic-aligned litigants consistently exploit these mechanisms, demonstrating the widespread nature of this pathology, which is best conceived as a procedural quandary to be solved and not a partisan issue.

The Scope of the Problem

The first dimension is the ability of litigants to select single-judge (or simply small, politically homogeneous) divisions of district courts, knowing that in all likelihood their case will land before a sympathetic judge. In some cases, plaintiffs may exploit Federal Civil Rule 41(a)’s allowance of a single voluntary dismissal without prejudice—a practice the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has noted can enable forum shopping in district courts, especially in district courts that do not automatically reassign these cases to the original judge, a local practice that some but not all district courts have adopted.

The Amarillo mifepristone litigation is perhaps an extreme example: Anti-abortion groups filed in the Amarillo Division of the Northern District of Texas precisely because the division’s only active judge was Trump appointee Matthew Kacsmaryk, a former anti-abortion activist. The judge promptly issued a nationwide injunction suspending approval of the drug, which almost immediately conflicted with a contrary order from a Washington court requiring continued access. The result was not a coherent provisional national rule pending Supreme Court review but dueling injunctions, with federal law both halted and preserved depending on the courthouse.

The second dimension is venue shopping across districts—a practice incentivized by the national sweep of these injunctions. Unlike the intra-district manipulation described above, this practice turns on choosing the district in which to file in the first place. As noted, recent nationwide injunctions have clustered disproportionately in just a handful of courts, with Maryland, D.C., and Massachusetts generating the majority of such orders in the opening months of Trump’s second term. The experience ofearlier administrations suggests a similar partisan logic: Challenges to Obama’s policies were concentrated in Texas, while opponents of the first Trump administration gravitated toward California. The common thread is that litigants file where the mix of judges is most favorable to their claims. So long as litigants can select districts where the bench is ideologically aligned, random assignment within a district will not blunt venue-shopping incentives.

The third dimension is premature nationalization of contested questions, or what might be termed a Mendoza problem. In United States v. Mendoza, the Supreme Court rejected the use of nonmutual collateral estoppel against the federal government because it would “substantially thwart the development of important questions of law by freezing the first final decision rendered on a particular legal issue.” Nationwide injunctions do just that by truncating, if not effectively foreclosing, the ordinary percolation of issues across circuits. One district court’s ruling effectively becomes a national directive, dragging the Court onto its emergency docket and distorting the doctrinal development that inter-circuit dialogue is meant to foster. As Justice Elena Kagan has warned, “It just can’t be right that one district judge can stop a nationwide policy in its tracks and leave it stopped for the years that it takes to go through the normal process.”

Evaluating Responses

The principal consideration in support of nationwide injunctions is eminently understandable: If an executive order applies across the country, then the harm it causes is necessarily national, and relief must be equally broad. But immediate national decisions are not how the U.S. judicial system generally works. Yale professor Jed Rubenfeld has noted nationwide injunctions should be reserved for the narrow class of cases where government action is clearly and unambiguously foreclosed by controlling Supreme Court precedent. The devil is in the application, for what may be popularly considered “clearly established” nonetheless often remains legitimately litigable to the government.

Other proposed reforms also fail to address all three of these dimensions and so fail to provide a durable solution. The Judicial Conference has attempted to curb the most blatant forms of judge shopping by adopting a policy of districtwide random assignment for cases that seek to mandate or modify federal or state government actions. That reform targets one critical corner of the problem: It prevents litigants from guaranteeing assignment to a single judge within a division or district. It does not, however, prevent venue shopping across districts or premature nationalization of contested questions.

Members of Congress have introduced a raft of proposals. The No Rogue Rulings Act, introduced by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), would sharply curtail the authority of district courts to issue injunctions extending beyond the parties, except when two or more states in different circuits sue together, in which case a randomly selected three-judge panel could issue broader relief. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)’s Nationwide Injunction Abuse Prevention Act goes further, seeking to bar nationwide decrees altogether. Meanwhile, the End Judge Shopping Act, introduced by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), focuses narrowly on preventing nationwide relief from single-judge divisions by mandating random assignment only in such cases.

Each of these bills addresses part of the problem, but none addresses all three dimensions we identify. They amount to partial fixes, and they risk simply redirecting litigants toward whatever loopholes remain. Entirely precluding national relief goes too far: While individual district court judges should not be able to effectively dictate or undo national policy, there does need to be a measured outlet for appropriate, relatively prompt judicial review of executive action having a nationwide sweep—especially as congressional inaction has fueled growth in both the number and the scope of executive orders and judicial corrective measures.

In Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court took a more direct step. It curtailed nationwide injunctions at the behest of nonparties—recognizing that individuals who are not bound by a judgment should not automatically benefit from a district court’s universal order. But the Court left open two significant exceptions: nationwide class actions and suits brought by state attorneys general. These carve-outs preserve many of the incentives for forum shopping, amounting to old wine in new bottles. Judges inclined toward broad relief have already shown a willingness to certify classes at very early stages of litigation, sometimes even including future claimants. While it is unclear precisely how CASA will impact this landscape, there are hints of a more laissez-faire approach to Civil Rule 23(b)(2) certification since the decision was handed down.

State attorneys general litigation poses its own risks: A nationwide injunction can effectively be achieved whenever a coalition of attorneys general sues in a favorable forum. The Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction over interstate disputes could serve to avoid lower-court litigation and forum shopping and provide a centralized forum for resolution of such cases, though not without raising serious risks of overloading the Supreme Court’s docket (a key justification for the creation of the federal courts of appeals in the first place) and questions surrounding the suitability of the Court for fact-finding without reliance on special masters and attendant lengthy proceedings.

A Three-Step Proposal

Piecemeal reforms will not solve the problem. What is needed is a structural change that restores the benefits of percolation while still allowing meaningful checks on executive overreach. The principle is not novel. Congress embraced it with the Evarts Act, creating the courts of appeals in part so that difficult questions could be tested regionally before reaching the Supreme Court. As we note above, the Supreme Court echoed this same concern in Mendoza. In short, easy access to national injunctions (from the ruling of one district court) ultimately makes for worse law.

Our three-step proposal builds on that principle. First, district-wide random assignments should be bolstered by curbing rules that permit a party one voluntary dismissal without prejudice.

Second, broader relief should also no longer hinge on a single trial court. Any injunction against federal or state government action should be subject to immediate review by the court of appeals, and its reach should be confined geographically to that circuit. District judges could still grant party-specific relief, but circuit-limited injunctions would ensure that unsettled questions receive fuller treatment before they are nationalized.

Third, to prevent endless relitigation, once two circuits have reached the same result the government should be required to seek certiorari rather than continuing to test the issue elsewhere. At that point, the value of further percolation has been given its due, and what remains is likely strategic delay. Once the Supreme Court has granted review, it can decide whether to stay further litigation by the government outside of those circuits. Relief against unlawful executive action would remain available but be geographically confined until multiple appellate courts concur. A similar concern animated Estreicher and Revesz’s defense of agency nonacquiescence: Forcing the federal government to conform nationally to the first adverse ruling sacrifices the benefits of intercircuit dialogue and sound doctrinal development. Congress has confronted this problem before: 42 U.S.C. § 2284 requires three-judge district courts in certain cases, with direct appeal to the Supreme Court. For decades, that provision went much further than it does today: Until 1976, three-judge courts were mandatory in any suit seeking to enjoin the enforcement of state or federal statutes on constitutional grounds—with the straightforward premise that when a federal court is asked to enjoin executive action or the enforcement of a duly enacted law, the matter is too important to be left to a single, hand-picked district judge. Congress later narrowed § 2284 to conserve judicial resources, confining it mainly to redistricting and reapportionment cases. But its earlier breadth shows that the instinct behind our proposal is hardly novel.

Circuit-limited injunctions, implemented through rulemaking or statutory change, would reduce incentives for venue shopping, ease the burden on the Court’s emergency docket, and restore the judiciary’s legitimacy by ensuring that national policy reflects more than the will of one carefully chosen judge, with Supreme Court review to follow once there has been a decent opportunity for intercircuit dialogue and doctrinal development.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-25 10:57:57.895733

That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once the US Congress approved a new financial plan.
“We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,” Jeffries wrote in a post on X shortly after the OMB memo was released.
Meanwhile, hundreds of federal employees who were fired in Musk’s cost-cutting blitz are being asked to return to work.
“Ultimately, the outcome was the agency was left broken and understaffed,” said Chad Becker, a former GSA real estate official.","The White House is telling federal agencies to prepare large-scale firings of workers if the government shuts down next week in a partisan fight over spending plans – prompting the Democrats to accuse Donald Trump of intimidation tactics.

In a memo released on Wednesday night, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said agencies should consider a reduction in force for federal programs whose funding would lapse next week, is not otherwise funded and is “not consistent with the president’s priorities”.

That would be a much more aggressive step than in previous shutdowns, when federal workers not deemed essential were furloughed but returned to their jobs once the US Congress approved a new financial plan.

A mass firing would eliminate employees positions, which would trigger yet another massive upheaval in a federal workforce that has already faced major rounds of cuts this year, leading with the dramatic intervention by Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) early in the second Trump administration.

Once any potential government shutdown ends, agencies are asked to revise their reduction in force plans “as needed to retain the minimal number of employees necessary to carry out statutory functions”, according to the memo, which was first reported by Politico.

This move from OMB significantly increases the consequences of a potential government shutdown next week and escalates pressure on the US Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats.

The two leaders have kept nearly all of their Democratic lawmakers united against a clean funding bill pushed by the US president and congressional Republicans that would keep the federal government operating for seven more weeks, demanding immediate improvements to health care in exchange for their votes to approve the short term plan, known as a continuing resolution (CR).

“We will not be intimidated by your threat to engage in mass firings,” Jeffries wrote in a post on X shortly after the OMB memo was released. “Get lost.”

Jeffries called Russ Vought, the head of OMB, a “malignant political hack”.

Schumer said in a statement that the OMB memo is an “attempt at intimidation” and predicted the “unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back.”

“It has never been more important for the administration to be prepared for a shutdown if the Democrats choose to pursue one,” the memo reads, which also notes that the GOP’s signature law, a major tax and anti-immigration spending package, gives “ample resources to ensure that many core Trump Administration priorities will continue uninterrupted.” OMB noted that it had asked all agencies to submit their plans in case of a government shutdown by 1 August.

Meanwhile, hundreds of federal employees who were fired in Musk’s cost-cutting blitz are being asked to return to work.

The General Services Administration ( GSA) has given the employees – who managed government workspaces – until the end of the week to decide, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press. Those who accept must report to work on 6 October after what amounts to a seven-month paid vacation.

A Department of Homeland Security directive issued in 2021 instructed ICE not to target disaster-relief areas like Lahaina.
Joseph Campos, deputy director of the Department of Human Services, which is leading the state’s efforts at Ka La‘i Ola, said Wednesday that he was aware of the ICE visit.
“As a temporary housing site for wildfire survivors and a place of peaceful recovery, Ka La‘i Ola and all disaster recovery sites must remain safe spaces where survivors can seek shelter and support without fear or intimidation,” Bissen said in the statement.
She and other advocates helped immigrant wildfire survivors get approved to move into Ka La‘i Ola.","The federal immigration enforcement agency was in West Maui reportedly searching for a non-resident.

Members of Maui’s large immigrant population were on edge this week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were seen knocking on doors in Lahaina, including at the largest temporary housing development for survivors of the deadly 2023 wildfires.

ICE officers approached residents on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, according to nonprofit leaders, government officials and others in the community.

Kevin Block, a longtime immigration lawyer based in Wailuku, said several of his clients who had been impacted by the fire were now afraid to leave their houses. Others were debating whether to send their children to school because for fear ICE agents might pull them from class to ask about family members’ immigration status.

A Department of Homeland Security directive issued in 2021 instructed ICE not to target disaster-relief areas like Lahaina. It grouped them with areas including churches, courthouses and hospitals that should be protected from some enforcement actions.

That directive was repealed shortly after President Donald Trump took office in January, and ICE officials were instead instructed to make “case-by-case determinations regarding whether, where and when to conduct an immigration enforcement action in or near a protected area.”

ICE officers were seen knocking on doors this week in the neighborhood near Princess Nāhiʻenaʻena Elementary School and at the state’s interim housing community for fire survivors, Ka La‘i Ola, in addition to other locations in west and central Maui, Block and Lahaina residents said.

Joseph Campos, deputy director of the Department of Human Services, which is leading the state’s efforts at Ka La‘i Ola, said Wednesday that he was aware of the ICE visit.

“They came to look for a non-resident who may have been visiting a resident,” he said. “They presented a judicial warrant.”

Ka La‘i Ola maintains a policy of not releasing information about its residents to anyone unless there is a signed and verified judicial warrant or higher documentation presented, he said.

ICE notified the Maui Police Department that they were present on the island, according to a statement Tuesday from Gregg Okamoto, assistant chief of the department’s support services division.

“But we are not given details and are not involved with their operations,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security, including ICE, does not “comment on pending or ongoing enforcement operations,” according to a statement issued by the agency. For operational security reasons, it also “does not disclose the locations or activities of its personnel.”

Consisting of 450 modular homes spaced out across 57 acres of state-owned land overlooking downtown Lahaina, Ka La‘i Ola was built for residents displaced by the Lahaina fire who don’t meet income or background qualifications for Federal Emergency Management Agency housing. It is home to nearly 900 people and has the capacity to house up to 600 more, according to its website.

Gov. Josh Green and Maui Mayor Richard Bissen joined community leaders and families Wednesday morning to mark the project’s completion. The site is expected to be handed over to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands by 2029 for Native Hawaiian beneficiaries.

Community advocates informed county officials earlier this week that locals were concerned about ICE activity at Ka La‘i Ola, according to a statement provided Wednesday evening by Maui County spokeswoman Laksmi Abraham.

“As a temporary housing site for wildfire survivors and a place of peaceful recovery, Ka La‘i Ola and all disaster recovery sites must remain safe spaces where survivors can seek shelter and support without fear or intimidation,” Bissen said in the statement. “Our community has faced extraordinary challenges, and these recovery sites are meant to serve as havens of stability and healing for all who need them.”

More than 2,200 structures were destroyed by the Lahaina wildfire, and approximately 12,000 people were displaced. As of Wednesday, roughly 60 homes had been rebuilt, according to the county’s recovery website.

‘Still Terrified’

Some residents are only recently returning to live in Lahaina after bouncing among emergency shelters and other accommodations during the past two years.

“They literally just moved in and are starting to feel safe and not traumatized anymore,” Block said. “And now ICE is driving around in the neighborhood and knocking on people’s doors. Even if they’re not looking for my clients, they’re still terrified.”

Some immigrants in the community have been missing work or avoiding returning to their homes because they were worried that ICE might be able to track them down, said Veronica Mendoza, the co-founder and executive director of the local immigrant advocacy group Roots Reborn.

She and other advocates helped immigrant wildfire survivors get approved to move into Ka La‘i Ola. She expressed gratitude for the housing, but said members of the immigrant community do not feel safe there right now.

Block, the immigration attorney, said the Department of Homeland Security’s shift in stance to allow enforcement actions near disaster-relief areas damages the community’s well-being.

“Because if people who need help aren’t going to the hospital, and if people who need to go to school aren’t going to school, people who want to participate in their spiritual life aren’t going to church because those places are no longer safe,” he said, “then all of us are losing our freedom and our rights.”

Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers, emphasized the urgent need for international oversight amid growing concerns over the treatment of immigrants and their families.

Background of Immigration Sweeps

Recent immigration enforcement operations have targeted multiple communities across the country, prompting the detention and deportation of several individuals. Advocates argue that these sweeps often disproportionately affect marginalized communities, raising questions about due process, family separation, and access to legal resources. Huerta’s request to the UN highlights these ongoing debates and seeks a global perspective on domestic enforcement practices.

Huerta’s Statement

In a public statement, Huerta condemned the actions of immigration authorities, calling the operations “unjust and harmful to vulnerable communities.” She urged international authorities to review the policies and practices employed during these sweeps, emphasizing that accountability and transparency are essential to uphold human rights standards.

Key Points Table

Response from Authorities

U.S. immigration officials have not formally responded to Huerta’s request but have previously defended enforcement operations as legal and necessary for public safety. The contrasting views highlight the tension between human rights advocates and law enforcement authorities, and the debate may gain international attention if the UN decides to investigate.

Public and Community Reactions

The call for a UN investigation has sparked discussions among advocacy groups, legal experts, and community members. Many support Huerta’s stance, arguing that independent oversight is crucial to ensure immigrant protections. Others believe domestic legal and policy mechanisms are sufficient to address concerns. Social media reactions reflect both strong support for immigrant rights and debates about the appropriate role of international organizations in U.S. affairs.

One of the people said the gunman was 29. The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the gunman had opened fire from a nearby rooftop, describing him as a “sniper” who shot “indiscriminately,” hitting three detainees who were inside a transport van.

The identities of the victims have not been released, but one of the injured is a Mexican national, according to Mexico’s foreign ministry. Homeland Security officials previously said in the statement that two detainees had been killed and one wounded, but corrected the tolls in a later statement.

Officials suggested that it was a targeted attack. Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, posted an image of the ammunition on social media, saying that an initial review of the evidence indicated an ideological motive.

The New York Times has not independently verified Mr. Patel’s description of the gunman or his motives.

The shooting comes two weeks after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a political activist whose death prompted President Trump to threaten to silence what he described as left-wing extremists.

Mr. Trump struck a similar tone after Wednesday’s shooting, vowing on social media to crack down on “Deranged Radical Leftists.” He wrote that he would sign an executive order to “dismantle these Domestic Terrorism Networks” and called on Democrats to “STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE.”

Here’s what else to know:

The suspect: Mr. Jahn left a long record of himself online but apparently little indication that he was politically active. On social media, he talked extensively about video games, cars and marijuana. Records show that he voted in a Democratic primary in March 2020 in Texas and was also registered to vote as an independent in Oklahoma, where he voted in 2024. Read more ›

Witness accounts: Two people who were waiting outside the facility for relatives who were going through immigration proceedings described the frantic moments of the shooting, hearing gunfire and taking cover until officers escorted them inside. “It was one shot after another after another after another,” one witness said.

Previous violence: The shooting was the second at a federal immigration facility in Texas in recent months. A police officer was shot in July outside an ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas. Read more ›

On the other side of a tense national immigration debate, some Democratic members of Congress in Texas and leaders with several of the top national immigrant and civil rights organizations did not disagree: the harmful rhetoric needs to stop — against law enforcement officers, and against immigrants.

The F.B.I. said the gunman in Dallas died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and left behind ammunition that bore the phrase “ANTI-ICE” in blue writing. But The New York Times has not independently verified federal officials’ assertion that the shooter was targeting ICE.

In some social media feeds and activist circles, agents have been called “Nazis” and “fascists” while elsewhere, prominent critics have used pointed, if less inflammatory language. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California this week said that masked agents grabbing immigrants off the streets were “authoritarian actions by an authoritarian government.”

Opponents of the administration’s crackdown have said that the belligerent, incendiary tone had been set at the top by President Trump, who has referred to undocumented immigrants as “monsters” and pledged to wage war on American cities that did not bend to his administration’s hard-line immigration agenda.

“My concern is that this anti-immigrant rhetoric has led us to this point,” said Rochelle Garza, president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, an advocacy organization.

Along with the man killed, two other immigrant detainees were wounded in the shooting. No law enforcement officers were hit by the gunfire.

Battles over immigrant rights have been escalating on the streets and in the courts for months. Trump administration officials have sought to characterize many actions of immigrant rights lawyers and activists — including protests and know-your-rights presentations — as enabling illegal immigration and threatening to national security.

Law enforcement officers and federal immigration agents have faced off with activists and concerned residents who have sought to film their actions. In some of the most heated outbursts, some have yelled or cursed at agents and sought to physically block them from apprehending immigrants.

On Wednesday, Democrats and immigrant rights leaders who have heavily criticized ICE in recent months condemned the violence and urged people to lower the temperature of the immigration debate.

Representative Joaquin Castro, a Democrat from San Antonio, called for Americans to “reject extremism in our politics.”

Others also took sharp, if measured, jabs at the administration. Representative Jasmine Crockett, a Democrat of Dallas, also denounced the shooting but observed that “rhetoric used to dehumanize and demonize immigrants in this country has led to increased hate crime incidents.”

Juan Proaño, chief executive of the League of United Latin American Citizens, a civil rights group, said in an interview that the shooting — and the administration’s response — would make it more difficult to hold ICE accountable. But he added it would not deter his group from continuing to challenge its immigration actions in court.

“Our community is literally under attack — and ICE cannot escape its responsibility to keep people in detention safe,” he said. “We will not be silenced, and we will not stop demanding accountability.”

J. David Goodman contributed reporting.

Federal authorities said that the shooter had opened fire from the roof of a nearby building, firing “indiscriminately,” and hitting several victims. The gunman, identified as Joshua Jahn, 29, died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, officials said.

Vice President JD Vance labeled the shooter as a “violent left-wing extremist” at a speaking event in North Carolina. He said that information not yet made public proved “this person was politically motivated,” without elaborating on what evidence the government had.

The Times, in interviews with authorities and others about the shooting, has not independently verified Mr. Vance’s description of the shooter or a motive; Mr. Jahn, who had an extensive online profile, had voted in a Democratic primary in 2020 in Texas, but showed little obvious interest in politics.

Mr. Vance also engaged in a high-profile clash about the Dallas shooting with Jon Favreau, a prominent progressive podcast host, as well as Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who Mr. Vance suggested had helped foster a dangerous environment with anti-ICE rhetoric. President Trump also suggested liberals were to blame for the violence.

The reaction to the shooting is indicative of a now-common playbook in an age of violent attacks, often punctuated by hasty conclusions and righteous anger.

The online skirmish between Mr. Vance and Mr. Favreau began in the hours after the shooting in Dallas, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced shortly after the attack that “our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them,” adding that a motive for the shooting had not been established.

Mr. Vance reposted Ms. Noem’s message, and included his own comment, saying that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

That post from Mr. Vance drew the ire of Mr. Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama and a host of “Pod Save America,” the popular politics podcast.

Mr. Favreau said that “the vice president is not a reliable source of information,” and said that Mr. Vance had previously erred several times by voicing “a political take” only to be contradicted by law enforcement.

In the case of the assassination of Mr. Kirk, messages written on bullets found at the scene of the crime led to a great deal of conjecture after the fact, with numerous assumptions being made about what could be derived about the shooter’s motivation.

On Wednesday, Mr. Vance and others leaned on a post by F.B.I. Director Kash Patel that showed a clip of rifle-caliber ammunition, with one casing having a message on it that read “ANTI-ICE” in what appeared to be blue writing. The actual motivation behind the messages written on the bullets in both Mr. Kirk’s assassination and Wednesday’s killing are still not known, and The Times has not confirmed details shedding light on the ammunition casing in Dallas.

Still, the fight between Mr. Favreau and the vice president — which devolved into Mr. Vance calling the podcaster a profanity — was just one front in a quickly evolving battle between the right and left.

By late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump had also begun to attack Democrats, posting on Truth Social that he was “CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT NOW!” and decrying “the Left Wing Domestic Terrorism that is terrorizing our Country.”

“The continuing violence from Radical Left Terrorists, in the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, must be stopped,” Mr. Trump wrote.

In a statement later released by Homeland Security, Ms. Noem said that the “far-left” needed to moderate its rhetoric. “Comparing ICE Day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences,” she said.

Mr. Vance was even more outspoken, attacking Mr. Newsom in his North Carolina speech, accusing the Democrat of demonizing ICE as “part of an authoritarian government” during an interview on Tuesday night on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”

“If your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell and you have no place in the political conversation of the United States of America,” Mr. Vance said.

Mr. Newsom — who, like Mr. Vance, is considered a possible presidential candidate in 2028 — had said in his interview with Mr. Colbert that “the ICE issue is alarming beyond words,” and expressed concern at federal agents’ tactics, including using masks and unmarked cars.

“These are not just authoritarian tendencies, these are authoritarian actions by an authoritarian government,” Mr. Newsom said, adding, “This can’t be normalized.”

Mr. Newsom also responded on X to Mr. Vance’s remarks on Wednesday, posting: “No thanks, JD. I will not be going ‘straight to hell’ today.”

“Though when I watch you speak I certainly feel like I’m already there,” the governor wrote.

In recent months, demonstrations outside ICE facilities in Los Angeles, Illinois and New York led to confrontations with law enforcement officers and arrests. This month, an ICE officer fatally shot a man in the Chicago area whom immigration agents had tried to pull over. The Department of Homeland Security said that the man was resisting arrest during the stop and that he dragged the officer as he fled in his vehicle.

Department officials have blamed such episodes on “hateful rhetoric,” calling in a statement last week for the “media, leftist groups and sanctuary politicians” to end the “demonization” of immigration enforcement officers.

“We have to turn down the temperature before someone else is killed,” Tricia McLaughlin, the department’s assistant secretary for public affairs, said in the statement. “This violence must end.”

On Wednesday, a detainee was fatally shot when a gunman opened fire on an ICE facility in Dallas, injuring two others, investigators said. The authorities suggested that the gunman — who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound — was targeting immigration enforcement agents.

The shooting was the culmination of months of rising tensions over the Trump administration’s immigration policies, as federal officers use increasingly aggressive enforcement tactics to bring in detainees and reach arrest targets.

Anger in some cities has mounted as immigration authorities have conducted large-scale operations across the country, with Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, saying this year the administration would strive to hit 3,000 arrests a day. ICE officers have arrested immigrants at immigration court hearings. Federal agents have swept through parking lots of big-box stores in the Los Angeles region. Videos of homeland security agents and officers breaking windows of cars belonging to targets have proliferated on social media.

Protesters, including faith leaders, community groups and liberal organizations, have held vigils, sit-ins and peaceful rallies at detention centers — though some demonstrations have turned volatile. Federal officials also report a sharp rise in threats against officers.

ICE has alleged a “more than 1,000 percent increase” in assaults against its officers this year, though the agency has not released detailed data of the episodes and it has not specified what it defines as assault. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately provide more specific information on Wednesday.

But the agency has repeatedly highlighted examples of threats it says its officers have received, such as a menacing letter with a white substance sent to a New York field office in August and pictures of injuries it says its officers have sustained while conducting arrests.

It has also sought to impose stiffer penalties. In a social media post, the agency warned last week that anyone who assaults an ICE officer would face federal felony assault charges and “prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.”

“We’re being compared to the Gestapo, to the Nazis, and that’s just not true and it’s dangerous rhetoric that puts us in situations like this,” ICE’s deputy director, Madison Sheahan, said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday.

As the federal government’s deportation campaign has accelerated and federal agents have homed in on liberal cities with policies aimed at protecting undocumented residents, protests have at times turned tense, leading to clashes with law enforcement officers.

In June, a federal building in downtown Los Angeles used by ICE to process immigrants became a central part of the protests that roiled the city, leading to instances of vandalism and the arrests of hundreds of protesters.

Last week, more than a dozen local Democratic officials were arrested at a federal building in Manhattan used by ICE after they blocked the garage doors and tried to get into the holding cells. The officials cast their actions as urgent displays of civil disobedience. ICE denounced them as obstructionist and dangerous, not just for the safety of its agents, but also for detained migrants. The agency also said the building had to go into lockdown after someone called in a bomb threat after the arrests.

Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller who was among those arrested, said on social media at the time that officials were demanding access to the ICE field office because “NYers refuse to stand by while ICE abducts our neighbors.”

On Wednesday, after the shooting, Mr. Lander said on social media that “surging political violence threatens all of us.”

“Whatever motivated the shooter, this act is heinous, and should be condemned by people regardless of ideology,” he said, adding, “The tradition of non-violence, which we practiced last week, is key to restoring our humanity, and making democratic co-existence possible.”

In May, the mayor of Newark was arrested outside a new detention facility in New Jersey and briefly charged with trespassing, after a protest at the facility that also entangled three members of Congress.

The wearing of masks by ICE officers, which was not the norm before this year, has become a flashpoint among those opposed to President Trump’s deportation campaign, prompting lawmakers in a handful of Democratic-led states to push for legislation banning the use of masks.

On Saturday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California signed a bill that would prevent federal immigration agents from wearing masks in the state. The move came after videos had spread online showing masked immigration agents handcuffing immigrants in Southern California. Democrats and immigration activists have argued that officers have acted with impunity knowing that their faces were shielded.

Homeland Security Department officials condemned the state law and called it unconstitutional, adding that their officers would not comply with the legislation. Federal officials have defended ICE officers’ use of masks, which they say protects them and their families from harassment or worse. Federal officials have said that officers carry badges and credentials and identify themselves when required.

“My fear is that the immigrants are the ones being targeted,” Ms. Duarte said as she sat in her car near the site of the shooting.

For weeks, Ms. Duarte has been visiting the site, which is not technically a detention center but an ICE office, for prayer vigils. She said she had heard about deplorable conditions there — dozens of detainees, men and women, crammed into what was described as a conference room, for days at time.

“They have all these people in one room, without beds, without food, without restrooms,” she said. “They have 30, 40, 60 people in one room.”

Jennifer Canadell, 34, was standing near the ICE facility Wednesday afternoon, hoping to hear from her husband, Rony Arroyo, 34, who was detained on Tuesday after an immigration appointment.

“I’m worried,” she said, holding their two-year-old. “I came down when I heard about the shooting.”

The couple, from Venezuela, showed up together for an annual check-in with immigration officials, but only he was detained, Ms. Canadell said.

“Everyone who is in there is in danger,” she said.

Other Latino leaders feared that the partisan rhetoric may only inflame tensions.

“We reject violence in any form, and we call on leaders at every level to act responsibly and stop inflaming tensions,” said Ray Mancera, the league’s vice president for the Southwest region. “Our communities deserve peace, not fear.”

Noemi Rios, co-founder of Vecinos Unidos DFW, United Neighbors, an immigration advocacy program, said that groups like hers have pressed for humane treatment of immigrants and have shunned violence.

“We don’t want to live in a world with so much violence and hatred,” Ms. Rios said. “We don’t wish violence on anyone.”

President Trump condemned “Deranged Radical Leftists” in a social media post about the shooting, linking the attack to the assassination of the political activist Charlie Kirk. “This violence is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis,’” he wrote.

D.H.S. officials said the suspect was targeting the ICE office from a nearby building. One detainee died in the shooting, and two others were critically wounded, officials said.

Mr. Jahn, who according to records voted in a Democratic primary in March 2020 in Texas, had an extensive online profile. But he showed little obvious interest in politics based on what has been uncovered so far. He has at least two Reddit accounts, where he talked about video games, cars, “South Park” and marijuana.

He was also registered to vote as an independent in Oklahoma, where his parents own property in Durant, Okla., north of Dallas, and where he voted once, in the 2024 general election.

Public records indicate that Mr. Jahn had at least a few minor scrapes with the law, including a charge for selling marijuana in 2015. He was released from court supervision for that charge a few years later, and the proceedings were dismissed.

Mr. Jahn was raised with a brother and a sister in a far north suburb of Dallas. His father retired in 2020 after spending 36 years in engineering roles at an elevator and escalator company, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Mr. Jahn lived with his parents in Texas at least as recently as a few months ago, according to public records. Their house is on a cul-de-sac in a rural area north of Dallas and Fort Worth that is rapidly developing as the metropolitan area expands. The house is a short drive from an outlet mall in Allen, Texas, where a shooter killed eight people in 2023.

Before noon on Wednesday, a blue truck drove quickly down the residential street leading to Mr. Jahn’s house. A man and woman got out of the car, quickly went into the house and did not answer the door.

According to a criminal complaint filed in the case, that shooting took place after a group of 10 to 12 people set off fireworks outside the Prairieland Detention Center that night. Not long after, one or two people from the group broke off and began spray-painting graffiti on nearby vehicles and a guard structure, scrawling the words “Ice pig” and “traitor” on a pair of cars, the complaint said.

The officer arrived at the scene around 11 p.m. After he stepped out of his car, the complaint said, two shooters opened fire from a wooded area next to the detention facility, firing numerous rounds and wounding the officer in the neck. He was flown to a hospital, where he was treated and discharged.

Investigators said later that they found spent ammunition where the shooters had been standing, of a type typically used in AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles.

A detective with the Johnson County sheriff’s office pulled over a van that had been seen leaving the scene, and the driver told the authorities about having transported several people to the detention center to “make some noise,” according to charging documents. The authorities reported finding a handgun, two AR-15-style rifles, two Kevlar ballistic-style vests and a ballistic helmet in the van.

Prosecutors have charged more than a dozen people in connection with the shooting in Alvarado, and have said that the fireworks, vandalism and shooting were part of a coordinated plan to ambush local and federal law enforcement officers. An organization that represents relatives and friends of people who were arrested over the episode disputes that characterization, saying that many of the people who were present that night believed they were attending a nonviolent protest.

A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Sept. 30.

In a separate incident three days after the Alvarado shooting, a gunman opened fire at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection station in McAllen, injuring a Border Patrol employee and two officers. The gunman was fatally shot by law enforcement officers.

There have been numerous protests and demonstrations at federal facilities across the country over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies. Some protests, including ones in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, have involved vandalism and scuffles with law enforcement officers, who have sometimes deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades against demonstrators.

In contrast with the July attack in Alvarado, the shooting victims in Dallas on Wednesday were detainees, hit by indiscriminate fire, the authorities said. No law enforcement officers were shot, they added.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/24/multimedia/24ice-shooting-promo-830pm-cphm/24ice-shooting-promo-830pm-cphm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 03:56:50.123384

Under current law, canines that serve at ports of entry are housed at contracted kennels. The bill would require the agency to report to the Congress on the pilot program’s implementation within one year of enactment and assess the effectiveness of home kenneling and make recommendations about its continued use by the agency within 180 days of the program ending.

Congressional members received the plan on September 12, giving them a tight time frame — only 19 days until the end of the 2025 fiscal year on September 30 — to either approve the State Department's plan or push back against it and risk losing the funding by the time the year ends, the

The State Department's proposed foreign aid funding projects have shifted from solely seeking to provide humanitarian to countries struggling with famine, disease and war to now being centered around how can these projects strengthen America's own national security and interests. For example, one of the projects the State Department is seeking to invest into is centered around supporting ""U.S. immigration priorities"" in Africa. The State Department is also seeking to fund projects combatting ""Marxist, anti-American regimes"" in Latin America, as well as “economic development and conservation work” in Greenland.

“The national security interests of the United States require that the United States utilize these foreign assistance funds to meet new challenges in ways that make America safer, stronger or more prosperous,"" the document stated.

Some of the projects laid out by the State Department have already garnered bipartisan support such as assisting United States allies in the Pacific in an effort to counter Chinese aggression. However, if Congress decides to completely agree to the Trump administration's decision to completely shift funding for projects already approved by Congress, it risks eroding their authority laid out in the Constitution over the federal budget.

Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) accused the Trump of “attempting to raid programs that Congress has authorized and appropriated to strengthen democracy, advance peace and support vulnerable communities and instead funnel that money into an unaccountable slush fund,"" in a statement to the Washington Post.

In August, the Trump administration notified House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in a letter that he intended to rescind approximately $4.9 billion from the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development and International Assistance programs, in an effort to codify cuts made under the Department of Government Efficiency.

“Any effort to rescind appropriated funds without congressional approval is a clear violation of the law,” Susan Collins (R-Maine), who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said.

However, earlier this month the Supreme Court issued an emergency order allowing for the Trump administration's freezing of billions of dollars in foreign aid to remain in effect.

The Busan District Court said the head of the Gimhae Airport Immigration Office must cancel the decision not to process the man’s application for refugee status.

The plaintiff, who is in his 30s, reportedly applied for refugee status after arriving at Gimhae Airport in Busan on April 27. The Justice Ministry, however, decided not to refer his case for examination.

In response, the man refused to return to his home country and has since remained in a temporary holding area in the airport for those denied entry.

The man claimed refugee status, saying he fled political persecution in Guinea after participating in protests against the military dictatorship.

But the ministry did not move ahead with the refugee screening process as it found the plaintiff’s statements lacked credibility.

The man filed a lawsuit against the airport’s immigration office with assistance from local human rights organizations.

“Although we won in the first trial, we need to wait and see whether the Justice Ministry will file an appeal,” the plaintiff’s legal representative was quoted as saying by Yonhap News Agency.

Local human rights groups have also raised concerns about the man’s treatment at the airport, claiming a clear human rights violation.

According to the organizations, including the Joint Committee for Migrant Rights and Human Rights, the plaintiff received a burger for every meal. They say the Refugee Act states that basic food, clothing and shelter shall be provided to applicants in the airport’s holding area.

The human rights group also raised the concern that the plaintiff is expected to remain in the airport's holding area until the final ruling is made in a higher court.

Refugee applicants at Incheon Airport whose cases are not referred are reportedly transferred to a waiting facility outside the airport if they appeal and win their cases in the first trial. Gimhae Airport has no such designated facility.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on Ice law enforcement”.
The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.
Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”.
While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.","A gunman fired at a Dallas immigration field office on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two more, before killing himself in what authorities called an indiscriminate attack on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Here’s what we know about the attack so far:

One detainee has been killed, with two others in critical condition. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said previously that two detainees had been killed and one injured, but issued a corrected statement. The Dallas police chief, Daniel Comeaux, said that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem.

The DHS said no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. But Comeaux also said that officials would not be releasing the identities of any victims at this time.

DHS officials say this was “an attack on Ice law enforcement”. At both today’s press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.

The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.

Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”. The DHS later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. All three victims were inside the van at the time the gunman opened fire.

The Dallas field office where the shooting occurred is used for short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by Ice. The facility is along Interstate 35 East, south-west of a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and just blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.

Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”. For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences”.

Donald Trump instantly politicized the shooting, claiming in a social media post that it “is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis.’”

The vice-president, JD Vance, claimed without evidence that the shooting was carried out by “a violent leftwing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”. While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7d62192946c0cbd53a0731275f5decef220f32a/311_0_2084_1667/master/2084.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=893c2eef7d36ea5dc789662a1305b49d",N,,2025-09-25 03:57:11.239407

But to do that, the federal government will have to overcome legal challenges from cities, states, and advocates.

Judges are weighing ecological effects, zoning laws, and the U.S. Constitution to shape whether President Donald Trump’s administration can deliver on his promise of mass deportations.

Here’s a look at some prominent cases:

CoreCivic v. New Jersey

In 2021, New Jersey passed a law that prevents state, local and private entities from entering into or renewing contracts for immigration detention. CoreCivic, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional.

CoreCivic argued that New Jersey’s law shouldn’t apply to it because the company is effectively serving as an arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Constitution blocks state laws from regulating the federal government or its agencies.

In 2023, U.S. District Judge Robert Kirsch decided partly in favor of CoreCivic. Although New Jersey could prevent state and local entities from entering into contracts with ICE, he ruled, it could not prevent CoreCivic or another private entity from doing so. Calling the law a “dagger aimed at the heart of the federal government’s immigration enforcement mission and operations,” Kirsch reasoned that allowing the full law to stand could encourage neighboring states to pass similar laws. That, he wrote, “would result in nothing short of chaos.”

A federal appeals court upheld Kirsch’s decision in July.

Newark v. GEO

In late February, GEO announced ICE had awarded it a 15-year contract, worth roughly $1 billion, to reopen Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed facility in Newark, New Jersey. Delaney opened May 1 after months of what city officials called “irresponsible construction practices.”

In an April complaint, the city alleged Delaney Hall put detained people and staff in danger because GEO wouldn’t allow city inspectors to review the plumbing, electrical work or elevators. Newark also alleged that GEO failed to file for a certificate of continued occupancy — a form required whenever there is a change in tenant or ownership of a property. The city asked for a court order to stop Delaney’s operation while the case proceeds.

GEO called the lawsuit politically motivated and adopted a similar argument to the one CoreCivic made, saying Newark couldn’t use local codes to interfere with the federal government’s business: detaining immigrants.

Newark didn’t get the injunction it sought, so Delaney Hall remains open as the case proceeds.

City of Leavenworth v. CoreCivic

CoreCivic is seeking to reopen the shuttered Leavenworth Detention Center in Kansas under a new contract with ICE to hold up to 1,000 immigrants. The company had used the building from 1992 through 2021, primarily to hold people awaiting trial on federal charges.

The city argues the company must obtain a special use permit to operate the facility as a detention center. When the city passed a 2012 zoning law that would have required such a permit, CoreCivic was exempt because the facility already operated as a prison. But because the facility has now been idle for several years, the city maintains CoreCivic must now apply for the permit.

CoreCivic insists it doesn’t need the permit because it never abandoned the building. As it did in New Jersey, it also argues that local ordinances can’t interfere with the company when it’s doing work for the federal government.

The city’s argument won over a local judge, who issued a temporary order barring the reopening. CoreCivic has asked the judge to reconsider while the battle plays out.

Friends of the Everglades v. Noem

In late May, two environmental advocacy groups sued several federal and Florida agencies over a sprawling new immigration detention center in the Everglades. Commonly called “Alligator Alcatraz” — a term coined by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier — the facility was constructed in a matter of days on an airfield in the heart of the Big Cypress National Preserve. Made of trailers and huge tents on the tarmac, the complex is expected to be temporary but has a capacity of up to 3,000 beds, according to state officials.

The advocacy groups want the project shut down on the grounds that authorities failed to produce the required assessment of how it will affect the environment. They’re also arguing it will harm people’s ability to use the area for recreation, science and other purposes. The Miccosukee Tribe has joined the lawsuit, saying the facility negatively affects sacred sites and other protected lands.

In court filings, defendants have sought to shift responsibility onto one another. Miami-Dade County argued the state used its emergency powers to commandeer the facility and that it was powerless to fight back. The Florida Division of Emergency Management maintains it didn’t need to produce an environmental impact report because those are required only of federal agencies.

Lawyers for ICE and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, argue the federal government can’t close the facility because it is the state’s operation.

In late August, a federal judge halted continued construction of the facility and said no additional detainees could be sent there. Additionally, officials must remove temporary fencing that prevented members of the Miccosukee Tribe from accessing the land. A separate lawsuit alleges detainees at the facility have been prevented from accessing legal counsel.

Guantanamo Bay plaintiffs v. DHS, ICE and other defendants

On Feb. 4, a plane carrying 10 immigrants landed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after the White House directed officials to use the base to house immigrants being deported from the U.S. The notorious military prison there — first opened in 2002 to hold terrorism suspects — had never been used for this purpose.

Represented by the ACLU and several other organizations, immigrants sent to Guantanamo Bay sued, arguing their detention outside the U.S. was illegal and a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process and their right to habeas corpus, the legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment.

The case is pending.

GEO v. Washington state

In 2023, Washington state enacted new regulations and requirements for private detention centers. Those included requiring the state Health Department to adopt new rules regarding health and safety and regular inspections of such facilities.

GEO, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.

Among the state’s arguments was that GEO had no standing to sue because the law would only affect new or extended contracts — not those already in place.

A federal judge ruled mostly in favor of GEO but, on a technicality, left alone the section of the law that would affect new or extended contracts.

The state appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in February but hasn’t ruled.

In May, the state amended the statute to define a “private detention facility” as any operated by a private, nongovernmental entity, regardless of whether the facility is operated for profit. The new law, GEO argues, is still unconstitutional but much different in substance and scope.

Additionally, officials must remove temporary fencing that prevented members of the Miccosukee Tribe from accessing the land. A separate lawsuit alleges detainees at the facility have been prevented from accessing legal counsel.

Guantanamo Bay plaintiffs v. DHS, ICE and other defendants

On Feb. 4, a plane carrying 10 immigrants landed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba after the White House directed officials to use the base to house immigrants being deported from the U.S. The notorious military prison there — first opened in 2002 to hold terrorism suspects — had never been used for this purpose.

Represented by the ACLU and several other organizations, immigrants sent to Guantanamo Bay sued, arguing their detention outside the U.S. was illegal and a violation of their Fifth Amendment right to due process and their right to habeas corpus, the legal principle that protects individuals from unlawful imprisonment.

The case is pending.

GEO v. Washington state

In 2023, Washington state enacted new regulations and requirements for private detention centers. Those included requiring the state Health Department to adopt new rules regarding health and safety and regular inspections of such facilities.

GEO, which operated the only private detention center in the state, sued on the grounds that the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.

Among the state’s arguments was that GEO had no standing to sue because the law would only affect new or extended contracts — not those already in place.

A federal judge ruled mostly in favor of GEO but, on a technicality, left alone the section of the law that would affect new or extended contracts.

The state appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in February but hasn’t ruled.

In May, the state amended the statute to define a “private detention facility” as any operated by a private, nongovernmental entity, regardless of whether the facility is operated for profit. The new law, GEO argues, is still unconstitutional but much different in substance and scope.

Ltd, based on information that reasonably indicates forced labor use.

Effective immediately, CBP will detain bicycles, bicycle parts, and accessories manufactured in Taiwan by Giant. This WRO, the third issued in 2025 and the fourth in Fiscal Year 2025, was issued due to violations of 19 U.S.C. § 1307, the law prohibiting goods made with forced labor from entering the U.S.

“CBP has a proven track record of cracking down on companies that use forced labor to the detriment of law-abiding U.S. businesses,” said CBP Commissioner Rodney S. Scott.

CBP identified the following International Labour Organization forced labor indicators during its investigation of Giant:

abuse of vulnerability,

abusive working and living conditions,

debt bondage,

withholding of wages, and

excessive overtime.

Giant profited by imposing such abuse, resulting in goods produced below market value and undercutting American businesses by millions of dollars in unjustly earned profits. The International Labour Organization estimates that nearly 28 million workers are under conditions of forced labor worldwide.

“Importers have a responsibility to do their due diligence and know their supply chains,” said Acting Executive Assistant Commissioner of CBP’s Office of Trade Susan S. Thomas. “CBP will continue to investigate allegations of forced labor and take action when we find it in U.S. supply chains.”

The WRO against Giant is the latest action CBP has taken to address forced labor. With this WRO issuance, CBP currently oversees and enforces 53 WROs and nine Findings under 19 U.S.C. § 1307.

When CBP has evidence indicating that imported goods are made by forced labor, the agency issues orders to detain those shipments. Importers of detained shipments may seek to destroy or export their shipments or seek to demonstrate that the merchandise is admissible.

CBP receives allegations of forced labor from a variety of sources including government agencies, media, non-government organizations, and members of the public. Any person or organization that has reason to believe merchandise produced with forced labor is being, or is likely to be, imported into the United States can report detailed allegations by contacting CBP through the e-Allegations Online Trade Violation Reporting System or by calling 1-800-BE-ALERT.",,N,,2025-09-24 23:57:28.529309

Lyons, the acting director of ICE, confirmed to Fox News that officials had identified the suspected attacker as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.
According to authorities, the gunman killed himself after opening fire, and his body was found near the ICE facility he had fired at.
In a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, President Trump said he had been briefed on the Dallas shooting.","A gunman armed with a rifle opened fire on a United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two others before taking his own life, authorities said.

Officials reported that the shooter left behind ammunition marked with the phrase “ANTI-ICE” written in blue. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of targeted violence. Acting ICE director Todd Lyons confirmed that the suspect identified was a man named Joshua Jahn.

The shooting comes at a time when ICE has emerged as the sword arm of US President Donald Trump’s attempts to deport not only undocumented immigrants but also legal migrants seen as critical of his administration’s priorities – including for opposing Israel’s war on Gaza.

The attack on the ICE facility also comes two weeks after the assassination of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, an event that led Trump to vow action against what he called left-wing extremists.

Here is what you need to know:

What happened and when?

Police said they got a call about a shooting about 6:40am local time (11:40 GMT) on Wednesday, September 24.

Four people were shot. One detainee died, and two others were taken to hospital in critical condition.

The gunman – authorities described him as a “sniper” – died from a self-inflicted gunshot. Officials said he fired indiscriminately at the ICE building from a nearby rooftop. The victims were either inside a van near the entrance to the building or nearby.

Authorities “found bullets throughout the entire building that had punctured into the facility”, ICE deputy director Madison Sheahan said.

No police officers were hurt, according to FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Joe Rothrock.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. Still, FBI director Kash Patel described the attack as “politically motivated”.

“These despicable, politically motivated attacks against law enforcement are not a one-off,” Patel said in a social media post.

“We are only miles from Prairieland, Texas where just two months ago an individual ambushed a separate ICE facility targeting their officers.” On July 4, ICE said nearly a dozen individuals armed with tactical gear and weapons attacked its Prairieland facility, injuring an officer, who survived.

What is ICE?

ICE, or US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security that enforces immigration laws – including arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants – and investigates crimes such as human trafficking, drug smuggling and financial fraud.

In recent years, the agency has frequently clashed with protesters, particularly over detention conditions and deportation policies.

“The Department of Homeland Security reports assaults against its officers have risen eightfold since Trump began his mass deportations,” Al Jazeera’s Heidi Zhou-Castro reported from Washington.

Trump has made immigration enforcement a centrepiece of his presidency, with large-scale deportations and high-profile crackdowns.

“Now, the agency is deploying more security to its offices – while leaders warn that the US is headed in a dangerous direction if the political violence continues,” she added.

Where did the shooting happen?

The shooting took place at ICE’s field office in Dallas, which covers Texas and all of Oklahoma.

The ICE facility sits along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a major airport for the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and only a few blocks from hotels that serve travellers.

This is not the first attack on the facility.

Last month, 36-year-old US citizen Bratton Dean Wilkinson was arrested after arriving at the facility and claiming he had a bomb in his backpack, showing officers what he said was a detonator on his wrist.

What do we know about the suspect?

Lyons, the acting director of ICE, confirmed to Fox News that officials had identified the suspected attacker as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.

Jahn had lived in a Dallas suburb, according to public records. According to authorities, the gunman killed himself after opening fire, and his body was found near the ICE facility he had fired at.

Court records show Jahn was arrested in 2015 for delivering marijuana to buyers. In 2016, he admitted to delivering between a quarter-ounce (7g) and five pounds (2.3kg). He was given five years of probation and a $500 fine.

Under Texas law, the charge is considered a “state jail felony”, which is the lowest level of felony offence in the state.

As Jahn’s name began circulating online, his older brother, Noah Jahn, spoke with a Reuters reporter. Noah, 30, who lives in McKinney, Texas – about 48km (30 miles) north of Dallas – said he was unaware of his brother having any negative feelings towards ICE.

“I didn’t know he had any political intent at all,” Noah said.

“He’s a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn’t really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Ryan Sanderson, who met him in 2017, told The Associated Press news agency.

“I don’t remember him being that abnormal. He didn’t seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble. He kept his head down and stayed working.”

What do we know about the victims?

Authorities have not released the identities of the victims. They said the three detainees who were shot were in the country without proper documentation and had been taken into custody and were awaiting transfer to a longer-term facility.

According to Mexico’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs, one of the injured detainees is a Mexican national. The ministry said the individual is hospitalised with serious injuries, and that the Mexican consulate has contacted the family to provide support and legal assistance.

What have been the reactions?

In a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, President Trump said he had been briefed on the Dallas shooting. He described the attacker as “deranged”, referred to the “Anti-ICE” message allegedly found on the shell casings and called that “despicable”.

Trump did not mention the victims, but instead urged, “CALLING ON ALL DEMOCRATS TO STOP THIS RHETORIC AGAINST ICE AND AMERICA’S LAW ENFORCEMENT, RIGHT NOW!”

Vice President JD Vance, without offering evidence, said the attack was politically motivated.

At an event in North Carolina, he said that California Governor Gavin Newsom and others didn’t need to support the Trump administration’s immigration policies, but “if your political rhetoric incites violence against law enforcement, you can go straight to hell”.

Newsom quickly responded.

“No thanks, JD. I will not be going ‘straight to hell’ today,” Newsom said. “Though when I watch you speak I certainly feel like I’m already there.”

Texas Senator Ted Cruz appealed for calm.

“This has very real consequences,” Cruz said.

“Look, in America, we disagree. That’s fine. That’s the democratic process, but your political opponents are not Nazis. We need to learn to work together without demonising each other, without attacking each other,” he added.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25267683160528-1758754927.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-24 23:57:32.816268

We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of Zapet’s asylum application and determine that substantial evidence supports the denial of her withholding of removal and CAT claims. …

“For her asylum claim, Zapet contends that the BIA incorrectly affirmed the IJ’s determination that she failed to present extraordinary circumstances sufficient to warrant consideration of her untimely application. The government counters that we lack jurisdiction to review the agency’s determination. We agree with the government. …

“We next address the BIA’s denial of Zapet’s application for withholding of removal. Zapet contends that the evidence she presented compelled the BIA to find that she suffered past persecution and would more likely than not suffer future persecution. …

“Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s determination that Zapet failed to demonstrate past persecution. Zapet’s testimony regarding the threats at the core of her claim lacked specificity. …

“We similarly conclude that the BIA’s rejection of Zapet’s claim that she would more likely than not be faced with future persecution was supported by substantial evidence. Because, as already discussed, the BIA made a supportable determination that the threats themselves do not constitute persecution, Zapet’s only remaining argument is that the circumstances in Guatemala are so dangerous that she should not be required to return. In support of this contention, Zapet submitted information about country conditions in Guatemala.

“Substantial evidence supports the finding that Zapet did not show any individual circumstances that make it likely that she will face persecution were she to return to Guatemala. The country conditions reports identify difficult aspects of life in Guatemala, but the record lacks evidence showing how these difficulties apply to Zapet. …

“Additionally, the record evidence does not compel a finding that Zapet would face danger if she relocated within Guatemala from the area where she previously lived. …

“The BIA’s determination again is supported by substantial evidence. Zapet says that she was threatened with forced conscription and the risk of her children’s kidnapping. But, as we have already noted, the threats Zapet experienced did not manifest in actions against her or her children despite her refusal to comply with her perpetrators demands, and she has shown no reason to expect more severe treatment were she to return. … Moreover, Zapet’s reliance on generalized facts from country conditions reports is insufficient to establish that she would be subject to torture with the consent or acquiescence of the government. …

President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.","DALLAS (AP) — A shooter with a rifle opened fire from a nearby roof onto a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement location in Dallas on Wednesday, killing one detainee and wounding two others in a transport van before taking his own life, authorities said.

The suspect was identified by a law enforcement official as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo on social media showing a bullet found at the scene with “ANTI-ICE” written on it.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S., coming two weeks after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter and as heightened immigration enforcement has prompted backlash against ICE agents and fear in immigrant communities.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association called the shootings “a stark reminder that behind every immigration case number is a human being deserving of dignity, safety, and respect.”

“Whether they are individuals navigating the immigration process, public servants carrying out their duties, or professionals working within the system, all deserve to be free from violence and fear,” the group said in a statement.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that shots were fired “indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport,” a secure and gated entryway.

The wounded detainees were in critical condition at a hospital, said DHS, which previously said two detainees were killed and one was wounded before issuing a correction.

No ICE agents were injured.

By the evening, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered more security at ICE facilities across the U.S., according to a post by DHS on the social platform X.

‘Targeted violence’

At a midday news conference, authorities gave few details about the shooting and did not release the names of the victims or the gunman.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. and determined that someone had opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathan E. Maner said via email.

The gunman used a bolt-action rifle, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots. An agent took people who were inside to a more secure area and said there was an active shooter.

“I was afraid for my family, because my family was outside. I felt terrible, because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God, no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels.

Who was Joshua Jahn?

Hours after the shooting, FBI agents gathered at a suburban Dallas home that public records link to Jahn.

It sits on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in a neighborhood dotted with one- and two-story brick homes. The street was blocked by a Fairview police vehicle, but officials wearing FBI jackets could be seen in the front yard.

A spokesperson for Collin College in nearby McKinney, said via email that a Joshua Jahn studied there “at various times” between 2013 and 2018.

Martyna Kowalczyk, CEO of Texas-based Solartime USA, said in a statement that Jahn worked for her company for less than a few months “many years ago.”

In late 2017, Jahn drove cross-country to work a minimum-wage job harvesting marijuana for several months, according to Ryan Sanderson, owner of a legal cannabis farm in Washington state.

“He’s a young kid, a thousand miles from home, didn’t really seem to have any direction, living out of his car at such a young age,” Sanderson told AP. “I don’t remember him being that abnormal. He didn’t seem to fight with anyone or cause trouble. He kept his head down and stayed working.”

Sanderson said he tried to keep Jahn longer because he “felt bad for him.”

Calls for an end to political violence

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Texas, continued in that direction, calling for an end to political violence.

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP: Stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson called the shooting not just an attack on law enforcement and the victims but “an attack on our community and on our nation’s heritage of civil and democratic discourse.”

The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, an advocacy group, said the shootings are “a heartbreaking reminder of the violence and fear that too often touch the lives of migrants and the communities where they live.”

“Violence must never be allowed to define how we respond to migration,” said Anna Gallagher, the group’s executive director.

The Rev. Ashley Anne Sipe, who prays outside the Dallas ICE facility every Monday said: “Violence doesn’t heal anything.”

Sipe and other local faith leaders who have decried deportations hold weekly vigils and serve as “moral witnesses.” They pray and observe for about three hours, watching as immigrants enter the building to meet with advisers and report for check-ins.

Sipe said she has noticed in recent months that people who enter are shuttled away on buses.

“They’re taking them away, and we don’t know where they’re taking them,” Sipe said.

Noem: ICE agents targeted

Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

On July 4 attackers in black, military-style clothing opened fire outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was injured. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him.

And in suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions flared with protesters. President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Ahead of the latest immigration operation, federal officials boarded up windows at the center. Sixteen people have been arrested outside, according to authorities who called the activists “rioters.”

Attacks, escapes concern at some ICE offices

Dozens of field offices across the country house administrative employees and are used for people summoned for check-in appointments and to process people arrested before they are transferred to long-term detention centers. They are not designed to hold people in custody.

Security varies by location, with some located in federal buildings and others mixed with private businesses, said John Torres, a former acting director of the agency and former head of what is now called its enforcement and removals division.

Some, like Dallas, have exposed loading areas for buses, which pose risks for escape and outside attack, Torres said. Other vulnerabilities are nearby vantage points for snipers and long lines forming outside without protection.

“I would assure you that ICE, after today, is going to be a taking a hard look at physical security assessments for all of their facilities,” said Torres, currently head of security and technology consulting at Guidepost Solutions.

Since then, several agencies have moved to restrict grants to ""sanctuary"" cities and states, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.","A federal judge ruled Wednesday it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to get some Federal Emergency Management Agency grants — a legal setback in the administration's push to revoke funding to ""sanctuary"" cities and states.

U.S. District Judge William Smith of Rhode Island ruled in favor of 20 mostly Democratic states that had sued FEMA, accusing the administration of ""holding critical emergency preparedness and response funding hostage"" unless they assist immigration agents.

The decision is likely to be appealed.

The states that sued — which include California, New York and Illinois — took issue with a Department of Homeland Security document issued earlier this year that says recipients of DHS grants must ""honor requests for cooperation"" with immigration authorities, including requests to detain migrants or share information. Some of the plaintiffs are ""sanctuary"" states that have laws restricting cooperation between police and immigration agents.

The states argued this move violates federal law and the Constitution, and could deprive them of billions per year in key disaster grants from FEMA, which is a sub-agency of DHS.

The Trump administration has argued its policy doesn't violate the law. Also, months after the lawsuit was filed, the government told the court it had decided most of the FEMA disaster grants that the states were concerned about losing will not be tied to immigration cooperation after all. The administration called the lawsuit moot on those grounds.

The states called the Trump administration's decision not to link disaster grants to immigration enforcement ""halfhearted and incomplete,"" arguing it's unclear if the decision was communicated to agency staff or if it will apply to years beyond 2025.

In a 45-page ruling Wednesday, Smith sided with the states and granted summary judgment, calling the policy ""both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional.""

""Plaintiff States stand to suffer irreparable harm; the effect of the loss of emergency and disaster funds cannot be recovered later, and the downstream effect on disaster response and public safety are real and not compensable,"" Smith wrote.

The ruling follows a monthslong gambit by President Trump to punish ""sanctuary"" cities and states that limit cooperation between the police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Trump administration argues those jurisdictions make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented immigrants, including accused criminals and people who are in state or local custody. But ""sanctuary"" cities and states typically argue that requiring them to cooperate with ICE would undermine trust in local police and make some immigrants wary of reporting crimes.

CBS News has reached out to DHS, FEMA and the White House for comment.

Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order telling federal agencies to ensure that ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions ""do not receive access to Federal funds.""

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the government is considering making the $1 million Trump Gold Card the only pathway to a U.S. green card—but immigration experts tell Forbes that it doesn’t pass the legal sniff test.

Key Facts

What Is The Status Of The Trump Gold Card?

The Trump administration has hyped the Gold Card but “I don't think it's happening,” Gelatt told Forbes, pointing to recent remarks by Joseph Edlow, the newly confirmed director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), that appeared to indicate the government does not yet have its ducks in a row. “We at the department will ensure that if a Gold Card does come to fruition, that there will be sufficient vetting and screening for any applicant that comes through the process,” Edlow told the Center for Immigration Studies last week. Multiple immigration experts told Forbes that creating a new visa must go through the legislative branch. “Unless Congress acts, there will never be a Trump Gold Card because it’s not consistent with current law, and it's not going to survive the invariable legal challenges,” Jorge Loweree, managing director of programs and strategy at the American Immigration Council, told Forbes. Writing in the National Law Review on Wednesday, attorneys at Ogletree Deakins, one of the country’s largest labor and employment law firms, concluded, “At this time, it is unclear whether the EB-1 and EB-2 immigrant visa programs for people of 'exceptional value' may be replaced, with the potential to eliminate or replace other immigrant visa programs in the future.” It’s strange and perhaps telling, note experts, that the Trump Gold Card is being managed by the Commerce Department and not Homeland Security. “Maybe that's an indication of how things have played out internally,” Loweree speculated. “Maybe there's been some level of pushback at DHS or USCIS in terms of the underlying legal prospects of being able to do this.”

What Is The Difference Between The Eb-5 Visa And The Trump Gold Card?

The biggest difference is who benefits from the applicant’s visa fee. The EB-5 visa is an investment immigration program that “was passed by Congress, has been on the books for many years and requires a level of investment between $800,000 and just over $1 million dollars,” Loweree told Forbes. “That money isn’t just a gift the US government. Applicants are required to invest those funds in a commercial enterprise in the U.S., and there's an important job creation component Congress instituted to create greater benefits for businesses and workers already in the U.S.” In comparison, the Trump Gold Card would require applicants to make a flat $1 million donation to the Treasury, which is a far less appealing proposition, according to Nuri Katz, founder of Apex Capital Partners, who has provided investment immigration guidance to ultra-high-net-worth clients around the world for 35 years. “Now what the government is saying is ‘we don't care about you business people. We don't care about job creation. We just want the money put into the Treasury,’” Katz told Forbes, adding the Trump administration is “basically destroying private businesses that were trying to get off the ground by raising funds from EB-5 investors. These are important projects, from hotels to hospitals, around the country that were creating thousands of jobs. By cutting off funding, many will fail, leaving half-built properties and bankrupt American businesses. It is pretty scary, actually.”

Chief Critic

Loweree scoffed at the administration’s claim that the Gold Card was designed to drive down the federal debt. “The idea that they’re concerned about the debt when they just championed and pushed through the Big, Beautiful Bill Act that's projected to increase the debt by over $3 trillion is ridiculous. This is an effort to create a new pay-to-play scheme and reorient our immigration system into something that simply favors the rich and moves away from the historical priorities of family reunification and focusing on skills and critical labor that's critical to the U.S. economy.”

Crucial Quote

“Instead of creating policies that help American businesses and families, President Trump is rolling out the welcome mat for Russian oligarchs and cartel bosses,” U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, D-Ill., ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.

“Today, the Court ruled that the Trump Administration cannot bully states into taking part in their fear-driven, inhumane immigration agenda by withholding congressionally appropriated funds,” said AG Campbell. “I applaud the Court’s decision, which will protect billions of dollars to help states ensure public safety and prepare for, protect against, and respond to catastrophic natural disasters. We will continue to hold the Trump Administration accountable when it violates our laws and puts our residents at risk.”

In their lawsuit against FEMA, the coalition of attorneys general argued that the new terms and conditions placed on federal grant funding were unconstitutional and beyond the Department of Homeland Security’s legal authority. They argued that Congress had appropriated the funding to protect and support public safety, not for immigration enforcement. In today’s judgment, the Court agreed with the states that the safety and well-being of every American could be put at risk if states were forced to forfeit the billions in federal funding for emergency preparedness and response for failing to comply with the federal government's cruel and unlawful immigration enforcement policies.

Last year, Massachusetts alone received more than five million dollars in federal funding from FEMA, for a sum total of over 23 million dollars received over the last four years. AG Campbell and the coalition argued that using federal funding to bully states into submission would cause irreparable harm to the delicate bond and carefully built trust between law enforcement and the very communities they vow to serve and protect.

The provider, Home Care Staffing, filed the first lawsuits of this kind that 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS has seen, one in Ramsey County District Court and the other in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota weeks after CEO Twyla Martin received a letter from DHS at the beginning of August, which served as notice the state agency was suspending HSS reimbursements to the provider.

Martin is asking the courts for a temporary injunction that would require DHS to resume payments while officials continue their investigation into alleged “credible allegation of fraud.”

“I felt like it was a huge injustice. It was unfair. And not only that, people’s lives are being impacted,” Martin said on Tuesday, when asked why she turned to legal action.

She said the payment suspension forced Home Care Staffing to lay off staff and suspend HSS-related services for more than 500 clients.

“I wasn’t able to pay my staff. I had to lay off 35 people,” Martin said.

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS met with Martin and client Jessica Cronquist on Tuesday at a home she said she was able to get into with the help of Home Care Staffing.

“They help us so much. They really do. And I feel lost without them, because they’ve been a good support system,” Cronquist said.

Cronquist was mentioned in the August Notice of Payment Withhold from DHS. The letter said that Home Care Staffing overbilled for her services, citing that as a “credible allegation of fraud.”

Cronquist signed a letter days later, saying the billing was “true, accurate, and a full reflection of the services I actually received.”

Renée Cooper: “You don’t believe that home care staffing has over-billed on your behalf?”

Cronquist: “Nope.”

Cooper: “And you’ve seen it all?”

Cronquist: “Yes.”

Cooper, turning to Martin: “And I’ll just ask you directly, has Home Care Staffing overbilled on any clients?”

Martin: “No, not at all.”

Martin said she appealed the payment suspension, but it was denied.

Martin: “It pretty much just said, based upon what their findings were, from the first letter, it still remains.”

Cooper: “Until they can complete their investigation?”

Martin: “Correct.”

A recent change to state policy allows payments to be stopped when there’s a credible allegation of fraud, amid growing fraud investigations across several DHS programs.

Asked on Tuesday, DHS said it has suspended payments to 115 HSS providers, 55 have appealed, and DHS has not resumed payments to any as of this report.

Asked if she supports the policy changes, including DHS’s ability to stop payments quicker, Martin said, “I do support it if there’s a credible allegation of fraud that’s been backed by some sort of evidence that they are doing their due process correctly by making sure it really is fraud.”

“And I don’t think it’s DHS’s intention to hurt, but someone has to stand up to say, ‘Hey, I know you’re trying to be helpful and stop fraud, as you should, but you are missing a step that is hurting a lot of people.'”

Martin said 20-30 other HSS providers were also considering legal action.

DHS has made motions to dismiss the district court and federal lawsuits filed by Home Care Staffing.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed in a press release at least one detainee was shot and others may be in critical condition. It's unclear if more were killed in the shooting. The department previously stated two detainees were killed and one was in critical condition but updated their release online.

However, DHS issued a statement Wednesday afternoon announcing the correction. No one from law enforcement was injured in the shooting, DHS said.

The shooter's motives and targets are unclear, but Joe Rothrock, the special agent in charge of the Dallas FBI field office, said at a press conference Wednesday morning the agency is investigating the shooting as ""an act of targeted violence."" Investigators found bullet casings they said contained anti-ICE messages.

The fatal shooting comes amid President Donald Trump's immigration crackdowns since taking office in January and the nationwide responses to his measures, including protests across the country.

It also comes after a year of high-profile, political incidents involving gun violence, including the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk exactly two weeks ago and the killings of two Minnesota Democratic lawmakers in June.

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pointed out Wednesday’s shooting is the third in Texas involving ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection and called on political violence to end.

""To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CBP, stop,"" Cruz told reporters. ""To every politician demanding that ICE agents be doxxed and calling for people to go after their families, stop.""

But U.S. Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas, was more direct in blaming the uptick in political violence on ""anti-law enforcement rhetoric from the radical left.""

“Texans back our men and women in blue. ANY attack on an officer WILL BE investigated & prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Cornyn wrote in a post on X. ""We must stop this dangerous rhetoric & break this disturbing trend of political violence.”

This isn’t the first incident at the ICE field office in recent months. The building, which sees detainees as well as people with ongoing immigration cases checking in with officers, received a bomb threat last month.

In a statement, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said it shouldn't be a partisan issue, calling on the public to pray for the victims and their families and condemn political violence.

""Dallas did not deserve what transpired this morning,"" the statement reads. ""We are better than this craven act of violence. In moments like this, our city must stand together and support one another. We must heal.""

Dallas City Council Member Adam Bazaldua expressed his sorrow over the shooting in a statement Wednesday, saying the country's immigrants are ""bearing the brunt"" of hate and violence spreading within the United States. Bazaldua also condemned any politicization of the incident.

""At a time when our communities are desperate for healing, leadership, and real solutions, we are instead met with more division and finger-pointing,"" Bazaldua said. ""We cannot continue down this path of hate and violence. Our country and all of its people deserve better.”

Alvarado ICE detention center shooting

Seventeen people have been arrested over the course of two months in connection with a July 4 shooting at the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, about 30 miles south of Fort Worth. About a dozen people arrived outside the detention center that night, setting off fireworks outside the facility, according to court documents.

ICE correctional officers called Alvarado police. When an officer arrived, several people started fleeing on foot and ignored verbal commands, court documents show. Then a person in the woods began shooting, hitting an Alvarado officer who has since recovered, according to court documents.

The initial complaint by the U.S. Justice Department said two people — one wearing a black mask, another wearing a green one — shot at correctional officers and the Alvarado officer 20-to-30 times.

But a more recent complaint obtained by KERA News states new evidence suggests there was only one shooter and 11 shell casings recovered from the scene.

The defendants allegedly had cans of spray paint and wrote “ICE Pig” and “Traitor” on cars in the parking lot. Police found firearms, magazines with ammunition, body armor and flyers that said “fight ICE terror with class war” and “free all political prisoners” on the suspects and their cars.

Ten people were arrested the night of the shooting and seven more have been arrested since on charges including attempted murder, aggravated assault and terrorism. That includes former Marine Corps reservist Benjamin Song, who was arrested after more than a week after a police and FBI manhunt.

Federal authorities have called the incident a coordinated attack against law enforcement. Some arrestees and their attorneys have said the incident was only intended to be a protest, and the alleged shooter acted alone.

Political scientists told KERA News the incident is indicative of an uptick in political violence on both sides of the political aisle.

Fourteen defendants made their first appearances in Fort Worth federal court Monday and Tuesday for their federal charges. Several will be back in court next Tuesday for hearings to determine probable cause in their charges and whether they should be kept in detention.

The arrestees had been held in the Johnson County Jail on million-dollar bonds, but they’ve now been moved to the Wichita County Jail as of Wednesday morning, jail records show.

Dario Sanchez, a Dallas teacher who was arrested for removing some of the defendants and their texts from a Discord group chat — then bonded out — was rearrested this week after law enforcement monitoring his devices said he made “explosive construction internet queries” in violation of his bond conditions. He and his attorney say his searches related to batteries and melting plastic were research for his hobbies: making anime figurines, building a remote-controlled car and fixing his Game Boy.

He’s scheduled to appear in court Wednesday afternoon for a bond hearing.

July 7 McAllen shooting

Days after the Alvarado shooting, a man fired dozens of rounds at federal agents with an assault rifle at a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen, injuring a police officer before authorities shot and killed him.

Authorities identified the gunman as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, a Michigan man around 27 years old, who was shooting at agents leaving the building.

According to an incident report obtained by ValleyCentral, Mosqueda’s father reported his son as a missing person hours before the shooting and told authorities his son was armed.

Mosqueda’s brother told TV station WOOD that Mosqueda had been dealing with mental health issues, and the attack came “out of the blue.”

Sept. 12 Chicago shooting

An ICE agent fatally shot a suspect who tried to evade arrest in a suburb of Chicago by driving at officers and dragging one of them, the Associated Press reported. The Department of Homeland Security said the officer was trying to arrest a man with a history of reckless driving who had entered the country illegally, but he refused orders and drove his car at officers.

ICE identified Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez as the suspect who later died in the hospital.

In an email statement, CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd thanked the DOJ for weighing in on the company’s behalf.","The U.S. Department of Justice is backing CoreCivic in its legal battle with the city of Leavenworth as the company seeks to reopen a shuttered prison it owns there as an immigrant detention center over the objection of local officials.

The DOJ filed a statement of interest in federal court on Tuesday, characterizing the city’s resistance as an illegal effort to undermine the federal government’s immigration enforcement.

“The United States submits this Statement of Interest to address an aggressive and unlawful effort by the City of Leavenworth, Kansas … to interfere with federal immigration enforcement,” begins the eight-page filing, signed by Brett Shumate, assistant attorney general over the DOJ’s Civil Division.

The DOJ filing was also signed by Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign and Anthony Nicastro, acting director of the Office of Immigration Litigation.

The show of support for CoreCivic comes as the private prison company has suffered a string of legal defeats in Kansas state court in recent months.

Leavenworth District Court Judge John J. Bryant issued and upheld a temporary restraining order blocking CoreCivic from accepting detainees at the 1,033-bed facility under a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while the lawsuit plays out.

The case landed in Bryant’s courtroom after CoreCivic successfully argued that Leavenworth’s initial lawsuit in federal court lacked jurisdictional standing. But the company later filed its own claim in federal court against the city, alleging that local officials were unlawfully interfering with the federal government’s prerogative to control immigration policy.

The DOJ built off of that argument in its own filing, invoking the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which places federal laws above conflicting state and local laws.

“Defendants have violated the Supremacy Clause by attempting to stymie the Federal Government’s immigration-related operations at 100 Highway Terrace,” the filing states, referring to the address of CoreCivic’s Leavenworth facility. “Under the doctrine of intergovernmental immunity, the Constitution ‘prohibit[s] States from interfering with or controlling the operations of the Federal Government.’

“This foundational principle means that Defendants cannot regulate the United States’ contracts for private detention facilities,” the filing adds.

ICE prison lawsuit

In court filings and hearings, the city has argued that to maintain legitimacy, it must be allowed to enforce its own laws, including a 2012 ordinance that requires jail and prison operators to secure a special use permit before opening.

CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit, but withdrew its application in March, saying it could operate the ICE detention center by right.

The facility at 100 Highway Terrace was previously operated as a private prison under contract with the U.S. Marshals Service through 2021, but a Joe Biden executive order barred the DOJ from renewing contracts with private prison companies.

Several previous efforts by CoreCivic to reactivate the prison in the years after its closure — including under an earlier proposed agreement with ICE — faced pushback from community members, in part because of the facility’s history of chronic violence, rampant drug use and dangerously low staffing levels.

CoreCivic attorney Taylor Concannon Hausmann argued during an August hearing that the local government’s adversarial stance toward CoreCivic reopening without a permit is “fueled by political discourse and polarization” over whether immigrant detainees should be brought to Leavenworth.

City officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.

In an email statement, CoreCivic spokesperson Brian Todd thanked the DOJ for weighing in on the company’s behalf.

“CoreCivic appreciates the Department of Justice’s support as we continue to pursue all avenues to find a successful conclusion to this matter,” Todd said.",https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/vjccst/picture301410574/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/KCM_LeavenworthICEdetention%20(2),N,,2025-09-24 19:57:59.278244

Lawyer Oliver Barker-Vormawor told Reuters after a court hearing in Accra that six of the group had already been forced into neighbouring Togo, while the whereabouts of the other five remain unclear.

Only three of those sent to Togo are Togolese. The nationalities of the others has not been disclosed.

He described the development as a breach of legal protections, noting that at least eight of the deportees previously held U.S. court orders shielding them from removal to their home countries due to risks of torture and persecution.

The group included four Nigerians, three Togolese, two Malians, one Liberian and one Gambian.

Ghana’s uneasy role in US deportation policy

Ghana’s President John Dramani Mahama recently confirmed that his government had agreed to receive deportees from across West Africa under President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

The arrangement meant Accra was not only accepting Ghanaians but also nationals from Nigeria, Mali, Togo, Liberia, and The Gambia.

Officials in Accra have stressed that Ghana is not endorsing Washington’s policy and has not received compensation for hosting these deportees.

Still, the move has made Ghana a frontline state in the U.S. strategy of outsourcing deportations to African partners.

While Ghana has accepted returnees, other African governments have taken a more defiant stance.

Nigeria has publicly rejected U.S. attempts to offload non-Nigerian deportees on its territory, insisting it will only receive its own citizens. Similar hesitancy has been expressed in Kenya and South Africa, where concerns about security and integration remain high.

The mixed response further reflects how U.S. immigration policies are straining relations with African nations, many of whom see the returnees as victims of a politicised crackdown rather than simply failed migrants.

Human rights concerns linger

Barker-Vormawor’s failed court bid highlights the limits of legal protections for deportees once they are transferred from U.S. custody to African soil.

He argued that the new expulsions “are precisely the injury we were trying to prevent,” adding that the case he filed was now moot since the deportees had already been forced out.

Rights advocates warn that deporting people with established protection orders violates international law and could expose them to torture, imprisonment, or persecution in their home countries.

Illinois’ Democratic members of Congress have been seeking answers from ICE and U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials about their operations in the Chicago area with little success. Durbin told reporters in Springfield on Wednesday that he has reached out to Homeland Security several times seeking a meeting.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has left Illinois officials from Gov. JB Pritzker down to local police chiefs almost entirely in the dark about the government’s “Operation Midway Blitz.” Federal officials say the operation is meant to arrest violent people illegally in the United States who are living in the Chicago area.

Durbin said prior presidential administrations have always kept members of Congress updated on their plans, but President Donald Trump’s second administration is leaving lawmakers searching for answers.

“That is routine in my service in Congress over the last 40 years,” Durbin said. “Routine for the administration of either political party to be asked to explain what they are doing and how they are spending tax funds. And they did it, but not this time.”

Durbin said there is a “chance” that changes this week, adding he has a lot of “basic” questions for ICE.

“What’s happening to the people that you’re sweeping off the streets, the detainees?” Durbin said. “Many times, their families don’t know what happened to them and can’t come up with any information as to where they’re even located.”

Transparency concerns

Illinois leaders have faulted ICE for a lack of transparency about its work in the Chicago area, which also includes teams from Customs and Border Protection.

Illinois’ Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to Noem on Tuesday with 13 questions about DHS’ operations. The letter also expressed concerns about the tactics federal agents are using to arrest people and manage protests outside an ICE detention center in Broadview.

Last week, Pritzker released his own list of 22 questions he wants reporters to ask DHS about immigration enforcement, including how people detained by ICE are receiving legal information.

Illinois leaders said several incidents heightened their concerns, including last week when Noem shared a video of herself at a raid of an Elgin home where two U.S. citizens were briefly detained by immigration authorities.

Franklin Park police released body camera footage following a deadly shooting by ICE in the near west suburb that appeared to contradict DHS’ narrative about the incident. The footage captured by a Franklin Park police officer after the shooting shows an ICE agent saying he had no major injuries. A previous DHS statement said an agent was dragged by a car and sustained “serious injuries,” according to the Chicago Tribune.

It’s unclear how many people have been arrested by immigration authorities in their Chicago area crackdown or how long the operations will last. Many people who have been arrested have no criminal history, news outlets including NBC Chicago have reported.

“This notion that we’re dealing with rapists and murderers and terrorists and criminally insane is a hoax, is a fraud,” Durbin said. “If there’s a person who is dangerous in the community, remove them.”

Durbin added it’s “not American” for masked agents to arrest people who have followed the country’s laws.

Trusting the Trump administration

Durbin also discussed the Trump administration’s decision to close an FBI investigation of Tom Homan, a previous acting director of ICE who is now overseeing the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

MSNBC reported Homan took a $50,000 bribe last year from undercover FBI agents posing as business executives before Trump’s election last year in exchange for government contracts if Homan earned a job in Trump’s administration.

Trump’s Justice Department ended the investigation. The White House said Homan did nothing wrong and accused the Biden administration of entrapment and political motives.

“This $50,000, particularly as it relates to this mass deportation effort, is embarrassing,” Durbin said.

He said the incident raises more questions about how much Trump’s administration can be trusted.

“If we want to have confidence in government, we have to fight corruption in government,” Durbin said. “And the notion that someone coming into the administration takes a $50,000 payment so good word will be expressed to the White House is troubling.”",https://capitolnewsillinois.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250924-Dick-Durbin-Gaggle.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 11:59:42.717957

The City of Eureka is among a group of plaintiffs that prevailed over the Trump administration in federal court Tuesday.

The plaintiffs, a group of local organizations and governments that receive millions of dollars of federal grant money, accused the Trump administration of imposing “unauthorized and vague conditions” on their grant funding. Yesterday, a federal judge agreed, issuing a preliminary injunction that bars the administration from making grants conditional upon fulfilling Trump’s policy goals.

The president’s administration was trying to force grantees to comply with a series of recent executive orders that prohibit recipients from promoting “woke” beliefs and practices, such as DEI, “gender ideology” and elective abortion, while requiring them to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The City of Eureka is among many jurisdictions to have passed a sanctuary ordinance prohibiting the sharing of immigration-related information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The plaintiffs in this suit, led by the City of Fresno, challenged the actions on constitutional grounds, arguing that they violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Fifth Amendment, Separation of Powers, the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment.

The City of Eureka joined the lawsuit last month. City Manager Miles Slattery told the Outpost via phone that while the city has not yet received any grants that would have been contingent on those new conditions, it regularly received Community Development Block Grants and federal transportation grants.

“We’re looking at a $5 million grant for transportation [currently],” he said.

With yesterday’s ruling, which follows a temporary restraining order granted last month, Judge Richard Seeborg found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their case. Only Congress has the authority to impose conditions on federal grant funding, he noted. And he found that the administration’s grant conditions likely violate the Separation of Powers; they’re unrelated to the expertise of the granting agencies; and the vagueness of the conditions would encourage “arbitrary and discriminatory” enforcement, among other issues.

The order applies to these federal agencies:

The Herrera case, alongside deportations to CECOT, has become a rallying point for legal challenges and human rights scrutiny of the administration’s immigration enforcement policy.","The sudden detention of Carmen Herrera, a longtime San Antonio resident, has drawn widespread attention after video of her being detained by federal immigration agents went viral on social media.

Herrera, a mother of six U.S. citizen children and married to a U.S. citizen, appeared at San Antonio’s Immigration Court earlier this year seeking relief in her case. Instead, she was met by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who detained her immediately after her hearing. She was later deported to her native Mexico.

Witnesses captured the moment on cell phones, and the footage spread rapidly online, sparking outrage from immigrant-rights advocates.

Supporters say Herrera had lived in the United States for years, held steady employment, and had no criminal record.

ICE officials defended the arrest, stating Herrera had a final order of removal and that the agency was acting within its authority. “Individuals subject to deportation orders are priorities for enforcement,” an ICE spokesperson said.

The viral video has reignited debate over courthouse arrests and the Trump administration’s broader immigration crackdown, which critics say targets families and longtime residents without due process.

Al Jazeera’s Fault Lines series recently released an episode titled “Crackdown,” which tells the story of Herrera and the impact her detainment and deportation has had on her family. It also examines the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, including court arrests and deportations conducted without full due process.

According to the documentary, Herrera had long lived in the U.S. and was pursuing legal relief but was unexpectedly handcuffed and shoved into an ICE van after being called into court.

Her attorneys say she had multiple paths to legal status; her arrest and removal came as families across the country report similar takedowns at courthouses.

More broadly, ""Crackdown"" frames Herrera’s case as part of a sweeping deportation campaign under Trump. The documentary underscores how the administration has used measures such as in-court ICE arrests, redefinition of enforcement zones, and transfers of migrants to foreign penal facilities.

One of the most controversial elements exposed is the mass deportation of migrants, including those with no U.S. criminal convictions, to El Salvador’s new Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a maximum-security prison built for gang detainees.

The administration invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act in March 2025 to justify shipping about 238 Venezuelan migrants from Texas to CECOT, despite internal records showing many lacked criminal records. The U.S. Supreme Court later found that this was a misuse of the Alien Enemies Act and was unlawfully applied.

Supporters of the administration argue that the policy is aimed at removing dangerous gang actors and closing legal loopholes exploited by criminals. They assert that broad powers are necessary to prevent criminal networks from exploiting sympathetic rulings or delays in the immigration system.

Critics counter that the campaign overshoots its intent: thousands of nonviolent immigrants, asylum seekers, and individuals with no criminal records risk being lumped in, deprived of due process, and sent to foreign prisons. The Herrera case, alongside deportations to CECOT, has become a rallying point for legal challenges and human rights scrutiny of the administration’s immigration enforcement policy.

At least three people were shot, two of whom were killed, in a shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, Fox News confirmed.

The FBI says it is investigating the incident as a ""targeted attack"" against ICE, and multiple sources familiar with the investigation have identified the alleged shooter as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. Representatives for the FBI at a Wednesday morning press conference in Dallas said that preliminary investigations uncovered anti-ICE messaging on bullet rounds found near the shooter.

The shooting reportedly occurred as ICE officers were transferring detainees into the facility. The shooter died due to a self-inflicted wound shortly after the attack, authorities say. The three individuals who were shot were all detainees, and two of them have died.

The three detainees were shot while inside a law enforcement van, ICE sources told Fox News' Brooke Taylor.

Authorities say Jahn fired on the facility from a nearby rooftop, striking both the van and other parts of the ICE facility.

Authorities say Patel was in Dallas for a ""prescheduled visit"" on Wednesday morning. The FBI says he visited law enforcement at the ""incident command location"" following the attack.

The Dallas Police Department sources told Fox News the shooting occurred at roughly 6:30 a.m. local time. They say no law enforcement officers were injured, but that three detainees were shot and two were killed.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed there were ""multiple fatalities.""

""There was a shooting this morning at the Dallas ICE Detention Facility,"" Noem wrote on X. ""Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities. The shooter is deceased by a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""

""While we don’t know motive yet, we know that our ICE law enforcement is facing unprecedented violence against them. It must stop. Please pray for the victims and their families,"" she added.

Authorities say the shooter opened fire when the sally port to the facility was open during the transfer of detainees, attempting to force his way in.

Associated Press

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — As President Donald Trump’s administration imposes new restrictions on the legal immigration system, U.S. adults are more likely than they were a year ago to think these immigrants benefit the country, according to a new poll.

The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that Americans are more likely than they were in March 2024 to say it’s a “major benefit” that people who come to the U.S. legally contribute to economic growth and help American companies get the expertise of skilled workers. The survey also shows that Americans are less likely than they were in January to say the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. should be reduced. Slightly fewer than half of Americans say the number should remain the same, a similar percentage from earlier this year.

At the same time, perceptions of illegal immigration haven’t shifted meaningfully. Americans continue to see fewer benefits from people who come to the U.S. illegally, and they’re more likely to see major risks from these immigrants, including the concern that they’ll commit crimes while in the U.S.

Trump, a Republican, has focused much of his attention on arresting and deporting those in the country illegally, but new screenings, vetting and increased costs are also impacting people who want to come to the U.S. legally to work or study. On Friday, Trump signed a proclamation to overhaul the H-1B visa program, one of the most common pathways for highly skilled foreign workers, requiring now a $100,000 fee for applications. The Trump administration is also subjecting green card applicants to “anti-Americanism” screening, and students applying for visas now need to adhere to social media vetting.

Even Republicans are less likely to say legal immigration should be reduced than they were earlier this year and more likely to say it should remain as is.

Philip Steers, of St. Petersburg, Florida, is a Republican and feels the U.S. makes it too difficult for people to migrate legally. His nephew married a woman from Cambodia, and they have been trying for months to secure a spouse visa.

“If you are pushing all those people who are illegal out, why not make it easier for people who want to come here legally?” said Steers, 76. “We need to speed up the process for those who want to come here to benefit our country.”

Republicans less likely to want to reduce legal immigration

While slightly fewer than half of U.S. adults say the number of legal immigrants should stay as it is, about one-quarter say the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. should be reduced “a lot” or “a little.” That marks a decrease from January, when about one-third said this.

The drop is largely driven by Republicans. About 3 in 10 Republicans now say that legal immigration should be reduced, down from 45% in January.

About 3 in 10 U.S. adults say the number of legal immigrants to the U.S. should be increased “a lot” or “a little,” up slightly from January, when 24% of Americans wanted an increase in legal immigration.

“If you don’t have immigration as a culture, the culture will stagnate. You have to have that balance,” Steers said.

More see benefits from immigrants for economic growth and companies

Americans are more likely to see “major” benefits from people who come to the U.S. legally and less likely to see “major” risks, compared with an AP-NORC poll conducted early last year.

About 6 in 10 U.S. adults say a “major” benefit of immigrants in the country legally is that they contribute to economic growth, which went up from about 4 in 10 in March 2024. Similarly, 51% of U.S. adults say a “major” benefit of legal immigration is that American companies get the expertise of skilled workers in fields like science and technology, compared with 41% in March 2024.

Carlos Gonzalez, who was born in the U.S. to Panamanian parents, said immigrants “provide a lot to the economy of the United States.”

“They bring different ideas that help the economy,” said Gonzalez, 53, a Democrat from Waterbury, Connecticut, adding his mother served as a military nurse in Vietnam. “A lot of people don’t realize that when they do come over here, they try to enrich the country and not take away from it.”

Some of the perceived benefits are economic, but some are cultural, with about 46% saying a “major” benefit of legal immigrants is that they enrich American culture and values, up from 38% in the previous poll.

Shifting views don’t extend to immigrants in the country illegally

Jeff Witoszczak, of El Paso, Texas, identifies as a moderate Republican and supports Trump’s efforts to conduct large-scale deportations of people in the country illegally, saying he does not think the focus needs to be on those who have committed violent crimes. Witoszczak is married to a woman from Mexico who came to the U.S. legally when she was a child.

“Coming here illegally, that’s a crime in and of itself,” Witoszczak said. “They didn’t follow due process coming in. They don’t need due process going out.”

Americans tend to see greater risks — and smaller benefits — from immigrants who are in the country illegally, and these views largely haven’t shifted since last year.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults now say it’s a major benefit that immigrants in the country illegally will take jobs Americans don’t want, up from about one-third last year. And 42% say that immigrants in the country illegally contribute to economic growth, and 32% believe that they enrich American culture and values. Those findings have remained steady since last year.

About half of U.S. adults say it’s a major risk that immigrants in the country illegally will burden welfare and safety net programs. Studies have shown that immigrants who work in the country illegally pay local, state and federal taxes and generally do not qualify for federal benefits.

The AP-NORC poll of 1,183 adults was conducted Sept. 11-15, using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.",https://sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25262782616454-scaled-e1758748260116.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 18:57:11.944846

Sen. Ossoff is spearheading a new inquiry into numerous Federal courts’ reported failures to uphold Americans’ civil rights as they await a full trial.

According to a recent studyThis is an external link, in numerous Federal courts across the country, judges jail defendants without lawyers at initial appearance hearings, in violation of their civil rights.

“Ensuring that every person is afforded legal counsel at their first appearance before a federal judge is not only a statutory requirement—it is a foundational protection for our adversarial legal system,” wrote Sen. Ossoff. “Given the gravity of these findings, I urge the Judicial Conference to prioritize this issue as a matter of urgent concern and bring the offending district courts into compliance with federal law immediately to ensure that no individual is jailed without the benefit of legal representation at the outset of their case.”

According to the study, proceeding unrepresented at an initial appearance severely disadvantages defendants, leading to increased pretrial detention rates.

Sen. Ossoff continues working to ensure civil and human rights are safeguarded.

In May, Sens. Ossoff and Ted Cruz (R-TX) introduced the bipartisan Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Reauthorization Act to help secure justice for civil rights cold case victims and their families.

In 2024, President Biden signed into law Sen. Ossoff’s bipartisan Federal Prison Oversight Act, prison reform legislation to overhaul independent oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prison’s 122 facilities nationwide.

… The reclassification of Eduardo’s visa petition to the F1 category was therefore in error, as Carlos was not, by statute, an adult.
Appealed from a decision by O’Toole, J., in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.","Where a complaint was filed in U.S. District Court alleging that the reclassification of a parent’s petition for a visa on behalf of his son has unlawfully delayed the visa process, it was error to dismiss the complaint under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability.

Reversed and remanded.

“In this appeal, we confront a challenge to a judgment of dismissal in a suit against the U.S. Secretary of State and the Consul General of the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The plaintiffs are a naturalized U.S. citizen and his noncitizen son. They are challenging the reclassification of the parent’s petition for a visa on behalf of his son. They allege that this reclassification has unlawfully delayed the visa process in their case.

“The merits of the claims hinge on whether the son, despite turning 21 years old during the visa process, must be treated as under ‘21 years of age’ and, therefore, a ‘child’ for purposes of the visa petition classification under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), Pub. L. No. 107-208, 116 Stat. 927 (2002). If so, then the reclassification of the visa petition would be unlawful, with the consequence that the son would be entitled to a much speedier resolution of whether he is entitled to a visa than if the reclassification were to remain in place.

“The District Court did not address whether the reclassification was lawful because it dismissed the complaint under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. We first conclude that the District Court erred in doing so, at least given the arguments that the appellees have advanced, both below and to our Court, for concluding that the doctrine applies. We then address whether, as the plaintiffs allege, the reclassification of the visa petition is unlawful. We conclude that it is. We thus reverse the claims’ dismissal and remand for further consideration consistent with this decision. …

“The plaintiffs are Eduardo Teles de Menezes and his son, Carlos Eduardo Rodrigues Menezes. …

“… The doctrine of consular nonreviewability prohibits ‘judicial review of a consular officer’s denial of a visa.’ …

“If the appellees are right that the doctrine precludes review in this case, then our analysis is at an end. The appellants contend, however, that the doctrine has no application here for either of two reasons. First, they contend that their claims do not allege that a consular officer’s denial of a visa even occurred, let alone that any such denial was wrongful. Second, they contend that, in any event, their claims concern only the proper interpretation of the CSPA and therefore ‘do[] not implicate the independent judgment of [a] consular officer[].’ For the reasons we will explain, we agree with the appellants’ first contention and so do not address the second. …

“There remains to address whether appellants are right that the reclassification of the visa petition into the F1 category (adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens) was unlawful. In their view, rather than reclassifying the petition into the F1 category, it should have been reclassified, upon Eduardo’s naturalization, into the ‘immediate relatives’ category (children of U.S. citizens). They contend that is so because Eduardo had become a U.S citizen and, under the CSPA, Carlos had to be treated as if he were under 21 years of age, notwithstanding that he had turned 21 during the visa process.

“Appellants’ contention turns, in the end, on the proper construction of a single phrase in 8 U.S.C. §1151(f)(2) — the provision of the CSPA that addresses the conversion of an F2A petition into an ‘immediate relatives’ petition. That phrase instructs that the determination of whether the noncitizen beneficiary satisfies the age requirement to be reclassified as an immediate relative ‘shall be made using the age of the alien on the date of the parent’s naturalization.’

“Appellants contend that ‘age,’ as used in §1151(f)(2), refers not to the beneficiary’s ‘biological age.’ Instead, they argue, ‘age’ refers to the ‘age’ of the noncitizen as determined by a formula that applies to all F2A beneficiaries, as set forth in §1153(h)(1). They contend that is so because §1153(h)(1), in setting out a formula to calculate the age of an F2A applicant, must be understood to interact with §1151(f)(2), which concerns potentially reclassifying an F2A applicant (based on their age) into an immediate relative applicant.

“The District Court did not address this issue given its reliance on the doctrine of consular nonreviewability to dismiss the claims. Nevertheless, the issue presents a question that ‘is purely a matter of statutory interpretation, and therefore, a question of law, which we can review in the first instance.’ … The parties have also fully briefed and argued this question. We thus proceed to address it. As we will explain, we agree with the appellants and so construe ‘age’ in §1151(f)(2) just as the only two circuits to have construed that term in §1151(f)(2) have. …

“In sum, we conclude that, ‘[i]n the case of a petition … initially filed’ in the F2A category, and ‘later converted, due to the naturalization of the parent, to a[n] [immediate relatives] petition,’ the ‘age of the [beneficiary] on the date of the parent’s naturalization,’ 8 U.S.C. §1151(f)(2), is the beneficiary’s ‘statutory age’ as provided in §1153(h)(1). Based on the allegations in the complaint, Carlos was a ‘child’ on the date of Eduardo’s naturalization because his statutory age was frozen at twenty. … The reclassification of Eduardo’s visa petition to the F1 category was therefore in error, as Carlos was not, by statute, an adult. We leave it to the District Court to determine the proper remedy on remand. …

“The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.”

Smith permanently blocked enforcement of the grant conditions, granting summary judgment to a coalition of states including Illinois, California, and New York.

The states sued in May, alleging the new strings attached to emergency-preparedness funds were illegal. The administration wanted grant recipients to certify they don’t “operate any program that benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration” and promise to “honor requests for cooperation” in immigration enforcement.

The conditions were imposed to comply with an executive order calling for cutting funds to so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

But in court, the administration “made no attempt to claim that it examined the relevant data or articulated a fact-based reason for its actions,” and gave no “actual explanation of why it is necessary to attach sweeping immigration conditions to all the grants at issue here,” Smith wrote, finding the conditions “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and unconstitutional under the spending clause.

The states risked losing billions in essential public-safety funding if they didn’t comply with “hopelessly vague” conditions that were unlawfully coercive, Smith wrote.

“Denying such funding if states refuse to comply with vague immigration requirements leaves them with no meaningful choice, particularly where state budgets are already committed,” he wrote.

CPC Member and Ranking Member of the House Rules Committee Rep. Jim McGovern (MA-02) joined as an original cosponsor.
“There was no legal justification for the Trump Administration’s military escalation in the Caribbean,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, Deputy Chair of the Progressive Caucus.
For decades, successive administrations of both parties have expanded presidential war powers while Congress has abdicated its constitutional role.
We are proud to support Congresswoman Omar's War Powers Resolution to end these horrific attacks.""","WASHINGTON – Today, Rep. Ilhan Omar (MN-05) introduced a War Powers Resolution to terminate unauthorized U.S military hostilities against Venezuela and transnational criminal organizations that the Trump administration has unilaterally designated as foreign terrorist organizations. The resolution follows the administration’s repeated strikes on vessels in the southern Caribbean carried out without congressional authorization or clear legal justification.

Omar, who serves as Deputy Chair of the Progressive Caucus and Chair of its Peace & Security Taskforce, was joined by CPC Chair Rep. Greg Casar (TX-35) and CPC Whip Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García (IL-04). CPC Member and Ranking Member of the House Rules Committee Rep. Jim McGovern (MA-02) joined as an original cosponsor.

“There was no legal justification for the Trump Administration’s military escalation in the Caribbean,” said Rep. Ilhan Omar, Deputy Chair of the Progressive Caucus. “It was not self-defense or authorized by Congress. That is why I am introducing a resolution to terminate hostilities against Venezuela, and against the transnational criminal organizations that the Administration has designated as terrorists this year. All of us should agree that the separation of powers is crucial to our democracy, and that only Congress has the power to declare war.”

“Donald Trump cannot be allowed to drag the United States into another endless war with his reckless actions,” said Rep. Greg Casar, Chair of the Progressive Caucus. “It is illegal for the president to take the country to war without consulting the people's representatives, and Congress must vote now to stop Trump from putting us at further risk.”

“The extrajudicial strike against a vessel in the Caribbean Sea is only the most recent of Trump’s reckless, deadly, and illegal military actions. Now, he’s lawlessly threatening a region already profoundly impacted by the destabilization of U.S. actions,” said Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, the Whip of the Progressive Caucus. “With this War Powers Resolution, we emphasize the total illegality of his action, and—consistent with overwhelming public opposition to forever war—reclaim Congress’ sole power to authorize military action.”

“The people that I represent are sick and tired of this country being dragged into one endless war after another,” said Rep. Jim McGovern. “Trump’s reckless, unlawful, and extrajudicial strikes were in flagrant violation of both international and U.S. law. And his military escalation in the Caribbean—a region already destabilized by decades of U.S. intervention—threatens to release even more chaos and violence at our doorstep. Only Congress has the power to declare war, and we must stand up for the constitutional separation of powers before it is too late.”

The War Powers Resolution directs the President to withdraw U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities against Venezuela and against transnational criminal organizations unless explicitly authorized by Congress. It makes clear that the President retains the ability to respond to sudden attacks or imminent threats, but stresses that the trafficking of illegal drugs does not itself constitute an armed attack.

For decades, successive administrations of both parties have expanded presidential war powers while Congress has abdicated its constitutional role. Rep. Omar’s resolution reasserts Article I authority, making clear that neither the 2001 nor the 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force provide legal cover for new conflicts in Latin America. It underscores that a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) designation, as defined by U.S. law, does not authorize the use of military force, contrary to recent claims from the Trump Administration and some Members of Congress.

""The Trump administration has appointed itself judge, jury, and executioner, in a series of blatantly illegal strikes,"" said Sara Haghdoosti, Executive Director of Win Without War. ""People struggling through the overdose crisis need healthcare, not warfare. We're proud to support Representative Omar's resolution to stop these strikes and we urge her colleagues to join her.""

""We abhor the recent unlawful strikes on Venezuelan boats, which have killed more than a dozen people,"" said Lauren Brownlee, the Friends Committee on National Legislation's Deputy General Secretary. ""As Quakers, we share the conviction that all creation has worth and dignity. Those suspected of crimes deserve due process, not summary execution. We are proud to support Congresswoman Omar's War Powers Resolution to end these horrific attacks.""

""It could not be more clear that Americans across the political spectrum do not want to fight and fund another war,"" said Dylan Williams, Vice President of Center for International Policy Advocacy. ""Trump's illegal, extra-judicial killings off the coast of Venezuela are an unauthorized and unconstitutional use of military force that put our servicemembers at risk. Lawmakers have a duty to stand up for their voters and their prerogatives to prevent another unnecessary and costly war of choice.""

""The President is claiming the authority to kill people outside of armed conflict and without due process,"" said Annie Shiel, US Director for the Center for Civilians in Conflict. ""The recent airstrikes in the Caribbean are unlawful executions during peacetime, not war. Rep. Omar's leadership in forcing an end to these unlawful strikes is sorely needed. Everyone else in the House should join her.""

""The Trump administration appears intent on dragging the United States into war with Venezuela. Between the extrajudicial killings of Venezuelan citizens, the threat of drone strikes on Venezuelan soil, and the amassing of military equipment in the region, Trump has given lie to his claims of being 'anti-war' and aligned himself decisively with the neoconservative camp,"" said Alex Main, Director of International Policy at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""This follows years of efforts to enact regime change in Venezuela by other means, including through broad economic sanctions that have devastated the Venezuelan economy and fueled a humanitarian crisis, triggering the migration of millions of Venezuelans. We must be clear: a war with Venezuela would be catastrophic for both the people of Venezuela and the United States, while doing nothing to solve the drug crisis in our nation.""

“The American people, across the political spectrum, don’t want their tax dollars funding unauthorized regime change wars overseas,” said Erik Sperling, executive director of Just Foreign Policy. “Americans are grateful to Rep. Omar and others in Congress who insist on upholding the Constitution — war must be authorized by Congress after a debate and vote, not unilaterally dictated by the same neocon zealots responsible for peddling one disastrous regime change after another.”

Ismael Ayala-Uribe was transferred Sunday from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center to a regional hospital for surgery on an abscess on his buttock, according to an ICE statement.

Hospital staff found him unresponsive and “initiated lifesaving measures” but he was declared dead around 2:30 a.m. Monday, the statement said. The cause of death is under investigation.

In addition to the abscess, Ayala-Uribe suffered from hypertension and tachycardia, an abnormally fast heart rate, according to ICE.

Federal records show that more than a dozen people have died in immigration detention since January, when immigration officials began to implement President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

His family said Ayala-Uribe had high blood pressure but was otherwise healthy. His brother told the Los Angeles Times that Ayala-Uribe got sick with a cough and a fever shortly after he arrived at the Adelanto facility on Aug. 22.

Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department offered its condolences to the man’s family and said the Mexican Consulate in San Bernardino would follow up with authorities at the immigration detention center to ensure a thorough investigation to “fully clarify” the cause of the death. Mexican officials are in contact with the family to offer legal assistance and other help.

Mexico also reiterated its commitment to protect and defend the human rights of Mexicans abroad.

According to ICE, Ayala-Uribe entered the United States at an unknown date and location. He applied for, and received, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection in 2012. In 2016, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied his application to renew his DACA status.

On September 12, Louisiana-based immigration judge Jamee Comans ruled that foreign-born activist-agitator Mahmoud Khalil can be removed to either Algeria or Syria due to material omissions on his green card application. Although the decision will be appealed – further dragging out what should be a simple and quick process – the immigration judge’s ruling is consistent with America’s national interests, national security, and the law.

Khalil, of Palestinian origin, was born in Syria and raised between there and Lebanon. He also holds Algerian citizenship. In 2024, as a graduate student at Columbia University, he became a leading organizer of pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel protests and campus encampments that followed the October 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks. This, according to DHS, created a climate of harassment and intimidation toward Jewish students at Columbia.

Originally arriving in the U.S. on a student visa in 2022 and obtaining a green card in 2024, Khalil was taken into custody by ICE in March at his apartment. The arrest was, as DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin explained, “in support of President Trump’s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism” because Khalil had “led activities aligned [with] Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.”

On March 10, referring to Khalil and others, President Trump warned in a Truth Social post that “[i]f you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here.” The president was referring to Section 237(a)(1)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which states that “[a]n alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.” From the moment of his arrest, however, anti-borders activists turned Khalil into a martyr and a symbol of an alleged attack against free speech.

The pro-Palestinian activist spent about three months in ICE custody in Louisiana until federal district judge Michael Farbiarz ordered his release on bail on June 20. But the litigation was far from over, with Judge Comans’ being the most recent chapter in the saga.

Rejecting three motions from Khalil’s lawyer, Judge Comans ruled that the activist intentionally committed fraud in his green card application by omitting important information about his political associations, thus rendering him deportable. Khalil specifically left out his work for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA) and Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD). As FAIR pointed out previously: “By its own admission, UNRWA employees participated in the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7 and that the terror group used UNRWA facilities in Gaza to hold hostages who were taken captive in those attacks. CUAD was one of the leading groups behind the violent takeover of Hamilton Hall on Columbia’s campus last year as well as engaging in activities that denied Jewish students access to parts of the campus.”

“The evidence shows the Respondent knew of the potential immigration consequences for his involvement in protests organized by varying organizations on campus, including CUAD,” emphasized Judge Comans. Moreover, “[t]he waiver [requested by Khalil’s legal team] was not designed to reward a lack of candor by applicants admitted as immigrant visa holders who then intentionally engage in dishonesty by misrepresenting facts in the application process to adjust status, post entry.”

She further emphasized the foreign policy argument as well, stating that “[a]s previously found by this Court, the Immigration Judge lacks authority to question foreign policy determinations made by the U.S. Secretary of State,” but “[t]he Court finds this factor alone outweighs the positive equities in the Respondent’s case [such as Khalil having a young child], and the Court denies the waiver as a matter of discretion on that basis.” Other negative factors working against Khalil included in Judge Comans’ ruling were the fact that he holds no property or business interests in the U.S. and had held no other employment other than internships.

Khalil was thus ordered deported to Syria, where he emigrated from in 2022, or to Algeria, where he also holds citizenship due to his mother’s descent from anti-French revolutionaries in that country. The law (INA Section 241) makes it clear that the U.S. government has many options when it comes to removing deportable aliens, who cannot only be sent back to countries in which they hold citizenship or have previously resided but also to other nations willing to accept them.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/iStock-691789288.jpg.webp?itok=hRgeex2A,N,,2025-09-24 16:58:08.090278

As of September 15, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) confirmed that no individuals remain detained in provincial correctional facilities. Ontario had historically held the largest number of immigration detainees in provincial jails, drawing intensified scrutiny after a 2023 coroner’s inquest into the 2015 death of Abdurahman Hassan revealed concerning conditions within these facilities.

Human rights advocates welcomed the decision as a major victory. Samer Muscati, Disability Rights Deputy Director at Human Rights Watch, emphasized that Ontario’s move upholds the dignity and rights of people seeking safety in Canada and increases pressure on the federal government to end the broader system of rights-violating immigration detention. Similarly, Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English-speaking section, noted that migrants deserve respect and safety, not incarceration, as they build new lives in Canada.

British Columbia had been the first province to end its immigration detention contract with the CBSA, setting an example for other provinces. The #WelcomeToCanada campaign, launched by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Canada in October 2021, alongside advocates, legal experts, healthcare providers, faith leaders, and people with lived experience, has consistently pushed for the closure of immigration detention facilities in provincial jails. More than 30,000 Canadians have written directly to authorities in support of this cause.

The practice of using provincial jails for immigration detention has been widely criticized for violating international human rights standards and harming mental health. Reports have highlighted that racialized individuals, particularly Black men, face harsher conditions and longer confinement periods, while people with disabilities experience systemic discrimination throughout the detention process. In recent years, UN bodies including the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention have called on Canada to end immigration detention entirely and respect the rights of detainees.

Despite provincial progress, the federal government has moved in the opposite direction, opening a temporary designated immigrant detention facility in a federal prison at Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec, in July 2025. Advocates urge Ottawa to follow the provinces’ lead by abolishing immigration detention, halting its expansion into federal prisons, and scaling up humane, community-based alternatives that respect human rights and Canada’s international obligations.",https://news.fundsforngos.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-24 16:57:36.402718

Trump administration fires immigration judges, even as it seeks to hire more of them

The Trump administration fired nearly 20 immigration judges this month, following the dismissal of more than 80 judges earlier this year.

The dismissals come as the administration is seeking to add immigration judges by filling jobs with up to 600 military attorneys. The current backlog in the courts is nearly 4 million cases, NPR reports in its article on the latest firings.

Matt Biggs, the president of the union that represents immigration judges, said in a statement to NPR the dismissal of more judges “is an illogical and costly setback for the nation’s immigration courts.”

“At a time when the backlog has reached historic levels and the administration has made immigration enforcement a central issue, the removal of experienced judges is hypocritical, undermines the law, wastes taxpayer dollars and further delays justice for citizens and immigrants alike,” said Biggs, who is the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.

The number of departing immigration judges swells when the dismissals are combined with voluntary resignations. The loss was more than 125 immigration judges in the last nine months, down from 700 judges at the start of the year, according to NPR.

In San Francisco, seven immigration judges have been fired as of Sept. 11, amounting to about one-third of the judges there, the San Francisco Chronicle reports.

Immigration judges preside in courts overseen by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. They decide whether noncitizens accused of violating immigration laws should be removed or granted protection from removal.

San Francisco immigration courts grant relief to immigrants in 71% of the cases, one of the highest rates among the nation’s largest courts, the article says.

Five of the seven judges fired in San Francisco grant relief at higher rates than their colleagues. One fired judge had the lowest rate of granting relief in the court.

Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, said in an August memo “statistically improbable outcome metrics” could indicate bias or failure to adhere to the law, warranting “close examination and potential action.”

Executive Office for Immigration Review leadership has also criticized judges for failing to manage their caseloads efficiently, according to NPR.

The suspect has been identified by a law enforcement official as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn. The official could not publicly disclose details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

The exact motivation for the attack was not immediately known. The head of the FBI, Kash Patel, released a photo on social media that shows a bullet found at the scene with the words “ANTI-ICE” written in what appears to be marker.

The attack is the latest public, targeted killing in the U.S. and comes two weeks after conservative leader Charlie Kirk was killed by a rifle-wielding shooter on a roof.

“The shooter fired indiscriminately at the ICE building, including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a release about the Dallas shooting.

The detainee who survived was in critical condition at a hospital, DHS said.

No ICE agents were injured.

‘Targeted violence’

At a news conference earlier in the day, authorities gave few details about the shooting and did not release the names of the victims or the gunman.

The FBI said it was investigating the shooting as “an act of targeted violence.”

Officers responded to a call to assist an officer on North Stemmons Freeway around 6:40 a.m. Wednesday and determined that someone opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building, Dallas police spokesperson Officer Jonathen E. Maner said in an email.

Edwin Cardona, an immigrant from Venezuela, said he was entering the ICE building with his son for an appointment around 6:20 a.m. when he heard gunshots.

An agent gathered people who were inside, took them to a more secure area and explained that there was an active shooter, Cardona said.

“I was afraid for my family because my family was outside. I felt terrible because I thought something could happen to them. Thank God no,” Cardona said.

Cardona said his family was brought into the building, and they were later reunited.

The ICE facility is along Interstate 35 East, just southwest of Dallas Love Field, a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and blocks from hotels catering to travelers.

Officials call for end to political violence

Shortly after the shooting and before officials said at least one victim was a detainee, Vice President JD Vance posted on the social platform X that “the obsessive attack on law enforcement, particularly ICE, must stop.”

Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas continued in that direction, calling for an end to politically motivated violence.

“To every politician who is using rhetoric demonizing ICE and demonizing CPB: stop,” Cruz told reporters, referencing Customs and Border Protection.

The Rev. Ashley Anne Sipe, who prays outside of the Dallas ICE facility every Monday, called the shooting heartbreaking.

“Violence doesn’t heal anything,” Sipe, a pastor in Lewisville near Dallas, told AP.

Sipe and other local faith leaders who have decried deportations hold weekly vigils and serve as “moral witnesses.” They pray and observe for about three hours, watching as immigrants enter the building to meet with advisers and to report for check-ins.

Over the past couple of months, Sipe said she has noticed that people who walk into the building are shuttled away on buses.

“They’re taking them away, and we don’t know where they’re taking them,” Sipe said.

Noem: ICE agents targeted

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem noted a recent uptick in targeting of ICE agents.

Attackers dressed in black military-style clothing opened fire July 4 outside the Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, southwest of Dallas, federal prosecutors said. One police officer was injured. At least 11 people have been charged in connection with the attack.

Days later, a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents leaving a U.S. Border Patrol facility in McAllen on July 7. The man, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, injured a police officer who responded to the scene before authorities shot and killed him. Police later found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks inside Mosqueda’s car.

In suburban Chicago, federal authorities erected a fence around an immigration processing center after tensions recently flared with protesters. President Donald Trump’s administration has stepped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area, resulting in hundreds of arrests.

Ahead of the latest immigration operation, federal officials boarded up windows at the center.

Sixteen people have been arrested outside the center, according to federal authorities who characterized the activists as “rioters.”

The report by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology is based on data released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in February. The data came from forms that immigration agents fill out when they send genetic information to an F.B.I. database of convicted criminals, missing persons and evidence from crime scenes.

The report’s authors argued that border agents were exceeding their authority with the collections, accusing them of violating U.S. citizens’ rights under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.

The report analyzed data from October 2020 to December 2024, a period covering a few months of the first Trump administration and most of the Biden administration. The researchers found that of the 2,000 Americans subjected to cheek swabs agents from Customs and Border Protection, more than 800 were not arrested or charged with a crime at the time.

Law enforcement officers in the United States are allowed to collect DNA from citizens arrested in connection with serious crimes.

The Georgetown report said that federal agents sending genetic information to the F.B.I. had provided “legally questionable, nonsensical, or altogether absent” justifications for collecting DNA samples.

Neither U.S. Customs and Border Protection nor the F.B.I. responded to requests for comment overnight.

A February directive from U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that federal agencies are required to collect DNA samples from Americans who were under arrest, facing charges or convicted, and from noncitizens in U.S. detention. The directive said that DNA collection by agency was a “routine booking measure parallel to fingerprinting.”

The authors of the Georgetown report said that data on DNA collection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection during Mr. Trump’s second term was not yet available. They said they expected it to “reveal an even broader and more reckless approach” because of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/24/multimedia/24xp-dna-kfzc/24xp-dna-kfzc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 16:57:15.352095

What is the H-1B visa?
Typically, the initial duration of an H-1B visa classification is three years but may be extended up to six.
The current annual statutory cap is 65,000 visas, with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution of higher learning.
H-1B workers are often in the mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical science fields, ranging from software engineers and doctors to architects and financial analysts.","President Donald Trump announced that his administration will impose a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa petitions. The new fee went into effect as of September 21, 2025, and will greatly impact employers’ ability to secure the highly educated foreign workers who come to the United States on the H-1B visa.

Employers will now be required to pay a one-time $100,000 fee per new petition. Previously, it cost employers between $2,000 to $5,000 per petition, depending on the size of the employer.

What is the H-1B visa?

The H-1B visa category allows employers to petition for highly educated foreign professionals to temporarily work in “specialty occupations.” These jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent and include positions like civil engineers, software developers, and researchers. Typically, the initial duration of an H-1B visa classification is three years but may be extended up to six.

Since creating the visa program in 1990, Congress has limited the number of H-1Bs made available each year. The current annual statutory cap is 65,000 visas, with 20,000 additional visas for foreign professionals who graduate with a master’s degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution of higher learning.

Who are H-1B workers?

H-1B workers are often in the mathematics, engineering, technology, and medical science fields, ranging from software engineers and doctors to architects and financial analysts. The majority, however, (nearly 65%) had computer-related jobs as of 2023 data.

Over 70% of H-1B visa holders are Indian citizens. Though the move could lead to issues for U.S. businesses with Indian ties, the impact extends beyond the financial.

India’s Ministry of External Affairs issued a response to President Trump’s new fee, stating that the measure will likely have “humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families.” The statement went on to say that the Indian government “hopes that these disruptions can be addressed suitably by the U.S. authorities.”

In the immediate aftermath of the fee announcement, families were left behind as H-1B visa holders scrambled to reach the United States before the fee went into effect, fearing they would be locked out of the country. Though the White House later clarified that the fee would not apply to existing visa holders, confusion had already gripped visa holders, their families, and the companies that employ them.

Some have canceled their plans to return to their home countries, believing that even a vacation is too risky right now.

How will U.S companies be impacted?

Some of the largest tech companies and top banks in the U.S. will be hit particularly hard by the change.

Amazon was the biggest sponsor of H-1B workers for fiscal year 2025, employing over 10,000 people with the visa, followed by other household names like Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Google, Cognizant Technology Solutions, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart.

Economists are already sounding the alarm that the astronomical fee will likely hurt the U.S. economy, resulting in a “brain drain” of qualified workers moving to other countries and slower economic growth overall.

Do H-1B workers take jobs from Americans?

No, they do not take jobs from U.S. workers. Before an employer can file a petition with USCIS, they must take specific steps to ensure that hiring an H-1B worker will not harm U.S. workers.

Employers first must attest, on a labor condition application certified by the Department of Labor, that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. They also must provide existing workers with notice that they plan to hire an H-1B worker.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/immigration-impact-h1b-fee.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 15:56:55.855090
