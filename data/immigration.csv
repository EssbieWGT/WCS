She says she never imagined her path would lead her to a secluded city in southern Mexico.
“It took two and a half days,” she said of the journey from the U.S.-Mexico border to Southern Mexico.
According to Rodríguez, deported migrants are typically processed in Reynosa, just across the border from McAllen, Texas.
Meanwhile, U.S. deportations to Venezuela continue While thousands of migrants remain stranded in southern Mexico, the U.S. has been sending others directly back to Venezuela.","Human rights organizations in southern Mexico are raising alarms about what they call dangerous conditions for migrants who are being deported from the United States and left in remote regions with little guidance or support.

Among them is a 22‑year‑old Venezuelan mother who spoke with NBC6 on the condition that her name not be used for safety reasons. She says she never imagined her path would lead her to a secluded city in southern Mexico.

The woman says she was deported on Jan. 1, along with her 3‑year‑old son. She told NBC6 she had been living in the United States with a deportation order, was apprehended in Pennsylvania and subsequently sent to Texas before being deported to Mexico.

“It took two and a half days,” she said of the journey from the U.S.-Mexico border to Southern Mexico.

A growing hub for deported migrants

Human rights groups say that southern Mexico — particularly the city of Villahermosa — has become a landing place for migrants being expelled from the U.S.

July Rodríguez, founder and director of Apoyo a Migrantes Venezolanos, a nonprofit that provides legal guidance to newly arrived migrants, says the recent deportation routes are long, exhausting, and often dangerous.

According to Rodríguez, deported migrants are typically processed in Reynosa, just across the border from McAllen, Texas. After being given food and held for about two hours, they are transported on bus by Mexican authorities approximately 14 to 16 hours south to Villahermosa. With traffic, she says the trip can exceed 24 hours.

But Rodríguez says the most troubling issue is what comes next.

Although migrants are supposed to be taken directly to Villahermosa’s immigration processing center, she says that “the reality is that it doesn’t always happen.” Some migrants report being dropped off in unsafe areas—sometimes overnight.

“We can’t cover the sun with one finger,” Rodríguez said. “These are places with very high levels of insecurity.”

Her organization has heard from engineers, architects, accountants, educators, and others who lived in the U.S. for many years — some for almost a decade — before suddenly being returned to a country they do not know.

Shelters seeing an increase in Venezuelans

In Villahermosa, shelters are feeling the impact.

Josue Martinez Leal, who works at the Amparito Shelter, says they’ve seen a noticeable rise in Venezuelan nationals arriving after deportation from the U.S. Many of them are families — women traveling with young children, like the young mother NBC6 spoke with by video conference.

In 2025, Martinez says the shelter also received Cuban, Honduran, Salvadoran, Colombian and Haitian migrants.

He believes Villahermosa may be intentionally chosen because of its proximity to Guatemala — potentially to encourage migrants to continue south and leave Mexico.

Meanwhile, U.S. deportations to Venezuela continue

While thousands of migrants remain stranded in southern Mexico, the U.S. has been sending others directly back to Venezuela.

Human Rights First reports that between February and December, nearly 80 deportation flights carried more than 14,000 Venezuelans back to their home country — including children.

Martinez says he worries about what lies ahead for migrants who now find themselves in a “third country” —neither the U.S. nor their homeland — without an immediate support network.

For the young mother NBC6 interviewed, returning to Venezuela is not an option. She says she fled an abusive relationship and hoped to build a safer future for herself and her son.

NBC6 reached out to both state and federal Mexican authorities to ask why Villahermosa is being used as a deportation destination, but received no response.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also did not respond to questions about its policies regarding Venezuelan deportations.",https://media.nbcmiami.com/2026/01/vz-deported-to-mx.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-24 00:57:41.226914

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers.
Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025.
The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024.
“So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said.","WASHINGTON -- Guan Heng, who exposed human rights abuses in his native China, has been in U.S. custody since being swept up in an immigration enforcement operation in August. He says he dares not even think about what would happen to him if he were sent back.

“I would be prosecuted, I would be jailed, I would be tortured. All of that could happen,” Guan, 38, told The Associated Press in a recent call from the Broome County Correctional Facility in New York.

A judge on Monday is to consider his appeal to remain in the United States, where he sought asylum after fleeing his homeland more than four years ago to publish video footage of detention facilities in China’s Xinjiang region.

The Department of Homeland Security initially sought to deport him to Uganda, but dropped the plan in December after his plight raised public concerns and attracted attention on Capitol Hill. But his future remains unclear.

Guan said the public attention has given him hope. During his first months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, he said “there was no help from the outside world” and stories from fellow detainees and reports of the Trump administration's anti-immigration campaign left him extremely pessimistic.

He is among tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have been swept up in mass deportation efforts in the past year despite having what they believed to be legitimate claims to stay in the U.S.

“We are very worried about the number of asylum seekers that will be sent back to extremely dangerous conditions,” said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “It’s worrying to see that an institution like asylum is being so eroded.”

Guan said ICE agents stumbled upon him during an operation targeting his housemates in the small town where he was living outside of Albany.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, said ICE encountered Guan when assisting the FBI in executing a criminal search warrant.

“This illegal alien from China entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time,” she said in a written response to a request for comment. “All of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge.”

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, has urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to release Guan and approve his asylum request.

In a statement to the AP on Friday in reference to Guan's case, the Illinois Democrat called for “careful adherence to due process and America’s long-standing commitment to protecting human rights whistleblowers.”

Immigrants can apply for asylum when there’s a fear of harm back home because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers. Rather than allowing them to stay in the country while their cases are pending, immigration authorities are closing out cases and giving people removal orders so they can be rapidly deported, she said.

Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025. That's about one-third of the half million people the Trump administration ordered deported last year.

The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024. Usually, a case gets marked “abandoned” when the applicant misses an appointment, said Bartlomiej Skorupa, the group’s chief operating officer. He said it's not yet clear what caused the rise.

In cities across the country, some immigrants have stopped showing up for routine hearings after agents began making arrests right in the courtrooms, turning them into deportation traps.

Guan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang, adding to a body of evidence of what activists say are widespread rights abuses in the region, where as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities, especially the Uyghurs, have been locked up.

The Chinese government has denied the allegations, saying it runs vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts.

Beijing tolerates little dissent, especially on issues such as Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan and Communist Party rule, and has largely silenced dissent through a range of coercive means, including detention and “forced disappearances.”

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guan's case and his fears about being deported to China.

With the footage in hand, Guan knew he had to leave the country if he was to publish it. He went first to Hong Kong without a further plan. “I played it by ear,” he said.

From Hong Kong, he flew to Ecuador, where Chinese tourists could then travel without a visa, and then on to the Bahamas before sailing to Florida in October 2021. By the time he arrived, he had released most of his video footage on YouTube.

Guan settled in Queens, a borough in New York City, and said he tried to live a “stable” life. Once he had a work permit, he worked as an Uber driver and did deliveries. He cut off contact with nearly all of his relatives back in China so they would not be harassed by the police.

He said he cherished the freedom from fear he enjoyed in the U.S. Then Donald Trump returned to the White House and launched his mass deportation campaign.

Guan said he understands why Trump has taken such a radical approach.

“It's because the past immigration policy was too lax and caused resentment from many people,” Guan said, adding that he considers such fluctuations to be “normal” in a democratic society.

“No matter what it is, any issue gets both support and opposition,” he said. “I also have come to know that people in all parts of the country are protesting the government's too aggressive behavior.”

Local residents who don't know him personally have shown their support, Guan said. “So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said. “At the same time, I've felt the warmth of the U.S. society.”

Should he be released, he said he would cherish the opportunity to stay in the United States.

“I would like to do meaningful things,” Guan said. “I hope to establish some connections with others so that I can help others.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d884f0fd-936e-4fba-aa1c-509d05d41bd7/wirestory_a63ab1448c2d719523c75269095f3c0a_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-23 21:58:32.320180

""There are rules and I know them,"" said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes.

Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution's Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government's forced entry into someone's home.

As a result, immigration officers have had to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people's homes without a judge's warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades.

The change comes as immigration arrests nationwide soar under a mass deportation campaign by President Donald Trump's administration that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on.

""But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that's the last straw,"" he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man's home in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

""Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,"" Blumenthal said in a news release.

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the ""physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.""

The waiting game

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he didn't leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called ""knock and talks"" to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations.

Not answering the door is a key part of know-your-rights trainings

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge.

They've held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves.

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School's Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo ""quite disturbing.""

""Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it's sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,"" he said. ""They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.""

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door.

""They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,"" he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump's border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

""They call it 'know-your-rights,'"" he said last year on CNN. ""I call it 'how to escape arrest.'""

Experts warn barging into homes could put all at risk

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they're at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a ""reasonable chance to act lawfully."" But if that doesn't work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.

Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-18T214723Z_1338556290_RC2W3JACU5AU_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 21:58:50.818220

And anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony. You have immunity to perform your duties. And no one, no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist, can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties. And the Department of Justice has made clear that if officials cross that line into obstruction, into criminal conspiracy against the United States or against ICE officers, then they will face justice.” What do you make of that? I make of that that Miller is trying to communicate to ICE, and to these new members of ICE in particular, that they will not face consequences for use of force specifically. I think he’s speaking to the ICE officer who shot Renee Good in Minnesota last week and killed her, but also to officers who’ve used tear gas, who’ve pushed and shoved and arrested protesters who’ve claimed that people who are filming them are impeding arrests and using that as a pretense to either take those people into custody or have some violent altercation with them. It is very striking. I was talking to one former ICE official who told me that you would always fear discharging your weapon in an interaction, even a potentially violent and a dangerous one. Usually the concern was that officers would be too unwilling to use their gun because they worried about potential repercussions. And there were all these layers of investigation that would take place after a shooting. And so his fear when he was in ICE for 30 years was that he wouldn’t use his gun in a moment when he needed to. And now it’s almost as if the opposite fear is true. And we’ve seen within ICE people losing their jobs. High-level officials losing their jobs because they’re not delivering enough deportations. They’re not being aggressive enough.

More than 65,000 people are currently in ICE custody, a two-thirds jump since Trump took office.","US immigration enforcement faced mounting scrutiny Friday from international officials as well as congressional Democrats after a detainee death ruled a homicide by a county medical examiner in Texas. The disturbing development comes amid record deaths in Homeland Security custody.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk called on the US to ensure that its immigration policies comply with international law, citing reports of arbitrary detentions, family separations, and dehumanizing treatment. And Democratic lawmakers demanded that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem answer for a growing death toll in immigration detention since President Donald Trump took office for his second term.

The medical examiner in El Paso County found this week that Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old Cuban migrant held at a local Homeland Security detention camp, died of asphyxiation on January 3—a homicide. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) initially said Campos died after staff “observed him in distress.” The Washington Post reported witness testimony that camp guards had choked him to death.

The homicide finding adds to intensifying controversy over deaths involving ICE, following the fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.

The UN’s Türk said that individuals are being detained “sometimes violently” at hospitals, places of worship, schools, and homes, “often solely on mere suspicion of being undocumented migrants.” He noted that children are missing school and medical appointments out of fear of family separation.

“States have the authority to establish their national migration policies, but this needs to be carried out in full accordance with the law,” Türk said. “Adhering to due process is crucial to the legality and legitimacy of any policy.”

Türk’s statement comes amid declining public support for ICE. A New York Times/Siena University poll of 1,625 registered voters conducted Jan. 12-17 found that 61 percent of voters believe ICE tactics have “gone too far,” including 71 percent of independents and 19 percent of Republicans. Across the political spectrum, just 26 percent of voters thought the enforcement tactics used by ICE were “about right.”

In Friday’s statement, Türk also called for an independent investigation into deaths in ICE custody, adding that 30 people are reported to have died in ICE custody since President Donald Trump took office for his second term on Jan. 20, 2025. This marks the highest figure since 2004, and there have already been a further six deaths reported in ICE custody so far this year.

The ICE detainee death reporting website lists only 18 deaths for fiscal year 2025, which ended Sept. 30, but the page has not been updated since October and does not yet include figures for fiscal year 2026. More than 65,000 people are currently in ICE custody, a two-thirds jump since Trump took office.

“What’s happening here is clearly immoral,” the Unitarian Universalist minister said. “It’s definitely chilly, but the kind of ice that’s dangerous to us is not the weather.”

“It’s my community,” Nelson said. “Like everyone else, I don’t want ICE on our streets.”

Organizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses statewide have closed in solidarity with the movement, from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.

“We’re achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 participating groups.

According to an emergency petition filed in federal court, a district judge granted an emergency injunction ordering Chloe’s release into the custody of her lawyer. The child, a citizen of Ecuador who was brought to Minneapolis as a newborn, has a pending asylum application and is not subject to a final order of removal.

DHS repeated its allegation Friday that the father of 5-year-old Liam Ramos abandoned him during his arrest by immigration officers in Columbia Heights on Tuesday, leading to the child being detained, too.

Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Liam was detained because his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, “fled from the scene.” The two are detained together at the Dilley Detention Center in Texas, which is intended to hold families. McLaughlin said officers tried to get Liam’s mother to take him, but she refused to accept custody.

The family’s attorney Marc Prokosch said he thinks the mother refused to open the door to the ICE officers because she was afraid she would be detained. Columbia Heights district superintendent Zena Stenvik said Liam was “used as bait.”

Prokosch found nothing in state records to suggest Liam’s father has a criminal history.

On Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative away from Liam’s detention by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.

Details from Good’s autopsy

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner posted an initial autopsy report online for Good that classified her death as a homicide and determined she died from “multiple gunshots wounds.”

A more detailed independent autopsy commissioned by Good’s family said one bullet pierced the left side her head and exited on the right side. This autopsy, released Wednesday through the Romanucci & Blandin law firm, said bullets also struck her in the arm and breast, although those injuries weren’t immediately life-threatening.

Antonio Romanucci, an attorney for the family, said in a statement that the family is still awaiting the full report from the medical examiner and “hope that they communicate with Renee’s family and share their report before releasing any further information to the public.”

The demonstration took place on “ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth & Freedom,” a general strike supported by Minnesota unions, progressive faith leaders and community activists. Proponents encouraged all Minnesotans to stay home from work, school and refrain from shopping — disruptions of normal orders of business to protest the presence of federal immigration agents in Minnesota.

The massive protest began at The Commons Park at 2 p.m. in Minneapolis. The march ended with a rally at Target Center.

Natasha Dockter, the first vice president of the Minneapolis Federation of Educators’ teachers chapter, handed out hand warmers to demonstrators at The Commons alongside other teachers.

“I’m out here today because what’s going on in our city is completely and totally unacceptable. It’s impacting the lives of our students and their families that we serve,” Dockter said.

Sergey Goro and Ben Daniel were visiting the Twin Cities from San Francisco and Seattle for the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships, which was delayed due to the extreme cold.

Goro said that he’d been to No Kings protests — demonstrations against the Trump administration’s authoritarian policies — in San Francisco, but that they weren’t as large as the Minneapolis protest.

Daniel agreed: “We can really feel that everyone’s on board here — that this is ridiculous and it’s gotta stop.”

Daniela Morales, 16, carrying a Mexican flag, said her parents are both Mexican immigrants and that she attended the protest on behalf of people who can’t speak out.

“I’m really glad to see everybody come out and support each other and our neighbors and fight against the administration,” Morales said.

Other protests led to arrests

A morning protest at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport led to the arrests of roughly 100 clergy by MSP and Bloomington law enforcement Friday, according to a statement from protest organizers.

Demonstrators at the airport were standing or kneeling on the roadway outside Terminal 1’s departures area and led away by law enforcement.

Jeff Lea, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, said in an email that the airport “worked in advance with event organizers to best accommodate their right to freedom of expression while also ensuring uninterrupted operations.”

“When the permitted activity went beyond the agreed-upon terms, MSP Airport Police began taking necessary action, including arrests, to protect public safety, airport security and access to Terminal 1,” Lea wrote. Lea confirmed there were around 100 arrests.

At least one demonstrator was also arrested at the nearby Whipple Federal Building, where federal agents deployed chemical irritants into a crowd of protestors, the Star Tribune reported. Around noon, the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office announced that it had given three dispersal orders for protestors to unblock an access road at the building. The Whipple Building, now a base for federal immigration operations, has been an ongoing site of protests.

Life stood still Friday for many Minnesotans. Over 700 businesses closed Friday to support the “ICE Out” day, according to Bring Me The News, which is keeping a running list.

“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN, accountability for federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to Minnesota residents and call for Congress to immediately intervene,” the demonstration’s website states.

Establishes language access technical standards that allow individuals with LEP to access agency content.
Requires each agency to designate a language access coordinator to lead implementation and serve as a point of contact.","Bill would protect language access for 25 million individuals in the U.S. with limited English proficiency.

WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Rep. Judy Chu (CA-28), Chair Emerita of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), joined Rep. Grace Meng (NY-06), Rep. Juan Vargas (CA-51), and Rep. Dan Goldman (NY-10) in introducing the Language Access for All Act of 2026 to codify language access requirements for federal agencies, including translation and interpretation services under threat from the Trump administration.

In March 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order (EO) 14224 that declared English as the official language of the United States and revoked EO 13166, a 25-year-old mandate that required agencies and recipients of federal funding to provide critical language access to individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). The Trump administration's Department of Justice issued new guidance that minimizes multilingual services and redirects resources towards English language education and assimilation.

These policy changes threaten language access for the over 25 million individuals in the United States—eight percent of the U.S. population—with limited English proficiency. Asian Americans have among the highest language access needs of any racial group, with 32 percent having LEP. 12 percent of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders also have significant language access needs. And while Spanish language speakers make up the majority of those who speak another language in the United States, nearly 40 percent report speaking English “less than very well” in the most recent U.S. Census.

The Language Access for All Act of 2026 modernizes and strengthens the federal government’s approach to language access by codifying EO 13166 and establishing a coordinated, accountable framework to ensure meaningful access for individuals with limited English proficiency. The legislation promotes consistency across agencies, increases transparency and public engagement, and updates federal language access policy to reflect evolving technologies.

“For more than 25 years, both Democratic and Republican presidents have supported language accessibility across the federal government. Trump’s roll back of these protections is simply wrong. In my district, translation services are essential for parents applying for a home loan, seniors accessing Medicare, immigrants starting a small business, and disaster survivors accessing the FEMA’s resources. That is why I’m proud to co-lead the Language Access for All Act to ensure no one is denied health care, housing, or disaster assistance because English is not their first language. Language access is a civil right and rolling back these services is an attack on our immigrant communities,” said Congressmember Judy Chu (CA-28).

“Every American deserves equal access to federal services and programs in a language they can understand. Language access is essential to ensure individuals are able to access small business loans or receive the right medical care,” said Rep. Grace Meng (NY-06), Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. “I am proud to introduce the Language Access for All Act alongside my colleagues to safeguard translation services for individuals with limited English proficiency, including millions in the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community. We will continue to fight against the Trump administration's attacks on immigrants and the essential services that our communities rely on and deserve.”

“For decades, federal language access services have helped millions of people file taxes, get emergency alerts, apply for loans, and access health care. Trump’s decision to designate English as our country’s official language and attempt to scrap these critical services is dead wrong,” said Rep. Juan Vargas (CA-51). “No one should be locked out of federal programs because of the language they speak. This legislation is critical as we fight to push back on Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda and keep in place the services our communities rely on.”

“In my district, in the most linguistically diverse city on earth, language access mandates across the federal government helps ensure that everyone has meaningful access to housing loans, health care, workforce programs, and life-saving emergency alerts. Trump's attempt to roll back language access is just one of his many xenophobic attempts to attack immigrant communities, and it is completely unacceptable. I am proud to be introducing legislation to restore common sense requirements and ensure information about basic government services is made available to all,” said Rep. Dan Goldman (NY-10).

The Language Access for All Act of 2026:

Requires federal agencies to ensure that individuals with LEP can meaningfully access the federally conducted programs and activities of the agency, including through translation and interpretation.

Creates a public complaint system to track complaints regarding barriers to meaningful access at agencies.

Requires agencies to develop and maintain language access plans consistent with EO 13166, with public notice and comment, and to submit plans to Congress and publish them on LEP.gov.

Establishes language access technical standards that allow individuals with LEP to access agency content. This applies to all agency communications, including AI and automated language assistance services.

Ensures AI-assisted language services do not replace qualified translators and interpreters, comply with federal privacy requirements, and are continuously tested for bias, discrimination, and errors.

Creates an interagency language access working group to provide guidance, coordination, and technical assistance.

Requires each agency to designate a language access coordinator to lead implementation and serve as a point of contact.

Together, these reforms aim to improve service delivery, reduce barriers to access, and ensure federal agencies are equipped to meet the language needs of the public.

This bill builds upon Congressmember Chu’s longstanding commitment to ensuring language accessibility, beginning with her work as a City Councilmember, fighting against an ugly “English-only” movement in her hometown of Monterey Park. On August 15, 2025, Reps. Chu, Meng, and Vargas led 58 House colleagues in a letter to President Trump and the Department of Justice, on the administration’s rollback of language access across federal agencies and its impact on LEP communities. On April 11, 2025, Rep. Chu also led an oversight letter with Rep. Meng and 54 other House Democrats opposing the initial release of President Trump’s EO 14224.

“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN,” the group organising the protest wrote on its website.

There are solidarity marches in cities across the US, including New York City, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Seattle, among others.

At the Minneapolis protest, the group is also planning a march that begins at 2pm local time (20:00 GMT) and ends at the Target Center — an arena in downtown Minneapolis.

Eyes on Target

The big-box retailer, in particular, has been in the crosshairs of organisers because of the company’s close ties to Minneapolis, where its headquarters are located, and it is the state’s fourth-largest employer.

The group is calling for Target stores to exercise protections under the Fourth Amendment, which would mean federal agents do not have the legal authority to enter a residence or place of business without a warrant signed by a judge.

In a document shared with organisers, the group pointed to two incidents of concern. One on January 8, when Customs and Border Patrol aggressively forced two US citizens onto the ground and subsequently detained them while working at a store in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, and another three days later in nearby St Paul, where Customs and Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino entered a store with other agents.

“Where Target leads, others follow. Our state is under occupation from federal agents, and they are attacking Minnesotans quite literally inside of Target stores. We need Target to stand with Minnesotans against these attacks,” the document said.

Target has been quiet about the protests and calls from its workers to take a stance. The company sent a memo to staff, according to Bloomberg News, warning of potential disruptions.

The pressure by anti-ICE protesters is the latest in a wave of pushback against the retail giant by progressives in the past year. There was a call for boycotts after the company rolled back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which the company later attributed to a reason for a downturn in sales in early 2025.

The looming tensions have not made a dent on Wall Street, as the company’s stock is up 1.3 percent in midday trading.

Target did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.

The political response

“The Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement operations have resulted in countless dangerous criminal illegals being removed from the streets – including rapists, murderers, burglars, drunk drivers, and more. Making American communities safer will create an environment in which all businesses can thrive in the long term and their customers can feel safe. Joe Biden and Democrat leaders should’ve never let countless dangerous criminal illegals enter our country to begin with. And now the Trump Administration is cleaning up the Democrats’ mess,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Al Jazeera in a statement.

When pressed for a response to this reasoning and asked whether ICE would commit to holding accountable agents who break the law, the White House declined to provide additional comment.

The allegations concerning the agency’s conduct have led to the protests, including claims that ICE’s actions violated First and Fourth Amendment protections and threats towards protesters.

Among them are the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a case that has drawn scrutiny from civil liberties advocates, and the Department of Justice’s decision not to investigate the agent behind the shooting, which has invoked further outrage. One of the economic blackout’s calls is to hold Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot and killed Renee Good, legally accountable.

“I understand why people are choosing to participate in the January 23 blackout, and I support those decisions. At the same time, our small businesses, especially immigrant-owned businesses, are under a lot of pressure right now, and they could really use our support. However you choose to show up, I hope we keep our neighbours and local businesses in mind,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.

By the end of November 2025, ICE was using 104 more facilities for immigration detention than at the start of the year, a 91% increase.
With release on bond no longer an option for many people seeking relief, and deleterious conditions inside facilities, immigrants are increasingly giving up.
As of November 2025, 14.3 people were deported directly from detention for every one person released from ICE detention pending a hearing.
Inside ICE detention itself, the conditions that have resulted from this rapid expansion for those caught up in the detention system have increasingly worsened and become more inhumane.","When President Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was holding roughly 40,000 people in a national network of detention centers on any given day. In just one year, this number has increased by over 75%, with a record 73,000 people being held in detention as of mid-January.

A new report by the American Immigration Council details the unprecedented growth of ICE detention over President Trump’s first term, which has been fueled by a staggering $45 billion in funding for ICE detention included in the signature “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The report chronicles how the ICE detention system has grown larger, more abusive, and more opaque than ever as the Trump administration rushes to detain ever-greater numbers of immigrants as part of its mass deportation push.

What the report finds:

The number of people held in ICE detention on any given day increased by over 75% in one year.

By the end of November 2025, ICE was using 104 more facilities for immigration detention than at the start of the year, a 91% increase.

The Trump administration has dramatically changed the profile of who is being arrested by increasing the use of “at-large” arrests in American communities by 600%, leading to an unprecedented deployment of federal law enforcement.

With the funding provided by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE has enough funding to operate upwards of 135,000 detention beds through the end of FY 2029.

These changes in arrest practices have led to a 2,450% increase in the number of people with no criminal record being held in ICE detention on any given day.

President Trump’s executive order calling for the maximum use of detention has created a “no release” system where increasingly few individuals are able to seek release on bond. By the end of November 2025, discretionary releases from detention fell by 87%.

With release on bond no longer an option for many people seeking relief, and deleterious conditions inside facilities, immigrants are increasingly giving up. As of November 2025, 14.3 people were deported directly from detention for every one person released from ICE detention pending a hearing.

How the detention and enforcement system has changed under Trump

The changes that have occurred in detention go beyond basic questions of infrastructure and development of the capacity to detain. As immigration enforcement has become the top priority of federal law enforcement, major shifts have occurred in the profile of who is arrested, and therefore who is detained.

T These changes have resulted from the expansion of “at-large” arrests in American communities, worksite raids at farms, construction sites, factories, and other businesses, and new “re-arrest” policies at ICE check-ins and immigration courthouses. American communities are now seeing a level of immigration enforcement utterly unprecedented in modern history, leading to a rising backlash and clashes between protestors and DHS officials.

Once people have been arrested, changes in policy have kept them locked up in detention centers for longer or indefinitely, including the establishment of an official no-release policy and the expanded use of “mandatory detention” laws to deny the right to seek bond. People who would have been released by any past administration are now being pressured into giving up their day in court. Immigration judges have been directed to deny bond to thousands of people who were previously eligible, and ICE officers have been told that only high-level officials can approve humanitarian releases.

As more people are detained, those held by ICE are suffering the consequences of the rapid expansion of detention infrastructure. ICE has signed extensive new contracts with private prison companies to reopen shuttered prisons and detention centers or expand existing facilities. At the same time, the agency has begun experimenting with new models for immigration detention of people arrested inside the country, including partnering with Florida on an unprecedented state-based detention center (the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” and the opening of a tent camp on a military base in El Paso).

New plans suggest that the administration may even purchase unused commercial warehouses and convert them into jails to hold thousands of people at a time. This expansion has come alongside the reduction of both internal and external oversight into conditions on the ground, making it harder than ever to track what is going on inside facilities or ensure that contractors are following the law.

Inside ICE detention itself, the conditions that have resulted from this rapid expansion for those caught up in the detention system have increasingly worsened and become more inhumane. With more arrests than detention beds to hold people, ICE facilities saw significant overcrowding in 2025, worsening and substandard medical care, growing complaints of abusive conditions, and documented extensive violations of detention standards. As the system expands before officials ensure there are enough staff or infrastructure in place, people have been “disappearing” for days as ICE’s detainee locator system has become unreliable and access to phones uncertain. Sadly, 2025 was the deadliest year for ICE detention on record, and 2026 is looking to be worse.

A system of detention, which did not fully take off until the mid-1990s, is now on track to rival the entire federal criminal prison system by the end of President Trump’s second term in office. With the Trump administration hoping to get over 100,000 detention beds or more online in 2026, ICE detention and the ongoing abuses inside these facilities will only grow more numerous. As the report documents, it will ultimately be on Congress to rein the agency back in. But until that happens, the system is likely to grow even larger for now; and unfortunately the consequences may be deadly.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/immigration-impact-report-detention.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 17:57:56.937561

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.","SAN DIEGO -- Since coming to the United States 30 years ago from Mexico, Fernando Perez said U.S. immigration officers have stopped by his home numerous times, but he has never once answered the door.

“There are rules and I know them,” said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes.

Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government’s forced entry into someone’s home.

As a result, immigration officers have been forced to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades.

The shift comes as President Donald Trump's administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on.

“But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that's the last straw,” he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man's home in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Blumenthal said in a news release.

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the “physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.”

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he didn’t leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called “knock and talks” to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations.

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge.

They’ve held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves.

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo “quite disturbing.”

“Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it’s sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,” he said. “They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.”

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door.

“They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,” he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump’s border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

“They call it ‘know-your-rights,'” he said last year on CNN. ""I call it ‘how to escape arrest.’”

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.

Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.

“This would just be another step down that path,” he said. “Obviously it will be more significant because it suggests you're not safe even in your own house.”

And now there are new questions being raised about ICE's warrants to enter homes.

A whistleblower group leaked an internal memo from ICE, suggesting federal agents can rely on administrative warrants to make arrests instead of judicial warrants.

That would mean a judge does not have to sign off for agents to enter a suspect's home.

The whistleblower group argued this violates Department of Homeland Security's own policy.

They also said it violates the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.

Here at home, the latest turn of events is alarming civil rights advocates.

The Aloha State is known as a melting pot with generations of immigrants and multiethnic people.

Some of them are now worried federal officers may be allowed enter a home without a judge's warrant.

""It is very terrifying and scary that they could potentially just target homes,"" said a Hawaii resident who asked to remain anonymous because her family member was deported. ""We're very worried for communities, we are a state made up of immigrants.""

""Raised here, there's a sense of community, there's a sense of belonging, respect for the host culture as well as respect for the diversity of culture,"" she added. ""I just hope that that survives.""

The latest immigration policy is alarming advocates at the ACLU of Hawaii.

""This policy puts everybody at risk because we know that there are mistakes that are getting made and that any immigration officer can sign one of these administrative warrants,"" said Emily Hills, the ACLU's senior staff attorney.

She said the Fourth Amendment is all about checks and balances and making sure that the government is operating appropriately and within constitutional limits.

""It makes you question, 'Is it going to be me next, right?' For me personally as a naturalized US citizen from the Filipino community, those are things that that come to mind,"" said Sergio Alcubilla, the ACLU's director of community engagement.

And the uncertainty is widespread.

""You're pitting immigrant communities against each other—legal, illegal—making folks wonder 'Is my neighbor here, you know, legally?' And those are things that don't sit well with people here in Hawaii,"" Alcubilla said.

Why it matters: For the 2028ers, voting ""no"" on a bill that's likely to pass the Senate next week is an easy way to signal their outrage at a president whose actions and policies they detest.

But for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), it's another reminder that funding a government controlled by President Trump can quickly inflame his base, especially if his colleagues are fanning the flames.

The intrigue: Schumer hasn't said how he'll vote on the minibus the House passed Thursday, but, earlier this month, he took the idea of another government shutdown off the table.

Last March, Schumer was filleted for supporting a short-term funding bill.

In September, he course-corrected and touted his willingness to shut down the government.

On its own, the 2028ers' opposition wouldn't be enough to derail plans to prevent a government funding lapse after Jan. 30, but that could change if more Democrats join them.

What they are saying: Many of the Democratic senators weighing a run for the White House in 2028 have been vocal on the issue, particularly Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has consistently demanded reforms to ICE and threatened to vote against funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was also clear on MSNOW on Tuesday night: ""I've said repeatedly that I will not support one dime of funding for Trump's lawless ICE operations. I will vote no.""

""Yeah, I am not voting to give whatever ICE has become more taxpayer money,"" Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said on X on Wednesday.

""I will vote against this bill when and if it comes to the Senate,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said on X on Thursday.

""I will not vote to fund DHS and ICE,"" Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said on X last week.

Between the lines: Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) suggested at an event in Michigan this week that she may not support DHS funding, but hasn't been definitive.

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has not taken a public position.

The other side: House Democrats got a separate vote on funding for ICE, with 206 voting against it and only seven supporting. It passed, 220-207.

Compare that with the remaining three bills — which will fund the Departments of Defense, Labor, HHS, Education, Transportation and HUD — in the minibus. That passed 341-88, with 64 Democrats voting against it.

The bottom line: The minibus — which will include six bills in the Senate — doesn't appear in danger of failing at the moment, but the margins will be interesting.

Judge questions Trump's authority for $400 million ballroom project

Preservation group seeks injuction halting work

Ruling expected in coming weeks

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A judge in Washington on Thursday sharply questioned whether President Donald Trump's administration had authority to proceed with the construction of a $400-million White House ballroom on the site of the demolished East Wing.

At a hearing in a lawsuit brought by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon raised doubts whether Trump had statutory power to tear down the East Wing with plans to build a ballroom in its place without approval or oversight from the U.S. Congress.

Leon snapped, ""Come on, be serious"" after a lawyer for the administration drew parallels to the erection of a pool during the Gerald Ford administration in the 1970s and other smaller renovations.

Leon said he would aim to issue a ruling in the coming weeks on the National Trust's request for a preliminary injunction to stop work on the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) ballroom.

The National Trust sued Trump and several federal agencies in December, arguing the project has proceeded without required approvals, environmental review or congressional authorization.

The group says federal law bars construction on federal parkland in Washington without the express authority of Congress. It also argues the National Park Service violated federal law by issuing an environmental assessment instead of a full impact statement, and by releasing it after demolition began on the 120-year-old East Wing.

Leon in December declined to issue a temporary restraining order in the case. The White House and other federal defendants have urged the court to deny a preliminary injunction, which would force an end to construction while the lawsuit proceeds.

The administration has defended the legality of the project, arguing it followed in a long line of presidential renovations, including Franklin D. Roosevelt's construction of the East Wing itself.

The ballroom is needed for state functions, its design is still evolving, and above-ground construction is not planned until April, making an injunction unnecessary, the administration said in a court filing.

Justice Department lawyer Jacob Roth asserted at Thursday's hearing that the ballroom plans advance the public interest.

The National Capital Planning Commission held a hearing earlier this month about the ballroom plans, the first time plans for the ballroom had been discussed in a public forum. The White House submitted an application for the project to the NCPC and the Commission of Fine Arts last month.

Human Trafficking Prevention Month presents an opportunity for DHS and DOJ, through Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTF), to intensify operational efforts, raise public awareness, and strengthen partnerships across federal, state, and local agencies to disrupt trafficking networks, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure traffickers are brought to justice.

“Through the Homeland Security Task Force, President Trump is taking the fight directly to human trafficking networks and disrupting their modern-day slave trade while seizing their assets and arresting their kingpins and foot soldiers. The American people should not have to live in fear of cartels, gangbangers, and foreign terrorists preying upon the most vulnerable among us,” the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a statement. “The Homeland Security Task Force is the largest coordinated campaign against transnational criminal organizations in U.S. history, and I’m proud to co-lead it with Attorney General Bondi.”

“This Department of Justice is working tirelessly alongside our partners to dismantle human trafficking networks, help survivors, and protect vulnerable populations from being exploited,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “Under this administration we have seen an increase in human trafficking prosecutions, and during Human Trafficking Prevention Month we reaffirm our commitment to prosecuting traffickers and encourage Americans to report instances of human trafficking in their communities.”

“During Human Trafficking Prevention Month, the FBI reiterates our work with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies and national victim-based advocacy groups in joint task forces to protect our communities across the country,” said FBI Director Kash Patel. “The horrifying reach of human trafficking spreads far and wide. Homeland Security Task Forces are fighting back to disrupt these perilous networks and put a stop to that reach. The FBI will continue our investigations and bring justice to those exploited by human traffickers.”

In January 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order 14159, Protecting the American People Against Invasion. Section 6 of this order directed the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly establish HSTFs in every state nationwide. The HSTF objective is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) throughout the United States; dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks; end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children; and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States.

In January 2026, DHS and DOJ are surging resources to fight and raise awareness about human trafficking, including:

Identifying ongoing investigations and prioritizing featured operations across 45 federal locations and 10 state locations with an emphasis on border states.

Coordinating with FBI Human Trafficking Squads and multi-agency Human Trafficking Task Forces to conduct victim recovery.

Partnering with AMTRAK and FAMS to increase law enforcement resources and distribute posters with QR codes for reporting human trafficking in all station bathrooms and trains.

Running advertisements related to $250 million recovery from Backpage to distribute to victims and additional victim restitution efforts by DOL-OIG.

Organizing Human Trafficking seminars and outreach events with DHS Center for Countering Human Trafficking at high schools and colleges to highlight the role of HSTFs in addressing human trafficking.

On August 25, 2025, HSTF officially launched its effort to protect the Homeland with a September Surge encompassing 400 operations nationwide. In just 43 days, HSTF nationwide operations resulted in 3,266 arrests and seizures including:

1,041 Sinaloa members,

856 Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (“CJNG”) members,

641 MS-13 members,

456 Tren de Aragua members,

1,067 weapons,

More than $3,250,000 in currency,

Approximately 91 metric tons of narcotics.

In 2023, no habeas corpus cases related to alien detainees were filed, and in 2024, only one.

This spring, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said President Donald Trump’s administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus for immigrant detainees, pointing to the “invasion” aspect of the clause.","As changes in the immigration court system create uncertainty for detainees, immigration attorneys are now turning to a 200-year-old American legal doctrine to get their clients released from detention facilities across the country.

That doctrine, known as a writ of habeas corpus, has typically been used as a last-ditch effort to give those behind bars a chance to present their case before a federal district judge and force the government to explain why a person’s detention is legal.

Now, attorneys are using it as a fast-pass ticket to seek a district court order that forces immigration judges to grant detainees a bond hearing or order their release.

“We have no choice. We have to file a habeas,” Constance Doyle, an Illinois-based attorney representing a recently released immigrant detainee, said in an interview with The Indiana Lawyer last week.

Without a habeas corpus filing, immigration courts now routinely deny bond hearings for detainees’ potential release.

“Things have changed a lot,” Doyle said.

How it works

The legal strategy worked for Doyle’s client, Jorge Garcia Ortiz.

After nearly two months in custody, he won a court order in late December releasing him from the Indiana Department of Correction’s Miami Correctional Facility, which has a contract with the federal government to house U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.

Ortiz was detained on Nov. 5 after the vehicle he was driving on I-90 near Rockford, Illinois, was struck by an ICE vehicle, according to his attorneys and court documents.

Once Ortiz’s vehicle was forced to the side of the road, ICE officers drew their weapons and broke Ortiz’s window to forcibly remove him from the vehicle.

Ortiz was detained and taken to Broadview, Illinois, to be processed. He was then transferred to Miami Correctional Facility near Peru, Indiana.

According to court documents, Ortiz, now 38 years old, came to the U.S. from Mexico in 2000. His attorneys say he has never left the U.S. since arriving here, and he now has five children—all U.S. citizens. Ortiz also has a minor criminal record, with a burglary conviction from more than 10 years ago.

In the past, most immigrants who entered the country without inspection and were later arrested by immigration authorities were typically eligible to request a bond hearing. The immigration judge had discretion to grant bond for release if the immigrant could show they were not a danger or a flight risk.

That practice changed last fall.

On Sep. 5, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or BIA, ruled in Matter of Yajure Hurtado that individuals who entered the U.S. without inspection are not eligible for a bond hearing before an immigration judge.

Much of the debate in that case, and in the pending federal cases, was based on the interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which details rules regarding the inspection, detention and removal of noncitizens.

Specifically, the discussion hinges on which noncitizens receive mandatory detention: those actively entering the country who have not been properly admitted or those who have been living in the country for a time who were not properly admitted.

In Hurtado, the BIA concluded that both categories of noncitizens warrant mandatory detention and are exempt from bond hearings.

In that case, Hurtado, who entered the U.S. without inspection, conceded that he is an “applicant for admission” under INA § 1225. Under that section, an applicant for admission is “an alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters).”

Hurtado also argued that because he lived inside the U.S. for almost three years, he cannot be considered as one “seeking admission,” a specific category of applicant for admission in § 1225 who “shall be detained.”

The BIA determined in its Sep. 5 ruling that Hurtado’s argument creates a “legal conundrum.”

“If he is not admitted to the United States (as he admits) but he is not ‘seeking admission’ (as he contends), then what is his legal status?” BIA stated. “The respondent provides no legal authority for the proposition that after some undefined period of time residing in the interior of the United States without lawful status, the INA provides that an applicant for admission is no longer ‘seeking admission,’ and has somehow converted to a status that renders him or her eligible for a bond hearing under section 236(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1226(a).”

Because of the BIA’s conclusions in Hurtado, when noncitizen detainees come before an immigration judge to consider bond hearings, the judge must deny jurisdiction in the matter. This means the detainee must remain in custody while their removal case proceeds.

Some federal district court judges in Indiana have consistently disagreed with the government’s stance and are overturning immigration judges’ rulings on denying bond hearings.

James Hanlon, a district court judge for the Southern District of Indiana, ruled in a recent habeas case that § 1225 applies to “arriving” noncitizens attempting to enter the country and not those undocumented immigrants who have lived in the interior of the U.S. for years.

He said the government’s interpretation of the statute “disregards” the plain meaning of § 1225 and is “inconsistent with decades of prior statutory interpretation and practice.”

A surge in filings

The BIA is an administrative body within the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review that reviews immigration judge decisions and determines precedent that is binding on all immigration judges—unless overruled by a federal court.

(The Executive Office for Immigration Review declined to comment on litigation-related matters for this story.)

The board shrank earlier this year from 28 to 15 members, following an April 2025 DOJ order. Nearly all of the board’s current members were appointed by conservative attorneys general. William Barr, President Donald Trump’s attorney general from his first administration, appointed five of the current members, and current Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed eight.

Since the BIA’s Hurtado ruling altered the course for many detainees, the country, and specifically Indiana, has seen a surge in habeas cases.

Although the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana declined to comment on the surge in habeas petitions, citing active and pending litigation, it did provide data detailing the number of petitions filed in the court over the last three years.

In 2023, no habeas corpus cases related to alien detainees were filed, and in 2024, only one. However, from Jan. 14, 2025, to Jan. 14, 2026, there were 93 cases filed.

An official with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana did not respond to requests for comment.

Nationally, information clearinghouse Habeas Dockets LLC reports more than 9,500 immigration-related habeas corpus filings are pending in federal district courts.

To Doyle, there is a clear reason why habeas filings are racking up now.

“We never had to do this before,” she said. “We didn’t even do habeas cases until this (Trump) administration took over.”

What is habeas corpus

Habeas corpus is a Latin phrase meaning “you should have the body.” In short, it means a judge must have any person who has been detained brought into the courtroom so that the legality of his or her detention can be reviewed.

A writ of habeas corpus, or a judicial order instructing law enforcement to produce a detainee, has been embedded in U.S. legal doctrine for over 200 years and is protected under the U.S. Constitution.

“The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it,” Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states.

This spring, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said President Donald Trump’s administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus for immigrant detainees, pointing to the “invasion” aspect of the clause.

Habeas corpus has been suspended four times in the country, all of which were related to wartime; it was most recently suspended in Hawaii in 1941 by President Franklin Roosevelt, following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The current administration has made no formal attempts to suspend the statute—which can only be done through congressional approval—so federal courts are reviewing these petitions and sometimes ordering immigration judges to allow detainees bond hearings or be released from custody.

Ongoing challenges

“All parties must play by the rules. The same wisdom that requires immigrants and noncitizens to follow the law equally requires the government to follow the law,” U.S. District Judge Damon Leichty of Northern Indiana wrote, in a Dec. 30, 2025, order granting Ortiz’s writ of habeas corpus and ordering his release from ICE custody.

Nearly two months after he was detained, Ortiz was released from the Miami Correctional Facility. But not every case moves at the same pace as his.

Vincent Olson, a lawyer in Doyle’s law office, said they had one client who was detained in Illinois at 9 a.m. and had filed a habeas petition in an Illinois federal court by 3 p.m. that afternoon.

But by that time, the client was already in transit, going through Iowa to Texas—one example of how difficult it is to track the whereabouts of some detainees.

“It’s been a little bit over a month, and we’re not even in the court yet,” Olson said. “So we’ve been trying to expedite the process by trying to do things as soon as they happen.”•",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ICE-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-23 15:58:45.974793

Under Minnesota law, the state’s Department of Corrections must notify ICE officials when an immigrant convicted of a felony is set to be released.
How do other Minnesota county jails handle ICE?","The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests in Minnesota and clashes between federal agents and residents.

But swirling beneath the surface of the tense, sometimes chaotic scenes playing out across the state is a political dispute over how local officials handle the cases of immigrants who are being held in state prisons and county jails.

Federal officials have suggested that they might wind down their campaign if Democratic leaders like Gov. Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey would give them access to the people subject to deportation in Minnesota’s prisons and jails.

“Let us in the damn jail,” Tom Homan, the White House’s border czar, said recently. “Frey and Walz could fix this today.”

The Department of Homeland Security has asserted that Mr. Walz and Mr. Frey are shielding 1,360 immigrants charged with crimes who are subject to deportation, though it did not explain how it came to that conclusion. But state and local officials dispute the claim.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections said the number of incarcerated people that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has identified as being subject to deportation was slightly over 300 as of last Monday. The department also says the Trump administration is misrepresenting how Minnesota jails and prisons assist in immigration matters.

In Minnesota, officials say that state prisons have long released inmates subject to deportation to federal immigration officials after their sentences end. Mr. Frey has no authority over Minnesota’s county jails, which have a patchwork of policies on the issue. Some counties explicitly cooperate with federal authorities, and at least one, Hennepin, the state’s most populous county, refrains from assisting ICE agents as a matter of policy.

Nationally, the degree to which local law enforcement officials overseeing prisons and jails are willing to cooperate with immigration enforcement has long been a thorny issue.

Under Minnesota law, the state’s Department of Corrections must notify ICE officials when an immigrant convicted of a felony is set to be released. The agency, overseen by Governor Walz, says that it has long coordinated with ICE agents to transfer custody of those who are subject to deportation.

Last year, prison officials turned over to ICE 84 inmates who had finished sentences and were leaving the state prison system, according to the state agency.

Paul Schnell, the commissioner of the state’s Department of Corrections, said he and other state officials had struggled to get clear answers from the administration about the specific steps the White House would like them to take.

“We would certainly like to be in a place where we could offer things that may be useful and relevant and serve the interest of ICE,” Mr. Schnell said.

He said that some of the people federal officials have publicly highlighted as having been arrested during the crackdown were actually transferred directly from prisons with assistance from the state.

Does Minneapolis cooperate with ICE?

Minneapolis, the state’s largest city, has a policy barring municipal officials, including police officers, from asking residents about their immigration status, with rare exceptions. City officials said the policy was aimed at building trust between the police and immigrants.

“I recognize that the fear of deportation prevents some people from calling police in times of need or to report crime,” Chief Brian O’Hara of the Minneapolis police said in a statement explaining the policy.

Mayor Frey said that the city’s policy has no effect on inmates. “At the city level, we do not have authority over jails and prisons — period,” he said.

What about the jail in Minneapolis?

That partnership ended after Rich Stanek, a former Hennepin County sheriff who ran the jail for 12 years, was voted out of office in 2018. His successor, Dave Hutchinson, gradually ceased sharing information with ICE, meeting a campaign promise he had made.

Mr. Hutchinson contended that close cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE undermined public safety because it made undocumented immigrants reluctant to report crimes. Mr. Stanek maintained that his approach had kept dangerous criminals from being released from custody back onto the streets.

“Our job is to keep communities safe,” Mr. Stanek said. “That was, pure and simple, keeping communities safe.”

The newer policy — to refrain from cooperating with ICE — has continued since the 2022 election of the current sheriff, Dawanna Witt. Sheriff Witt declined a request for an interview.

How do other Minnesota county jails handle ICE?

Sheriffs in at least seven of Minnesota’s 87 counties have signed agreements to collaborate with ICE on immigration enforcement.

Under those partnerships, jail officials are trained to identify people who are in the country unlawfully and to share that information with federal agents to help facilitate deportations.

A few jails in the state have contracts providing beds for immigrants in ICE custody.

But most Minnesota sheriffs lack explicit policies on the issue, said Linus Chan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who specializes in the intersection of criminal and immigration law. The extent to which jail officials help transfer people into ICE custody varies widely and relies mainly on individual relationships between local and federal officials.

“From my understanding, only a few sheriff offices even have a policy written down,” Mr. Chan said. “They like to have that flexibility.”

Why are some sheriffs reluctant to help ICE?

ICE routinely asks jail officials to notify the agency about the imminent release of a person subject to deportation by issuing a document known as a detainer. Detainers request that jail officials continue to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily be released.

Questions about the legal authority local officials have to detain people at the request of ICE have led to two lawsuits in the state in recent years.

Anoka County, a suburb of Minneapolis, was ordered to pay $30,000 in 2021 after a federal jury found that local officials had exceeded their authority when they detained a woman from Mexico for several hours after she was involved in a collision.

The following year, Nobles County agreed to pay a $200,000 settlement after a class-action lawsuit brought by individuals who accused the local sheriff of holding them unlawfully based on ICE requests.

“Sheriffs are generally worried about liability and wanting to follow the law,” said Sandra Feist, a Democratic state lawmaker who is also an immigration lawyer.

Still, several sheriffs say they regularly provide ICE with information about inmates the agency intends to take into custody. Some say ICE agents are not always available to pick up someone on short notice after an inmate has posted bail or been released by a judge for other reasons.

Micinski",,,,,https://theconversation.com/ice-immigration-tactics-are-shocking-more-americans-as-us-mexico-border-operations-move-north-273741,"Historically, the country’s militarized immigration enforcement practices have played out closer to the U.S.-Mexico border.
And for decades, agents with Customs and Border Protection have carried out most deportations near the border, not ICE.
But Trump during his second presidency has greatly shifted immigration enforcement north into the interior of the U.S. And ICE has played a central role.
DHS has 22 agencies, including three that focus on immigration: Customs and Border Protection, ICE and U.S.
Roughly $67 billion goes toward immigration enforcement at the border, including border wall construction.","Over the past year, images of masked, heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arresting men, women and children – outside of courts, at schools and homes – have become common across the United States.

The video of an ICE agent shooting and killing Renee Nicole Good – a U.S. citizen – in Minnesota on Jan. 7, 2026, is one example of the brazen, sometimes deadly tactics that the agency employs.

Part of the reason why recent ICE tactics have shocked Americans is because most people haven’t seen them before. Historically, the country’s militarized immigration enforcement practices have played out closer to the U.S.-Mexico border. And for decades, agents with Customs and Border Protection have carried out most deportations near the border, not ICE.

From 2010-2020, nearly 80% of all deportations were initiated at or near the U.S.-Mexico border. During the COVID-19 pandemic, that number jumped to 98%, as both the Trump and Biden administrations utilized Title 42, a public health statute that allowed the government to rapidly deport recently arrived migrants.

But Trump during his second presidency has greatly shifted immigration enforcement north into the interior of the U.S. And ICE has played a central role.

As international migration and human rights scholars, we have examined recent federal immigration policy to determine why ICE has become the main agency detaining and deporting migrants as far away from the southern border as snowy Minnesota.

And we have also explored how the transition in immigration control from the southern border to more Americans’ front lawns could be shifting the public’s views on deportation tactics.

Migration as a threat

ICE is a relatively new agency. The 2002 Homeland Security Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, created the Department of Homeland Security, known as DHS, by merging the U.S. Customs Service – previously under Treasury Department control – and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, formerly under the Justice Department.

DHS has 22 agencies, including three that focus on immigration: Customs and Border Protection, ICE and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which manages legal immigration and naturalization.

There is no inherent reason that immigration enforcement should fall under homeland security. But immigration was deemed a national security matter by the George W. Bush administration after 9/11.

In a 2002 presidential briefing justifying DHS’s creation, Bush said, “The changing nature of the threats facing America requires a new government structure to protect against invisible enemies that can strike with a wide variety of weapons.”

The U.S. government has viewed immigration from this national security perspective ever since.

The full impact of the deportations

The Trump administration in early 2025 set a goal of deporting 1 million people during its first year.

But with so few crossings, and thus deportations, at the U.S.-Mexico border, the administration instead has focused its efforts on the U.S. interior.

Trump’s 2025 tax and budget bill reflected this reprioritization, allocating US$170 billion over four years to immigration enforcement, compared to approximately $30 billion allocated in 2024.

Roughly $67 billion goes toward immigration enforcement at the border, including border wall construction. But the largest percentage of the bill’s immigration funding – at least $75 billion – goes toward arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants already living in the U.S.

The Trump administration did not initiate deportations from the U.S. interior. They have formed part of other administration’s policies, both Democratic and Republican.

Interior border enforcement increased under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s with the introduction of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which widened the criteria for deportations. And former President Barack Obama was referred to as the “Deporter in Chief” after his administration carried out more than 3 million deportations over his two terms, with roughly 69% of deportations occurring at the border.

But the astronomical growth of government funding toward migration control – at the border and in the U.S. – got the country to where it is today.

Between fiscal year 2003 and 2024, for example, Congress allocated approximately $24 toward immigration enforcement carried out by ICE and CBP for every $1 spent on the immigration court system that handles asylum claims.

The new money allocated under the 2025 budget bill, and the reprioritization of immigration enforcement from the border to the interior, partly explains why Americans are now seeing the long-term consequences of border militarization play out directly in their communities.

Americans may not know about the experiences of migrants who are quickly deported near the border, but it is harder to ignore recent images of people snatched up within their own neighborhoods.

Now the visible targets of border enforcement are increasingly immigrants who have built their lives in the U.S. – neighbors, friends, co-workers – as well as anyone who opposes ICE’s tactics, like Renee Good.

Changing political attitudes

In fact, the violence of Trump’s mass deportation campaign may be changing how Americans view immigration.

Just before the 2024 presidential election, a Gallup Poll found that 28% of Americans believed that immigration was the most important problem facing the nation – the highest percentage since Gallup began tracking the topic in 1981. This number dropped to 19% in December 2025, reflecting how more Americans see immigration as a routine issue that the government can manage rather than a crisis that needs to be dealt with.

This is supported in the academic literature. Migration scholars have shown that voters often support strict immigration policies in the voting booth but resist and protest when governments attempt to implement those policies in organized immigrant communities.

In 2002, for example, migration scholar Antje Ellermann documented that immigration officers reported it was more difficult to detain and deport people in Miami – because of resistance by a politicized immigrant community – compared to relatively conservative and less organized communities in San Diego.

But in both places, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were influential in intervening in individual cases to prevent deportations. This is because senior immigration officials, Ellermann noted, were influenced by media attention and pressure by members of Congress to grant relief.

Support for Trump’s handling of immigration is trending downward. Only 41% of Americans approved of Trump’s approach to immigration as of early January 2026, compared to 51% in March of last year, according to CNN polling.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/714192/original/file-20260123-66-q7nd0h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C288%2C3450%2C1725&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-23 15:58:03.318850

Those in attendance told NEWS CENTER Maine they believed ICE agents were staying at the hotel based on several reports, including from an employee. NEWS CENTER Maine is working to independently confirm that claim.

Roughly 75 people rallied outside the building for about an hour, holding signs and making banging noises.

A NEWS CENTER Maine crew at the scene observed Portland police arrive and warn protesters that anyone making noise would face arrest. At about 10:50 p.m., police gave four warnings, and one male individual was arrested.

Shortly before 11 p.m., protesters began dispersing, but about 50 still remained at the corner of Hancock Street and Fore Street where police had gathered and the man arrested was being held, according to the crew at the scene.

Shortly after 11 p.m., the man arrested was later released, with a summons order for early March.

The protest follows news that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, which officials say has led to about 100 arrests so far.

On Thursday, masked agents in police vests detained Juan Sebastian Carvajal-Munoz, a Colombian civil engineer on a work visa in Portland. He has no criminal record, making him at least the third person detained in Maine under the operation without a known criminal history.

The day before, agents detained Micheline Ntumba, a Portland resident, after she dropped off one of her children at Portland High School. Her daughter said agents followed Ntumba to her apartment, took her phone and wallet, and put her in a vehicle without showing ID or explaining why. Ntumba has no criminal record and has a pending asylum application.

Portland Mayor Mark Dion and Maine U.S. independent Sen. Angus King held a press conference on Thursday, calling for more transparency from ICE regarding the identities and reasons for arrests.

Jeannie Norris says it's hard to see El Paso at the center of recent events.","EL PASO - Once a flashpoint in the heated debate over high immigration flows, this city is now a hub for detentions and deportations – with more mega-facilities in the works as the Trump administration tries to ramp up massive deportations.

This week, the El Paso County Medical Examiner ruled the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, a Cuban immigrant at a tent camp, was a homicide, a finding bound to intensify calls for a shutdown at what's become the nation's largest immigration detention facility.

In total, in just the last six weeks, three men have died at the $1.2 billion privately operated Camp East Montana located at Fort Bliss army base. The average daily population at the end of November was nearly 2,800 people and is likely higher now. The Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, did not respond to a request for the current number of people detained at the camp. Immigrants picked up by the DHS agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, across the country are held at the tent facility pending deportation.

The medical examiner's findings shed a broader light on issues of oversight and return a harsh focus to El Paso.

""Witnesses claim staff killed the detainee; DHS must preserve all evidence - including halting their effort to deport the witnesses,"" said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso. ""I reiterate my call for Camp East Montana to be shut down and for the contract with the corporation running it to be terminated.""

The federal government has consistently denied abuse allegations and says ICE is committed to ensuring all those in custody reside in a ""safe, secure and humane environment.""

Testing Ground

El Paso has long served as a testing ground for everything from facial recognition biometrics to drones to license plate readers - tactics now seen throughout the country, from Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis. The El Paso region, not new to the U.S. long history of deportations, was also the location of other controversial tent camps, including a notorious site that held minors. In 2018 and 2019, a migrant camp in Tornillo for children swelled to more than 2,500.

But the political theater, as locals refer to the whims of Washington, is back. Until recently, immigrant raids were rare. In recent days, however, several videos on social media platforms show ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents picking up workers in construction sites, putting a city that's more than 80 percent Hispanic, on edge.

Controlled explosions near Mount Cristo Rey, with its towering and iconic sculpture of Jesus Christ on the cross, have gone off as the Trump administration prepares the foundation for a new 1.3-mile wall. Despite the construction, crossings of migrants have dropped significantly.

Now a new detention center is planned in El Paso County, with funds from Trump's tax and spending package that includes an estimated $45 billion for ICE detention centers and tens of billions more for additional law enforcement.

""What we are seeing with the system right now is truly unprecedented,"" said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a lawyer and senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, at a recent webinar on detentions. ""It's expanding more quickly. There is no sense of basic humanity of the people going through the system, and the basic underlying rules of due process are being tossed out.""

Reichlin-Melnick called the El Paso County medical examiner's finding probably the first-ever homicide in ICE detention.

Escobar and 122 Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation last December to create enhanced oversight for detention centers and phase out private contractors over three years.

Rapid Expansion

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed plans to expand detention space across the country. ""These will not be warehouses — they will be very well-structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards,""a DHS spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""It should not come as news that ICE will be making arrests in states across the U.S. and is actively working to expand detention space.""

An ICE spokesman also said they wouldn't confirm specific locations, including one in Dallas County.

Detentions have reached historic highs of 70,000 at about 200 U.S. facilities, stretching from the state of Washington to California, Texas to Georgia, according to ICE data.

""There will be more deaths, there will be more harm,"" said Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center here in El Paso. ""This is not an anomaly. Unless ICE changes course, there's more oversight, there's more accountability and there's more protection of people in detention.""

In Dallas County, another possible detention facility off a highway could hold nearly 10,000. The prospect has galvanized Texans there against it, too.

The Washington Post reported details in December about a draft solicitation for renovating industrial warehouses to hold up to 80,000 persons. One of them is believed to be in Hutchins, a suburb of about 8,000 persons, according to Census Bureau estimates.

""We are horrified by the fact this is going to be in our backyard,"" said Rev. Eric Folkerth, a Methodist minister who leads an interfaith group defending immigrants and holding vigils at an orange-brick ICE field office in Dallas. ""We are planning resistance from our churches and have spoken to other county officials who are equally disturbed.""

Folkerth said he believes the massive ICE detention center could open based on conversations his clergy group has had with government and private officials.

The site sits sandwiched by a noisy highway and a Federal Express distribution hub and budget hotels. The empty blue and white warehouse looks like the length of a large mall and advertises its size at 1 mm square feet.

Recent Deaths

Human rights organizations and lawyers in contact with people at the El Paso tent facility have been sounding the alarm for months and documented cases of medical neglect, unsanitary conditions, lack of food and abuse at the facility.

""The medical examiners report that Geraldo's death was a homicide completely dispels the government's claim that this was a suicide,"" said Charlotte Weiss, staff attorney based in El Paso with the Texas Civil Rights Project. Weiss regularly visits people detained at Camp East Montana and says she and other partners have documented cases of ""excessive use of force.""

DHS officials have said Lunas Campos tried to take his own life and ""violently resisted security staff when they intervened to save him."" And during the struggle, a DHS spokesperson said he stopped breathing and lost consciousness.

DHS says his death is under investigation. At the same time the federal government is trying to deport two detainees quoted in news reports saying they witnessed Lunas Campos in an altercation with staff when he died. Lawyers for the men, a Salvadoran and a Cuban, are trying to extend an injunction to keep them in this country until they can give depositions.

When ICE officials reported his death they also cited Lunas Campos' criminal record. He had been convicted of driving while intoxicated, criminal possession of a weapon, petit larceny, and other crimes.

In another death at the El Paso tent camp on Jan. 14, ICE officials reported Victor Manuel Diaz of Nicaragua, died by ""presumed suicide."" The official cause of his death remains under investigation, ICE said. The man had been detained in Minneapolis, where widespread protests have been held since Renee Good, a U.S. citizen, was fatally shot by an ICE agent on Jan. 7.

A third man, Francisco Gaspar Andres from Guatemala, died in December at an El Paso hospital where he was transported for a serious medical condition.

Protests Grow

There have been multiple protests outside the detention camp in Fort Bliss since it opened in August and a vigil recently for the men who died in custody.

Jeannie Norris says it's hard to see El Paso at the center of recent events.

""I am so shocked what's happening in our country,"" she said, one of dozens of El Pasoans at a recent vigil. ""...and it's close to home and you have a big detention center right in your hometown which is an international city, which has always loved immigrants before, and we treat them so badly, it's heartbreaking.""

Rebecca Krasne, another El Paso resident, added, ""We have to voice our condemnation of these acts and our total distrust of our government, and come together and be strong and powerful in our voice to try to do what we can to stop this madness.""

Much of the trauma for immigrant families, particularly women, is unseen, said Anthony Lazon, the founder of the social justice group Dallas For Change. ""They are forcing these women to self-deport,"" said Lazon, who often assists families whose loved ones are detained. ""These tactics force these women into life-threatening situations where they have to fend for themselves….A lot of these people are following the legal process. Asylum is the legal process.""

As so many see video of violent arrests and the fatal death of Good in Minneapolis, polls show declining support for the crackdown.

Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the Twin Cities for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.

Organizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses across the state have closed for the day in solidarity with the protest — from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.

""We're achieving something historic,"" said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 groups that is mobilizing. The demonstration coincides with a blast of cold air hitting the Upper Midwest and ahead of a severe winter storm that is expected to affect millions.

On Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative from that of a 5-year-old boy taken by ICE officers in Minneapolis by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.

On Thursday, a prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people were arrested for their involvement in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a Sunday service at a church in St. Paul. They remained in federal custody Friday morning.

Organizers hope Friday's mobilization will be the largest coordinated protest action to date, with a march in downtown Minneapolis planned for Friday afternoon. Earlier Friday, the temperature in Minneapolis was minus 21 with a wind chill of minus 40.

Havelin compared the presence of immigration officers in Minnesota to the winter weather warnings.

""Minnesotans understand that when we're in a snow emergency … we all have to respond and it makes us do things differently,"" she said. ""And what's happening with ICE in our community, in our state, means that we can't respond as business as usual.""

Somali businesses, especially, have lost sales during the enforcement surge as workers and customers, fearing detention, stay at home.

Many schools were planning to close on Friday, but cited different reasons. The University of Minnesota and the St. Paul public school district said there would be no in-person classes because of the extreme cold. Minneapolis Public Schools were scheduled to be closed ""for a teacher record-keeping day.""

Clergy planned to join the march, as well as hold prayer services and fasting, according to a delegation of representatives of faith traditions, including Buddhist, Jewish, Lutheran and Muslim.

Bishop Dwayne Royster, leader of the progressive organization Faith in Action, arrived in Minnesota on Wednesday from Washington, D.C.

""We want ICE out of Minnesota,"" he said. ""We want them out of all the cities around the country where they're exercising extreme overreach.""

Royster said at least 50 of his network's faith-based organizers were joining the protest. About 10 were traveling from Los Angeles while others from the same group planned a solidarity rally in California, said one of the organizers there.

It is designed to connect vulnerable Mainers with resources and to track the movements and actions of federal immigration agents.
“We’ve seen ICE agents separating mothers from young children without any empathy or any respect for the rule of law,” Mills said.","A wave of federal immigration enforcement in Maine that has been marked by sharp political polarization and a sense of fear in some communities entered its fourth day Friday.

Gov. Janet Mills, who has strongly criticized the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, issued a call for Congress to curtail funding for the agency “until they stop their aggressive tactics.” Sen. Angus King also suggested not funding ICE’s budget going forward and said he is considering pressing for federal agents to be required to wear body cameras and remove masks.

Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce confirmed ICE moved all of its detainees out of the county jail after he questioned the agency’s tactics, calling officers’ actions during the arrest of a county corrections officer “bush-league policing.” York County Sheriff William King also spoke out after confirming that one of his county’s corrections officers was also detained, saying that it doesn’t appear that agents are truly targeting “the worst of the worst,” as they have said.

Meanwhile, Republican leaders have called on Democrats to temper their rhetoric. And conservative Mainers told our reporters this week that many of them welcome what the Trump administration has dubbed “Operation Catch of the Day,” though some also expressed reservations about agents’ tactics.

4:30 p.m.: Federal agents apprehend man, transfer him into a vehicle at Maine Mall

Sirens, honking and whistles sounded off in a parking lot at the Maine Mall in South Portland around 3:45 p.m. Friday as about a dozen people watched an apparent federal immigration arrest unfold.

According to witnesses, people who appeared to be federal law enforcement officers apprehended a man near the Hannaford and TJMaxx and put him into their vehicle, a minivan with out-of-state plates.

A reporter at the scene saw at least one person who appeared to be a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Nearby, the crowd blew their whistles and honked their car horns.

The minivan drove away with the man inside, then pulled into the nearby JCPenney parking lot, where three additional vehicles surrounded it.

4:20 p.m.: Maine Med nurse says apparent ICE agent taunted her, said he would target families

Kelli Brennan, a neurotrauma nurse at Maine Medical Center, said in an interview Friday that she was driving to work Thursday morning when she noticed potential federal immigration enforcement activity on Forest Avenue in Portland. She said she saw a few cars surrounding another vehicle and what looked like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents standing around.

Brennan parked across the street and began recording the encounter with her cellphone, at which point the agents pointed their flashlights at her, indicating that they knew she was recording them. Brennan said she was driving a co-worker who is an immigrant to work, so she immediately left, not wanting to put her fellow employee in danger.

But someone she believes was an ICE agent followed her in a blue Subaru, rolled down his window and taunted her, calling her a “Karen.” Brennan said she rolled down her window and exchanged words with the man.

“I told them we didn’t want them here and said, ‘You can get the (expletive) out,” Brennan said. “He said, ‘Well, you can get the (expletive) out.’ Then he said, ‘I’m going to arrest three more families in Maine just for you.’

“It was so surreal to see that much anger,” Brennan added. “They are here just to terrorize. No police officer would do what he did.”

After the exchange, Brennan said the man left, and she continued to work.

Brennan said she’s noticed some of the housekeeping and janitorial staff, some of whom are immigrants, have called off work because they are fearful of ICE. A spokesperson for Maine Med operator MaineHealth said in a statement earlier Friday that the health system is experiencing some work callouts, as well as patient cancellations, because of the uptick in ICE activity.

Maine Med employees have been giving rides and delivering groceries to immigrant workers and their families so they don’t have to leave home, said Brennan, a union representative with the Maine State Nurses’ Association.

“ICE has no place in Maine,” said Brennan, of Saco. “These immigrants aren’t criminals. These are our friends and neighbors, part of our community.”

4:10 p.m.: U.S. Attorney’s Office says ICE violated court order by transferring detainees from Cumberland County Jail

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maine said Friday afternoon that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement violated a federal judge’s order by moving a woman detained in Portland out of state Thursday night.

Abigail Lima Da Silva O’Leary was one of roughly 50 ICE detainees who were transferred from the Cumberland County Jail around 6 p.m. Thursday night, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lizotte confirmed in court records.

The transfer came hours after Sheriff Kevin Joyce criticized ICE for how it arrested a county corrections officer earlier this week, calling the apprehension “bush league.”

Lizotte said the transfer was “in violation of the Court’s prior order,” which temporarily barred ICE from moving O’Leary, who has filed a petition in federal court arguing that her detention is unconstitutional.

Lizotte said federal prosecutors, who represent ICE in court, were not made aware of the transfers until after the fact.

Almost three hours after O’Leary was moved, Lizotte said ICE had his office file an emergency motion requesting the transfer because ICE “can no longer house immigration detainees at the Cumberland County Jail, and there is no additional bed space in Maine in which to house petitioner.”

Lizotte said ICE’s decision to “no longer house immigration detainees at the Cumberland County Jail” was not known to him until Friday afternoon.

4 p.m.: Maine AFL-CIO President condemns ICE raids

The president of the Maine AFL-CIO on Friday decried recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on Maine workplaces as “an attack on all workers.”

In a written statement, Cynthia Phinney said workers of color throughout the state are afraid to go to their jobs, take their children to school or go to the store. The AFL-CIO represents more than 200 unions and 42,000 workers throughout the state.

“Everyone in this country should have the right to go to work and return safely to their loved ones at the end of the day without fear of violence, especially not violence perpetrated by their own government,” Phinney said.

Phinney said the name “Operation Catch of the Day,” as federal officials have dubbed it, is dehumanizing. She charged that ICE agents are subjecting immigrants to the “same kind of terror and violence” many of them fled in their home countries.

“We stand strongly opposed to the Trump administration’s deportation of workers to dangerous prisons, stripping workers of their citizenship and other permits, and shooting innocent people for exercising their constitutionally protected right to protest,” she said. “An injury to one of us is an injury to us all.”

3:15 p.m.: York County sheriff says ICE arrested a corrections officer outside immigration appointment

A York County Jail corrections officer was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement outside a scheduled immigration appointment in Scarborough this week, York County Sheriff William King said Friday.

The officer, who King declined to name, had passed a criminal background check and federal verification before being hired. King described him as “a contributing and valued member of the staff” at the jail, which is currently experiencing a staffing shortage.

“To the best of our knowledge this individual has never committed any type of crime that would result in the revocation of his legal status,” King said in a written statement Friday afternoon. “From York County’s perspective, it never received any notification on whether there had been a change in his status.”

King noted that York County “supports local and federal law enforcement in their various missions,” but he said ICE was falling short of its promises to specifically target violent criminals rather.

“While enforcement actions are being promoted as targeting the ‘worst of the worst’ the reality appears far more complicated,” he said. “Changes in immigration policy have redefined who is considered lawfully present in the United States.”

3:10 p.m.: South Portland Mexican restaurants temporarily closes

Tres Leches Cake’s Flor, a Mexican restaurant in South Portland, will be closed indefinitely to protect vulnerable community members, according to Rachel Gavilan, the daughter of the owner.

A lot of their customers are Latino, Gavilan said.

“We don’t want to put anybody at risk,” she said. “It’s not safe to be out right now.”

Jose Franco, the owner’s brother, and Gavilan went to check the mailbox of the business Friday.

“We want to wait and see how it’s going to be,” Franco said.

Franco has lived in South Portland for decades, but he’s started carrying his passport in his pocket, just in case. He said people are being stopped and taken regardless of status, and that’s terrifying.

“They’re looking for any excuse to take you,” he said. “The color of your skin. An accent.”

Tres Leches was also closed during its normal hours Wednesday and Thursday. A small crowd of about 20 people formed outside the restaurant Thursday morning after witnesses reported seeing a vehicle with apparent federal agents parked nearby.

3 p.m.: Lawyers march in protest of ‘unlawful’ ICE arrests

A couple dozen lawyers and other legal advocates marched through Portland’s Bayside neighborhood Friday afternoon to protest what they say have been unlawful arrests in Maine by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Advertisement

The march was organized by Maine Lawyers for the Rule of Law, a group that has organized other events to raise awareness for the ways that it believes the Trump administration has attacked the “rule of law,” the democratic principle that people are accountable to publicly enacted laws that are equally enforced and consistent with human rights. Those events have included protests across from the courthouse and a forum at the University of Southern Maine campus in September.

“Lawyers are officers of the justice system,” said attorney David Webbert, a member of the group. “This is not normal, this is outrageous, and Mainers need to know that lawyers recognize that.”

Webbert said the group is concerned by increased ICE arrests and activity in Maine, which he said has included targeting people based on their race and appearance, entering homes without judicial warrants and using excessive force. He said that he is planning to sue ICE under the Federal Tort Claims Act for alleged wrongdoing by a federal agency.

Webbert said he was also concerned by news Friday that ICE had moved roughly 50 detainees from the Cumberland County Jail in Portland, hours after the sheriff overseeing the jail criticized ICE agents who forcefully arrested a corrections officer.

Court records show that a federal judge had temporarily barred the federal government from moving at least four of these detainees out of Maine.

Neither ICE nor the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maine has explained yet in court why the detainees were moved or whether they consider this a violation of court orders.

“They don’t care about following court orders,” Webbert said. “They’re just mad at the sheriff; they want to punish him.”

The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not respond Friday afternoon to a request to discuss those transfers.

2:40 p.m.: Federal agents arrested 6 restaurant workers in coordinated visits to 2 locations, manager says

Federal immigration agents arrested three staff members each from Kobe Japanese Restaurant’s locations in South Portland and Biddeford on Thursday morning, according to a restaurant manager.

Immigration agents arrived at the Biddeford location as staff were just arriving for the day before 11 a.m. Thursday, said the manager on duty Friday, who requested anonymity because she was concerned for her safety. She said agents arrived at the South Portland location around that same time.

The manager said the agents requested proof of citizenship from everyone present and did not offer a specific explanation for the arrests. Among those taken were immigrants from China and Latin America, she said.

“All we know is that they are legal to work,” she said. “It’s hard to open a business right now. You’re basically targeted.”

Two kitchen staff and a hibachi chef were among those taken, leaving the businesses “severely short-staffed,” she said. On Friday, the South Portland location was closed and some of its staff moved to Biddeford — allowing one location to operate despite the staffing issues, she said. No one answered the phone at the South Portland location Friday afternoon.

At least one customer, in a post on social media, reported having a reservation canceled due to the staffing shortages.

In June, masked Border Patrol agents arrested three workers from Kobe’s Bangor location as part of what officials called a “worksite enforcement operation,” the Bangor Daily News reported.

ICE spokespeople did not immediately return emailed questions about who was arrested, why they were taken or why the agency targeted the restaurants.

2:30 p.m.: Sen. King suggests immigration agents should be required to remove masks, wear body cameras

U.S. Sen. Angus King said Friday that he is considering whether Congress could require federal immigration agents to remove masks and use body cameras as part of budget talks next week.

King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, was speaking at the Maine Outdoor Economy Summit in Portland. More than 400 people gathered to talk about the state’s outdoor recreation sector, but anxiety about the surge in federal immigration agents in the city bubbled up continuously throughout the conference.

King spent more than 45 minutes in conversation about land conservation and national parks with Carrie Besnette Hauser from the Trust for Public Land and Whitney Potter Schwartz of Outdoor Recreation Roundtable — but most questions from the audience were about ICE.

“Many of us in this room are acutely aware right now that the outdoors is not safe or accessible to a great deal of our citizenry,” one audience member asked. “And I was just wondering what you would be willing to do to protect the citizens of Maine from the great overreach by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to make it safe for our citizens.”

Applause met the question. King replied by echoing remarks he made at a news conference Thursday in Portland, saying that federal immigration agents are “terrorizing” people in Maine.

“We could perhaps not fund the ICE budget, and they still have what was passed last summer,” King said. “That’s something I’m trying to determine with the leadership of the Appropriations Committee as to what can we do.”

King also said he was still trying to get more information from ICE about its operations in Maine.

A staffer told a Press Herald reporter that the senator was not available for an interview after the discussion.

Another guest at the conference took the mic to say that he previously worked in immigration enforcement but questioned federal agents’ current tactics.

“They need to remove their masks,” he told King. “We didn’t wear masks. We didn’t dress up in combat gear. We didn’t shoot people in the face, point blank, with pepper balls, which is deadly force.”

“I’m starting to think the fear and intimidation is the point,” King said.

“It is the point,” the man replied. “It’s very intentional.”

2 p.m.: Maine ICE watchers say federal agents are threatening them for documenting activity

Greater Portland residents who have been driving around the area this week to monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity and document enforcement efforts in their cities say they have been threatened by federal agents.

The volunteers in Maine say agents have started showing up at their homes and intimidating them or threatening arrest. Some of them, masked and wearing tactical gear, have issued stark warnings not to follow them.

Advocates began preparing for potential large-scale ICE activity in Maine back in September. On Tuesday, when the federal operation officially began, they started driving around the city on a daily basis.

There are similar groups in other communities all over Maine and the U.S. that are set up to monitor ICE activity, especially in the mornings and afternoons, when children are going to school or coming home.

“ This was not about law enforcement doing their job. This was about a federal agent using intimidation to discourage lawful civic activity in my own community,” said Erin Cavallaro, one of the volunteers in Maine who said officers came to her home. “What I was doing was lawful.”

Another volunteer, Bob Peck, said he followed an SUV that left the ICE detention center in Scarborough on Thursday and was confronted by the men in the vehicle, who told him he was impeding federal law enforcement. When Peck said he was only observing, they threatened to arrest him.

1 p.m.: Some MaineHealth workers are staying home because of ICE fears, but operations continuing as normal, spokesperson says

John Porter, a MaineHealth spokesperson, said in a statement Friday that the health system is experiencing some work callouts and patient cancellations caused by the ramped-up ICE enforcement this week, but not enough to disrupt operations. The largest health system in the state operates Maine Medical Center in Portland, seven other Maine hospitals, and an array of primary care and specialty clinics across the state.

“A limited number of patients have requested either to postpone visits or take advantage of our established telehealth resources, and MaineHealth is taking steps to accommodate these requests as we prioritize safety, privacy and continuity of care,” Porter said. “We also continue to experience higher than usual call-outs in some segments of our workforce. While the exact numbers can vary shift to shift, the overall trend line for these call-outs has been steady.”

On Thursday, the Maine State Nurses Association, the nurses’ union for Maine Med, released a statement about working conditions at the hospital. Meg Sinclair, an union representative and nurse at Maine Med, said “scaring people into not coming to work doesn’t make us safe. It compromises the care of our patients.”

12:30 p.m.: Hotel group CEO says he doesn’t know of any ICE agents at his properties

Freeport-based Maine Course Hospitality Group, owner of 14 hotels in Maine and 14 others from the Northeast to Florida, hasn’t been affected by increased immigration enforcement, CEO Sean Riley said.

Riley said he knew of no ICE agents staying at or arresting people on Maine Course properties, including Courtyard hotels in Portland and South Portland and the Homewood Suites in Scarborough.

He said Maine Course makes sure all staff members have necessary immigration documents and work permits, and that the company hasn’t experienced staffing issues because some employees are afraid to go to work.

Maine Course began addressing concerns about increased immigration enforcement last year, Riley said, and has taken steps to make sure associates know how to respond if ICE agents arrive at one of their hotels.

“Our hotels are open to everybody,” he said. “But we also want our guests and our associates to feel safe and comfortable, and we want to be law-abiding.”

Riley said the company recently held an online information session to update associates on the current situation.

“We wanted to give them as much information as possible because the lack of information around this carries a lot of fear,” he said. “This isn’t going away anytime soon and we want to put people at ease.”

11:30 a.m.: ICE hotline calls are up nearly 5,000%, advocacy group says

The operators of Maine’s Immigrant Defense Hotline, which allows callers to report sightings and tips regarding federal immigration activity, say they have seen a major uptick in calls since news of the Trump administration’s enforcement surge began to circulate last week.

Between Jan. 13 and Friday morning, the hotline saw a nearly 5,000% increase in calls compared to the prior 10-day period, said Hunter Cropsey of the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition.

MIRC publishes daily call data on its social media accounts.

On Wednesday, the latest day for which data was available as of Friday morning, operators fielded 1,169 incoming calls — roughly 35% more than the day before. The calls have also grown longer on average, according to MIRC.

Among Wednesday’s calls were 46 from Portland, 24 from South Portland, 22 from Westbrook and 17 from Biddeford, though the group cautioned that not all calls include location details.

The group also provided a breakdown of calls by type for Tuesday. The majority referenced suspected sightings and tips about Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity, but there were also more than 100 calls for support and general information, according to MIRC.

MIRC, working with other advocacy groups, helped launch the hotline in October. It is designed to connect vulnerable Mainers with resources and to track the movements and actions of federal immigration agents.

11 a.m.: Passamaquoddy chief says ICE has ‘been in contact‘ with tribal leaders

Amkuwiposohehs “Pos” Bassett, chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Sipayik, moved to assuage the concerns of tribal members in a letter to the community shared online Thursday night and said that ICE has already been in contact with the tribal government.

Bassett did not elaborate in his letter on the nature of that communication.

He encouraged tribal members to carry their tribal IDs and pledged the full support of the tribal government and its legal representation to any tribal member who is unlawfully detained or arrested by federal immigration officials.

The announcement followed a similar letter from Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis, who on Tuesday also urged members of his tribe to carry their tribal IDs. Members of federally recognized tribes in other states have been detained or arrested, Francis said, and there have been reports of federal agents refusing to accept tribal IDs as proof of citizenship.

“I’m asking you to be proud of who you are, I want you to stand out, I want you to walk down the street knowing that you have the full force of the Passamaquoddy Tribe behind you and we are willing to step up in any situation you cross paths with,” Bassett wrote.

He advised any Sipayik residents who aren’t citizens and lack legal documentation to contact an immigration attorney.

Federal agents would have a police escort if they come onto tribal territory, Bassett said.

10:55 a.m.: One summonsed during protest outside hotel where ICE believed to be staying, police say

One person was issued a summons during a Portland protest Thursday night outside a downtown hotel where protesters believed federal immigration agents were staying, police confirmed Friday.

Videos circulating on social media showed dozens of people banging drums, blowing whistles and chanting outside the Residence Inn at 154 Fore St.

Portland police spokesperson Brad Nadeau said more than 50 people gathered Thursday night, making noise and “causing disturbances inside the lobby.”

Police arrived shortly after 10 p.m. and told the group to disperse or risk being charged with disorderly conduct. One person, a 28-year-old from Brunswick, was issued a criminal summons “in lieu of arrest,” Nadeau said.

10:50 a.m.: Immigration lawyer filed late-night emergency petition to prevent client’s transfer from Portland jail

A federal judge ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement not to move at least one immigrant detainee from the Cumberland County Jail late Thursday night, when the federal agency transferred its detainees out of the facility.

Tong Qi Lu, 56, has been held at the jail in Portland for 10 months after a Maine State Trooper called ICE on him, according to a petition Lu’s attorney filed Thursday night in Maine’s U.S. District Court. Lu was living in Bangor and owned a restaurant there, according to court records.

Federal attorneys representing ICE had not yet responded in court Friday morning, but ICE’s online locator indicated that Lu is now being held at the Plymouth County Correctional Center in Massachusetts.

Sheriff Kevin Joyce, who oversees the Portland jail, confirmed Friday morning that ICE detainees had been moved out of the facility. The mass transfer came hours after Joyce criticized ICE on Thursday for its tactics when arresting a county corrections officer this week.

Lu’s attorney Oriana Farnham said in the petition that Lu left China when he was about 20 years old, and that he has called the U.S. home for more than 30 years.

ICE determined in 2020 that his removal to China “was not likely in the foreseeable future” and that he posed no risk to the community, Farnham wrote in court records. She said Lu has been complying with ICE’s conditions of release for the last five years, and that a petition for lawful permanent status is still pending.

Lu was taken into custody again in April, Farnham said, after a state trooper stopped Lu while he was searching for supplies at a scrapyard with the property owner’s permission.

“After checking Mr. Lu’s driver’s license, the Trooper informed him, ‘You’ve got trouble — ICE wants you,’” Farnham wrote.

The trooper reportedly took Lu to a restaurant he owns in Bangor to hug his family members, before Lu was transferred to ICE custody and brought to Portland.

10:40 a.m.: Avesta Housing says ICE has been active at its properties

Avesta Housing said Friday that it was aware of “ICE activity at a limited number of our properties.”

The affordable housing nonprofit manages over 3,000 units across the state, including a 52-unit South Portland property designed to serve asylum seekers experiencing homelessness. That building opened in 2023.

Avesta declined to comment on any specifics of the activity.

“Avesta employees handle any requests for resident information or property access in accordance with applicable law. To protect the privacy and safety of residents and employees, we do not disclose property locations or comment on the status of individual residents,” the agency said in an emailed statement.

“Our mission is unwavering, and we support those who have chosen to make their home in an Avesta community. We recognize that this is a time of great stress and uncertainty for many, and the safety and wellbeing of all our employees and residents is paramount.”

10:30 a.m.: Gov. Janet Mills urges Sen. Susan Collins, Congress to curtail ICE funding ‘until they stop their aggressive tactics’

Gov. Janet Mills on Friday called on Congress to curtail funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “until they stop their aggressive tactics.”

Mills, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, specifically called out Republican Sen. Susan Collins, whom she hopes to unseat this fall, in a written statement released by her campaign.

“We’ve seen ICE agents separating mothers from young children without any empathy or any respect for the rule of law,” Mills said. “Congress, including Susan Collins, should curtail funding for ICE until they stop their aggressive tactics that are just instilling fear and anxiety in people across the state.”

A surge of federal agents came to Maine this week as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort. Agents have been seen wearing masks and moving around Portland, Lewiston and surrounding communities in unmarked vehicles.

The administration says it is targeting “the worst of the worst,” but state officials and families say that people with misdemeanors or no criminal records are being detained and disappeared.

The U.S. Senate is expected to vote next week on a minibus package of spending bills that includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The package is the final annual appropriations bill needed to prevent a partial government shutdown at the end of the month.

Collins has said she plans to support the bill, which includes $20 million in funding for body cameras and $2 million for deescalation training — measures that she said can help protect ICE agents and the public.

“At this time of heightened tensions, these steps could help improve trust, accountability, and safety,” Collins said in a written statement this week. “I hope that Congress will adopt these measures quickly.”

The funding bill was approved Thursday by the House of Representatives, with Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, one of just seven Democrats voting in support.

Mills is running in the Democratic primary against Graham Platner, a combat veteran and oyster farmer from Sullivan who has forcefully condemned ICE tactics throughout his campaign. Platner said he supports “dismantling” ICE and holding congressional hearings.

10 a.m.: ICE detainees removed from Portland jail after sheriff’s criticism

Detainees who were arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were removed from the Cumberland County Jail on Thursday night, according to the sheriff.

Sheriff Kevin Joyce said Friday morning that ICE officials called the sheriff’s office Thursday to inform staff that they were removing all of their detainees in custody at the Portland jail. He said the detainees were transferred out of the jail Thursday night.

The move came after Joyce criticized the federal agency’s practices at a news conference Thursday after agents apprehended a Cumberland County corrections officer Wednesday evening.

9 a.m.: Masked agents detain man in Portland, leave his car running in the street with a smashed window

Masked agents in police vests detained Juan Sebastian Carvajal-Munoz, a civil engineer from Colombia employed by an engineering consulting company, in Portland on Thursday morning. Carvajal-Munoz earned a master’s degree from the University of Maine, and colleagues said he was in the country on a work visa.

An unmarked dark Subaru with tinted windows cut off Carvajal-Munoz as he was driving his grey Hyundai Tucson on Pearl Street in downtown Portland at 8:46 a.m., according to Jesse Smith, who witnessed the encounter.

Agents got out and quickly began using a crowbar to try and pry open his window, Smith said. They then smashed it to pieces. Three agents pulled Carvajal-Munoz out of his car, placed him in their Subaru and drove off, he said.

Smith couldn’t hear what, if anything, the agents said to Carvajal-Munoz but said the whole encounter was very quick.

“In less than two minutes, they smashed his window and dragged him out of the car,” Smith said. “He was compliant. He wasn’t resisting or anything.”

Agents left the car running — with its smashed window — on the street, according to interviews with Smith and a nearby parking attendant. A passerby then drove the vehicle into the parking lot, the attendant said. Smith said Carvajal-Munoz’s bag and keys were left in the passenger seat, and his phone was discarded on the road behind the car.

7:50 a.m.: Homeland Security launches new website to highlight what it calls ‘worst of the worst’ arrests in Maine

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday that the agency has revamped its new website to highlight some arrests carried out this week by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

The site, which the administration is calling the “Worst of the Worst,” now features 13 people who have been apprehended by ICE agents in Maine. They are accused of committing crimes ranging from drug offenses, to failure to report a crime, to aggravated assault.

ICE officials confirmed Thursday that agents have arrested at least 100 people in Maine since its enhanced enforcement operation began. Some local and state leaders have cast doubts on ICE’s claims that agents are only arresting people with criminal records.

BOSTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) – Immigrant rights advocates have filed a lawsuit seeking to block U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration from ending temporary protections from deportation that had been granted to thousands of Ethiopians living in the United States.

Three Ethiopian nationals, ‍along with the non-profit African Communities Together, allege in a lawsuit filed in Boston federal court on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is unlawfully putting over 5,000 people at risk of losing their temporary protected status after February 13.

It marked the latest in a series of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to curtail protections from deportation extended to citizens of numerous countries through grants of Temporary Protected ‌Status, or TPS.

Under federal law, TPS is available to people whose home ‌countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

LAWSUIT ALLEGES ANIMUS AGAINST NON-WHITES

The lawsuit says that while Ethiopia remains a country in a humanitarian crisis, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unlawfully terminated the Ethiopians’ legal status with ​just 60 days’ notice based on an unconstitutional animus against non-white immigrants. Ethiopia’s population is predominantly Black.

“The administration’s review of Ethiopia’s TPS designation resulting in the termination decision was motivated wrongly by ‍politics and racism and ignored the rule of law, ​including the requirement to consider objective evidence of unsafe conditions in Ethiopia,” ​Amaha Kassa, executive director of African Communities Together, said in a statement.

Homeland Security Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, ‍in a statement said TPS “was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades.”

Numerous lawsuits have been filed challenging the administration’s moves to end similar protections for nationals from countries, including Syria, Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua and South Sudan, leading to court rulings that have at times slowed or halted the Trump administration’s efforts ‍to strip migrants of their legal status.

The latest lawsuit was filed after DHS said on December 12 it was ending TPS for Ethiopia, saying conditions in the African nation no longer posed a serious ‍threat to people returning safely to ‍it and that TPS was “never meant to be a ticket to ​permanent residency.”

Former Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration granted Ethiopians already in the ​United States ⁠that status beginning in 2022, citing the need to protect citizens ‌fleeing armed conflict in their home nation.

The Ethiopian military and allies, including troops from neighboring Eritrea, had been battling forces from the northern region of Tigray in a conflict that killed thousands and displaced millions of people.

While that civil war formally ended later in 2022, the Biden administration extended TPS for Ethiopians in mid-2024, citing armed conflict in another region, Amhara, which is ongoing.

Sheriff Kevin Joyce confirmed that ICE arrested a corrections recruit with the Cumberland County Jail on Wednesday.

The man, whose name has not yet been released, was pulled over by agents just after 5 p.m. in Portland's Bayside neighborhood. Video obtained by Maine's Total Coverage shows the arrest. The man can be heard shouting: ""I'm a corrections officer, I work in Cumberland County, what's wrong?"" as he was placed in handcuffs.

Joyce said the recruit was hired in February 2025 after undergoing a rigorous hiring process. The sheriff also said the recruit's I-9 suggested that he was able to work in the United States until April 2029.

""He took the extra step of risking his job to fly to Texas to take care of hearings and for some reason, he was picked up last night,"" the sheriff added.

He called the number of agents on the scene a ""show of force,"" and said he was disturbed that the ICE agents left the recruit's vehicle unsecured at the scene.

ICE announced Wednesday that it launched ""Operation Catch of the Day"" in Maine on Tuesday.

It is not clear exactly how many people ICE has detained in Maine so far. Some of the charges brought against those who have been detained include aggravated assault, false imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child.

""Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,"" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens.""

Earlier on Thursday, Gov. Janet Mills answered questions from reporters regarding the ICE operation in Maine.

Mills said the Maine State Police and other local law enforcement agencies are not working with immigration officers.

During her news conference, Mills referred to ICE agents as ""secret police"" and said Maine State Police officers do not wear masks when conducting operations.

Mills said no one in her administration has been in contact with the Trump administration about the ICE operation, and all she knows about arrests or targeted arrests is what she has read in media reports.

The governor went on to say that the operations are disruptive for children and families across the state.

""I'm hearing that many of the people being detained, or on that list I think, are family members here in Maine, people who are working here in Maine, people who have children in the school system, people who have children in homes in Maine, people with no criminal record, and that's concerning,"" Mills said.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/images/sheriff-joyce-on-ice-arrest-of-cumberland-county-corrections-recruit-1-22-2026-69728373977e0.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*",N,,2026-01-23 16:59:17.961294

Vance's comments come as outrage swelled over Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents taking into custody four students under the age of 18 in the Minneapolis suburb of Columbia Heights. School officials said Liam Conejo Ramos, a preschooler, and his father were detained in their driveway after school on Tuesday.

When an adult known to the family offered to take Liam, ICE agents refused and instead led the boy to his front door and ordered him to knock – ""essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,"" according to a news release from Columbia Heights Public Schools.

Vance on Thursday said ICE was targeting the boy's father, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador, who federal officials accuse of trying to flee from immigration agents. The man’s attorney vehemently denied federal officials' account of the arrest and said the man was in the country legally, awaiting asylum.

""Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?"" Vance said. ""If the argument is that you can’t arrest people who have violated the law because they have children, then every single parent is going to be completely given immunity from every being the subject of law enforcement.""

The vice president gave those remarks after a closed-door meeting in Minneapolis with federal agents, business leaders, and others in an effort to ""bring down the temperature,"" Vance said. More than two weeks after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, daily protests continue to roil Minneapolis as state officials and the Trump administration square off in bitter legal fights.

Developments:

∎ The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday announced the arrests of three people accused of participating in a protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday. A federal magistrate judge declined to sign a complaint charging journalist Don Lemon in connection with the protest, CBS News and CNN reported.

∎ ICE has conducted stops and arrests in Maine as part of an immigration operation that was launched over the objections of state and local leaders. The mayors of Lewiston and Portland, who said the operation was unnecessary, reported a surge of federal agents and asked residents to remain calm.

'How can you justify incarcerating a child""

Marc Prokosch, a Twin Cities immigration attorney representing Liam’s family, slammed immigration authorities for detaining the 5-year-old and his father.

""How can you justify incarcerating a child,"" Prokosch told reporters on Thursday. The Minnesota attorney said the boy’s father had no criminal record according to a search of state records, and that the family was in the country legally.

The family entered the U.S. in 2024 through the border in Brownsville, Texas, said Prokosch, adding the family used an immigration authorities app to apply for asylum.

""These are not illegal aliens,"" the attorney said, responding to comments from Vice President Vance. ""They came properly and are pursuing a legal pathway.""

Prokosch said the family is currently being held at a family detention center in San Antonio. He said he has not been able to directly speak with his clients.

The attorney said he could not disclose what prompted the family to flee their home country of Ecuador. The South American nation is among the most violent in Latin America, according to Human Rights Watch.

Gov. Walz: ICE needs to turn the temperature down

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said immigration authorities in Minneapolis need to abandon their controversial tactics for calm to return to the city.

""I’m glad the Vice President agrees the temperature needs to be turned down, but actions speak louder than words,"" Walz said in a statement on X. ""We don’t need 3,000 ice agents in our streets — more than every local police department combined. Take the show of force off the streets and partner with the state on targeted enforcement of violent offenders instead of random, aggressive confrontation.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey criticized federal authorities for detaining the 5-year-old boy and said the child is ""not a threat of our community.""

""When the federal government treats kids like criminals, something has gone seriously wrong,"" Frey said on social media.

The governor and mayor did not respond to USA TODAY's requests for additional comment.

Teachers ask authorities to stop targeting students

Zena Stenvik, the superintendent for Columbia Heights Public Schools, said Liam was the fourth child in the school district to be detained by immigration authorities.

The first, Stenvik said, was a fourth grader who had been in the school district since kindergarten.

""All the teachers in that school were shattered,"" Stenvik said, ""and then it happened again and again and again.""

The other students immigration authorities detained were a 17-year-old girl arrested at her home and a 17-year-old boy arrested in his car on the way to school, the superintendent said.

""The kids just want to come to school, they want to be in school, we want them in school,"" Stenvik said. ""They want to be in-person learning. They thrive. They’re happy learning.""

Immigration agents have repeatedly followed school buses and made appearances in school parking lots, the superintendent said.

Minneapolis police on how it responds to ICE-related 911 calls

The Minneapolis Police Department told USA TODAY that the agency has an official dedicated to answering 911 calls related to immigration enforcement incidents and determining whether a police response is warranted.

""Calls that involve property damage and threats to life safety take priority,"" public information officer Sgt. Garrett Parten said. But ""the presence of protestors alone is not sufficient reason for MPD to respond.""

The police statement came in response to allegations that the agency ignored at least two calls for help from federal agents. According to Parten, police have no record of a call on Jan. 21 from agents asking for help recovering a gun magazine loaded with ammunition they left on a residential sidewalk in Minneapolis.

In the second incident on Jan. 19, federal agents called for help handling anti-immigration enforcement protesters.

""The agents expressed concern that the situation could become physical. MPD monitored the situation and determined that the federal agents had sufficient resources available to manage the incident,"" said Parten, adding police kept watch on a car the agents left behind.

Vance on Insurrection Act: 'We don’t think we need that'

Vance said the Trump administration doesn’t believe it needs to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota, right now, amid tensions over immigration enforcement.

""We don’t think that we need that,"" Vance said. ""Now the president could change his mind, of course, things could get worse.""

In a social media post earlier this month, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota, which gives him authority to deploy U.S. troops to suppress rebellions and civil unrest or when federal laws are being obstructed.

Vance blames 'chaos' in Minnesota on state and local officials

Speaking in Minneapolis on Thursday, Vance acknowledged the prevalence of videos and reports raising concerns about the aggressive tactics being used by immigration agents.

Vance said some videos and reports suggest some federal agents ""are not doing everything right.” He added: “But if you look at the context of what’s going on, you understand that these people are under an incredible amount of duress, an incredible amount of chaos.”

Vance placed the blame squarely on Minnesota's state and local officials.

""Do we want these things to happen? Do we want these arrests to be so chaotic? No, we don’t,"" Vance said. ""But if we had a little cooperation from local and state officials, I think the chaos would go way down.""

'Incredible job' Vance backs ICE in Minneapolis

While kicking off his remarks in Minneapolis, Vance reiterated his support for ICE.

""The guys behind me are doing an incredible job,"" Vance said, speaking with uniformed individuals standing behind him, including one wearing an ICE jacket.

The vice president said he came to Minneapolis to better understand the situation so he can ""tone down the temperature a bit, reduce the chaos."" There has been a wave of anti-ICE demonstrations since an agent shot a killed a woman in Minneapolis. Vance said he sympathizes with ICE agents who are “operating in a very, very tough environment.”

“I wanted to show some support for these guys,” Vance said.

Feds announce third arrest related to St. Paul church protest

A third person has been arrested in connection with the protest at a St. Paul church that interrupted a service on Sunday, Jan. 18.

Attorney General Pam Bondi on X named the third person as William Kelly.

Earlier in the day, Bondi announced the arrests of Nekima Levy Armstrong and Chauntyll Louisa Allen, a member of the St. Paul Public School board. Homeland Security Secretary said all three were being charged with conspiracy to deprive rights.

The arrests come after the DOJ said it was investigating the protest as a potential violation of the FACE Act, which protects access to religious worship under the First Amendment.

Protesters greet Vance in Minneapolis

Roughly a dozen protesters greeted Vance outside the Royalston Square event venue in Minneapolis, with two holding signs reading ""ICE out.""

Vance arrived at the Royalston and met with ICE agents before his speech. He is also held a roundtable discussion.

Minneapolis police not responding to feds' calls for help, official says

Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino said the Minneapolis Police Department has not been responding to calls from federal agents amid heated protests in the city.

“Minneapolis Police Department has been called on several situations that they have not responded to,"" Bovino said at a news conference on Thursday. He described an incident in which two off-duty agents were confronted by protesters at a restaurant. Bovino said the agents called police but had to be assisted by a federal tactical team after 40 minutes without a police response.

The Minneapolis Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The surge of immigration agents into Minnesota has strained the relationship between federal and local law enforcement. Local police chiefs have criticized the tactics employed by federal agents and accused agents of racially profiling off-duty police officers.

ICE faces backlash as agents enter homes without judge-signed warrants

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is facing intense scrutiny over its agents forcibly entering homes without a judge's warrant.

An internal ICE memo authorized agents to use force to enter residences with only administrative warrants, which are signed by ICE officers and do not require a judge's signature, multiple outlets reported, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post.

Marcos Charles, the executive associate director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, confirmed that agents enter homes with only administrative warrants at a news conference on Thursday.

""We don't break into anybody's homes,"" Charles said. ""We make entry either in a hot pursuit with a criminal arrest warrant or an administrative arrest warrant.""

School official: Immigration agents detained 4 students

At least four students under the age of 18 have been detained by immigration agents over the last two weeks in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, the school district said in a statement.

Liam Ramos, 5, was detained with his father on Tuesday, Jan. 20, and taken to a detention facility in Texas, according to the district. On the same day, a 17-year-old was detained on his way to school after agents removed him from his car.

Last week, a 17-year-old student was taken into custody after “ICE agents pushed their way into an apartment,” according to Columbia Heights Public Schools.

And two weeks ago, a 10-year-old student and her mother were detained while on their way to class. “The father immediately came to the school to find that both his daughter and wife had been taken,” the district said in a statement. “By the end of the school day, they were already in a detention center in Texas, and they are still there.”

The school district said it is working with an immigration lawyer to get the students back.

“ICE agents have been roaming our neighborhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lots and taking our children,” the district said. “The sense of safety in our community and around our schools is shaken and our hearts are shattered.”

Vance wants more arrests after church protest

Ahead of his visit to Minneapolis, Vance touted the investigation into an anti-ICE protest at a St. Paul church. He said he wants to see more arrests after the Department of Justice announced two of the protesters had been apprehended.

“I certainly want to see more arrests,” Vance said. “Because I’ve seen the videos and there are very clearly more people who have violated the law.”

The vice president predicted more prosecutions.

“They’re scaring little kids who are there to worship God on a Sunday morning,” Vance said. “Those people are going to be sent to prison.”

DOJ announces 2 arrests in St. Paul church protest

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents arrested two people involved in a protest that interrupted Sunday service at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Bondi identified those arrested as Nekima Levy Armstrong and Chauntyll Louisa Allen but did not describe any alleged charges. ""More to come,"" Bondi said on X. ""WE WILL PROTECT OUR HOUSES OF WORSHIP.""

A group of protestors entered Cities Church on Jan. 18, alleging that Pastor David Easterwood serves as the ICE St. Paul Field Office acting director. Videos show dozens of protesters changing ""Renee Good,"" and ""don't shoot,"" as some verbally confronted churchgoers.

The DOJ launched an investigation into the protest as a potential violation of the FACE Act, a federal law that prohibits the use of force, threats, or physical obstruction to block people from reproductive health care or access to religious worship under the First Amendment right to religious freedom.

Vance says he wants to 'calm the tensions' in Minneapolis

As the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts continue to roil Minneapolis, Vance said he hopes his presence in the city Thursday will calm things down.

“Certainly one of my goals is to calm the tensions, to talk to people, to try to understand what we can do better,” Vance said during a speech in Toledo, Ohio, before flying to Minnesota.

At the same time, Vance blasted local officials for not cooperating with federal immigration authorities and blamed the lack of cooperation for “chaos” in the city. The vice president said he also wants to send a message to law enforcement “that we stand with them and we’re not going to abandon them.”

“We’re not going to do what the last administration did,” Vance continued. “Which is throw them under the bus to appease a bunch of left-wing radicals.”

Appeals court freezes order limiting force against protesters in Minnesota

A federal appeals court on Jan. 21 paused a lower court's order that had ordered federal immigration agents in Minnesota not to use ""intimidation tactics"" against peaceful protesters.

The move by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a win to the Trump administration, which had vowed to appeal the lower court's order that set up guardrails around the behavior of federal agents.

In the lower-court order, U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez said agents appeared to have engaged in ""chilling conduct"" and ""intimidation tactics."" She noted actions such as the ""drawing and pointing of weapons,"" the ""use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions,"" and ""actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers.""

'ICE Out of Minneapolis' protest planned for Friday

Organizers in Minneapolis asked people to call out of work, skip school, and refrain from buying anything as part of a protest against the ongoing immigration operations.

""Faith leaders, business owners, workers, and concerned Minnesotans have called for a statewide day of public mourning and pause through 'No Work, No School and No Shopping' and a massive, peaceful march in downtown Minneapolis that afternoon,"" said a news release about the demonstration scheduled for Friday, Jan. 23.

Over the last two weeks, students at schools across Minnesota have held walkouts in protest of the immigration operation and Good's killing.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/22/USAT/88298580007-screenshot-120.png?crop=777,438,x0,y49&width=777&height=438&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-23 14:58:17.506905

And you know, we’re going to, we’re going to continue to work with judges and the courts to obtain these warrants with those judges.” Bovino’s aggressive methods have come under fire in Minnesota and other cities.","Federal judges in Minnesota have several times in recent weeks rejected arrest warrants for people protesting a surge of immigration officers in that state, finding that federal agents do not have sufficient evidence that protesters assaulted officers or committed other crimes, according to two people briefed on the discussions.

In these sealed court proceedings, magistrate judges in the federal court in Minnesota have been deluged with requests from federal prosecutors to arrest and criminally charge protesters. The rise in requests comes amid increasing clashes between protesters and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after a surge of federal officers arriving in the state and in the wake of an ICE officer fatally shooting protester Renee Good on Jan. 7. But some prosecutors have fared poorly in establishing evidence of crime, said the people, who asked to speak confidentially about sensitive court proceedings.

It is exceedingly rare for judges to turn down investigators’ requests for search and arrest warrants or criminal complaints, since the standard of evidence required is so low; a federal agent or officer providing an account of events need only show a fair probability that the suspect engaged in the crime for an arrest warrant.

This spate of rejections in Minnesota would normally cause embarrassment for the U.S attorney’s office that submits the requests. But the Minnesota office has been in turmoil since the Justice Department’s decision not to investigate the officer who killed Good, which led to six senior prosecutors resigning, and more departures are expected.

In one case, a Minnesota-based judge rejected an effort to arrest and charge a protester after they had thrown an egg at a law enforcement vehicle, according to one person briefed on the case.

In another example that has not been previously reported, Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota on Tuesday rejected a complaint to arrest a St. Paul school board member, Chauntyll Louisa Allen, on federal charges of seeking to threaten or intimidate people from engaging in worship. The case stems from a Sunday-morning protest outside the St. Paul service at Cities Church, where protesters chanted “ICE out” and “justice for Renee Good,” because they believed David Easterwood, acting director of the city’s ICE field office, served as a pastor there.

Micko noted in his Tuesday rejection that he found no probable cause for such a claim against Allen; he did, however, grant a separate request from prosecutors allowing them to seek to charge Allen with the separate claim of conspiracy to make threats.

Attorney General Pam Bondi had announced the arrests of Allen and others in the church protest case on Thursday but did not mention the charge the magistrate judge rejected for lacking evidence.

Micko also rejected a criminal complaint against journalist Don Lemon, who had followed protesters inside the church, which the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Former FBI agents have publicly complained of watching ICE officers in Minnesota arrest protesters who appear only to be taunting or yelling at the officers, which they say appears to be protected free speech and not a criminal act.

Recommended

Sources have also told MSNOW that Gregory Bovino, the Customs and Border Protection commander who is leading the surge of immigration officers in Minnesota, expressed frustration about the magistrate judge declining to approve arrest warrants. MSNOW asked Bovino about this report at a news conference he held Thursday; Bovino said he had not argued directly with any magistrate judges but acknowledged struggling to get some warrants approved.

“We work very hard with [the] Department of Justice, with the courts, to gather and obtain those warrants,” Bovino said, mentioning that his teams work for “several days” to get a warrant for one person. “We worked through what we needed to do to get a warrant for this individual. And you know, we’re going to, we’re going to continue to work with judges and the courts to obtain these warrants with those judges.”

Bovino’s aggressive methods have come under fire in Minnesota and other cities. He recently was filmed tossing a gas canister into a crowd of chanting protesters.

“It’s our f–––ing city,” Bovino is heard saying to his officers. “Arrest as many people that touch you as you want to.”

Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Representative Dan Goldman (D-NY-10) and U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) led 27 lawmakers in writing to the Inspectors General for the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Postal Service (USPS), and the Office of Tax Administration (TIGTA), asking the watchdogs to investigate the impact of the Trump administration’s diversion of law enforcement resources away from white collar and corporate crime and in favor of immigration enforcement.

“Trump is letting white collar criminals run rampant without consequences so he can shift law enforcement to violently attack immigrants, the overwhelming majority of whom have no criminal record,” said Rep. Goldman. “Having 25,000 fewer law enforcement personnel investigating and prosecuting white collar crime enables fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and other crimes that hurt the American people. Federal Inspectors General must conduct a thorough investigation of the impact of these diversions.”

Since January 2025, the Trump administration has reportedly diverted over(link is external) 25,000 law enforcement personnel to immigration enforcement. Many of those agents had been dedicated to combating white-collar crimes—including fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and more.

Those diversions include:

Nearly one quarter of FBI agents nationwide(link is external);

More than 1,700 IRS Criminal Investigation employees(link is external);

Around 300 State Department Diplomatic Security Service agents(link is external);

More than 90 percent of the Homeland Security Investigations workforce(link is external);

Dozens of career prosecutors from DOJ’s(link is external) Public Integrity Section and National Security Division; and

Even members of the US Postal Inspection Service(link is external).

Several agencies are experiencing the consequences of these diversions. For example, the mass reassignment of HSI agents to immigration removal operations means that(link is external) critical threats could go uninvestigated. Diverting State Department resources to ICE weakens cross-border investigations(link is external) into corruption, fraud, and international financial crimes. The diversion of FBI and DOJ personnel from white-collar units has caused delays and the deprioritization(link is external) of complex financial crime cases such as public corruption, corporate fraud, and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prosecutions.

The lawmakers asked the IGs to provide the information below as a part of their investigation:

A breakdown of how many law enforcement personnel have been reassigned from each agency for immigration enforcement;

A breakdown of how many white-collar crimes cases (including but not limited to financial fraud, corruption, FCPA, and money-laundering cases) have been opened, closed, or suspended since the start of the second Trump administration;

Any internal assessments conducted by agencies to determine the impacts of diverting law enforcement resources; and

An accounting of complaints or whistleblower disclosures received about these diversions;

A list of the safeguards that exist to ensure each agency still meets its statutory white-collar criminal investigative obligations despite these diversions.

Dear Inspectors General Berthiaume, Cuffari, Hill, Baker, and Hull:

We write to express our deep concern about the diversion of critical federal law enforcement personnel and resources away from investigating and prosecuting white-collar crime and toward advancing President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda. We ask that your office conduct an evaluation of the scope of this diversion and its impact.

When white-collar criminal enforcement is neglected, the American public pays the price. Ordinary people are left more vulnerable to fraud schemes, market manipulation, predatory financial practices, and corruption that threaten their savings, retirement accounts, and financial security — while the wealthiest bend the rules and exploit a weakened enforcement system that no longer holds them accountable.

The failure to enforce the law against corporate criminals has been a hallmark of the Trump Administration. Time and again, President Trump and his administration have let convicted corporate criminals off the hook by wiping out fines and penalties, eliminating efforts to enforce consumer and banking laws, and pardoning fraudsters and con-men under the flimsiest of pretenses. According to one estimate, President Trump’s pardons have wiped away “approximately $1.3 billion in restitution and fines owed to [crime victims] and American taxpayers.”

Exacerbating this lack of accountability, since January 2025, the Trump Administration has diverted over 25,000 federal law enforcement personnel to immigration enforcement.6 Many of those agents had been dedicated to combatting white-collar crimes — including fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and more.

According to reports, thousands of agents from teams responsible for white-collar criminal investigations at the Department of Justice (DOJ), Treasury Department, State Department, and more have been reassigned to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), primarily to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to execute the President’s civil immigration dragnet. For example:

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI): Nearly one-quarter of FBI agents nationwide — and up to 40 percent in the largest field offices — have been reassigned to support ICE enforcement operations. These agents, once dedicated to public corruption, financial fraud, cybercrime, and complex corporate investigations, are now serving on civil immigration details and ICE facility protection assignments.

Internal Revenue Service (IRS): More than 1,700 IRS Criminal Investigation employees have been reassigned to ICE as of September 2025, compared to just 250 employees as of June 2025. In April 2025, the IRS and DHS formalized a data-sharing Memorandum of Understanding granting ICE access to certain taxpayer return information — including names, addresses, and tax years — to support immigration enforcement, a potentially unlawful departure from the longstanding IRS confidentiality policy, and potentially further drawing from IRS resources.

State Department Diplomatic Security Service (DSS): DSS agents traditionally focus on protecting U.S. diplomatic missions, investigating passport and visa fraud, coordinating sensitive international investigations, and investigating crimes involving foreign missions and consular services. The CATO Institute reported that around 300 DSS agents have now been detailed to ICE operations.

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI): HSI has historically led criminal investigations into international money laundering, financial fraud, cyber-enabled financial crimes, and intellectual property theft. But now HSI has reassigned a whopping 90 percent of its workforce to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, according to CATO’s estimates.

DOJ Public Integrity Section (PIN) & National Security Division (NSD): PIN oversees the investigation and prosecution of public corruption cases involving elected officials, judges, and other government employees. Yet under President Trump, the Section has been gutted — shrinking from 36 career prosecutors to just two16 — and the head of PIN was reassigned to the DOJ’s new “Office of Sanctuary Cities Enforcement” task force. Similarly, two veteran prosecutors in NSD, responsible for investigating sanctions violations and other offenses, were also reassigned to the sanctuary cities task force. Many lawyers placed on the sanctuary cities team were sidelined, given only menial tasks and, with little else to do, “completed jigsaw puzzles and streamed television shows” after being removed from their jobs investigating serious white-collar crimes and other offenses.

US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS): USPIS, the law enforcement arm of the Postal Service, normally investigates mail fraud and other crimes. But this year, some Postal Service agents have assisted ICE in locating individuals for immigration enforcement.

Taken together, these moves represent a massive diversion of specialized law-enforcement talent away from criminal financial investigations and prosecutions and toward civil immigration enforcement.

As a result of these diversions, white-collar investigative teams are understaffed, under- resourced, and in some cases gutted. Complex, multi-year investigations into white-collar crimes depend on continuity of staff and specialized expertise. By reassigning agents who worked on white-collar crime and corruption cases to immigration, critical investigations into fraud, corruption, and cyber-financial crimes have been sidelined or shelved. For example, one DOJ investigation into a financial services firm has reportedly stalled in part because investigators were “pulled into immigration matters,” while the FBI’s white-collar crime squad in Houston was reportedly “decimated in 2025 by orders to put dozens of their agents onto immigration enforcement.” Already, we are seeing how other diversions of agents at DOJ appear to have resulted in a decline in criminal referrals for prosecution of non-immigration offenses.

Several agencies are already experiencing the consequences of these diversions. For example, the mass reassignment of HSI agents to immigration removal operations means that “critical threats could go uninvestigated,” including “Dark Web financial schemes, Iranian and Chinese nuclear traffickers, Russian organized crime, [and] trade fraud.” Likewise, diverting State Department resources to ICE weakens cross-border investigations into corruption, fraud, and international financial crimes. At the same time, the diversion of FBI and DOJ personnel from white-collar units has caused delays and the deprioritization of complex financial crime cases such as public corruption, corporate fraud, and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prosecutions — undermining the federal government’s ability to hold powerful actors accountable.

Moreover, at the IRS, the diversion of agents inflicts a double harm: it not only allows wealthy tax evaders and criminal enterprises to escape accountability but also deprives the federal government of the revenue needed to sustain broader law-enforcement operations. The IRS’s Criminal Investigation team is widely regarded as one of the most cost-effective units in federal law enforcement;28 last year, on a budget of less than $800 million, that unit recovered over $9 billion in fraudulent proceeds.29 But now, more than 1,700 IRS Criminal Investigation agents and staff have been detailed to ICE operations, severely undermining the agency’s ability to investigate tax evasion, offshore accounts, cryptocurrency fraud, and money laundering. That means less revenue to fund the federal government’s enforcement functions and a greater risk that honest taxpayers will shoulder the burden left by tax evaders. In practice, these diversions also undermine deterrence: when white-collar criminals believe that federal enforcement units lack the resources or continuity to pursue long-term cases, they may become more emboldened to take risks that endanger markets, taxpayers, and public institutions.

The safety of American families and the integrity of our financial system depend on restoring law enforcement’s capacity to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime rather than simply turning the federal government into an immigration enforcement machine. In order to carry out our legislative responsibilities regarding enforcement of the nation’s criminal laws, we ask that your offices conduct an evaluation of these diversions. This evaluation should include answers to the following questions:

1. How many law enforcement personnel at your agency have been reassigned to ICE or other parts of DHS since January 20, 2025? Please provide a breakdown by bureau, division, field office, and duration of the reassignment.

2. Excluding any work done since January 2025 on immigration matters, how many white- collar crime cases (including but not limited to financial fraud, corruption, FCPA, and money-laundering cases) have been opened since January 20, 2025? How many have been closed or suspended? How many have been charged?

Please describe what types of white-collar crime cases have been charged, opened, closed, or suspended.

Please provide the number of white-collar crime cases charged, opened, closed, or suspended in FY 2023 and FY 2024 as points of reference.

How many white-collar crime cases have been closed, delayed, or suspended due to personnel shortages, following diversions of personnel from the relevant agency to immigration-related functions?

How many white-collar crime cases have been closed, delayed, or suspended due to other resource shortages, following resource diversions from the relevant agency to immigration-related functions?

3. For Offices of Inspectors General other than the DOJ OIG: excluding any work done since January 2025 on immigration matters, please provide the number of prosecution recommendations your agency made to the DOJ, the number of investigations closed without a referral for prosecution, the information or indictments DOJ filed, and the number of defendants sentenced, in or after FY 2025 compared to FY 2023 and FY 2024.

4. What internal assessments has your agency conducted to evaluate the impacts of diversion of law enforcement resources? Has your agency taken, or does it plan to take, action consistent with the findings of these assessments?

5, Has your office received complaints or whistleblower disclosures about these diversions? If so, how many, and what issues were raised?

6. What safeguards exist to ensure that your agency continues to meet its statutory white- collar crime obligations despite these diversions?

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

Sincerely,

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Thursday joined the Department of Justice in arresting three individuals in connection with a planned riot at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota on Sunday.

On Sunday, January 18, anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agitators stormed into the Cities Church in St. Paul, shouting down churchgoers in the middle of services. Protestors targeted the church accusing one of the pastors of working for ICE.

On Thursday, Homeland Security Investigators (HSI) — alongside FBI partners — arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Louisa Allen, and William Kelly in connection with Sunday’s riot. The three are being charged under 18 USC 241.

Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 makes it unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person of any state, territory or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him/her by the Constitution or the laws of the United States, (or because of his/her having exercised the same).

“Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States - there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion,” said Secretary Kristi Noem.

ICE, and other federal immigration law enforcement, have arrested more than 10,000 illegal aliens in Minnesota since January 20, 2025. In response to that robust enforcement of law and order, leftist agitators have attacked, organized riots, and attempted to thwart law enforcement daily. Even as they face a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks against them, and an 8,000% increase in death threats against them, the brave men and women of ICE will not be deterred.

Ford, Rosanne Skirble",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/23/immigration-enforcement-restrictions-take-center-stage-at-daylong-senate-hearing/,"No matter what happens with a pair of bills that would rein in federal immigration agents in Maryland, no one can say they didn’t get a full hearing.
The second bill, discussed for about three hours, would bar local law enforcement agencies from entering into immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government.
“We should no longer refer our precious, critical law enforcement resources to federal immigration enforcement,” he said.
The eight counties with the 287(g) agreements have a strictly jail-based model and don’t handle street enforcement, they said.

Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), that would ban face coverings on law enforcement officials.","No matter what happens with a pair of bills that would rein in federal immigration agents in Maryland, no one can say they didn’t get a full hearing.

The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee took five hours of testimony from dozens of witnesses Thursday, on one bill that would prohibit police from wearing face coverings while on duty and another that would eliminate agreements allowing local police agencies to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The hearing followed a rally by advocates late Thursday morning.

The bills are likely to be among the most emotional in this session, as increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement tactics by federal agents flooding U.S. cities continue to dominate the news. But Thursday’s hearings were largely unemotional, with the biggest outbursts being the occasional rounds of applause from the lobby outside the hearing room, where an overflow crowd watched a livestream of the proceedings.

Senators spent nearly two hours on a bill to prohibit face coverings for law enforcement officers in the state, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who are mostly masked.

The second bill, discussed for about three hours, would bar local law enforcement agencies from entering into immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government. Sheriffs in eight Maryland counties currently has the so-called 287(g) agreements with ICE, under which the counties agree to hold criminal suspects for ICE pickup if the local agency determines the suspect is in the U.S. illegally.

Senate Bill 245, sponsored by Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), states that no local police officers or any “agent of the state” would be allowed to enter into an agreement with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law.

The bill, which failed in last year’s session, comes as immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump (R) is becoming increasingly aggressive and divisive, with Smith citing the case of a 5-year-old boy being detained by ICE in Minnesota.

“Immigrants have been used as this pawn for this whole political dynamic, and ICE has been used as that tool to vilify immigrants, to stoke fear, to disrupt lives and communities and to divide us,” said Smith, the chair of Judicial Proceedings.

“We should no longer refer our precious, critical law enforcement resources to federal immigration enforcement,” he said. “Instead, our law enforcement should be relentlessly focused on public safety. That’s what this bill intends to do that.”

Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) testified in support of the bill, noting that immigrants contribute millions of dollars to the state’s economy, account for about 23% of the state’s STEM workforce and the same percentage of registered nurses.

“It’s just important to recognize that policies that promote stability and trust within immigrant communities also help protect and buoy Maryland’s economy and increase our economic resilience,” Lierman said.

But Sens. Chris West (R-Baltimore and Carroll) and William G. Folden (R-Frederick) said Maryland sheriff’s departments are not engaged in rouding up immigrants, just in holding immigrants for ICE once they’re already in custody.

“These 287(g) agreements, in fact, all they do is require that after someone has been arrested and brought into a detention facility, that arrestee is screened, and if it turns out that person is an illegal immigrant, ICE is informed. That’s it,” West said.

That may be, said Smith, but he said West glossed over the fact that some people have been arrested and turned over to ICE for minor offenses, and that there is a lack of due process for them.

“If we are in the business of doing ICE’s job for them, then that frees up other resources to do that field enforcement that we find to be so egregious in many senses,” he said.

The majority of witnesses Thursday testified in support of Smith’s bill, saying the 287(g) agreements encourage racial profiling and create anxiety and fear in immigrant communities.

The agreements “lead to local residents losing trust in the very law enforcement agencies that are supposed to protect them,” said Viviana Westbrook, state and local advocacy attorney at Catholic Legal Immigration Network based in Montgomery County. “I really hope that this year we will end 287(g) since it is complicit with all the violence and chaos and fear that ICE has been sowing.”

Some opposition

But supporters pushed back against what they say are the many misconceptions about the 287(g) program.

The eight counties with the 287(g) agreements have a strictly jail-based model and don’t handle street enforcement, they said. The work done by local authorities is done by correctional officers in a detention center who handle detainers, which are written requests from ICE that a local jail or other agency detain an individual for up to 48 hours, to give ICE time to take the person into federal custody to begin removal proceedings.

Cecil, Frederick and Harford counties have agreements where they can process individuals in local detention centers and then hand to ICE. The other five counties – Allegany, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary’s and Washington – entered into agreements last year and can serve administrative warrants in a local jail.

Carroll County Sheriff Jim DeWees, whose jurisdiction signed onto an agreement in May, said his department implemented a warrant-based model to strictly serve administrative warrants.

“You can pass this law and abolish our 287(g) agreement, but no politician or legislative body will tell me that I can’t communicate with another law enforcement agency when it comes to a matter of public safety in my community,” DeWees said.

In November, the Wicomico County Council discussed entering a 287(g) agreement, but County Executive Julie Giordano (R) suggested holding off because the General Assembly might make changes to the program. On Thursday, Giordano told the committee her county is again considering an agreement with ICE.

“This bill does not eliminate ICE. It does not stop immigration enforcement,” she said, speaking against the legislation. “What it does is that it strips counties’ and correctional officers’ and elected officials’ ability to cooperate and coordinate with federal authorities in a responsible, structured and transparent way.”

The hearing came two days after several sheriffs joined Senate Republicans in Annapolis to speak in support of the 287(g) program as an effective public safety tool in their jurisdictions, and who said they would fight any attempt to end the program.

About four hours prior to Thursday’s hearing, Smith joined members of the immigrant rights and advocacy group CASA and other community leaders at a news conference to say ICE must go. Smith rejected the argument by critics that a 287(g) ban would be unconstitutional, saying sheriffs are bound to adhere to state law.

“While they do have responsibilities and powers vested in them through their status as a constitutional officer, the legislature can curtail that,” Smith said. “The department that the sheriff resides over is also a creature of the state, and so the state can also curtail those responsibilities and those rights. So, it’s fully constitutional.”

Standing alongside Smith on Thursday was Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), sponsor of the House version of the 287(g) bill scheduled to be heard Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee.

Williams said the legislation remains necessary with what’s happening in the nation, especially under the Trump administration.

“This is one of those pivotal moments in our history as a country where what we’re seeing is unprecedented, and I think the way that we all respond is going to be in history books for our children and grandchildren to read about in the future,” Williams said.

Face coverings

Before the Senate committee reviewed the federal enforcement bill, it spent nearly two hours on Senate Bill 1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), that would ban face coverings on law enforcement officials.

The bill comes after months of aggressive immigration raids by ICE agents, who are typically masked. Augustine’s bill would prohibit officers from wearing items such as a balaclava, ski mask or neck gaiter on duty. It wouldn’t apply to an individual “actively engaged in an undercover operation” or when health-related matters are involved.

“Wearing masks is just simply not necessary for law enforcement to function. The wearing of masks undermines public trust,” Augustine said. “Masking within the normal course of duty has no tactical benefit, but does pose a risk to our collective public safety by creating fear and anxiety, particularly in situations that are already tense.”

Naureen Shah, director of immigration policy with the American Civil Liberties Union, said law enforcement agencies wearing masks represent tactics “of an authoritarian regime where people must watch what they say, lest they be disappeared by masked agents operating without accountability.”

After Augustine and Shaw spoke, several people could be heard clapping in the committee lobby area.

But Folden, who recently retired from law enforcement after slightly more than 30 years, said doxing has become a problem for officers on the job, such as during protests.

Neil Franklin, a retired Maryland State Police major who testified online, said he doesn’t see that as a problem, especially when federal immigration duties have been done for decades under other U.S. presidents.

“There’s no tactical advantage to wearing a mask outside of … normal performance of their duties,” Franklin said. “It’s actually a disadvantage in my professional opinion because again, it creates distrust in policing.”

Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) asked why the bill includes potential criminal prosecution of officers who violate the law. Under Augustine’s bill, an officer found guilty would be charged with a misdemeanor and possible imprisonment for up to two years, a fine to not exceed $2,000, or both. In addition, the officer must waive “all immunity in a civil action.”

Augustine said the penalties are needed “to have strong enforcement mechanisms because of the damage that this practice has on the fabric of our community and human dignity in our state…. Don’t wear a mask [and] you don’t have to worry about it.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sen.-William-C.-Smith-Jr.-at-Senate-JPR-hearing-1-22-2026-2048x1503.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 14:58:14.157356

The truth is, no one knows when the federal siege will end. It may not be soon.

U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who calls his officers “troops,” said “this mission is ongoing until there are no more of those criminal illegal aliens roaming the streets.”

Frank — who asked that he be identified only by his nickname to protect his identity — is originally from Mexico but has lived in the United States for more than a decade.

He has a pending application for what’s known as a U visa, which are available to victims of human trafficking, domestic abuse and other serious crimes, so they can cooperate with law enforcement without the fear of being deported.

The Trump administration has pushed to eject U visa applicants, which is why Frank’s lawyer has advised him to keep a low profile. Other immigrants in similar situations have been detained and deported, all while following the rules.

Frank knows a dozen people who’ve been deported — several in just the past couple weeks, including a co-worker on a construction job site.

His kids, three of whom are U.S. citizens, switched to online school. He stopped going to work, and he and his wife never leave the house together, lest they both be detained and separated from their children.

Frank, who has no criminal record save a couple traffic tickets, is the main breadwinner for his family. They’ve been able to live off savings, although he recently had to ask his mother in Mexico for help.

“We still don’t have enough, but we have a little bit to survive on,” he said.

‘Reckoning & Retribution’

The aggressive campaign of sweeping up immigrants has driven tens of thousands of people like Frank into hiding.

The Trump administration claims they are targeting the “worst of the worst” criminals in the country illegally in the “largest DHS operation ever” with some 3,000 federal agents in Minnesota.

Their ranks far surpass the several hundred agents sent to the Chicago area despite Minnesota having a much smaller population and far fewer immigrants without permanent legal status. Pew Research estimates 130,000 out of Minnesota’s roughly 6 million residents are undocumented, a relatively small percentage compared to states like Texas and Florida — contrary to Vice President JD Vance’s recent claim that Minneapolis has the “highest concentration of people who have violated our immigration laws.”

Launched in December under the stated goal of combating Medicaid fraud, the operation followed a high-profile state and federal investigation into social services fraud that involved mostly Somali American defendants. The case drew years of local media attention before being amplified by right-wing outlets and, eventually, by the president himself.

“Do the people of Minnesota really want to live in a community in which their are thousands of already convicted murderers, drug dealers and addicts, rapists, violent released and escaped prisoners, dangerous people from foreign mental institutions and insane asylums, and other deadly criminals too dangerous to even mention,” Trump posted to Truth Social on Jan. 13, promising the day of “RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”

The Department of Homeland Security says it’s arrested some 3,000 undocumented criminals in Minnesota since December — and 10,000 in the past year — although the figures strain credulity and the agency hasn’t provided a full list of who those people are.

Instead, DHS has periodically released curated lists of mug shots including many of those who were already in custody in state prisons.

The operation has ignited fierce resistance from residents and Democratic officials that’s grown into a crescendo since an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old unarmed woman, in her car in south Minneapolis. Many Minnesotans grew further outraged when the Department of Homeland Security called her a “domestic terrorist,” while the U.S. Department of Justice yanked local investigators off the case. A week later, federal immigration agents shot a second person after a case of apparent mistaken identity, setting off clashes between law enforcement and protesters.

Gov. Tim Walz, whose office was subpoenaed by the feds for documents related to state immigration enforcement, appealed directly to Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “end this occupation,” as has virtually every elected Democrat in the state including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey whose appeal was, “get the f*ck out.”

Neither has any influence with the Trump administration besides, and Walz has become a lame duck since announcing early this month he won’t run for a third term.

As Democrats wait for proven vote-getter Sen. Amy Klobuchar to announce a run governor, the resistance to Trump’s siege has not come from politicians but from everyday Minnesotans — practiced in protest since even before the police murder of George Floyd — using a decentralized but well-organized system for spotting and harassing federal officers and giving aid to people who need it.

Minnesotans have reacted with an unbending resistance befitting people who are accustomed to withstanding the bitter cold. The state’s Midwestern progressivism, civic activism, volunteerism and tight familial and social networks serve as crucial infrastructure of the rampart against the federal presence.

Assaults on citizens

Each day brings a new news story about a lawful resident being handcuffed, sometimes beaten, and whisked away in an unmarked vehicle, unable to reach family members.

A Minnesota-born, Somali-American woman with no criminal record was shoved to the ground by ICE agents outside her apartment in St. Paul and called a racial slur on a Wednesday morning.

Nasra Ahmed, 23, says even though she showed agents her ID, she was detained for two days, including being shackled in a hospital while undergoing an MRI after suffering an apparent stress-induced seizure.

Just a few days later, at least eight masked federal agents broke down the door of a U.S. citizen with no criminal history in East St. Paul and arrested him at gunpoint in front of his 5-year-old grandson. (The Associated Press reported this week that “federal immigration officers are asserting sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant.”)

Video taken by a neighbor show officers leading the man, ChongLy Scott Thao, outside in 10-degree weather wearing only a pair of blue boxer briefs, white crocs and a plaid blanket draped over his shoulders. He was detained for about an hour in a vehicle before agents dropped him back off at home.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said he matched the description of two men with criminal convictions at Thao’s address, but Thao hardly looks like either of them, save for being Asian, and said he doesn’t know either man. One of the men turned out to have been in prison since 2024.

ProPublica reported in October — months before Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota — that immigration agents have detained more than 170 U.S. citizens.

Federal agents are also targeting the roughly 5,600 refugees in Minnesota who have yet to receive permanent residency as part of “Operation PARRIS” — Post-Adminision Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening. It has entailed arresting refugees with no criminal records who are complying with the federal government’s rigorous screening process including more than a dozen health and background checks.

Countless other lawful residents have been stopped and asked to show identification just on the suspicion of looking like an immigrant.

“In every situation, we’re doing targeted enforcement,” Noem said when asked why Americans are being asked on the street to prove their citizenship. “If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are.”

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison alleged federal agents are racially profiling people — which DHS denies — in a lawsuit filed with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seeking to end the operation.

Evidence supporting the allegation abounds.

Journalists have witnessed federal immigration agents check random non-white people’s documents outside big box stores, electric vehicle charging stations and bus stops. Agents even demanded the papers of a Latino U.S. citizen whom they rear-ended.

Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said while he has worked well with ICE in the past, his department is now receiving “endless complaints about civil rights violations” including from members of his own police force who aren’t white.

Federal agents boxed in one of his officers — a U.S. citizen — while she was off-duty and demanded to see her papers, Bruley said during a news conference with other local law enforcement leaders. The agents had their guns drawn and knocked the off-duty officer’s phone out of her hand, leaving only after she identified herself as a police officer — without comment or apology.

“Our officers know what the Constitution is. They know what right and wrong is. And they know when people are being targeted. And that’s what they were,” Brule said.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told the New York Times that federal agents have stopped police officers’ family members, though “they’re not stopping family members of folks who are Norwegian or Irish.”

Many people of color in the Twin Cities now grab their passports before leaving the house — a previously unthinkable and unacceptable necessity of life in the modern United States.

The aggressive papers checks, which a court may very well determine are unconstitutional, are driven by a perverse incentive structure that rewards officers for the number of arrests they make, even if the people they detain are later released, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Pervasive fear

The terror the federal occupation is inflicting on immigrants — regardless of their legal status — is apparent in missed school days, doctors appointments and work shifts.

Schools, hospitals and churches have traditionally been off-limits to immigration agents, but Trump lifted the restrictions on immigration enforcement actions at sensitive locations that provide essential services in one of the first immigration policy directives of his second term.

Minneapolis Public Schools canceled school for two days after federal agents came to the high school that houses the Spanish immersion program during dismissal, hours after an ICE agent killed Good. They tackled people, handcuffed two staff members and released chemical irritants outside the school. A Border Patrol spokesperson told KARE 11 the skirmish happened after bystanders interfered with federal agents making an arrest next to the school.

In St. Paul, federal agents briefly pulled over two unmarked contract vans carrying students and staff to school in mid-January. The stops ended without incident but nevertheless frightened students and parents.

In Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb, school officials say federal agents have detained four students in two weeks, including a 5-year-old boy and his father after returning home from school and a 10-year-old and her mother on the way to school.

“ICE agents have been roaming our neighborhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lots and taking our children,” Zena Stenvik, the Columbia Heights Public School District superintendent, said at a news conference on Wednesday.

School districts across the Twin Cities metro have noted a drop in attendance from students from Latino and other immigrant families. In St. Paul, at least one-fourth of students from Spanish-speaking homes have missed every day of school since Dec. 12.

Minneapolis and St. Paul public schools have both responded by offering virtual learning options for students who don’t feel safe coming to school. It’s a better option than no school at all, and yet students still haven’t recovered from pandemic-era learning loss.

Medical providers have also reported many of their immigrant patients have stopped showing up to appointments. Diabetics are rationing insulin. Jaundiced babies are missing treatment. Mothers are laboring in hiding.

ICE agents have entered hospitals, including Hennepin County Medical Center, the largest safety-net hospital in Minnesota, without judicial warrants to guard detainees needing medical care around the clock over the objections of medical staff.

One is Alberto Castaneda Mondragon, who suffered a life-threatening brain injury shortly after being detained by ICE, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf. He doesn’t remember how he was injured and has been medically sedated since being hospitalized, but an agent told medical staff “he got his sh*t rocked,” according to the lawsuit.

ICE’s presence has sent a chilling effect throughout the hospital — on both patients and staff.

Medical staff, elected officials and immigrant rights activists held a news conference decrying ICE’s presence in the hospital in early January, and two days later DHS subpoenaed the hospital’s employment records to audit workers’ employment eligibility, which one Hennepin County commissioner called “retaliatory.”

Immigration lawyers have reported a surge in similar audits at businesses across the Twin Cities — including a St. Paul toy store with a handful of part-time employees — making the federal siege personally painful for business owners who might otherwise be immune from immigration operations.

Businesses that rely on immigrant workers — and customers — across the economy are all feeling the effects of the siege.

A new underground relief network

The siege on Minnesota has ignited a relief effort on the scale of a natural disaster response, albeit under the glaring eyes of the federal government.

Churches, schools and coffee shops have become pop-up collection centers for food and other necessities that are distributed to immigrant homes.

A trans-owned sex toy store in Minneapolis called Smitten Kitten has become one of the major distribution centers, with boxes of Kleenex and Kraft Mac and Cheese and Campbell’s soup piled up next to displays of leather harnesses and wooden paddles.

Anne Lehman has been working around the clock since putting out the call for donations on Jan. 10, directing volunteers and a steady flow of donations.

Lehman wears hoop earrings with 3D-printed whistles that people drop off by the bagful every couple days to arm observers with what’s become the signature symbol of resistance. One whistle says “Go home passport bro” and the other “beta male repellant” — they’ve gotten a fair amount of use, too.

“We all know that ICE is f*cking dweebs. They’re just cosplaying their ‘Call of Duty’ game, but they’re also actively terrorizing and traumatizing my city,” Lehman said.

People are welcome to come pick up donations right from the store, or Lehman sends it on to larger collection sites at churches and trusts it eventually makes it to people in need.

They don’t track where all the food and diapers and tubes of toothpaste go, which adds a layer of security for the people they’re trying to help.

Lehman says Smitten Kitten has gotten the attention of federal agents, and fears if they started making deliveries from the store they could unintentionally lead immigration agents to vulnerable families.

Eventually the supplies end up with families like Raquel’s.

Raquel and her husband, Jesus, have lived in the United States for more than 20 years. She works as a house cleaner, he as a roofer. They own a home in the northern suburbs where they’re raising their two kids.

But their deeply rooted lives in Minnesota became suddenly precarious under the Trump administration and his focus on Minnesota. Raquel and Jesus — who were granted anonymity to protect their identities — have had pending U visa applications for several years.

She stopped going to work in the cities, where ICE has focused much of their attention. It’s been a hit financially, although some of her clients have continued to pay her to help make ends meet. One brings her groceries.

But the suburbs aren’t free from ICE either. Her best friend’s brother was just deported with his son while doing construction work in the suburbs.

While her kids are still going to school, she stopped taking them to the mall or out to eat. She’s had to instruct them not to answer the door, and while she and her husband never leave together.

“Because in case we both get detained, my kids are at risk to be alone,” Raquel said. “We don’t have family here.”

Her boss has let her use her vehicle, since ICE can pull up vehicle registrations and appears to be targeting people with Hispanic last names. Her husband checks ICE activity online crowdsourced by an army of volunteer observers to try to avoid places where they’re active.

“We spend more on gas but that doesn’t matter to stay safe,” he said.

A growing resistance

Twin Cities residents have been turning out every day to monitor ICE activities. Car horns and whistles have become a constant in parts of the cities, alerting immigrants to lock their doors and citizens to come out and film.

Walz has encouraged Minnesotans to keep their phones handy to record any federal activity, creating a “database of atrocities” to serve as evidence in future prosecutions.

Bystanders have documented numerous instances of federal agents brutalizing people, including a border patrol agent kneeing a man in the face several times while others hold him down.

Some residents have taken to driving around the metro looking for ICE vehicles — tinted windows and out-of-state plates, usually — and then tailing them to observe, but also to distract them and slow them down.

“The more time they’re trying to get away from us, the less time they’re spending searching for people to abduct,” one patroller, Patty O’Keefe, told the Reformer.

Neighborhood group chats dedicated to tracking ICE movements regularly reach capacity at 1,000 members, while a group that trains people to be ICE watchers is looking for larger venues.

It’s become a cat and mouse game, but with the roles frequently changing.

Federal agents, in an effort to evade observers, have taken to switching the license plates on their vehicles — a crime in Minnesota, the state Department of Public Safety reminded Noem in a letter.

Sometimes they’ll lead the observers to their own homes — apparently using a law enforcement database to connect license plate numbers to addresses in an effort to intimidate observers.

They’ve also threatened and detained people for following them. O’Keefe was recently dragged from her car with another observer, Brandon Sigüenza, and detained for around eight hours before being released without charges.

Federal agents have responded to crowds of observers and hecklers with aggressive force — tackling people, spraying them in the face with chemical irritants and deploying enough tear gas to cause coughing fits in a several block radius.

High-ranking leaders on the ground have not just encouraged these tactics, but participated in them. Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, threw a can of gas in a melee that broke out when a crowd formed around a federal convoy driving slowly through a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis.

The show of force came just hours after the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court judge’s ruling in a case brought by the ACLU that sought to stop federal agents from detaining and tear gassing people engaged in peaceful protest or observation.

Resistance to ICE has gone mainstream, at least in the core cities, where businesses have plastered signs telling federal agents they’re not welcome without a judicial warrant. Scores of unions, businesses and organizations are expected to participate in a general strike on Friday.

Homeland Security posted on social media that Border Patrol agents have been struggling to find a place to go to the bathroom in Minneapolis because at each gas station they are turned away or met with groups of angry residents.

The weather hasn’t cooperated either. A steady accumulation of snow has thawed and refrozen several times as temperatures yo-yoed between unusually balmy 40s and bonechilling sub-zeros, glazing sidewalks and city streets with ice.

Federal agents have beached their SUVs and cars in slush and snowbanks across the metro, often having to call in back-up to be pushed free.

ICE agents slipping on ice has become its own genre on social media and a source of schadenfreude for many opposed to their presence.

One particularly viral moment was captured from several angles by bystanders: a Border Patrol agent in a black balaclava runs down the street before hitting a patch of ice that sends both feet skywards before he lands on his back. Observers can be seen jumping in celebration as he turns around and jogs back to his unmarked black Chevrolet Suburban.

The clip was set to praise music, mixed in ice-on-ICE compilations, and played multiple times to a cheering audience of Saturday Night Live.

Every day, protesters line the street outside the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, which briefly appeared on a list of federal buildings to be sold last year during Trump’s DOGE era and is now serving as home base for Operation Metro Surge. The office building, which houses offices for DHS, Veterans Affairs, and Fish and Wildlife Services, now serves as a short-term detention center for immigrants and protesters, who’ve described sordid, overcrowded conditions.

On a recent Saturday, several hundred protesters yelled “Shame!” and “Get the f*ck out of here!” at the steady stream of masked agents in SUVs with out-of-state license plates coming and going.

An agent in a Kia Soul with Michigan plates blew kisses over his mask as he left the building. The masked passenger of a Hyundai Tucson with Illinois plates filmed protesters on his cell phone as they pulled into the gated compound.

Eric Lofdahl of St. Paul was there shaking a small copy of the U.S. Constitution at the agents driving by, as he had been for the past few days.

“The First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, 14th Amendment… these are things that this administration doesn’t care about,” Lofdahl said.

The atmosphere is often neighborly — people hand out slices of pizza, cups of hot coffee and handwarmers.

But the appearance of law enforcement have led to frequent skirmishes and arrests, including of a person dressed as a giraffe and another as a fox.

The federal government has delivered a forceful crackdown on protesters — who they call rioters. On Thursday, longtime civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong and two other activists were arrested for protesting during a church service where one of the pastors is an ICE field director. Attorney General Pam Bondi called it an attack on a place of worship.

The White House sent out a digitally doctored photo of Levy Armstrong that showed her crying and her skin tone a darker hue.

‘For us, it’s always been the safest state’

The federal incursion is activating residents who haven’t previously been very political as it infringes on their daily lives.

Ana Alarcon, a U.S. citizen, was at the laundromat early one Sunday morning with her kids when two ICE agents came in and started questioning her. Another time, she was leaving a Mexican grocery store with her husband, a permanent U.S. resident from Mexico, and saw ICE agents stopped in traffic, studying her license plate.

“You never think Minnesota would be what it’s like now,” Alarcon said. “For us, it’s always been the safest state.”

Her daughter turned 18 this month, but they didn’t have a big party because most of her friends didn’t want to leave home.

Alarcon now carries her passport with her all the time and doesn’t let her husband leave the house alone. He doesn’t speak fluent English, and she worries he won’t even get the chance to show his papers before being detained. Also, if there’s two of them, one will be able to record it on their phone.

“We’ve noticed that if there’s only one person in the car, the agents tend to take their phones or knock it out of their hands,” Alarcon said.

She doesn’t want to be mistaken for being afraid, however. Certainly not in front of a federal agent, because she has nothing to hide.

So, for the first time, she started going to protests.

“Being afraid … it’s like venom. It’s like a sickness,” Alarcon said. “We have to get out and not show them we’re not afraid.”

Biden administration extended temporary protected status due to ongoing conflicts

BOSTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Immigrant rights advocates have filed a lawsuit seeking to block U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from ending temporary protections from deportation that had been granted to thousands of Ethiopians living in the United States.

Three Ethiopian nationals, along with the non-profit African Communities Together, allege in a lawsuit, opens new tab filed in Boston federal court on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is unlawfully putting over 5,000 people at risk of losing their temporary protected status after February 13.

They say that while Ethiopia remains a country in a humanitarian crisis, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unlawfully terminated the Ethiopians' legal status with just 60 days' notice based on an unconstitutional animus, or ill will, against non-white immigrants. Ethiopia's population is predominantly Black.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

SIMILAR LAWSUITS FILED FOR MIGRANTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

The case is the latest in a series of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's efforts to curtail protections from deportation extended to citizens of numerous countries through grants of TPS.

Under federal law, TPS is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed challenging the administration's moves to end similar protections for nationals from countries, including Syria, Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua and South Sudan, leading to court rulings that have at times slowed or halted the Trump administration's efforts to strip migrants of their legal status.

The latest lawsuit was filed after DHS said on December 12 it was ending TPS for Ethiopia, saying conditions in the African nation no longer posed a serious threat to people returning safely to it and that TPS was ""never meant to be a ticket to permanent residency.""

Former Democratic President Joe Biden's administration granted Ethiopians already in the United States that status beginning in 2022, citing the need to protect citizens fleeing armed conflict in their home nation.

The Ethiopian military and allies, including troops from neighboring Eritrea, had been battling forces from the northern region of Tigray in a conflict that killed thousands and displaced millions of people.

While that civil war formally ended later in 2022, the Biden administration extended TPS for Ethiopians in mid-2024, citing armed conflict in another region, Amhara, which is ongoing.

“After a year of constant, unchecked violence and militarization of our neighborhoods by the Trump administration—including the murder of Renee Good and Keith Porter, and the horrible violence against children, women, the elderly, and immigrants—that has horrified the nation, it is unconscionable that Congress would send $10 billion in funding to continue terrorizing our communities. The proposed FY26 Homeland Security Appropriations bill does nothing to rein in the abuse of power that we see every day in our streets.

Nurses demand the removal of immigration enforcement agents from communities, the abolition of ICE, and accountability for this administration’s crimes against all residents of the United States.

Make no mistake, the terror we are experiencing is being subsidized by our own government and is leading to irreparable harm to the working-class. Workers are being kidnapped at their place of work and being ripped away from their families. Families are often losing their sole source of household income and are unable to cover housing costs, food, and basic needs as a result. Children with immigrant parents are being pulled out of school for fear they might be separated from their parents, or worse be attacked by ICE in their own schools. Immigrant patients are delaying care for fear of being apprehended, and ICE is failing to provide necessary health care to detainees as required by law.

Instead of funding armed secret police to terrorize our Black and brown, AAPI, and indigenous neighbors, Congress must focus on the investments that nurses and working people are demanding to make our society safer, healthier, and more just.

The small investments to health agencies fail to reverse the destruction of our public health agencies caused by the Republican-led Congress and Trump administration, through last year’s budget bill and Reduction In Force (RIF) plans.

This appropriations bill also fails to reverse the $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other public health programs that will force patients to go without care and safety-net hospitals to close. It fails to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies needed to prevent huge hikes in premiums for millions of families. And ultimately, it fails to make the transformational reforms nurses and working people are demanding, in order to guarantee health care to every person in the United States free at the point of service.

Nurses know that our vision for a healthy society is possible and we will not stop fighting until it is a reality.”

The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t have a direct contract with ICE but has had a contract with the U.S.
Under this contract, Cumberland County Jail is given a daily rate to house federal detainees, including people awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation.","The federal government has moved detained immigrants out of Maine’s largest jail, a marked shift after the jail had been a detention hub during President Donald Trump’s second term so far.

While this comes amid U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s heightened activities in Maine, the people known to have been detained during the operation so far were not being held in local jails but instead sent out of state soon after apprehension.

“Folks are having issues with being able to locate their loved ones,” said Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition.

Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated ICE facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions.

On Thursday, The University of Maine’s School of Law’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic, which has helped provide legal support to more than 300 people held in the county jail during Trump’s second term, began receiving frantic calls from detainees telling their counsel they were being moved.

Anna Welch, the founding director of the clinic, has heard from jail staff that there are no longer any immigration detainees in the facility as of Friday morning, though one person the clinic has helped is still showing up as in the facility, according to ICE’s detainee locator.

Based on that locator, people have since been sent to the Federal Correctional Institution in Berlin, New Hampshire; the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island and the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts. But the locations for the majority of women removed from the jail are not yet clear, and Welch said they may be sent to Louisiana, based on conversations her co-counsel has had with detainees.

This is not the first time these people have been moved, as Welch and other attorneys said the majority of those that had been in the jail had not been apprehended in Maine and were instead moved from other facilities.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE and Cumberland County Jail did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the removal of people from the jail nor where the federal government is otherwise holding people detained during its Maine operation.

The abrupt removal from the facility comes after Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce publicly questioned on Thursday the agency’s priorities after ICE detained one of his corrections officer recruits. Joyce said the recruit had a “squeaky clean record.”

Unclear where new detainees are being held

Since the Trump administration launched its operation in Maine on Tuesday, local organizers and legal groups have tried to gather details about who has been taken and where they’re being sent, while Gov. Janet Mills and other Democratic officials are demanding transparency from the Trump administration, which has not been communicating with Maine leaders and shared few details of its plans.

With sparse information about who has been detained overall, and up to 48 hours for detainees to be entered into the tracking system, little is known about people’s whereabouts.

As of Wednesday, Cumberland County Jail hadn’t had any new bookings this week for federal immigration detainees. Before they were moved out, there had been 64 immigration detainees in the facility, with nine total new bookings in January.

Cumberland and Androscoggin County, which includes Lewiston, are the areas that have had the most ICE activity so far, based on reports verified by community organizers, though federal agents have also been seen elsewhere in recent days.

Androscoggin County Jail has only had one person with immigration related charges booked this week, but that person was brought in on Tuesday by the Lewiston Police Department on local charges. Police told the jail upon arrival that the person also had a federal detainer, meaning he’ll be held for ICE if he makes bail.

Two Bridges Regional Jail in Bath has held the second-most immigration detainees throughout Trump’s second term, but it’s also had no new immigration-related bookings since the heightened operations in Maine, intake supervisor Corporal Aaron Smith said.

The facility has five ICE detainees, but they’ve been there for an average of 301 days, with the shortest length of time being 272 days and the longest being 318 days, Smith said. They were all transferred to Two Bridges from other facilities, so it is unclear how long they’ve been in detention overall.

A pattern of moving immigrant detainees

The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, expects people already out of state could be moved again to more remote detention facilities. That’s the pattern that has emerged out of Minnesota. In that case often to a facility in Texas and more recently, in some cases, then to New Mexico.

Down South is where the largest detention facilities are. That was the case even before the Trump administration pumped more money into them through the spending bill passed in the summer.

It’s also more difficult to get attorneys to those sprawling, more remote areas, said Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union.

In Maine, someone was moved out of state this week hours before a federal judge had ordered ICE not to do so.

On Tuesday, ICE detained Yanick Joao Carneiro of Portland, an asylum seeker from Angola, at a routine immigration check-in without a warrant, according to the petition filed by his lawyer.

U.S. District Court Judge Stacey Neumann ordered ICE to explain why they arrested him. Instead, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Concannon argued in his filing that Neumann no longer had the authority to rule on Carneiro’s case because he’s in Massachusetts.

The majority of immigration detainees that had been held in Cumberland County Jail were not Maine residents and were not detained in Maine, according to attorneys providing legal assistance. Jail records don’t provide that insight, though, as records only indicate the overall agency that’s the arresting body.

But, according to attorneys, most appear to be transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.

Federal authorities may move people for any number of reasons — space, staffing — but legal experts say regardless of intent, this movement creates chaos and makes it more difficult for legal counsel to advocate for their clients and for families to keep in touch.

The use of Cumberland County Jail to aid Trump’s mass deportation agenda became clear in the spring when public records requested revealed the facility had increased detentions for federal immigration authorities.

The jail has since faced mounting pressure from community members to end its contract that permits such detentions. The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t have a direct contract with ICE but has had a contract with the U.S. Marshal Service since July 2010. Under this contract, Cumberland County Jail is given a daily rate to house federal detainees, including people awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4501-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 12:38:51.294087

Anti-ICE protests have swept across Minnesota in recent weeks in response to the shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother who was killed by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month. Good was shot three times and grazed by a fourth bullet, according to a private autopsy report released Wednesday. The Trump administration argues the officer, Jonathan Ross, was acting in self-defense.

The protesters are demanding that ICE leave Minnesota immediately, that Ross is held “legally accountable” and that federal funding to ICE is halted. They’re also demanding that ICE be investigated for “human and Constitutional violations of Americans and our neighbors.”

“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN, accountability for federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to Minnesota residents and call for Congress to immediately intervene,” the website for the protest states.

Tensions between ICE and protesters in Minnesota continued to escalate this week after a group of protesters interrupted a church service over the weekend, targeting a pastor who also holds a senior position in the regional ICE office.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday that federal agents arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, a prominent attorney and one of the alleged leaders of the protest.

ICE officers have faced renewed criticism for detaining a 5-year-old boy and his father in Minnesota after the boy had just returned from preschool.

For the past year, President Trump has tested every limit and abused every power to silence dissent, terrorize immigrants, unleash violence and chaos in our cities and neighborhoods, and expand surveillance in ways that threaten the safety of millions.

But we aren’t powerless against these attacks. This legislative session, the ACLU of New Mexico will fight —alongside our partners and community activists— to safeguard hard-fought protections New Mexico leaders have already won and to pass new, urgent bills that will shield New Mexicans’ from the Trump administration’s most dangerous attacks.

Here are the bills we’re championing—and those we’ll fight against.

That same unchecked system is also inflicting harm inside detention centers— including right here in New Mexico. For years, conditions in New Mexico’s three immigration detention centers have been dangerous and dehumanizing and the current administration has only intensified those risks. People held in detention facilities in Torrance, Cibola, and Otero counties have reported abysmal conditions like rotten food, sewage water in their cells, and the misuse of solitary confinement. Three people have also died in these facilities in recent years— a pattern reflected across the country in a rising death toll that reached its highest point in more than two decades last year.

While New Mexico cannot directly regulate ICE, we can refuse to enable a system that violates human rights and due process. At least eight other states have already passed laws limiting collaboration with ICE.

The New Mexico Immigrant Safety Act would do exactly that. It would bar state and local governments from entering into agreements to detain people for federal immigration violations, remove New Mexico from the business of mass deportation, and end the leasing of public land for immigration detention.

With detention conditions deteriorating and abuses mounting across the country, we’re standing with immigrant rights advocates to demand the passage of this urgent bill in New Mexico.

Law enforcement in New Mexico collects huge amounts of data on us through surveillance technology, including cameras known as automatic license plate readers (ALPRs). These devices, mounted on police cars or on objects like road signs and bridges, use high‑speed cameras to photograph thousands of plates per minute—creating a detailed record of where we drive.

While this technology has legitimate law enforcement uses and can help solve crimes, sharing this data with out‑of‑state or federal authorities carries serious risks. It has been used to track immigrant community members, people seeking abortion care, and activists. A recent ACLU-NM public records request showed that New Mexico ALPR cameras have been accessed thousands of times by out-of- state authorities for immigration enforcement, and at least once by Texas authorities to track a woman under criminal investigation for seeking abortion care.

New Mexico should join the growing number of states and cities that have enacted common-sense limits on how ALRP data can be used and shared.

The Driver Privacy and Safety Act would prohibit data sharing for purposes that violate New Mexico values, while ensuring law enforcement can continue using ALPRs for legitimate investigations. Passing this bill is critical to ensure outside authorities can’t turn our surveillance tools against us to target our families and communities.

Tech companies constantly harvest and sell personal data far beyond shopping preferences. Information about our immigration status, gender identity, or whether we’ve accessed reproductive healthcare can be purchased by anyone — including out‑of‑state law enforcement and anti‑LGBTQ+ politicians. Every time we post on social media or search the web, online service providers retain that information and may share it with the government. For non‑citizens, this data is already being used in visa screenings and could soon be used for other international entry decisions. Even something as simple as entering “Planned Parenthood” into Google Maps becomes part of a data trail that can be bought and weaponized.

Under an administration that is terrorizing immigrants, targeting protestors and critics, and dismantling reproductive and LGBTQ rights it is even more crucial that New Mexico strengthen its privacy protections.

CHISPA would require for‑profit companies serving New Mexicans to collect only the data that is necessary to provide the service requested, and to obtain explicit consent before collecting, processing, or sharing anything more—an opt‑in standard far stronger than the typical opt‑out model. Critically, the bill has teeth by giving individuals the right to sue when their privacy is violated. We’ll be working alongside the NM CHISPA coalition to pass this bill and ensure that New Mexicans — not corporations or hostile governments — control their own data.

Everyone in New Mexico deserves to live in safe communities, and we have the ability to make real progress on safety this session. What we know from experience and research is that the safest communities are those where everyone is housed, where everyone can access the healthcare they need voluntarily, and where everyone has access to quality jobs and education. Investments in these areas are investments in public safety.

This year, with our partners in the All Safe New Mexico coalition, we’re asking the legislature to make significant investments in housing services so that New Mexicans can build and maintain lasting stability in their lives. We’re also asking legislators to continue leading the country on harm reduction and a public‑health approach to substance use by studying overdose prevention centers and ensuring that people can access medication‑assisted treatment in their communities.

At the same time, we must reject proposals that expand mass incarceration or make it easier to involuntarily commit people who are unhoused—the very approach President Trump advanced in his dangerous executive order last year. Policies that increase sentences, create new crimes, target youth, or push people into locked institutions won’t make us safer. They will deepen the challenges our communities have faced for years.

We’re advocating for common‑sense, root‑cause solutions that strengthen our communities and promote real safety, not policies that criminalize people.",https://www.aclu-nm.org/app/uploads/2026/01/sean-quillen-kwNWq3FtETs-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 12:38:54.270749

Northfield city leaders are emphasizing their commitment to constitutional principles, public safety, and community trust as federal immigration enforcement actions continue to spark fear and disruption across Minnesota.

On Tuesday night, during the regular City Council meeting, Mayor Erica Zweifel read a prepared statement addressing concerns raised by residents about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity both locally and statewide. The statement, now posted on the city’s website, outlines Northfield’s values, clarifies the city’s limited role in federal immigration enforcement, and directs residents to local resources.

The statement, the full text of which can be read here, acknowledges the fear and uncertainty expressed by families, students, businesses, and faith communities. While emphasizing that cities do not control federal immigration policy, Zweifel said Northfield has a responsibility to speak clearly about its values and expectations.

Zweifel referenced the city’s vision of being “open, safe, and welcoming,” and noted that city council members and local officials are sworn to uphold the U.S. Constitution. She also publicly recognized Police Chief Jeff Schroepfer and the Northfield Police Department, stressing that local police do not enforce federal immigration law and remain focused on professionalism, de-escalation, and serving the entire community.

“They’re stuck between a rock and a hard place,” she said.

City Administrator Ben Martig echoed those concerns, describing both operational and community impacts stemming from current ICE tactics. Martig, who oversees the police department, said there has historically been limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities in cases involving serious crimes, but current conditions are different.

He cited a recent incident reported by Brooklyn Park’s police chief involving armed ICE agents stopping an off-duty officer as an example of escalating concerns, and he said just the threat of aggressive ICE situations has already affected the city.

“As we’ve talked about, there’s been a long history of cooperation with immigration enforcement and in particular around the more serious crimes that would be occurring than trying to do enforcement with those limited individuals where that comes into play. We’re in a different world right now where there’s no communication happening, a lot of questionable use of force that we’ve observed, tactics that are happening. And so that’s really caused an impact.”

According to Martig, the situation is straining city operations, diverting staff time toward communications and crisis response, and affecting local service providers, schools, and the economy.

Zweifel’s statement calls on federal immigration officials to uphold due process, avoid intimidation, respect free speech, and operate transparently. She also urged Minnesota’s elected leaders to affirm peace and dignity and support accountability where concerns arise.

The city has expanded access to immigration-related information through its website, including recorded presentations by immigration attorneys, resources curated by the Human Rights Commission, and links to community partners such as the Community Action Center.

In her statement, the Mayor said that Northfield remains committed to the common good of all who live, learn, work, worship, and do business here, and added that city leaders will continue to lead “with care, clarity, and a steadfast commitment to our community.”",https://kymnradio.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Vertical-Lockup_3_RGB-01.png,N,,2026-01-23 12:38:57.855790

Speaking at a conference in Geneva, Mr. Turk said he was astounded by the acts of “now-routine abuse and denigration” carried out by U.S. immigration officials.

“Where is the concern for their dignity and our common humanity?” the Austrian said. “Those who dare to speak up or protest peacefully against heavy-handed immigration raids are vilified and threatened by officials and, on occasion, subject to arbitrary violence themselves.”

The Trump administration said its rounding up of illegal immigrants has helped secure the U.S.-Mexico border and resulted in the arrest and deportation of hundreds of thousands of criminal migrants, including drug traffickers, murderers, rapists and gang members.

The Washington Times reached out to the White House for comment.

Mr. Turk acknowledged that sovereign nations have the authority to establish migration policies but said they must be done in accordance with the law.

“Adhering to due process is crucial to the legality and legitimacy of any policy,” he said. “If these principles are not followed, it will more broadly erode public trust, diminish legal certainty, weaken institutional legitimacy and violate individuals’ rights.”

Mr. Turk also denounced what he called unnecessary or disproportionate enforcement operations.

“Under international law, the intentional use of lethal force is only permissible as a measure of last resort against an individual representing an imminent threat to life,” he said.

Mr. Turk appeared to be referring to the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Jonathan Ross.

Trump administration officials said the ICE agent acted in self-defense because she was driving toward him during an anti-immigration protest in Minneapolis. Local officials in Minnesota have challenged the federal government’s narrative of what happened, saying Good was steering away from Mr. Ross when she was shot.

Mr. Turk said U.S. history has been shaped by the contributions that migrants have made.

The trio were driving to work in the fields when an unmarked SUV with police flashers pulled them over.

Unbeknownst to the group, their vehicle had been flagged using a powerful new data tool, part of the government’s expanding surveillance capabilities.

An ICE officer initially yelled at the driver to roll down the window. When the driver didn’t move fast enough, the officer then smashed the window. Almost immediately, a swarm of SUVs surrounded the car. The officers did not identify themselves as ICE or provide any explanation as to why they had made the traffic stop. They detained everyone in the van.

MJMA (as the asylum seeker is referred to in court filings to protect her from government reprisals) was terrified as agents pulled her out of the vehicle. Officers broke her finger as they handcuffed her, pinning her arms behind her back. “I felt so powerless and anxious,” she later told her lawyers.

MJMA was first transported to a holding cell in Portland. She was then quickly transferred out of state to Tacoma, Washington.

Her arrest, similar in many respects to the barrage of ICE detentions in communities nationwide, stands out for one fact. It involved the deployment of ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement).

This powerful surveillance software, developed by Palantir Technologies, comes thanks to a $60 million investment by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The investment funds the ongoing enhancement of a suite of data weapons to track, target, detain, and deport immigrants.

Track, target, detain

MJMA’s detention was part of Operation Black Rose, specifically designed to give ICE agents experience in using ELITE. The surveillance tool has been described in some detail by 404 Media, a leading news service specializing in reporting on technology advances. In essence, ELITE facilitates ICE targeting of entire areas with concentrations of immigrants. The software then allows agents to aggregate data from multiple sources to target them.

Reports from Operation Black Rose suggest the data tools need further refinement. For example, Mobile Fortify, widely used to identify individuals’ legal status mis-identified MJMA twice.

As is typical in software that incorporates AI, however, performance may improve as additional data is acquired. If ICE gains access to large administrative datasets—e.g. MedicAid or SNAP—ICE can then use AI to merge that personal data with commercially available cellphone and social media data, together with license plate data, to make surveillance and arrests still easier. This can, of course, also increase the likelihood of mistakes.

News reports in Chicago and Minneapolis, meanwhile, suggest that ICE’s ability to cross-reference disparate data sources is rapidly expanding.

‘At large’ arrests

This all means more cost-effective and indiscriminate targeting of immigrants, criminal or otherwise. The Cato Institute reported in November (based on leaked internal Department of Homeland Security data) that only 5% of all ICE detainees had been convicted of a violent crime. Some 73% had not been convicted of any crime.

In states like Oregon, where MJMA was arrested and where state law prohibits police from cooperating with ICE, tools like ELITE allow the agency to carry out wide-area surveillance. It is no coincidence that Oregon is among the states where most ICE detentions (80%) have been warrantless “at large” arrests of non-criminals.

Part of ELITE’s appeal is cost. Historically, the average cost of an individual deportation has been approximately $17,000. Reaching the administration’s objective of 1 million deportations per year would therefore run upwards of $17 billion annually.

The technology also comes as the administration has removed guardrails protecting against warrantless search and seizure. Following Trump’s 2025 Executive Order, new DHS guidelines no longer limit ICE to detaining just criminals. The agency can now arrest virtually any unauthorized immigrant.

Those now vulnerable to arbitrary arrest in community-wide ICE sweeps empowered by ELITE include DACA recipients. It also includes immigrants like MJMA, who was planning to seek asylum.

Legal aid

In her case, MJMA was able to secure her release after just two days in detention, thanks to legal aid from Innovation Law Lab. The Portland based organization filed a class action lawsuit on her behalf. The suit calls into question ICE’s increasing numbers of warrantless arrests. It also challenges how the agency uses data-weapons such as ELITE to conduct wide-area sweeps in immigrant neighborhoods.

Two other Oregon immigrants—one a middle-aged Guatemalan woman who is a small store owner and a legal permanent resident, the other a middle-aged man who has lived in the U.S. for 40 years, a U visa applicant and is lawfully present and employed—were added to the litigation as co-plaintiffs in December. Both were roughly and arbitrarily detained in “at large” arrests similar to MJMA’s.

ICE’s use of data-weapons such as ELITE broadens the digital dragnet it uses for indiscriminate arrests in what it calls “target rich” environments. The focus is not actually on detaining “the worst of the worst.” The aim is to bulk up numbers of daily arrests to meet the arbitrary quota of 3,000 set by White House advisor Stephen Miller.

Yet despite the power and financial resources available to ICE, sound legal support can make a huge difference. That is especially the case for detained immigrants like MJMA and her co-plaintiffs. Unlike immigration courts, which are controlled by the Department of Justice, federal courts remain committed to following the law. Of which ICE’s current aggressive enforcement often falls afoul.

Increased ICE funding

There is no definitive information about the proportion of ICE detentions which stem from warrantless arrests. It is likely, however, that in 2025 at least one-third, or several hundred thousand detentions were warrantless, at-large arrests made during community sweeps.

Given dramatic increases in FY26 federal funding for ICE—President Trump’s yearly budget includes a proposed $11.3 billion for the agency—and escalating enforcement, improved surveillance technology such as ELITE is a worrisome weapon. (The House on Thursday passed a spending package that includes increased funding for ICE. Seven Democrats joined with Republicans in approving the measure.)

As we saw in Los Angeles and now in Minneapolis, ICE tactics initially used against immigrants can be easily deployed and viciously used against US citizens as well.

Neuman: Lessons for Birthright Citizenship from Suspension of Deportation HRP Associate Director and J. Sinclair Armstrong Professor of International, Foreign, and Comparative Law Gerald L. Neuman has released a new draft article, “Lessons for Birthright Citizenship from Suspension of Deportation.” While much has been written about why the Executive Order purporting to abolish birthright citizenship violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Professor Neuman argues there is a “prior issue that has received less discussion”: the Executive Order “also violates the Immigration and Nationality Act” (INA).

Neuman: Lessons for Birthright Citizenship from Suspension of Deportation

HRP Associate Director and J. Sinclair Armstrong Professor of International, Foreign, and Comparative Law Gerald L. Neuman has released a new draft article, “Lessons for Birthright Citizenship from Suspension of Deportation.” While much has been written about why the Executive Order purporting to abolish birthright citizenship violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Professor Neuman argues there is a “prior issue that has received less discussion”: the Executive Order “also violates the Immigration and Nationality Act” (INA).

Senator Angus King is criticizing the escalating surge of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in his home state.
Or have they only been arrested and not convicted?” King said.
King said his staff has reached out to ICE but has not gotten a response, and his request for an in-person briefing in Maine was denied.
“ICE has been operating under an internal memo from last May that essentially allows ICE agents to enter a home without a warrant,” King said.","PORTLAND, Maine — Maine independent U.S. Senator Angus King is criticizing the escalating surge of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in his home state.

“What I have been hearing is there is terrorizing of American citizens going on, but it's by ICE, not by the people that they are arresting,” King told reporters at Portland City Hall on Thursday, three hours after Governor Janet Mills held a briefing in the same room. “If the purpose here is to stop allowing people to terrorize American citizens, they ought to look in the mirror.”

Before briefing reporters, King had met or spoken with the mayors of Portland, Biddeford, and Lewiston. “Parents are afraid to take their kids to school. They're afraid to put them on the bus,” King said. “And I'm hearing from employers who are having a fairly high level of absenteeism.”

ICE this week began a search for 1,400 immigrants it calls Operation Catch of the Day, resulting in 50 arrests in the first 24 hours, the agency said, describing only four of the detainees, one of whom had been convicted of driving under the influence.

“One of my questions is, who are the other 46?” King said. “They haven't told us. So, that tells me that there's a skunk here.”

King said he wanted to know why individuals are being sought by ICE agents. “They've said that there are 1,400 targets in Maine. We'd like to know the nature of those targets. What crimes are they charged with? Have they been convicted? Or have they only been arrested and not convicted?” King said.

King said his staff has reached out to ICE but has not gotten a response, and his request for an in-person briefing in Maine was denied.

“What bothers me about that is that this entire operation is based on the premise—and I'll read it from their press release—‘an immigration enforcement effort across the state of Maine targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.’ That's the mission,” King said. “Let's call this what it is. This is a large-scale mass deportation effort, and let's drop the pretense that somehow this is about the worst of the worst.”

King asked, “Where are these people going, where are they being held, and under what circumstances? But the damage to children, to families, the breadwinner who's being taken away, what's going to happen to that family? Are we going to see a surge in evictions in a month or so because of this?”

King blasted the agency for running afoul of the Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable searches.

“ICE has been operating under an internal memo from last May that essentially allows ICE agents to enter a home without a warrant,” King said. “It's blatantly unconstitutional.”

King theorized some names on the ICE target list may have come from shared Internal Revenue Service data, as many undocumented people in this country pay taxes, or perhaps from a list of immigrants who have obtained or applied for work permits.

King said he supports the apprehension of illegal immigrants using normal tactics.

King said, “It's not necessarily that we are against enforcing our immigration laws; it's the manner in which it's going forward, and I have never in my experience seen law enforcement agencies with masks on, without body cams, often without identification.”

King forewarned there could be a reckoning over ICE’s activities when the budget for the Department of Homeland Security is debated next week in Washington.

When asked why he hasn’t been able to get answers from the Trump administration, King said, “I’m not sure they want sunlight into what’s going on.”

Organizers are calling for no work, no school and no shopping, and some businesses said they would close their doors as part of the civil action.

“This is a bigger thing than the weather,” said Larry Weiss, a retired resident who patrols on his block alongside his wife and noted it was supposed to be about “eight below” in the city on Friday. “They are trying to break us and we are not going to be broken,” he said.

Posters calling for statewide action and promoting the protest march and rally are pasted in the windows of businesses near the University of Minnesota. In the LynLake area, a few businesses had posted signs warning that neither Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs nor Border Patrol were welcome inside their stores without a valid judicial warrant.

“Everyone is welcome here, except I.C.E.,” reads a sign on the door to Wrecktangle Pizza.

Three weeks since 37-year-old U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer, the defiance of the city’s residents remains on full display.

Jeff Rogers, one of the Wrecktangle owners, said the pizza restaurant would be closed Friday and he’d attend the protest. The restaurant industry in the city is being suffocated by ICE’s presence, he said.

“It’s tearing our restaurant community apart … everyone’s seen all the evidence of all this bulls---. It’s horrific and not something we condone,” he said.

Beckett’s, a nearby sports bar, also planned to close, said Frank, one of the managers who declined to give his last name as he expressed concern over his co-workers.

“We have one of our head cooks who hasn’t come in for a month now because he’s afraid. We’re all just supporting him. We also have other cooks that also are worried about it, but they need to pay their bills,” he said of his immigrant co-workers.

Craig, a local businessman who did not want his last name used and did not want his business identified over fears of backlash, said he has canceled all his Friday appointments to support the protest. He said most of his clients were supportive.

One of his co-workers is of Hmong descent, Craig said, and has had a lot of ICE activity in his neighborhood.

“I don’t know how fearful he is, but I am fearful for him,” said Craig, who added he’s been locking his business' door to offer a safe place for University of Minnesota international students.

“They’ve maybe felt all week unsafe and they can come in here and maybe feel safe that maybe I’m a trusted person,” he said.

In response to a question about the planned protest and the closing of some businesses, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stated in an email on Wednesday, “the fact that those groups want to shut down Minnesota’s economy, which provides law-abiding American citizens an honest living, to fight for illegal alien murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, drug dealers, and terrorists says everything you need to know.""

On Tuesday, Greg Bovino, Border Patrol's commander-at-large, and Marcos Charles, ICE’s executive director of enforcement and removal operations, touted the arrests of more than 3,000 people in the Minneapolis region since last month, including “some of the most dangerous offenders,” they said at a news conference. Bovino said the actions he’s witnessed from immigration enforcement agents have been “professional” and “lawful,” after he was asked about concerns from local law enforcement that people were being racially profiled.

In the neighborhood where Good was shot, the streets were covered by snow on Wednesday. At mid-morning, a burst of whistles and car horns broke the icy quiet as drivers and pedestrians blowing whistles started following a group of vehicles they identified as belonging to federal agents. After a few blocks, the cacophony subsided.

Despite days of bone-chilling winter weather, residents could be seen throughout the week on street corners and navigating the snow piles on sidewalks as they monitored any actions by ICE or Border Patrol agents.

Networks of volunteers have grown by the thousands, according to a person who acts as a “dispatcher” to groups, including those who respond quickly to arrest sites in order to document immigration enforcement activity. Volunteer medics and chaplains also roam neighborhoods where ICE operations play out, ready to tend to anyone impacted by tear gas or pepper spray.

“None of us want to be doing this. I don’t, but we simply cannot stand by as other Minnesotans are being hurt,” said Ben Damberg, who helps thousands of people communicate on Signal channels, coordinating responses to ICE operations around the city. “We will march, we will protest, and we will do it all peacefully above all else.”

A massive mobilization network

While some residents have been acting as rapid responders, others have been mobilizing and doing the kind of work seen in natural disasters such as floods or fires.

Earlier this month, Rogers’ business began providing free frozen pizzas to immigrant families for every pizza bought. The donation drive began in early January after a confrontation with federal agents who were refused entry to the restaurant.

The restaurant shortened its hours to have more hands to prepare the pizzas and meal kits for families and handle donations.

On Wednesday, Rogers said in a social media post that the restaurant had raised $200,000 and would put that money in a fund to support other nonprofits as it continues to give frozen pizzas and meal kits to families.

At Dios Habla Hoy church, in south Minneapolis, volunteers were stacking dozens of small bags of flour and other staples that were coming into the church. It’s the sort of relief-operation work volunteers might do after a major disaster.

Sergio Amezcua, the church’s pastor, said he has a network of 4,000 volunteers. They help him distribute food to families in need, many of them immigrants who won’t leave home for fear of being arrested by federal officers.

On Wednesday, Amezcua said the church delivered boxes to 1,500 families in about six hours. About 300 volunteers served as drivers and helped Amezcua deliver the boxes. The church is distributing about 100 tons of food weekly, the pastor said.

Last Friday, the church had run out of food and Amezcua sent a message to volunteers asking if they could do some shopping. In three hours, the church was filled with food.

“This is a humanitarian crisis in Minnesota,” he said. He said the disaster-like response honors Renee Good.

“Her life shouldn’t be forgotten. She is going to be a hero for our community,” he said.

Aside from donation mobilizations, other residents are expressing support to the city’s immigrant community in other ways. A community singing group has been performing at the site where Good was fatally shot.

“It’s such a sacred and difficult place,” said Timothy Frantzich, of the Perfection-Free Community Singing Circle, who spoke to NBC News last week. “But I think if we can bring something beautiful, then maybe we can bring something beautiful to a difficult place.”

One of the singers, who asked to be identified as Z. Brown out of fear due to the ongoing tensions in the city, described a feeling of “helplessness, and wanting to do something” after Good’s death and recent enforcement actions impacting her immigrant neighbors.

Brown said there was an uncomfortable truth about it all, which was that those who didn’t look like her, a white woman, couldn’t come out and support the community for fear of being aggressively targeted by ICE.

“It’s important as white people, we can be out here right now and we can be in this space,” she said. “It’s just, we feel like we have to do that, because there are so many people right now who are literally hiding.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260122-minneapolis-ice-vl-1127a-d5185f.jpg",N,,2026-01-23 13:38:29.551886

Meanwhile, district leaders say they’ll do more to support school staff when such reports emerge.

The accounts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity led four schools in south Seattle — Mercer International Middle School, Aki Kurose Middle School, Cleveland STEM High School, and Maple Elementary — to enact shelter-in-place protocols for several hours Tuesday, according to district officials. That means all of a school’s exterior doors are locked while normal instruction and operations continue inside.

Other schools nearby took different “precautionary measures,” the district said — including Dearborn Park International and Beacon Hill International elementary schools, which the district had earlier incorrectly said sheltered in place.

District officials previously called the reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity “credible,” but in a statement Wednesday said security staff were at each school that sheltered in place Tuesday and “did not observe any ICE presence at or near SPS campuses.”

“The district continues to monitor information closely and works to verify all reports before acting,” the district said, adding that it “remains alert to community concerns.”

Interim Superintendent Fred Podesta said Wednesday the district has strong policies in place if immigration enforcement affects a school building, and that all principals have been trained on them.

He also emphasized that ICE agents are not allowed on district property without a verified warrant or court order.

But Podesta also acknowledged that the district can do more, including by better supporting principals who have to make decisions such as whether to shelter in place on the fly with little information — unlike when other law enforcement activity happens near a school.

“Usually there are hard facts and we’re working with law enforcement agencies. In this case, there’s just a lot of information flying around,” Podesta said. “I don’t think we’ve given school leaders all the tools they need for dealing with that ambiguity, so we are going to work hard to correct that to make sure there's a bit more centralized decision-making and consensus-building before we take action.”

A spokesperson for the Seattle Police Department said it received no calls reporting ICE near schools Tuesday. ICE did not respond to KUOW’s inquiry about whether agents had been in the area on Tuesday.

Still, the incident has rattled local leaders and left Seattle school communities fearful — especially as immigration enforcement in Minnesota has led to children being physically hurt or detained, including a 5-year-old boy whose lawyers say he was used as “bait” to draw family members outside their home.

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday wrote on X: “This is disturbing. We’re monitoring the situation closely.”

Seattle Mayor Katie Wilson’s team said it’s also watching the situation, but does not have “concrete information on increased ICE activity in Seattle.”

King County Councilmember Rhonda Lewis applauded the quick action taken by the schools, saying in a statement that she’s “concerned about the ongoing impacts of this kind of activity in King County, especially in historically marginalized communities.”

At a school board meeting Wednesday, half a dozen parents, teachers, and community members urged the district to take a stronger stance against immigration enforcement activity.

“There’s a lot of work being done by the community,” said one speaker, Gloria Ramirez, through an interpreter. “But we’re not getting that kind of support from the institutions — the school system, the district — that we need.”

Ramirez called on the district to provide families with more information, including through informational nights and workshops so they can better understand their rights and how to stay safe.

“The problems that we’re seeing right now — they’re big, and they're only going to get bigger down the road,” she added.

Parents and teachers also called for better communication from district officials if they receive reports of ICE near schools and decide to shelter in place.

Gela Simpson is a special educator at Aki Kurose Middle School. One of her kids attends Aki, the other Maple Elementary. Both schools sheltered in place on Tuesday. Simpson said she didn’t learn about the suspected ICE activity or shelter-in-place at Maple Elementary until a staff member texted her. Shortly after, one of her coworkers at Aki heard similar information, prompting their school to also shelter in place.

“There was a huge fracture with communication and the training that we have as educators in order to know how to respond appropriately,” Simpson said.

Simpson said most of her students didn’t attend school the following day — and those who did were frightened.

“At the end of the day, I don’t want to see my student running down the hallway screaming, ‘Miss Gela, I don’t want to be killed. I don’t want to lose my family,’” Simpson said through tears. “We have to do better.”

Jazmin Chavez, an educator at South Shore PK-8 in Seattle’s Rainier Beach neighborhood, said she’s seen an increase in families navigating ICE activity and deportation orders in recent weeks.

“Some students have already withdrawn, and others are at risk of leaving in the coming weeks or months,” Chavez told the board. “These are students who have built strong relationships and a sense of belonging at our school — and it’s heartbreaking to see that stability disrupted so suddenly.”

That fear has escalated quickly since Tuesday, Chavez said. Parents were scared to pick up their kids from school, and the situation “highlighted how vulnerable families are during moments of uncertainty, and how unprepared schools might be when fear spreads faster than accurate information.”

While the South Shore school community did its best to rally around families with support, Chavez said they need more support from district officials.

“Without clear structures, it has made coordination and collective action that much more difficult,” Chavez said.

“Our district serves a large population of families impacted by immigration policies — too many to ignore or treat as isolated cases,” she added. “Larger scale partnerships, clear guidance, or even a policy-level stance that advocates for our communities could help schools navigate these moments more thoughtfully and consistently.”",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/0776e577cbb993e7bc2aed4b5d74a4a4.jpeg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2026-01-23 13:38:34.478739

Last week, Senate Republicans were only able to narrowly dismiss the Venezuela war powers resolution after the Trump administration persuaded two Republicans to back away from their earlier support.

The tied vote was the latest sign of House speaker Mike Johnson’s tenuous hold on the majority, as well as some of the growing pushback in the Republican-controlled Congress to the US president’s aggressions in the western hemisphere. A Senate vote on a similar resolution was also tied last week until JD Vance broke the deadlock.

To defeat the Democratic-backed resolution on Thursday, Republican leaders had to hold the vote open for more than 20 minutes while Republican congressman Wesley Hunt, who had been out of Washington all week campaigning for a Senate seat in Texas, rushed back to Capitol Hill to cast the decisive vote.

On the House floor, Democrats responded with shouts that Republican leaders were violating the chamber’s procedural rules. Two Republicans –Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky – voted with all Democrats for the legislation.

The war powers resolution would have directed Trump to remove US troops from Venezuela. The Trump administration told senators last week that there are no US troops on the ground in Venezuela and committed to obtaining congressional approval before launching major military operations there.

But Democrats argued that the resolution is necessary after US troops captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, in a surprise nighttime raid earlier this month that left Congress in the dark.

Thursday’s vote was the latest test in Congress of how much leeway Republicans will give a president who campaigned on removing the US from foreign entanglements but has increasingly reached for military options to impose his will. So far, almost all Republicans have declined to put checks on Trump through the war powers votes.

Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House armed services committee, accused Democrats of bringing the war powers resolution to a vote out of “spite” for Trump.

Still, Democrats stridently argued that Congress needs to assert its role in determining when the president can use wartime powers. They have been able to force a series of votes in both the House and Senate as Trump, in recent months, ramped up his campaign against Maduro and set his sights on other conflicts overseas.

“Donald Trump is reducing the United States to a regional bully with fewer allies and more enemies,” Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said during a floor debate.

Last week, Senate Republicans were only able to narrowly dismiss the Venezuela war powers resolution after the Trump administration persuaded two Republicans to back away from their earlier support.

Trump’s recent military actions – and threats to do more – have reignited a decades-old debate in Congress over the War Powers Act, which dates back to the Vietnam war era.

Trump’s insistence that the US will possess Greenland over the objections of Denmark, a Nato ally, has alarmed some Republicans on Capitol Hill. They have mounted some of the most outspoken objections to almost anything the president has done since taking office.

Trump this week backed away from military and tariff threats against European allies as he announced that his administration was working with Nato on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.

But Bacon still expressed frustration with Trump’s aggressive foreign policy and voted for the war powers resolution even though it only applies to Venezuela.

“I’m tired of all the threats,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1789da10790428f47291efdb2b1f6e759c865d46/1078_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=945636a8bc827693e8ed803d3c7b0bd1",N,,2026-01-23 10:58:24.739842

On Thursday, hundreds of clergy and faith leaders of many faith groups gathered for relationship-building, spiritual grounding, and orientation to what is happening on the ground in Minneapolis.

“I am keenly aware that what is happening here is happening across the country … so I feel it is important for us to have a national witness,” Rev. Mariann Budde, an Episcopal prelate who is Bishop of Washington, D.C., told UU World. Budde gained national attention in January when she addressed President Trump directly during a prayer service for the inauguration, calling on him to have mercy on transgender children and immigrant families.

UUs “are here in large numbers relative to your size, and your faith tradition has such a history of commitment to social justice, and that is well represented here,” Budde told UU World. “I think [UUs] would feel a combination of both heartbreak at what’s happening [and] an incredible sense of honor and pride to be a part of people of faith and goodwill, who are doing lots of things, large and small, to keep the fabric of society woven together.”

Rev. Ben Atherton-Zeman, minister at the UU Church of St. Petersburg, Florida, is one who answered the call to Minneapolis. “I am here for reasons of morality and ethics. ICE, I feel, has sacrificed any moral authority in the way they have done their job so poorly, so illegally, so violently,” he told UU World. “I would say [to all UUs] to answer the call.”

Erol Delos Santos, a Union Theological Seminary graduate preparing for UU ministry, is director of congregational life at UU Society of Oneonta, New York. “Oneonta is a pretty rural congregation, and I think there’s a misconception that the presence of ICE doesn’t really reach rural congregations in a way that it reaches major cities,” Santos said. “So I really wanted to take a look at the impact myself and bring those facts and that public witness back to my congregation to let them know that this is a military occupation … And when this call came out, it seemed like a good call to follow. I feel really supported and hopeful that so many different denominations and faith traditions are coming together with a similar purpose.”

On Thursday evening, Rev. Dr. Sofía Betancourt, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), gave the after-dinner prayer at a local church that hosted about 200 people for dinner. “Let us be reminded of the greater calling, the greater possibility, the greatest promise of our living tradition,” Betancourt said, adding, “We are moving and joining movements through the strength of all those who worked and fought and sacrificed and struggled for the freedom, the wholeness, the well-being of all, for that love that abides, which resides in us, as long as we are on this planet.”

At a press conference earlier Thursday, ten faith leaders stood as a group, including Betancourt and Lena Gardner, executive director of BLUU (Black Lives of Unitarian Universalism), who lives in Minneapolis. Those who spoke included Budde, who said, “A dangerous line has been crossed. Peaceful protestors are being killed. This moment calls us all to moral clarity and civic responsibility.” Jamie Beran, CEO of Bend the Arc, a Jewish social justice group, also addressed the media, saying, “When people like me from across this nation saw our neighbors in need, and heard the call from our friends here in Minnesota, we came from all over the nation to stand together … There is no holier call to action than the call to action for each other.”

Valerie Kaur, a Sikh activist and founder of the Revolutionary Love Project, also spoke at the press conference, saying, “Revolutionary love is the choice to leave no one outside of our circle of care, to risk ourselves for one another, to show up with whistles when they have guns. And that love is a force that this administration cannot defeat.”

In putting out the call to clergy, MARCH described Minneapolis as “at the center of a crisis that has been long in the making,” and a “crisis of our Constitution, federal overreach, militarized enforcement, and the erosion of civil liberties.” It added, “We therefore call on clergy and faith leaders of all faiths, representative of every part of the country, to join us for a day of witness and resistance …”

MARCH said the current crisis in the Twin Cities has “echoes of Selma [Alabama],” a reference to the Selma March of 1965, when Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., put out a nationwide call to clergy to travel there to support the struggle for civil rights. “It is in that same spirit—and with that same clarity—that we issue this call now,” MARCH added.

Rev. Terri Burnor, executive director of the Minnesota Unitarian Universalist Social Justice Alliance (MUUSJA) and a lifelong Minnesotan, is on the MARCH core planning team. “People do not understand what it is like here, what it’s like to be in an occupied territory,” Burnor said Thursday. “They don’t understand what it’s like to have helicopters flying over your head, to have whistles blowing, to have people showing up to patrol their daycare centers and their schools.”

Rev. Laura Smidzik, assistant minister of First Universalist Church of Minneapolis, helped distribute warm clothing to attendees on Thursday. “We have 3,000 ICE agents on the ground here. Restaurants are closing because they can’t keep their staff there. [Agents] are around schools and hospitals,” she said. MARCH organized the call to clergy in six days, Smidzik said, adding, “People are desperate to help and want to be part of this larger community that we’re creating here. People are standing up.”

On January 7, 2026, Good, a U.S. citizen and 37-year-old mother of three, was shot dead in Minneapolis by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, sparking immediate protests in that city and around the country. President Donald Trump and others in his administration claimed the agent acted in self-defense, while many others insist the shooting was entirely unjustified and a violation of law enforcement procedure. In one of a number of targeted immigration enforcement efforts, Trump has sent over 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota in “Operation Metro Surge.” Good’s killing has intensified national calls for the abolition of ICE, which has been involved in numerous violent confrontations and shootings during Trump’s second term.

“The ICE ‘surge’ that cost the life of Renée Nicole Good is violating the Constitutional and human rights of Americans and our neighbors,” according to ICE Out. The Day of Truth and Freedom is calling for ICE to leave Minnesota immediately, for the officer who killed Good to be held legally accountable, for the end to any more federal funding for ICE, for ICE to be investigated for Constitutional and human rights violations, and for the state of Minnesota as well as national corporations—including Target, Delta, Home Depot, Hilton, and Enterprise—to stop economic relations with, and other supports for, ICE.

Minutes after Good was killed on January 7, a number of UU ministers and laypeople rushed to the scene, including Rev. Ashley Horan, the UUA’s vice president for Programs and Ministries. Horan, who resides near the site of the shooting, livestreamed from the scene. Her footage captures ICE agents firing chemical irritants at protesters, according to a report from the Religion News Service. In a video she posted on Facebook, Horan said federal agents were attempting to “fracture and terrorize our communities,” which goes against UU values.

Rev. Jen Crow, senior minister of First Universalist Church of Minneapolis, described ICE’s presence on the scene as “an overwhelming show of force,” saying that over fifty agents were present after Good’s killing, many heavily armed. “It was a war zone,” she said.

“It’s felt hard to tell people outside of Minneapolis what is happening here. And this could happen anywhere,” Horan told UU World. “Renée Good was killed one block from my house, and I had to explain to my child what had happened, and it was devastating to me. But when we drive through my neighborhood with my children on the way to school, I can say, ‘Look, those are the people who are patrolling to keep our neighbors safe. Look at the parents standing outside the school across the street who are making sure that classmates can get in and go to school … I don’t know anybody in Minneapolis who isn’t doing something.”

In a January 14 interview with the Religious News Service, Horan, who since Good’s killing has patrolled her Minneapolis neighborhood looking for the presence of ICE, pointed to the history of UUs in the famous civil rights march in Selma. During that action, Rev. James Reeb, a UU minister from Massachusetts, was killed by white supremacists, and Viola Liuzzo, a UU and civil rights activist from Michigan, was murdered by Ku Klux Klan members as she was driving activists who were participating in the march. They were responding to a call to clergy from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to join the march.

“Those folks are very front of mind right now, particularly Viola Liuzzo and the ways in which she feels so similar to Renée Good,” Horan told RNS. “She was a mom, she was somebody who was drawn to just show up in ways that she could and ended up losing her life because of her convictions.”",https://www.uuworld.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_2400x2400_no_upscale/public/2026-01/MARCH_day1_2.jpg?itok=PWLVrE9c,N,,2026-01-23 14:04:18.821838

BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”

During the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”

“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”

In his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.

“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.

A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment

During last year’s trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.

Among the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.

The three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.

But in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.

The decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.

Another was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel’s war in Gaza.

During the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country’s top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.

“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”

Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”

“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",https://firstamendmentwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05T224415Z_614720175_RC2YUIAW0TXI_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 10:58:35.670972

4 hours ago

The first week of 2026 was brutal. Reports of abuse of power, including the unwarranted use of force against civilians, have already resulted in the killing of a citizen, numerous preventable injuries and the deaths of more than 30 people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody since 2025.

Yet just as alarming is the lack of meaningful engagement and leadership from most of the Georgia delegation in Washington, D.C., in preventing further harm to their constituents and especially to the futures of millions of U.S.-citizen children.

“We will walk in below-zero degrees in one of the coldest days in Minnesota,” Emilia González Avalos with UNIDOS Minnesota, one of the groups behind the event, told CNN’s Sara Sidner.

The wind chill in Minneapolis is not expected to rise above -20 today. The march that was originally scheduled to begin and end at the city’s Commons Park will instead conclude with an indoor rally at Target Center.

“We’re asking people to march,” said González. “We’re asking people boycott today. We’re asking people to get trained as legal observers.”

The event is part of a broader Friday strike activists have called for, encouraging people to stay home from school and work and for businesses to close.

The Department of Homeland Security is calling for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey to turn over a convicted sex offender they said federal agents were searching for when they dragged a US citizen from his St. Paul home on Sunday.

“This is exactly what we have been saying: We need state and local law enforcement engagement and information so we don’t have to have such a presence on the streets,” reads a post on X from the agency.

Paul Schnell, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections, told CNN yesterday he had notified DHS that the offender was in state custody.

Some context: ICE agents bashed open ChongLy “Scott” Thao’s door before detaining him and leading him outside in his underwear in frigid conditions, according to the Associated Press. The episode, captured on video, provoked anger and criticism of the ICE agents’ tactics.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Thao of living with two convicted sex offenders, the targets of the operation, and said both were still at large.

But Schnell said that one of those sex offenders is already in prison.

“He is, in fact, in prison and subject to a detainer,” Schnell told CNN yesterday. “They should know, because we did notify them that they were in our custody.”

Hundreds of Minnesota businesses are expected to close on Friday as part of a protest against immigration enforcement in the state.

The strike, organized by local faith leaders and unions, urges Minnesotans to avoid shopping and stay home from work or school, according to CNN affiliate KARE. There is also a rally planned in downtown Minneapolis uniting under the slogan “ICE out of Minnesota.”

The statewide strike comes a day after Vice President JD Vance, who visited Minneapolis, blamed a lack of cooperation from local authorities for some of the problems in the city, and suggested that is why ICE needs such a robust presence in Minneapolis.

Here’s a look at the latest:

A 5-year-old has become one of the latest children caught up in the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, after he and his father were taken by federal agents outside their Minneapolis home. The family’s attorney said they are in the US legally after applying for asylum. The father and son are being held together at a detention facility in Texas, while the boy’s pregnant mother remains in Minneapolis.

More arrests are expected in connection with a church protest in St. Paul, Minnesota, according to acting ICE director Todd Lyons. Federal authorities have arrested three people since the protest interrupted a church service to object to a pastor who appears to serve as a top ICE official.

Vance, while in Minneapolis, acknowledged the need for investigations into the fatal shooting of Renee Good and other instances where agents have been accused of wrongdoing.

Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said agents are encountering protesters who are “stalking” them at public places and local police and elected officials have not intervened. He cited an instance where a “violent” group tried to stop ICE officers from using a gas station restroom.

ICE has arrested more than 100 people in Maine since it launched “Operation Catch of the Day” in the Democrat-led state Tuesday.

“When they boxed her in, they demanded her paperwork, of which she’s a U.S. citizen and clearly would not have any paperwork,” Bruley said.

The ICE officers had their guns drawn during the encounter, Bruley said. He noted that they eventually left without apologizing after the woman identified herself as a Brooklyn Park police officer.

“If this happens to our officers, it pains me to think of how many community members are falling victim to this every day,” Bruley said. “It has to stop.”

Bruley said he does not blame all ICE officers for incidents like this and stressed that he respects law enforcement broadly. He believes a small number of agents are engaging in inappropriate conduct.

“I don’t think the leaders in Washington, D.C., fully understand what some of their groups are doing on the street and how much damage they’re causing,” Bruley said.

Bruley, along with St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry and Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, said the behavior of some ICE agents is eroding trust that local law enforcement has worked for years to build within the community.

They said documenting and reporting questionable encounters has been difficult because there doesn't appear to be a clear point person for the operation and many officers are masked or not easily identifiable.

Despite recent criticism, the Department of Homeland Security has defended the agents involved in Operation Metro Surge.

“These staff and resource diversions exemplify this Administration’s reckless decision-making in service of Trump’s brutal, ruthless immigration enforcement agenda.","Senator Elizabeth Warren and fellow Democrats have accused Donald Trump of letting white collar criminals “off the hook” by diverting crucial resources to his sweeping immigration crackdown.

In a letter to federal watchdogs, the Democrats demand an investigation into the US president for shifting more than 25,000 personnel away from investigating fraud, tax evasion and money laundering in favour of his immigration enforcement agenda.

“The Trump Administration is letting white-collar criminals off the hook for all kinds of wrongdoing,” Warren, from Massachusetts, said in a statement. “Instead of protecting American families from fraud and predatory behavior, the Administration is diverting resources to pursue its inhumane immigration agenda.

“Nobody is above the law, and the Trump Administration needs to stop treating white collar criminals with kid gloves.”

In the letter to inspectors general of the justice department, state department, homeland security, the postal service and the treasury’s tax division, the Democrats allege that the administration is “diverting critical federal law enforcement personnel and resources” away from corporate crime and into what they describe as Trump’s “civil immigration dragnet”.

The letter – signed by Democrats including Warren, senator Richard Blumenthal and representatives Dan Goldman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Madeleine Dean – demands a formal evaluation of the extent of the transfers and their impact on US financial crime enforcement.

It cites a “deep concern” that entire investigative units have been “gutted” as agents are sent to bolster Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.

According to the Democrats, more than 25,000 federal agents across multiple departments have been reassigned since January 2025, including specialists in financial fraud, sanctions enforcement, money laundering and cybercrime.

The authors warn that the shift has already stalled complex investigations and risks emboldening corporate criminals who believe the federal government has in effect “stood down”.

The most dramatic allegation concerns the FBI, where the letter claims nearly a quarter of agents nationwide, and up to 40% in major field offices, have been diverted to support ICE enforcement. Staff who once pursued public corruption cases, cyber-enabled fraud and organised financial crime are now reportedly guarding detention facilities and performing immigration checks.

Other agencies appear similarly affected. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), long regarded as one of the government’s most effective financial crime units, is said to have reassigned 1,700 criminal-investigation staff, compared with just 250 last summer.

Diplomatic Security Service agents normally tasked with cross-border fraud and international corruption cases have likewise been detailed to ICE, while Homeland Security Investigations – historically the home of complex global fraud cases – has, according to one estimate, shifted 90% of its workforce to removal operations.

Even the US Postal Inspection Service, better known for policing mail fraud, has reportedly loaned officers to track down immigration targets.

The letter paints the shift as part of a broader pattern under Trump’s second administration, accusing the White House of a “failure to enforce the law against corporate criminals” and lambasting a string of controversial presidential pardons. Citing congressional analyses, the authors say Trump’s clemency decisions have erased an estimated $1.3bn in fines and restitution owed to taxpayers and victims.

They warn that the combined effect has left ordinary Americans “more vulnerable to fraud schemes, market manipulation, predatory financial practices, and corruption”.

The Democrats cite reports of corruption and financial-fraud cases being delayed or abandoned as investigators are pulled off long-running inquiries. One justice department investigation into a financial services firm has allegedly stalled because key staff were moved to immigration work, while the FBI’s white-collar unit in Houston was reportedly “decimated” in 2025.

They also highlight a dramatic shrinking of the justice department’s public integrity section, responsible for prosecuting corruption among elected officials. The unit has allegedly fallen from 36 lawyers to just two, with staff reassigned to a new “sanctuary cities enforcement” team, where some have complained of having so little to do that they “completed jigsaw puzzles” to pass the time.

The letter asks watchdogs across the federal government to disclose how many personnel have been reassigned since January 2025, how many white-collar cases have been opened, closed or suspended during the period, and how many investigations have been derailed due to staffing shortages.

The Democrats also request details of any whistleblower complaints relating to the transfers and ask what safeguards, if any, remain to ensure statutory duties on financial and corruption cases are still being met.

They conclude with a stark warning that the “safety of American families and the integrity of our financial system” depend on restoring the government’s ability to investigate corporate wrongdoing.

Blumenthal, a senator for Connecticut, said: “The Trump Administration’s diversion of critical resources and personnel away from white-collar crime undermines our country’s ability to combat fraud schemes, market manipulation, and corruption –seriously threatening the security of American families and leaving them vulnerable to predatory practices.

“These staff and resource diversions exemplify this Administration’s reckless decision-making in service of Trump’s brutal, ruthless immigration enforcement agenda. I call on the Inspectors General to fulfill their duty as nonpartisan watchdogs and illuminate this Administration’s abuse of power.”

Goldman, a congressman from New York, added: “Trump is letting white collar criminals run rampant without consequences so he can shift law enforcement to violently attack immigrants – the overwhelming majority of whom have no criminal record.

“Having 25,000 fewer law enforcement personnel investigating and prosecuting white collar crime enables fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and other crimes that hurt the American people. Federal Inspectors General must conduct a thorough investigation of the impact of these diversions.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c76f110459216344ed3b8d728a00409faafa09b5/757_0_3174_2539/master/3174.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d24e24bd1ae23641e4d1a50a75b03120",N,,2026-01-23 09:58:12.258239

Unlike previous administrations, the Trump administration has not released monthly detailed deportation data.
University of California Los Angeles researchers, through the Deportation Data Project, collect and publish immigration data received via Freedom of Information Act requests.
That includes $45 billion for immigration detention and nearly $30 billion for ICE to increase deportations and hire more immigration agents.","In the year since his inauguration, President Donald Trump has taken dramatic actions to carry out his promise of the largest domestic deportation operation in U.S. history, including invoking rarely used laws and launching aggressive immigration enforcement in several U.S. cities.

Although deportation data is limited because the federal government has stopped releasing it, available figures show Trump remains far below his goal of deporting 1 million people a year.

Nevertheless, the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute said in a Jan. 13 report that Trump’s actions have ""dramatically reshaped the machinery of government to target unauthorized immigrants"" and made the climate for immigrants in the U.S. illegally ""more hostile.""

Trump’s promise to prioritize deporting the ""worst of the worst"" has also fallen short. About 74% of the nearly 70,000 immigrants in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention as of December, the most recent data available, have no criminal convictions.

Trump’s deportation efforts have been less efficient and more disruptive than those undertaken by other presidents, said University of North Carolina immigration law professor Rick Su.

The deportations have been ""more sensational, intrusive, and focused on ‘low hanging fruit’ than not only past presidents, but even the first Trump administration,"" Su said.

When asked for comment about the deportation operation, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson, said Trump is ""keeping his promise and the American people are appreciative."" DHS did not respond to detailed questions about deportation data.

Here’s what the administration’s first-year efforts have encompassed.

How many people have been deported under Trump?

Unlike previous administrations, the Trump administration has not released monthly detailed deportation data. Instead, the Department of Homeland Security provides updates via press releases.

DHS said in a Dec. 10 press release that 605,000 people had been deported since Jan. 20, 2025, when Trump was inaugurated. But the lack of public data makes it impossible to know what that figure includes. For example, it could include people turned away at the U.S. border or at airports.

University of California Los Angeles researchers, through the Deportation Data Project, collect and publish immigration data received via Freedom of Information Act requests.

The project’s data shows around 350,000 deportations since Jan. 20, 2025. That number does not include people who were not arrested by ICE before being deported, such as people encountered by Border Patrol agents at the U.S. southern border.

The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, another research group that uses Freedom of Information Act requests to analyze government data, said that from January through September 2025, the Trump administration deported around 234,000 people.

DHS also cites another data point: people who left the country voluntarily. During Trump’s second term, DHS says, 1.9 million people self-deported.

As with other deportation figures, DHS provided no evidence for this number. In September, Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said 1.6 million people had voluntarily left the U.S. under Trump. But that number came from one research group’s estimate based on a survey with a small sample size and large margin of error. And the figure represented not only people who might have voluntarily left the U.S., but also people who were deported, died or whose status changed such as by receiving asylum.

How does that compare with other administrations?

Deportations are generally a three-step process, said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. People are arrested, detained and then deported.

""In the last year, we've seen some parts of that deportation effort increase, while others have stayed the same,"" she said. For example, even though arrests and detentions increased, the administration hasn’t ""reached that increase in deportations that they're looking for.""

Overall, deportations under Trump are lower than deportations under former President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama, who immigrant rights advocates dubbed the ""deporter-in-chief."" But the Trump administration’s limited data release makes it difficult to compare.

During the last full fiscal year when Biden was in office, from October 2023 to September 2024, DHS deported about 778,000 people. Biden’s figure includes people deported at the border and people deported inside the U.S. Because of the high number of people who crossed the southern border under Biden, it’s likely that a large share of the deportations happened there.

Obama deported around 962,000 people in fiscal year 2009, from October 2008 to September 2009. As with Biden’s data, that included deportations at the border and inside the U.S.

Vice President JD Vance called any comparison between Obama and Trump an ""entirely fake"" argument.

""In the Obama administration, they counted being turned away at the border as a deportation,"" Vance said in a Jan. 14 post. ""A person would show up, be sent back, and counted as a deportation.""

Vance is correct that deportation data under past presidents did include people sent back at the border. It’s likely that Trump’s data includes those numbers too. That said, under Trump, Border Patrol encounters with people trying to illegally enter the U.S. have significantly dropped, so Trump’s deportation data is likely to include fewer removals at the border.

What actions has Trump taken so far?

Among the most high-profile of Trump’s deportation efforts was his use of the centuries old Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador without due process. The law lets the president detain and deport people from a ""hostile nation or government"" without a hearing when the U.S. is either at war with that country or the country has ""perpetrated, attempted, or threatened"" an invasion against the U.S. It has been used only three times in U.S. history, each during wartime.

Trump has sent large numbers of ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents to carry out wide-ranging operations in cities including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans.

Each city has had instances of masked federal agents in military gear raiding workplaces, tackling immigrants and bystanders and releasing tear gas in crowds. Federal agents have fatally shot several people, including U.S. citizen Renee Good Jan. 7 in Minneapolis.

The administration’s actions have resulted in several ongoing lawsuits related to agents’ tactics and the legality of deploying National Guard troops.

Trump has also focused on arresting and deporting people at scheduled ICE check-ins or immigration court hearings — people who are following immigration requirements.

What will it take to reach 1 million deportations a year?

Trump has aimed to expand the administration’s immigration enforcement capacity. As part of his signature tax and spending bill, Congress allocated $170 billion in immigration enforcement funding. That includes $45 billion for immigration detention and nearly $30 billion for ICE to increase deportations and hire more immigration agents.

In the past year, DHS has hired 12,000 ICE agents. The rush to onboard more agents has led the agency to cut training for the new hires in half.

The administration has also let federal officials in other agencies enforce immigration law, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals Service.

Even so, deporting 1 million people a year would require even more effort.

""There would need to be a lot more door-to-door raids and checkpoints, and detention capacity,"" Su said. ""It would also require that all Americans — citizens and otherwise — to be subject to constant surveillance and checking of status.""

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Republicans narrowly defeated a resolution on Thursday that would have barred President Donald Trump from further military action in Venezuela without the authorization of Congress, days after a similar measure failed in the Senate.

The House voted 215 to 215, a tie that defeated the resolution which ""directs the president to remove United States Armed Forces from Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for use of military force.""

The vote was largely along party lines in the narrowly divided chamber, where Trump's Republicans have a 218 to 213 majority. Every Republican except Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky voted against the resolution. Every Democrat voted in favor.

House leaders held the vote open until Republican Representative Wesley Hunt of Texas could return to the Capitol building to cast the decisive no vote. California Republican Tom McClintock did not vote.

The close vote reflected concern in Congress, including from a handful of Republicans, over Trump's foreign policy. There is growing support for the argument that Congress, not the president, should have the power to send U.S. troops to war, as spelled out in the U.S. Constitution.

Opponents of the resolution had argued it was unnecessary because the U.S. does not currently have troops on the ground in Venezuela.

""We do not have anybody there in Venezuela fighting,"" Republican Representative Brian Mast of Florida said in the debate before the vote.

Republicans also accused Democrats of introducing the legislation only as an attack on Trump. ""It's about spite,"" Mast, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said. ""You will condemn him no matter what he does.""

'FOREVER WAR'

Backers disagreed, saying they wanted to keep Trump from pulling the U.S. into another ""forever war,"" after decades fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.

""The American people want us to lower their cost of living, not enable war,"" said Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the foreign affairs panel.

U.S. forces swept into Caracas on January 3 and captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. A large flotilla of U.S. ships is blockading Venezuela, and has spent months firing on boats allegedly carrying drugs in the southern Caribbean and Pacific.

Trump recently said the U.S. will run Venezuela for years, told Iranians protesting against their government that ""help is on the way"" and threatened military action to take Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.

Some Democrats also denounced Trump for leaving most of Maduro's government in place in Caracas and failing to present a plan for Venezuela after his removal.

""The machinery of repression was left in place and the Democratic hopes of Venezuelans are being left behind,"" said Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.

Recent votes on war powers have been very close, with the measure failing in the Senate last week only because Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol to break a tie.

""If the president is contemplating further military action, then he has a moral and constitutional obligation to come here and get our approval,"" said Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, a lead sponsor of the House resolution.

The Trump administration argues that Maduro's capture was a very limited judicial operation to bring him to trial in the U.S. on drug charges, not a military operation.

While awaiting his day in immigration court, Barros applied for and was approved for Special Immigration Juvenile Status.
Crayk explained that this is a protected-class designation that must be approved by a Utah judge outside of immigration court.
Because of this, during Tuesday’s hearing, his prior immigration case was dismissed by a judge.
Crayk explained that the dismissal of an immigration case typically indicates the government is no longer seeking to remove an individual.","A Colombian man belonging to a protected class was detained by ICE while leaving immigration court. His case had been dismissed minutes before his detention, and he has no criminal record.

Kevin Alexander Ortiz Barros, 21, entered the United States as a minor. He was detained by Border Patrol agents upon entry before being released on his own recognizance. He then entered the immigration proceedings process.

“They gave him what is known as an alien number and told him to be prepared because he was going to have to litigate his case,” said Adam Crayk, the lawyer now representing Barros.

Barros’ first court date in more than two and a half years was on Jan. 20. While awaiting his day in immigration court, Barros applied for and was approved for Special Immigration Juvenile Status.

Crayk explained that this is a protected-class designation that must be approved by a Utah judge outside of immigration court.

It is granted to people who crossed the border as minors and can prove they were abandoned, neglected, or abused as a child and were fleeing their country for safety.

“In order to get that, you have to prove to a Utah judge, not an immigration judge, a Utah judge, that you’ve been the victim of abuse or the victim of abandonment or the victim of neglect. A Utah judge in the juvenile district court here determined that he qualified and met that standard,” said Crayk.

Once this designation was approved, Barros became eligible for a green card and was waiting for his case to move forward. Because of this, during Tuesday’s hearing, his prior immigration case was dismissed by a judge.

Crayk explained that the dismissal of an immigration case typically indicates the government is no longer seeking to remove an individual.

As Barros was leaving his hearing, ICE agents detained him while he was still inside the courthouse.

“For us it’s alarming because there have been arrests [in court] before, but typically that’s because someone has an open warrant,” said Crayk. “This young man was actively engaged in showing up to court doing the things that he was asked to do.”

Crayk explained that once the case was dismissed, it left the judicial process. Because Barros does not yet have his green card and was no longer in active immigration proceedings, ICE then had jurisdiction to detain him and place him into expedited removal proceedings, despite his Special Immigration Juvenile Status designation.

“The real strategy behind what was done was to take him from what is commonly known as removal proceedings and then they transition him into what is known as expedited removal, which then keeps him in custody,” said Crayk.

During his immigration proceeding, Barros petitioned the judge not to dismiss the case out of fear ICE would detain him in the window between dismissal and when he received his green card. Crayk explained that this process can take years due to backlogs in the immigration system.

“What people also don’t know is that prior to the current administration, we had approximately 60,000 people in immigration proceedings already facing deportation consequences,” said Crayk. “So to say that we were ramping up or we were going to do this mass deportation effort, all that does is put more people into deportation proceedings.”

Crayk said arrests like this have a chilling effect on others who are following court orders and attending their immigration appointments.

“Why would I go to court? They’re going to arrest me anyways. I don’t have the ability to show up to that building and argue my position,” questioned Crayk. “But, I’m telling you that cannot be the mentality.”

Barros’s girlfriend, Jillian Nelson, described him as “kind, gentle, the perfect person.”

She said Barros went through a lot as a child, which led to his Special Immigration Juvenile Status.

“He was abandoned in his childhood. Now, I feel like he’s been abandoned trying to make a better life for himself, trying to provide for himself, truly trying to make his community better, trying to make everyone around him better,” said Nelson. “This is what his community does for him. This is what they do for him.”

Nelson said Barros was incredibly trusting and believed that because he was following the proper legal process to remain in the United States, this would not happen to him.

“He trusted that, after hearing for months that ‘we’re going after criminals, the worst of the worst,’ he didn’t fit that,” said Nelson. “He was 100% confident. He thought he was on the path to getting his green card.”

Nelson said she was able to speak with him briefly while he was being detained. He has also spoken with his roommate and his lawyer. She said they believe he is currently in Evanston, Wyoming, though ICE was unable to confirm his location to her.

2News also contacted ICE, which said Barros was in transit and they could not disclose his destination.

Nelson said she is trying to stay focused on sharing Barros’ story and speaking out on his behalf, but said she is “heartbroken.”

“It honestly makes me embarrassed to be an American. I know that is harsh,” said Nelson. “But, this is the way they’ve treated someone who has done nothing wrong? It’s embarrassing.”

2News reached out to Immigration and Customs Enforcement via email and phone to confirm the details of Barros’s arrest, including why he was detained. 2News also asked whether ICE is conducting enforcement operations at courthouses in Utah and whether individuals with approved Special Immigration Juvenile Status are subject to arrest.

ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

Crayk said they plan to appeal the immigration judge’s motion to dismiss Barros’ case, which would place him back into deportation proceedings.

Nelson started a fundraising account to support Kevin’s legal fees.

U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has seen some 3,000 heavily armed masked federal officers deployed to the city of Minneapolis, rounding up suspects they say are dangerous criminal immigration violators, while sometimes ensnaring law-abiding U.S. citizens and immigrants.

The city is on edge after an immigration officer shot and killed Renee Good, 37, a U.S. citizen and mother of three on January 7. Vice President JD Vance delivered a broad defense on Thursday, saying that ""far-left agitators"" and uncooperative local officials were to blame for chaos on the streets.

U.S. immigration enforcement operations have used what appears to be unnecessary or disproportionate force, Turk said. Such measures should only be used as a last resort if an individual posed an immediate threat to life, he added.

Turk said the U.S. must comply with international law and that migration enforcement must respect due process, voicing concern that, in some cases, people arrested or detained had not been granted timely access to legal advice.

He called for an independent investigation into the rising number of deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. He cited 30 deaths reported in 2025 and six recorded so far this year.

Turk condemned what he called the routine denigration of migrants and refugees in the United States that portrays them as criminals or a burden on society, saying it increased their ""exposure to xenophobic hostility and abuse"".

Driving the news: Images of the boy wearing a small backpack and a light blue stocking cap fueled angry speculation in the Twin Cities that ICE was detaining children as ""bait"" to catch parents wanted for alleged immigration violations.

Federal officials rejected those claims Thursday, and alleged that the boy was detained by ICE agents after he was left behind when his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled officers who were trying to arrest him.

The episode is a reminder of the growing number of children, likely hundreds of them, who've wound up in family detention centers with their parents during President Trump's push to deport immigrants.

That includes those who, like Arias, were seeking asylum.

The big picture: ICE routinely detains children whose parents are arrested and targeted for deportation. In fact, creating detention space for families before they're deported has been a priority of Trump's second administration.

The idea, officials have said, is to deport children with their parents so as not to separate them.

Arias, who is from Ecuador, and his son were together Thursday in the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in South Texas.

Meanwhile, critics of ICE's tactics were juxtaposing images of the boy, surrounded by immigration agents, with Trump's boast this week that his operation is arresting the ""worst of the worst"" criminals in Minnesota.

What they're saying: ""This family is following U.S. legal parameters and has an active asylum case with no order of deportation,"" local school superintendent Zena Stenvik said, criticizing the seizure of Arias and his son at a news conference on Wednesday.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that ""ICE did not target a child,"" but said agents were after his father, ""who was released into the U.S. by the Biden administration.""

She didn't respond to a follow-up question about whether Arias had a court notice to appear or a final deportation order. Typically immigrants in the asylum process aren't held in detention while making what's known as an ""affirmative claim"" for asylum.

McLaughlin said that when a parent is arrested by immigration agents, they're ""asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates.""

""This is consistent with past administrations' immigration enforcement,"" she added.

In some cases, children who are U.S. citizens have been deported with their noncitizen parents.

During his visit to Minnesota on Thursday, Vice President Vance echoed the administration's defense for detaining parents arrested by immigration agents as well as their children.

""If the argument is that you can't arrest people who violate the laws because they have children, then every single parent is going to be completely given immunity from ever being the subject of law enforcement,"" he said.

Between the lines: ICE detention data doesn't indicate how many child detainees are being held with their parents.

The latest figure on the average number of people being held at the Dilley detention center is about 700. Detainees stay for an average of 20 days.

Another South Texas family detention center, in Karnes County, holds an average of about 1,100 people with an average stay of about 49 days, according to ICE detention data from late December.

After litigation, the U.S. government agreed to not hold minors in detention (with their parents or as unaccompanied minors) for longer than 20 days.

""All of the research shows that the actions that the administration is doing is very bad for children's health and children's well-being,"" said Joanna Dreby, a sociologist and author of a book on the impact of immigration enforcement on children.

""I think about all the kids in that little boy's classroom and his school,"" Dreby said.

More than 200 law enforcement agencies across the state have entered agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that grant local officers limited immigration authority.
Texas accounts for roughly one-fifth of all agreements that ICE has inked with local law enforcement agencies, second most behind Florida.","This article first appeared on The Texas Tribune on Jan. 22.

(Texas Tribune) — Three years ago, Texas lawmakers passed a landmark law that would let state police arrest people suspected of having entered the country illegally by crossing the border.

Such authority has long been the sole responsibility of the federal government, but the state’s Republican leaders said Texas, which shares about 1,250 miles of border with Mexico, had a constitutional right to protect its sovereignty as the number of illegal border crossings hit record highs under the Biden administration.

But when a federal appeals court reheard oral arguments Thursday in a legal challenge seeking to stop Texas’ law from going into effect, the circumstances outside the courtroom were much different.

The number of people crossing the border has dwindled to a trickle during President Donald Trump’s first year back in the White House, setting record lows in a sharp reversal from the influx that inspired Texas’ law, known as Senate Bill 4. The new reality on the ground could complicate Texas’ legal argument that it has a constitutional right to defend itself against an invasion, like the one state lawmakers claimed was afoot when they enacted the law. The case carries high stakes for the future of immigration enforcement and the role states are allowed to play.

For Texas, a court ruling in either direction could present a victory. It is not clear when the court will issue a ruling.

If the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, after hearing Thursday’s arguments, removes the injunction that has blocked SB 4 from taking effect, the state would further solidify its already outsized role in immigration enforcement. If the court keeps the injunction in place, Texas authorities would still be poised to continue the starring and unprecedented role they have played in aiding the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, even with SB 4 off the books. And state GOP leaders would almost certainly appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, giving them a possible forum to reconfigure legal precedent that largely prevents states from enforcing immigration law.

“What is at stake most importantly is the ability of migrants to live and feel safe in a state where they have contributed deeply,” said Denise Gilman, a law professor who co-directs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin. “It really could be a watershed moment for how we think about immigration and noncitizens in general in Texas.”

Legal experts say the most pertinent development that could affect the case is the defection of the U.S. Department of Justice, which filed the lawsuit to block SB 4 under the Biden administration before dropping its challenge last year after Trump took office.

SB 4 would make it a state misdemeanor to illegally cross the border and authorize Texas officers to arrest undocumented immigrants. It would also require state magistrate judges to order people arrested for illegal entry — a new state charge created by SB 4 — to leave the U.S. for Mexico in lieu of prosecution, or if they are convicted.

The Biden administration swiftly moved to block the law, arguing in a suit filed weeks after SB 4’s passage that the measure was unconstitutional because the policing of immigration — including oversight of who is allowed into the country and the removal of people without proper documentation — rests in the federal government’s hands alone.

The legal challenge has continued through a case brought by a group of civil rights organizations and El Paso County. Last summer, a three-judge panel from the Fifth Circuit upheld an injunction blocking SB 4, reinforcing a lower court’s finding that the federal government is the main enforcer of immigration law.

The state of Texas appealed, asking to have the case reheard by the entire circuit court, which made the rare move of granting the request. The conservative circuit court — which hears appeals from Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi — has 17 judges, 12 of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, including six by Trump.

Legal experts said the federal government’s switch presents a key question for the court: Do the remaining parties have a legal right — or “standing” — to challenge the law before it has gone into effect, now that the federal government is no longer claiming a conflict?

Texas has argued that the plaintiffs do not have standing because the law has never taken effect, offering no chance for anyone to be affected by it. The state also argues that it has a right to defend its sovereignty because the record migration under Biden amounted to an invasion — a novel legal argument that courts have historically rejected or refused to wade into.

On Thursday before the 5th Circuit, Texas Solicitor General William R. Peterson contended thatthe plaintiffs lacked standing and urged the judges to lift the injunction. Asked if the state was abandoning its invasion argument, Peterson said he was focusing his case on the question of standing because it presented “probably the easiest analysis” to resolve the lawsuit.

“You’ll take any theory that gets you the win,” a judge responded at one point.

The lawyer for the plaintiffs, Cody Wofsy, disagreed, telling judges that his client, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, which provides legal services to migrants, had standing because it would be affected by SB 4 and its creation of a state-level immigration offense.

El Paso County officials estimate that SB 4 would result in 8,000 more arrests each year, which they say would strain local jails and courts, and without funding from the state to cover the costs.

“Once again, El Paso was forced to figure out how to pay an unfunded mandate that would not only undermine the County’s financial stability but undermine the trust that local law enforcement has developed with community members,” said El Paso County Attorney Christina Sanchez in a statement to The Texas Tribune.

Ahead of Thursday’s arguments, Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement that his office “looks forward to aggressively defending Senate Bill 4 to uphold public safety and address the important standing and preemption principles involved.”

Immigration enforcement in Texas

In December 2023, the month lawmakers passed SB 4, U.S. Border Patrol recorded nearly 250,000 encounters with migrants along the country’s southwest border.

Since Trump returned to the White House, illegal border crossings have plummeted.

Border Patrol agents working in Texas — home to five of the agency’s nine sectors along the border — recorded just 4,265 migrant apprehensions in December, the most recent month for which federal statistics are available.

In response to the Trump administration and the quiet border, the state has redirected law enforcement previously stationed at the border to helping the federal government with its deportation crackdown across the state.

Texas Department of Public Safety officers have helped arrest thousands of undocumented immigrants for deportation. More than 200 law enforcement agencies across the state have entered agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that grant local officers limited immigration authority. Texas accounts for roughly one-fifth of all agreements that ICE has inked with local law enforcement agencies, second most behind Florida.

Should SB 4 go into effect, that role would be further expanded with a green light to handle deportations without needing signoff from the feds.

“At the end of the day, the Legislature wrote SB 4 for a specific purpose,” said Jorge Dominguez, of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, in an interview before the arguments. “Even though Texas has more involvement with the federal government in terms of enforcement in the interior, I don’t think that will supplant what the state wants to do with SB 4.”

To immigration hardliners, that is exactly why SB 4 remains important.

Ammon Blair, a former Border Patrol agent who is currently a research fellow at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, contended that fluctuations in the White House’s border enforcement policies — which have contributed to the drop-off in crossings — do not invalidate states’ constitutional right to defend themselves.

While SB 4 would leave Texas well-positioned to act should border crossings increase in the future, Blair said, it would also give state authorities more latitude to help the Trump administration in the meantime.

“In order for the Trump administration to do all the mass deportation efforts they are currently striving for,” Blair said, “the only possible way to do that is by working with local law enforcement.”",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/09/fifth_circuit_court_appeals_01072015_AP89068168142.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-23 11:39:41.805269

The vote was 220-207, with seven Democrats breaking with their party and voting yes. The House also passed a separate package of bills funding other federal agencies in a broad, bipartisan vote, in a bid to avert a partial government shutdown on Jan. 31.

In an unexpected twist, the House unanimously voted to add an amendment to the package repealing a law crafted by the Senate that allows eight particular Republican senators to sue the government for a minimum of $500,000 in damages after their phone records were collected as part of a Jan. 6 investigation.

House members in both parties have been critical of that law since it passed as part of the deal to end the government shutdown two months ago. Thursday's vote puts the Senate in a jam, forcing it to accept repeal or shut down the government next week when the House is scheduled to be on recess.

The House has combined the repeal amendment and six of its approved spending bills into one package. It now heads to the Senate, where Appropriations Committee leaders have signed off on the funding deal. The package represents the final tranche of the 12 spending bills Congress needs to pass each year to keep the government open and will fund it through the end of September.

“You see, we aren’t here for just another stopgap, temporary fix,” House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said before the vote. “We’re here to finish the job by providing full-year funding.”

The successful DHS vote came as some on the far left called on Democrats to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman and U.S. citizen, this month.

And in a sign of how the ICE issue has become a major political issue for Democrats, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and his top lieutenants joined rank-and-file Democrats in voting no on the DHS funding bill, saying it lacked sufficient guardrails and accountability for ICE.

Liberal Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., a lead negotiator of the broader funding deal, also voted no on the DHS bill — an unusual move for House Democrats' top appropriator.

“ICE is out of control and operating, in far too many ways, in a lawless fashion,” Jeffries told reporters, accusing the agency of “using taxpayer dollars to inflict brutality on the American people,” including by killing Good “in cold blood.”

The leaders made that decision even after DeLauro and other top Democratic appropriators — who work closely with leadership — struck the bipartisan, bicameral deal to fund the government through the 2026 fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.

“You have to ask every individual member who’s going to vote the best interest of their district why they’ve chosen to vote one way or the other,” Jeffries said when asked about the split over ICE.

The seven Democrats who voted in favor were: Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, both of Texas; Jared Golden of Maine; Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington state; Don Davis of North Carolina; and Laura Gillen and Tom Suozzi, both of New York.

Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote no.

Some Democrats lamented that their party had not fought as hard for ICE guardrails as they had for an extension of Affordable Care Act funds, when they forced a 43-day shutdown last fall. (A group of eight Senate Democrats ultimately relented without ACA concessions.)

“Instead of explaining to the American people where we are and what the immigration system is and why it is broken — it is broken, but why it’s broken and what are fixes for it? — we just have a bunch of Democrats who have gone around trying to be tougher on immigration than Republicans. It’s never worked,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. “You can’t out-Republican Republicans because you’re going to lose your base and you’re not going to get any of the Republicans to come over to you.”

She said many Democrats are afraid to lean in to pro-immigrant stances after Trump used immigration in his 2024 campaign victory.

Jayapal suggested that DeLauro and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top two Democratic appropriators, negotiated DHS funding as part of the broader bill because “they wanted to get this all done. Appropriators often — they just care about getting the bills through.”

DeLauro and Murray have pointed out that Democrats did secure $20 million for body cameras for ICE personnel, as well as cuts to ICE funding for enforcement and removal operations and the number of detention beds.

US & World

While most Democrats are treading carefully on immigration, others in the party are going all out in opposition to ICE as they seek to channel the public backlash to the agency. Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., facing a fierce primary challenge from the left, has authored the Abolish ICE Act, which would dismantle the agency.

Meanwhile, Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., this week introduced the MELT ICE Act, which would end DHS’s funding to detain or monitor immigrants, and redirect that money to health care, housing and other social services in local communities.

Neither stand a chance of passage under Republican majorities in the House and Senate.

Murray, instead, focused on a series of victories she said Democrats scored in the wider government funding package, including funding for child care, housing assistance, mental health and Pell Grants — in many cases defeating Trump’s proposed cuts.

“There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for,” Murray added. “But the hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.”",https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/2026/01/ice-officer-copy.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-23 13:57:30.139338

Several state lawmakers in California, Colorado, Georgia, New York and Oregon are pursuing measures that would allow residents to sue federal immigration agents for constitutional violations.","As a growing number of encounters between civilians and Department of Homeland Security agents — including the widely scrutinized fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis — are scrutinized in court records and on social media, federal officials are returning to a familiar response: self-defense.

In more than a handful of recent encounters, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, has said its agents acted in self-defense during violent encounters, even as eyewitness testimony and video footage raised questions about whether those accounts fully matched what happened.

And in a ruling for a recent civil lawsuit, a U.S. district judge said federal immigration officials were not forthcoming about enforcement efforts, citing discrepancies between official DHS statements and video evidence.

“We’re now in a situation in which official sources in the Trump administration are really tying themselves quite strongly to a particular narrative, regardless of what the widely disseminated videos suggest,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University.

The cases come amid an aggressive expansion of federal immigration enforcement and increasing scenes of violent and intimidating arrest tactics. President Donald Trump’s administration has sharply increased the hiring of immigration agents, broadened enforcement operations and accelerated deportations, as protests have spread across major cities.

The use of force, paired with conflicting official statements and evidence, has raised questions about whether federal immigration officials can be held accountable and highlighted the steep hurdles victims of excessive force might face in seeking legal recourse.

States, cities are hard-pressed to fight violent ICE arrest tactics

The Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to multiple requests from Stateline for comment on discrepancies between official accounts and publicly available evidence.

Since last July, there have been at least 17 open-fire incidents involving federal immigration agents — including fatal shootings, shootings with injuries and cases in which shots were fired — according to data compiled by The Trace, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news outlet investigating gun violence. A recent Wall Street Journal investigation also found 13 incidents since July in which immigration agents fired at or into civilian vehicles.

One of the most prominent examples unfolded in Minneapolis this month: Good’s fatal shooting by a masked ICE agent. The Department of Homeland Security initially said the agent, Jonathan Ross, fired in self-defense after Good, 37, allegedly tried to run over officers. Videos taken by bystanders show Good’s vehicle reversed, shifted and began to turn away from officers after one yelled and pulled on her car handle. Ross positioned himself near the hood of her car, and he began firing.

Minnesota officials later stated the footage did not support DHS’ description of an imminent threat, prompting renewed scrutiny of how the Trump administration is characterizing use-of-force encounters.

Similar discrepancies have surfaced in other cases. The Department of Homeland Security recently revised its account of a December shooting in Glen Burnie, Maryland, after local police contradicted its initial version. DHS first claimed both men injured in the incident were inside a van that ICE officers fired at in self-defense, but later said that one of the injured men had already been arrested and was in custody inside an ICE vehicle when he was hurt. The other man was shot twice and is facing two federal criminal charges.

In August, federal immigration agents fired at a family’s vehicle three times in San Bernardino, California. DHS maintained the shooting was justified after at least two agents were struck by the vehicle, but available footage shows an agent breaking the driver-side window moments before gunfire erupted. Surveillance footage from the street does not show agents being struck by the vehicle.

“I can’t think of another time in my lifetime — I’m 50 years old — where we’ve seen this sort of force in the streets in the United States,” said Mark Fleming, the associate director of federal litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center. Fleming has been an immigration and civil rights attorney for the past 20 years.

García Hernández, the law professor at Ohio State University, echoed Fleming’s point, saying that what also stands out is how often agents are deploying less‑lethal weapons in ways that would generally be prohibited — including firing rubber pellets and similar projectiles at people’s faces or heads.

In its use-of-force policy, DHS agents may use force only when no “reasonably effective, safe, and feasible” alternative exists and only at a level that is “objectively reasonable.” DHS policy emphasizes “respect for human life” and directs officers to be proficient in de-escalation tactics — using communication or other techniques to stabilize or reduce the intensity of a potentially violent situation without, or with reduced, physical force. The policy also states that deadly force should not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.

ICE, as an agency under DHS, is bound by this guidance, but the policy on shooting at moving vehicles differs from what many law enforcement agencies nationwide now consider best practices. While DHS prohibits officers from firing at the operator of a moving vehicle unless it is necessary to stop a serious threat, its rules do not explicitly instruct officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles when possible.

Use of force

A growing pattern of aggressive tactics and conflicting evidence has raised serious questions about how federal immigration agents use lethal and less-lethal force, and how DHS officials describe the incidents to the public.

In September, 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González was fatally shot during a traffic stop in Franklin Park, a suburb near Chicago. DHS claimed that one agent was “seriously injured” after being dragged by González’s car as he tried to flee. But body-camera footage shows the agent telling a Franklin Park police officer that his injury was “nothing major.”

In a statement, DHS said the agent responded with lethal force because he was “fearing for his own life” — a narrative very similar to the department’s description of the fatal shooting of Good in Minneapolis.

In recent months, DHS officials have claimed that immigration agents have been repeatedly attacked with vehicles.

“We’ve seen vehicles weaponized over 100 times in the last several months against our law enforcement officers,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during an interview with CNN this month.

In court filings related to a civil lawsuit about Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, the department provided body-camera footage and other internal records to bolster their claims of self-defense.

An ever-larger share of ICE’s arrested immigrants have no criminal record

But U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis found the evidence “difficult, if not impossible to believe.” In her lengthy opinion issued in late November, Ellis acknowledged that agents sometimes encountered aggressive drivers but also found that agents treated cars that were merely following them as potential threats.

In October, an ICE agent shot a community observer, Marimar Martinez, five times during a confrontation in Chicago. DHS claimed that she rammed the ICE vehicle with her car and boxed it in, but surveillance footage does not show the agents were trapped.

Martinez survived, but the Trump administration quickly labeled her a “domestic terrorist” — the same label used to describe Good. Martinez’s criminal charges were dropped in November after the federal Department of Justice abruptly moved to dismiss the case.

In Ellis’ ruling on the civil lawsuit, she wrote that federal officials “cannot simply create their own narrative of what happened, misrepresenting the evidence to justify their actions,” and that the violence used by federal agents “shocks the conscience,” a legal standard meaning a situation that seems grossly unjust to an observer.

Ellis also explicitly questioned the conduct and leadership of Greg Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol during the Chicago immigration operation. Bovino, who has led the administration’s big-city campaign, was deposed under oath, and in her November ruling, Ellis described him as “not credible,” writing that he “appeared evasive over the three days of his deposition, either providing ‘cute’ responses … or outright lying.”

In a footnote, Ellis also noted an instance in which an agent asked ChatGPT to draft a use-of-force report from a single sentence and a few images — further undermining the credibility of official DHS accounts.

A narrow path to accountability

Holding federal immigration agents accountable for misconduct is difficult, even as video evidence and police or court records increasingly contradict official government accounts.

With more evidence surfacing and legal claims already underway, some experts say it’s likely that even more lawsuits will emerge this year.

Under pressure, some immigrants are leaving American dreams behind

“We should expect to see more examples, more instances in which cellphone video is used to bolster legal claims against DHS, ICE, Border Patrol and specific officers as well,” said García Hernández, of Ohio State University.

Federal officers are shielded by legal doctrines such as qualified immunity and U.S. Supreme Court rulings that restrict when people can sue federal officials for constitutional violations. In recent years, the courts have narrowed the circumstances under which individuals can bring claims for excessive force or wrongful death.

Suing individual federal immigration agents is nearly impossible.

People can, however, pursue claims against the federal government under the Federal Tort Claims Act if a government employee causes financial or bodily harm. These cases, which can include claims for wrongful death, face significant hurdles: no punitive damages, no jury trials, state-specific caps on compensation and protections for discretionary government decisions.

Internal DHS investigations can lead to discipline or policy changes, but their findings may not be made public.

Several state lawmakers in California, Colorado, Georgia, New York and Oregon are pursuing measures that would allow residents to sue federal immigration agents for constitutional violations. Illinois has a similar law already in place, but this pathway remains largely untested, and experts say it faces significant legal and logistical hurdles.

Several students from Franklin County school districts including Worthington Schools, Hilliard Schools, Upper Arlington Schools, Westerville Schools, and Dublin Schools have walked out of school this month in protest.

These walkouts come after more than 280 people in central Ohio were detained by ICE in one week during Operation Buckeye, which ICE launched from Dec. 16-21.

“Our immigrant kids are afraid to come to school,” Columbus Education Association President John Coneglio said to the Capital Journal.

Ohio schools are required by law to provide free public education to all children, regardless of immigration status.

The Trump administration last year rescinded a policy directive that banned ICE from operating in “sensitive areas” like schools, places of worship, and hospitals.

Some Ohio teacher unions have recently condemned ICE activity near school buildings.

“ICE’s presence in central Ohio is causing fear, upheaval and panic in immigrant communities,” South-Western Education Association Faculty Representatives Spokesperson Emmalee Harding said in a statement.

“This will predictably harm the school environment by causing increased absences, decreased student achievement, and parental disengagement.”

The Hilliard Education Association said denying any child the chance to attend public school is harmful.

“Depriving any child of an opportunity to attend public school puts them at a disadvantage, making it difficult for them to gain the skills they need to contribute fully to society,” HEA said in a statement.

The Ohio Education Association “strongly opposes any presence or enforcement actions” by ICE in or around public schools, OEA President Jeff Wensing said in a statement.

“Schools must remain safe, welcoming spaces where every student — regardless of immigration status — can learn, grow, and thrive without fear,” Wensing said.

“No child should be afraid to go to school, and no school employee should be placed in the position of navigating immigration enforcement. The presence of ICE in schools undermines trust, disrupts learning, and creates trauma for children and families.”

Maqueli Eldredge, a paralegal at Legal Immigration Services in Dublin, said she has not seen ICE try to detain parents when they pick-up or drop-off their children at school.

“Sometimes people see (ICE) around the schools in the neighborhoods, but we haven’t seen ICE trying to detain parents when they take the kids to school,” she said.

Some parents are choosing to keep their students at home and are trying to figure out distance learning, Eldredge said.

“It’s very hard for the kids to miss school and also for the parents to miss work,” she said.

Ohio Immigrant Alliance reported last month that at least 214 people detained were in detention as of Dec. 24. Ninety-three percent were men and 80% appear to be Latino, according to a report from the Ohio Immigrant Alliance.

Ohio House Bill 42 would require various agencies and departments, including the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce, to collect and report citizenship and immigration status to the governor. For the department, that would mean reporting how many students are citizens and how many are not citizens.

Ohio State Reps. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, and Josh Williams, R-Sylvania Twp., introduced the bill, which has had three hearings so far and received much opposition.

“Schools are not immigration enforcement agencies,” Honesty for Ohio Education Executive Director Christina Collins said in her opponent testimony.

“Students who fear that their personal or family information could be used against them are less likely to participate in school, less likely to ask for help, and less likely to report safety concerns.”

“ICE as it exists today should be abolished,” Watson Coleman said, a sentiment that was echoed by both of her colleagues.
On the other two bills, Murphy issued pocket vetoes, which cannot be overridden.
“My understanding is that he’s concerned about Trump and what he would do to New Jersey,” Watson Coleman said.
As governor-elect, Sherrill offered some praise for the Immigrant Trust Directive and suggested she’d keep it in place.","As Gov. Mikie Sherrill settles into office, state legislators and advocates are looking to try again on a pair of immigrant-rights bills vetoed by former Gov. Phil Murphy, and they’ll have congressional allies in the effort.

Reps. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing), and Rob Menendez (D-Jersey City), who have formed something of an unofficial progressive trio ever since their now-famous May visit to the Delaney Hall immigrant detention center, had privately pushed Murphy to sign the legislation. They expressed disappointment regarding Murphy’s vetoes, but told the New Jersey Globe they plan to discuss the legislation with Sherrill.

“We have to do everything that we can in New Jersey to protect our residents from ICE,” McIver said. “While I’m disappointed [in Murphy’s veto], I am hopeful that in the new Assembly, with our new governor, we will see the bill come back, and we’ll be able to sign it into law.”

The three House members also have a major immigration-related vote of their own coming up in Congress today, on a bill funding the Department of Homeland Security for 2026. All three said they plan to join most of their fellow Democrats in opposing it — “I’m a hell no,” Menendez said — and went further to suggest that ICE needs to be dismantled and completely reshaped.

“ICE as it exists today should be abolished,” Watson Coleman said, a sentiment that was echoed by both of her colleagues. “What they’re doing is illegal, harmful, and disgusting.”

“Everything’s on the table with respect to ICE,” Menendez concurred. “I don’t see it being something that people can look to and trust in this administration, or in any future administration. And so it will take an entire rethinking and restructuring starting from the ground up.”

During the most recent lame duck session, state legislators passed a trio of bills meant to protect immigrants. Murphy, however, signed just one of the three, legislation directing New Jersey’s attorney general to develop policies requiring “sensitive” locations — like schools, hospitals, and courthouses — to remain accessible to all residents. On the other two bills, Murphy issued pocket vetoes, which cannot be overridden.

One bill that would have prohibited government agencies and healthcare facilities from collecting personal information like immigration status, Murphy said, featured a “drafting oversight [that] could jeopardize billions of dollars of federal funding,” but he expressed optimism that the legislature could quickly fix the issue and pass it again. The other bill would have codified the Immigrant Trust Directive, a policy that bars New Jersey police from cooperating with federal agents on civil immigration enforcement; Murphy’s longtime position had been that putting the directive into state law would make the state more vulnerable to legal challenges.

Murphy’s pocket vetoes, which came less than three hours before Gov. Mikie Sherrill took the oath of office, angered advocates who had been pushing the legislation since the Trump administration’s expansion of deportation operations. Watson Coleman, McIver, and Menendez said they understood Murphy’s reasoning but disagreed with his conclusion.

“My understanding is that he’s concerned about Trump and what he would do to New Jersey,” Watson Coleman said. “I guess he thought he was between a rock and a hard place. I know where his heart is. It’s always to protect New Jerseyans. I’m sorry that we just didn’t bite the bullet and do it.”

The effort to bring the bills back to the fore is likely to start again almost immediately; Assemblywoman Ellen Park (D-Englewood Cliffs), the original bill’s prime sponsor, promised to reintroduce the legislation after Sherrill’s inauguration.

“While these bills were not signed into law this time, our efforts do not end here,” Park said in a release.

As governor-elect, Sherrill offered some praise for the Immigrant Trust Directive and suggested she’d keep it in place. During last year’s gubernatorial campaign, Sherrill expressed concerns about the Immigrant Trust Act — a separate but related piece of legislation more aggressive than the similarly named Directive; she said the Act could pose legal peril to the Directive — but hasn’t commented specifically on the two bills vetoed by Murphy.",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Menendez-McIver-Watson-Coleman.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 04:57:38.246541

Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to testify before Congress about the memo.","With an Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo that allows officers to enter homes without a judicial warrant, the Trump administration is seeking to usurp guardrails that are enshrined in the Fourth Amendment and have protected Americans’ civil liberties for centuries, experts in constitutional law and immigration policy told CNN.

Even in an administration that has always pushed an expansive vision of its law enforcement authority, the directive is notable for the way it tosses aside longstanding prohibitions against warrantless searches on private property — a legal concept that predates the creation of the United States and is among the country’s most foundational principles.

“The Bill of Rights, we thought, were the first 10 amendments,” said Mark Graber, a constitutional law scholar and University of Maryland professor.

With the newly discovered memo, he said: “I guess now we’re down to nine.”

Immigration officials had typically sought the arrests of undocumented people through two means: a judicial warrant, which is signed and authorized by a judge, or an administrative warrant, which is signed by people who work in the executive branch and fall under the purview of the president.

A critical difference between the two is that judicial warrants allow law enforcement to enter and search a person’s home or a non-public area of a business, while administrative warrants do not.

Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants because they require a lower bar to issue, and Trump administration officials have long harbored frustrations over limitations on officers pursuing targets on private property.

The internal memo, which was issued in May 2025 but revealed by a whistleblower complaint and first reported by the Associated Press on Wednesday, authorizes ICE officers to forcefully enter homes using only administrative warrants, essentially bypassing the neutral, third-party arbiters who would have reviewed evidence before signing a judicial warrant.

Administrative warrants are signed by ICE officers after an immigration judge orders the removal of an undocumented immigrant. But these immigration judges work for the Department of Justice at the pleasure of the attorney general, and the Trump administration refers to them as “deportation judges.”

“It would essentially be the same as if you were at the local police department, and the police officer that is both collecting the evidence and arresting you then goes and types up his own warrant to search your house because he thinks he has probable cause,” said Emmanuel Mauleón, an associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota.

“It’s deeply concerning, because there’s absolutely no safeguards and no accountability built into the system,” he said.

The history of the Fourth Amendment is rife with examples of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies seeking to challenge or whittle away its protections.

But this memo, Mauleón said, is “not the sort of incremental wearing down that we’ve seen over time.”

“It is what you might think of as crossing the Rubicon,” he said. “It is declaring that the fundamental protections that every court has recognized up to this point just don’t apply to DHS and to immigration stops.”

The Department of Homeland Security defended the directive in a statement in which spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said people who are served administrative warrants already had “full due process and a final order of removal.”

The administration’s own data shows hundreds of thousands of people last year were issued removal orders in absentia by immigration judges after they failed to show up to court.

The memo was not broadly distributed to ICE field offices in a departure from the way major policy chances have been typically announced internally.

Instead, in at least some cases, the guidance appeared to only be shared verbally, according to a source familiar. Some ICE officials learned about the guidance for the first time only after the Associated Press reported the change.

News of the memo prompted widespread alarm among civil liberties advocates and Democratic lawmakers. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to testify before Congress about the memo. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whose state is experiencing the most intense surge of immigration enforcement in DHS’s history, said in a post on X “every American” should be “outraged by this assault on freedom and privacy.”

A Trump administration official told CNN the directive is “not a green light to randomly kick down doors.”

But it comes after months in which officers carrying out the president’s massive deportation mandate have used brutish tactics, largely unchecked, to detain immigrants and citizens alike.

“This administration’s general stance is that immigrants are ‘invaders’ and immigration officials should be allowed to expedite their arrest, detention and deportation,” said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney and analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. In doing so, she said, “they are pushing so many legal boundaries and doing things that have not been tried before in this way.”

Liam Ramos was taken into custody on Tuesday as he and his father arrived home from school in Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb. According to school officials, an ICE agent used the child to knock on the family’s front door to determine if anyone else was inside, before detaining father and son.

Joaquin Castro, a representative from Texas, said his office has been working to locate the boy and demand his release, but that ICE has not provided information despite acknowledging the inquiry. Castro said his office suspects Liam may have been sent to the Dilley detention center, a family detention facility about 90 minutes from San Antonio.

“Ice and the other federal agencies under Donald Trump have gotten super secretive,” Castro said in a video statement. “This is the least transparent that an administration has been in generations.”

Castro said he was scheduled to visit the facility next week, and said he believes ICE “should be disbanded” and get “zero funding”.

“They’ve become reckless, they’ve become lawless,” he said, “and it’s not about immigration enforcement any more. It’s about abusing people.”

Ruben Gallego, a senator from Arizona, questioned whether the operation made Americans safer to begin with. “These are the ‘violent criminals’ Trump is going after. Liam Ramos is 5 years old. He was used as bait to knock on doors to see if anyone else was inside. Then they took him and shipped him to Texas. This is fucked up and it doesn’t make anyone safer,” he wrote on X.

Yassamin Ansari, a representative from Arizona, on Thursday said it was “absolutely disgusting that they used a 5-year-old child as bait so that they could arrest his father”. She added: “Murdering US citizens and kidnapping children in front of our eyes is pure evil.”

Jimmy Gomez, a representative from California, echoed similar sentiments. “ICE just used a 5-year-old boy as bait, forcing him to knock on his own door so they could arrest his father,” he wrote. “Trump, ICE and CBP don’t see these families as people, and that’s exactly how they’re treating them.”

Marc Prokosch, an attorney representing the family, said the Ramos family had followed proper legal procedures. They have an active asylum case and entered the United States at an official port of entry, he said.

“The family did everything they were supposed to in accordance with how the rules have been set out,” he said. “They did not come here illegally. They are not criminals.

Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a representative from California, said: “This isn’t about criminals. It’s about cruelty.”

The homeland security department defended the raid, with assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin saying ICE was conducting a targeted operation to arrest the father and did not target the child. She alleged the father fled on foot, abandoning his child, and that an officer remained with Liam for his safety.

School superintendent Zena Stenvik disputed that account, saying the father’s car was still running when she arrived at the scene and that both had already been apprehended. She said another adult at the home had pleaded to take care of Liam but was denied.

“Why detain a five-year-old?” Stenvik said at a press conference. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

Liam is one of four children in the Columbia Heights school district who have been detained by federal immigration agents during an enforcement surge in the region over the past two weeks, according to district officials.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/806c6b5dc1841119905b9d9e6b735f5df4b8b8d6/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f8782cb28b4363650c800d7e6ca5fcb",N,,2026-01-23 05:57:32.091549

The $64.4 billion bill, which includes roughly $10 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), passed the House by a vote of 220-207.
The measure contained a few targeted reforms, including a reduction in funding for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, a decrease in ICE detention beds and a cut in Border Patrol funding, which were seen as attempts to placate Democrats.
“Let us be clear: this bill is about funding FEMA disaster relief, about stopping child trafficking and the spread of fentanyl in our communities and strengthening our cybersecurity and law enforcement,” Gillen said.
“I’m shocked my colleagues would vote to cut off national and community security funding while leaving ICE to operate under the status quo,” she added.","Several House Democrats joined with nearly all Republicans to approve a bill funding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Thursday, as anger grows over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.

The $64.4 billion bill, which includes roughly $10 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), passed the House by a vote of 220-207. All but one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie (Ky.), voted for the measure.

The seven Democrats who sided with Republicans were Reps. Henry Cuellar (Texas), Jared Golden (Maine), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), Laura Gillen (N.Y.), Don Davis (N.C.), Tom Suozzi (N.Y.) and Vicente Gonzalez (Texas).

The bill also provides billions of dollars in funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the U.S. Secret Service, the Disaster Relief Fund and other programs and agencies.

Suozzi explained his vote earlier Thursday, writing that the measure was the product of “bipartisan negotiations and responsible governing,” framing the vote as necessary to avert a potential government shutdown.

“I am voting for the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, not to expand ICE enforcement or add more agents, but to fund the core operations Americans rely on every day, FEMA disaster response, TSA security, Customs and Border Protection, the Coast Guard, passport processing, and other essential services,” Suozzi wrote on the social platform X.

“I strongly oppose allowing another shutdown to disrupt the lives of working families. We saw the damage of a shutdown last year: millions of Americans lost pay and access to essential services,” he added. “Congress has a responsibility to govern, not to lurch from one manufactured crisis to the next.”

Gillen offered a similar justification, saying she supported “funding our immigration enforcement and the commonsense guardrails” included in the package.

The measure contained a few targeted reforms, including a reduction in funding for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, a decrease in ICE detention beds and a cut in Border Patrol funding, which were seen as attempts to placate Democrats.

“Let us be clear: this bill is about funding FEMA disaster relief, about stopping child trafficking and the spread of fentanyl in our communities and strengthening our cybersecurity and law enforcement,” Gillen said. She also pointed to money included for the Office for Civil Rights and security grants for houses of worship.

Federal agents took the child, Liam Conejo Ramos, from a running car while it was in the family’s driveway on Tuesday afternoon, Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik said during a news conference on Wednesday.

The officers then told the child to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a five-year-old as bait”, Stenvik said.

Stenvik said the family, who came to the United States in 2024, has an active asylum case and had not been ordered to leave the country.

“Why detain a five-year-old?” she asked. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child”.

She said ICE was conducting an operation to arrest the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador.

“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.

Liam is the fourth student from Columbia Heights Public Schools who has been detained by ICE in recent weeks, said Stenvik. A 17-year-old student was taken on Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, she said.

The family’s lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said on Thursday that Liam and his father were taken to an immigration lockup in Dilley, Texas, and that he assumes they were being held in a family holding cell.

“We’re looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or moral pressure,” he said at a news conference.

A lawyer who visited the Dilley detention facility last week, as part of an ongoing lawsuit to ensure the safekeeping of immigrant children in federal custody, said conditions were deteriorating.

“The conditions were worse than ever,” said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsellor at the advocacy group Children’s Rights.

“The number of children had skyrocketed, and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,” Welch said.

“Nearly every child we spoke to was sick – and it seemed there was an epidemic of illnesses going around. Families reported that their children were malnourished, extremely ill, and suffering profoundly from prolonged detention,” Welch said.

During a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, US Vice President JD Vance said he heard the “terrible story” about Liam, but said he was not sure what the federal agents could have done differently.

“Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?” said Vance, noting that he was also the parent of a five-year-old.

US federal agents have arrested some 3,000 people in immigration raids across Minnesota in recent weeks, according to Greg Bovino, a US Customs and Border Protection official.

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said advocates have no way of knowing whether the government’s arrest numbers and descriptions of the people in custody are accurate.

Also on Thursday, US Attorney General Pam Bondi said that three people have been arrested in Minneapolis after they protested at Cities Church in St Paul, where they alleged one of the pastors, David Easterwood, was the acting field director for the St Paul ICE field office. Those arrested included Minneapolis civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong and St Paul school board member Chauntyll Louisa Allen, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper.

Reached by phone Thursday, Corey Oliver, the CEO of the Strength in Management property company, wouldn’t answer questions about his next steps or whether he planned to cooperate with the investigation.
Hightower, the former resident, said he and others had seen hints that the property manager or owner had tipped off federal officials.
“It’s well overdue that somebody investigates this situation, but it’s taken years for this to be even noticed,” Hightower said.
Penalties can include orders to end discriminatory practices, compensation to tenants and fines starting at $16,000, the state says.","As Illinois officials investigate whether a landlord and property manager prompted a massive federal immigration raid on their South Shore building, former residents and organizers say that’s what they’ve long suspected.

Tenants had faced squalid conditions for years, long before the arrival of Venezuelan migrants in the building, and they said the property could be so unsecured at times that it felt open to the public and to squatters. Residents have accused the manager of failing to address complaints of disturbing conditions, and some suspected the owner and manager of calling the feds as a back door way of clearing the building.

The Illinois Department of Human Rights announced late Wednesday that it would investigate the claims when it filed a formal housing discrimination charge against Wisconsin-based real estate investor Trinity Flood, her company 7500 Shore A LLC, and Strength in Management LLC, the property management company she hired at the South Shore building.

WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times have previously reported observations from tenants and a map found in the building that detailed each unit, suggesting federal agents may have received inside information before the Sept. 30 raid.

Jonah Karsh, with the Metropolitan Tenants Organization, called the investigation “a big step” to getting justice for the tenants, who “have been through hell — between helicopters showing up on their roof, and then the remaining tenants having to leave on 2½ weeks notice in the cold.”

Former resident Darren Hightower was glad to hear about the inquiry but was far less enthusiastic.

“It’s never too late, I guess, but sometimes it feels like it’s too late,” he said. “Look where we are today: Some of the tenants from that building still don’t have a place to stay — myself included.”

State officials said they would look into the allegation that the landlord and property manager “tipped federal officials” that Venezuelan nationals were living in the building without leases and had “threatened other tenants.”

“7500 S Shore building management sought to intimidate and coerce the building’s Black and Hispanic tenants into leaving their apartment units, based on stereotypes about Venezuelan immigrants,” the state complaint read.

“Within hours after the raid, workers employed or contracted by 7500 S Shore building management were tossing tenants’ belongings in the trash and clearing out units vacated by the raid.”

Signed by James Bennett, director of the state’s human rights department, the housing discrimination charge alleges that the landlord and property manager “blamed Venezuelan tenants for their own failure to provide needed locks and security service, as well as other needed maintenance and repairs, and perpetuated stereotypes about Venezuelan gang members to send a message that tenants born outside of the United States were considered gang associates, even if they were law abiding.”

The charge document also states that building management unlawfully discriminated against longtime tenants when they refused to make maintenance and repairs.

Flood didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.

Reached by phone Thursday, Corey Oliver, the CEO of the Strength in Management property company, wouldn’t answer questions about his next steps or whether he planned to cooperate with the investigation.

“I have nothing to give you,” he said. “I can’t tell you anything.”

One resident previously told the Sun-Times and WBEZ that he saw someone he believed to be a worker from the building taking pictures of the units “where the Venezuelans lived” before the raid.

WBEZ and Sun-Times reporters also found a crumpled map on a hallway floor days after the raid. It marked each unit inside the five-floor building as “vacant,” “tenant” or as having “firearms.” The units marked “vacant” on the map had clearly been raided, with doors broken down and items scattered everywhere. Most units marked as “tenant” appeared intact, though not all.

Hightower, the former resident, said he and others had seen hints that the property manager or owner had tipped off federal officials.

“It was a lot of facts that we gathered as tenants to back up our theory … that this was a [coordinated] hit,” said Hightower, who said he had seen stickers with an “X” placed over doors to units occupied by either migrants or squatters just before the raid.

Hightower said he’s staying with a friend and applying to apartments. He moved out of the building Dec. 12 without a place to live after a Cook County judge ordered the building to be vacated, citing dangerous conditions.

Hightower, who along with his neighbors had dealt with numerous issues in the building long before the raid, said the state human rights department should not only investigate the months leading up to the immigration raid, but “[go] back years, go into [the owner’s and property managers’] books,” to probe other ways in which tenants were mistreated and ignored.

“It’s well overdue that somebody investigates this situation, but it’s taken years for this to be even noticed,” Hightower said. “It’s not OK to manipulate the system for your own gain. You’re playing with people’s lives.”

Karsh, the housing organizer, said former residents deserve material compensation, and the landlord and property manager “need to be put on notice that this kind of behavior is not acceptable” through fines, penalties and a reputational hit “for not caring about their tenants’ safety, and being willing to literally have them arrested, kidnapped, kicked out outside of an eviction process.”

The state human rights department is likely to gather evidence and seek interviews with former residents and other witnesses, including Flood and Oliver, as part of its inquiry. If investigators find substantial evidence of housing discrimination, they can refer the case to the Illinois Human Rights Commission, which conducts public hearings in front of an administrative law judge.

Whether through a settlement or a judge’s ruling, the property owner and manager could be held liable and ordered to make tenants whole, “as if the discrimination had not occurred,” according to the commission’s website, which adds that the process can take years.

The war powers debate The War Powers Resolution was passed in the Vietnam War era as the U.S. sent troops to conflicts throughout Asia.","On the House floor, Democrats responded with shouts that Republican leaders were violating the chamber's procedural rules. Two Republicans — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — voted with all Democrats for the legislation.

The war powers resolution would have directed Trump to remove U.S. troops from Venezuela. The Trump administration told senators last week that there are no U.S. troops on the ground in the South American nation and committed to getting congressional approval before launching major military operations there.

But Democrats argued that the resolution is necessary after the U.S. raid to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and since Trump has stated plans to control the country's oil industry for years to come.

The response to Trump's foreign policy

Thursday's vote was the latest test in Congress of how much leeway Republicans will give a president who campaigned on removing the U.S. from foreign entanglements but has increasingly reached for military options to impose his will in the Western Hemisphere. So far, almost all Republicans have declined to put checks on Trump through the war powers votes.

Rep. Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, accused Democrats of bringing the war powers resolution to a vote out of ""spite"" for Trump.

""It's about the fact that you don't want President Trump to arrest Maduro, and you will condemn him no matter what he does, even though he brought Maduro to justice with possibly the most successful law enforcement operation in history,"" Mast added.

Still, Democrats stridently argued that Congress needs to assert its role in determining when the president can use wartime powers. They have been able to force a series of votes in both the House and Senate as Trump, in recent months, ramped up his campaign against Maduro and set his sights on other conflicts overseas.

""Donald Trump is reducing the United States to a regional bully with fewer allies and more enemies,"" Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said during a floor debate. ""This isn't making America great again. It's making us isolated and weak.""

Last week, Senate Republicans were only able to narrowly dismiss the Venezuela war powers resolution after the Trump administration persuaded two Republicans to back away from their earlier support. As part of that effort, Secretary of State Marco Rubio committed to a briefing next week before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Yet Trump's insistence that the U.S. will possess Greenland over the objections of Denmark, a NATO ally, has alarmed some Republicans on Capitol Hill. They have mounted some of the most outspoken objections to almost anything the president has done since taking office.

Trump this week backed away from military and tariff threats against European allies as he announced that his administration was working with NATO on a ""framework of a future deal"" on Arctic security.

But Bacon still expressed frustration with Trump's aggressive foreign policy and voted for the war powers resolution even though it only applies to Venezuela.

""I'm tired of all the threats,"" he said.

Trump's recent military actions — and threats to do more — have reignited a decades-old debate in Congress over the War Powers Act, a law passed in the early 1970s by lawmakers looking to claw back their authority over military actions.

The war powers debate

The War Powers Resolution was passed in the Vietnam War era as the U.S. sent troops to conflicts throughout Asia. It attempted to force presidents to work with Congress to deploy troops if there hasn't already been a formal declaration of war.

Under the legislation, lawmakers can also force votes on legislation that directs the president to remove U.S. forces from hostilities.

Presidents have long tested the limits of those parameters, and Democrats argue that Trump in his second term has pushed those limits farther than ever.

The Trump administration left Congress in the dark ahead of the surprise raid to capture Maduro. It has also used an evolving set of legal justifications to blow up alleged drug boats and seize sanctioned oil tankers near Venezuela.

Democrats question who gets to benefit from Venezuelan oil licenses

As the Trump administration oversees the sale of Venezuela's petroleum worldwide, Senate Democrats are also questioning who is benefiting from the contracts.

In one of the first transactions, the U.S. granted Vitol, the world's largest independent oil broker, a license worth roughly $250 million. A senior partner at Vitol, John Addison, gave roughly $6 million to Trump-aligned political action committees during the presidential election, according to donation records compiled by OpenSecrets.

""Congress and the American people deserve full transparency regarding any financial commitments, promises, deals, or other arrangements related to Venezuela that could favor donors to the President's campaign and political operation,"" 13 Democratic senators wrote to White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles Thursday in a letter led by Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.

The Justice Department is now investigating Frey, Walz, and other Minnesota Democrats who have encouraged residents to document and report abuses.
The Melt ICE Act is perhaps the most robust proposal from Democrats to block the rampage of federal immigration agents across the country.","As protests against President Donald Trump’s brutal crackdown on immigrants grow nationwide, Democrats in Congress are scrambling for a unified response to the violence brazenly displayed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol. Voters are demanding a response to the most recent deployment in Minnesota, where residents and local leaders say federal immigration patrols are disappearing people, brutalizing protesters and bystanders, and intentionally sowing chaos in the icy streets.

A pair of Democrats announced a bill on January 21 that would defund ICE’s rapidly expanding detention system and redirect resources toward repairing the damage caused by immigration raids on local communities.

The Melt ICE Act would remove the authority from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to incarcerate immigrants and dismantle the ICE’s rapidly expanding network of roughly 200 jails, privately run prisons, and makeshift detention halls holding at least 73,000 people on any given day. It was introduced by Rep. Delia Ramirez and Rep. Yvette Clarke, representing districts in Illinois and New York hard-hit by Trump’s so-called “immigration enforcement” surges.

Designed to hamper Trump’s mass deportation campaign as protests erupt nationwide, the bill comes as the House advances bipartisan legislation that would continue robust funding for ICE and deportations. Facing a January 30 deadline to fund the government, House Republicans advanced the DHS funding bill to a vote on January 22. If approved, the bill will be sent to the Senate.

While some Democratic lawmakers say the budget bill essentially keeps funding for ICE flat compared to last year, Rep. Pramila Jayapal said it effectively amounts to an increase when additional funding from 2025 is considered. Specific numbers aside, Jayapal said she could not vote to fund ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) without placing strict limits on the behavior of immigration officers to protect the public.

“The core issue here is that there really are no guardrails on ICE and CBP. I can’t vote for it,” Jayapal said in a video statement on January 20. “I can’t be complicit in continuing to allow them to violate the constitutional rights of people across this country.”

The House funding bill provides funding for ICE for more training and body-worn cameras, which critics say amount to optics rather than meaningful reforms designed to prevent violence by federal immigration officers. Immigrant rights advocates note that Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by a law enforcement veteran who was recording the interaction.

“Any realistic effort to rein in ICE and DHS’s lawlessness should start with the blank check they have enjoyed since Donald Trump retook power,” Clarke said in a statement on January 21 introducing the Melt ICE Act.

Since taking office, Trump has transformed ICE into the nation’s largest law enforcement outfit. At least 36 people have died in ICE custody since Trump took office. Along with viral videos of ICE agents acting violently in neighborhoods across the country, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross on January 7 has struck a nerve far beyond Minnesota. The public is demanding accountability as backlash builds in the streets — and lawmakers are taking notice.

In Minnesota, some lawmakers are answering the call by joining constituents in protest.

“The answer to authoritarianism unfortunately is not in the halls of the statehouse, it is in the streets of our country, standing shoulder to shoulder with Americans resisting the violations of constitutional rights that we are seeing dozens and dozens of times every day now,” Rep. Aisha Gomez, a Minnesota state representative from Minneapolis, told Truthout in an interview.

The surge in Minnesota is among the largest and most recent invasions of major U.S. cities by newly emboldened immigration officers, who left a trail of death and disruption in Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, and elsewhere. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Democrat, said the Trump administration has deployed 3,000 federal immigration officers to the Twin Cities, nearly triple the number of local police officers.

Ellison, who is challenging Trump’s immigration deployment in federal court, pointed to the recent arrest of an elderly U.S. citizen who was removed from his home in St. Paul in a bathrobe and underwear by federal immigration officers despite sub-freezing temperatures. The man’s family says his case was one of mistaken identity.

“Are agents of the state — that you don’t even know who they are because they are masked — can they kick your door in, beat you down, and kill you?” Ellison said during a press call on January 21, suggesting the Trump administration has crossed a line. “Once that happens, you know without any doubt that you are in a tyrannical society.”

ICE’s leadership continues to argue its officers are doing nothing wrong despite a growing pile of video evidence to the contrary. Following the playbook his agency has used in other cities, Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino blames local police and the residents of Minneapolis when asked about videos showing his agents assaulting people. Asked about tear gas and other crowd-control weapons deployed against protesters, Bovino accused Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Gov. Tim Walz of colluding with “anarchists.” Both Democrats have repeatedly called for protests to remain peaceful.

“What we do is legal, ethical and moral, well grounded in law,” Bovino told reporters on January 20.

The Justice Department is now investigating Frey, Walz, and other Minnesota Democrats who have encouraged residents to document and report abuses.

“We need people to keep standing up for the protesters,” Ellison said, addressing a national audience. “The protesters are a living, breathing example that Minnesotans are not quietly going into the dark night … and this effort needs to continue to be supported.”

Back in Washington, Democrats at the federal level are debating how best to hold ICE accountable while Republicans still control the majority. The Melt ICE Act is perhaps the most robust proposal from Democrats to block the rampage of federal immigration agents across the country. The bill is unlikely to gain traction in the GOP-controlled Congress but still offers Democrats an option for framing as they respond to the outrage over heavily armed, masked immigration officers patrolling the streets. It also responds to the increasingly popular demand to abolish ICE, which has the support of nearly half of the country.

Meanwhile, proposals from Democrats such Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and the measures in the House funding bill have been roundly criticized for suggesting that state violence can be prevented with “transparency” and providing ICE officers with better training.

In addition to continuing DHS funding, the House bill does not include reforms to ICE demanded by many activists and Democrats in Congress, including bans on detaining U.S. citizens and conducting immigration enforcement in the interior of the country.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, which released the budget package, said on January 21 that she shares the frustration of her fellow Democrats with “the out-of-control agency.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced his personal opposition to the funding bill but was criticized by progressives for failing to whip other Democratic votes against it.

“ICE must be reined in. There must be accountability for the countless abuses, acts of violence, and lawless behavior we have seen on our streets,” DeLauro said in a statement on January 20, encouraging fellow Democrats to base their vote on what is best for their constituents. “The bill takes several steps in the right direction … but it does not include broader reforms Democrats proposed.”

Lindsay Koshgarian, the program director at the National Priorities Project and an expert on federal appropriations, said the bill amounts to Congress giving ICE more money to “terrorize communities and break our laws.”

“ICE shouldn’t get one more penny, especially since the GOP took from healthcare and food programs last year to give billions more to ICE in their Big Bad Bill,” Koshgarian said in an email. “The immediate thing Congress needs to do is stop giving ICE more funding and legislate real accountability, like not allowing racial profiling and violence against protestors.”

With the funding bill likely to pass, local and state leaders are scrambling to offer their own legislative protections against Trump’s immigration forces. Lawmakers in multiple states are now pushing legislation known as “universal constitutional remedies” that would allow individuals to sue any official — local, state, or federal — when their constitutional rights are violated. Currently, Renee Good’s surviving wife and family have little legal recourse for holding Ross accountable for the deadly shooting that took Good’s life.

Cameron Kistler, a counsel at the watchdog group Protect Democracy, said state laws allow people to sue state and local law enforcement when their rights are violated, but there is no similar federal statute for holding federal officers accountable.

“Ms. Good’s killing really drove home to legislators how unfair and frankly anti-constitutional that system is,” Kistler told reporters on January 21. “Whether Ms. Good’s family has a remedy for her killing should turn on whether her constitutional rights are violated, not what badge the officer had when he shot her.”

Kistler said Illinois has already passed a “universal constitutional remedies” bill into law, and similar legislation has been announced or introduced in California, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, and Virginia. Kistler expects more states to take up similar bills as more lawmakers seek to close the “loophole” shielding ICE agents from lawsuits.

“These are not messaging bills, these are not stunts,” Kistler said. “State law has long been a critical source of protection [against] unconstitutional actions by federal officers.”

Representative Gomez said lawmakers in Minnesota are working on constitutional remedy legislation and other efforts to keep their residents safe despite the invasion of immigration officers, but that state and local leaders can only do so much when the federal government is openly violating the Constitution.

“The reality is that many people want state policy and local policy and law to protect us in the face of a federal government that is basically an authoritarian tyrannical regime on the march, so I understand the impulse,” Gomez said.

State lawmakers passing a ban on masking for law enforcement or opening up legal avenues for lawsuits alone will not stop Trump’s rampage. That is why Gomez is joining her constituents in the icy streets to protest ICE’s invasion of her city.

“We are not the first and we are not going to be the last,” Gomez said, referring to ICE operations in other cities. “Everyone needs to be organizing in their communities and building up that web of care for each other, which is the only answer to a regime that doesn’t care about the law and doesn’t care about the truth.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255546468-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 22:57:36.232666

America's judicial system is undergoing one of its most consequential stress tests in decades, as the president pushes the limits of executive power and strains the nation's system of checks and balances.

Over the past year, the courts have moved to the center of the country's most significant political fights, while the Trump administration has increasingly challenged the authority of judges, whose rulings have stalled key parts of its agenda.

As we mark a year into President Trump's second term, we're returning this week to guests from our On Democracy series, which explores the laws, institutions, and norms that have shaped this country and the different pressures they face today.

We're joined now by Steve Vladeck, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University.

Welcome back to the program.

Steve Vladeck, Georgetown University Law Center:

Thanks, Geoff. Thanks for having me.

Geoff Bennett:

I want to start with immigration enforcement because it's raising the most immediate constitutional questions.

As you well know, there is this newly revealed internal ICE memo that authorizes federal agents to forcibly enter homes with an administrative warrant, instead of a warrant from a judge. And the whistle-blowers who presented this memo to Congress says this goes not just against their training, but also the law.

How do you assess the constitutional legitimacy of this policy?

Steve Vladeck:

Yes, it's not legitimate. I mean, the whistle-blower is right.

So the Supreme Court, even as it has poked holes in the Fourth Amendment over the last 35, 40 years, the one thing it has kept coming back to is that an American's home is their castle. And so there are exigent circumstances in which law enforcement officers are allowed to enter a home without a warrant.

We just had a case about that a couple of weeks ago. There are circumstances where a law enforcement officer might have probable cause to believe that there's a crime being under way in a home.

But this notion that an ICE officer can simply sign a piece of paper called an administrative warrant and use that as a basis for entering someone's home without any probable cause, without any exigency, without a federal judge signing off has no precedent in our jurisprudence and is, frankly, flatly inconsistent with everything the Supreme Court has said about the Fourth Amendment.

Geoff Bennett:

Our team reached out to DHS and received a statement, part of which reads this way.

""The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause. For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement.""

Is that the case?

Steve Vladeck:

No.

So, administrative warrants, when there is a basis for believing that there is a crime under way or when there's a basis for believing that you're definitely going to find someone who's immediately arrestable and subject to mandatory detention, that's closer.

But, Geoff, you can't put the cart before the horse. You can't say, we went into the house without a judicially signed warrant and then found someone who we could arrest on an immigration violation. That's bootstrapping.

The reality is that the government's not supposed to be able to go door to door without warrants, barging into American's homes. I mean, just to go way back, this was one of the grievances against King George III that we list specifically in the Declaration of Independence. There's a reason why we have a Fourth Amendment. There's a reason why it applies even to folks who are suspected of and may well be out of status from an immigration perspective.

Geoff Bennett:

If immigration enforcement in particular is pushing the limits of executive power, where does the president's constitutional authority begin and where does it end?

Steve Vladeck:

So, I mean, at least historically, we have viewed immigration enforcement inside the country not as part of the president's exclusive Article II powers, but as a shared authority between the president and Congress.

Maybe, Geoff, it's different at the border, because the president could have an argument at the border that now I'm engaged in my Article II self-defense function. But once we're talking about law enforcement on a house-by-house basis in American cities, that's where it has historically been up to the president to carry out what Congress has provided for.

Congress hasn't provided for this. And this dovetails with this broader push by the Trump administration, also dating back to last summer, to treat anyone who's in the country who was never lawfully admitted, even if they have been here 30 or 40 years, as if they were stopped at the border, so that the government can then try to deny them a bond hearing if they're arrested.

It really is a categorical wholesale rethinking of immigration law that, Geoff, so far federal courts have been blocking overwhelmingly judges from across the geographical and ideological spectrum.

Geoff Bennett:

When we spoke almost a year ago about this very topic, whether the courts could meaningfully act as a check on executive power, we didn't really know much because it was so early into the second term.

But looking back over that year, what has stood out? What has surprised you the most?

Steve Vladeck:

I think a couple of the points that stand out, one is, the federal courts, I think, have done a really remarkable job of at least serving as a speed break on many of this administration's more aggressive tendencies.

The Alien Enemies Act, for example, was never successfully deployed because of the federal courts. President Trump's birthright citizenship executive order still hasn't gotten into effect because of the courts. But the courts can't do it alone.

And some of that's because we have had all these interventions from the U.S. Supreme Court that have allowed the administration to carry out a bunch of these policies while these cases are going forward. But even in the cases where there hasn't been Supreme Court intervention, the courts are more of a rearguard action here, Geoff, right?

And you really need multiple institutions holding each other accountable.

Geoff Bennett:

Are we in the midst of a constitutional crisis?

Steve Vladeck:

That question, I think, is -- sort of has different meanings to everybody.

I don't know what the -- where the line is, where you cross the line and say, hey, now it's a crisis. I think we're in the middle of an institutional crisis, and we have been for the better part of a year. And it's a crisis caused largely by the fact that we have an ambitious executive, we have a, I think, fairly well-functioning judiciary, and we have a completely sort of indolent Congress.

And the founders set up our constitutional structure so that the branches would work the best and our rights would be best protected when the branches were all pushing against each other. With an ambitious executive and ambitious courts and no Congress, I think we're seeing the problem, which is everything comes down to injunctions, temporary restraining orders, and whether the executive branch is going to comply.

I don't know that it's a constitutional crisis, but also I'm not sure that that's the relevant question. Our institutions are under pressure in ways that they really haven't been in American history. And although I think the courts have done a very good job of holding the line to this point, you know, there's going to come a point where they need some help.

And whether that's going to be from Congress perhaps on the far side of this year's midterm elections or from some other actors, I think that's going to be the critical question as we look toward the next 12 months of this presidency.

Steve Vladeck, always a pleasure to speak with you.

""Listen loud and clear: WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP,"" the attorney general wrote on X.

Cities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads the local ICE field office. Many Baptist churches have pastors who also work other jobs.

Attorneys representing the church hailed the arrests.

""The U.S. Department of Justice acted decisively by arresting those who coordinated and carried out the terrible crime,"" said Doug Wardlow, director of litigation for True North Legal, which calls itself a public interest civil rights firm, in a statement.

Vance threatens the protesters with prison terms

Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and prominent local activist, had called for the pastor affiliated with ICE to resign, saying his dual role poses a ""fundamental moral conflict.""

""You cannot lead a congregation while directing an agency whose actions have cost lives and inflicted fear in our communities,"" she said Tuesday. ""When officials protect armed agents, repeatedly refuse meaningful investigation into killings like Renée Good's, and signal they may pursue peaceful protesters and journalists, that is not justice — it is intimidation.""

WATCH: Border Patrol and ICE leaders defend tactics used in Minneapolis operations

Prominent leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention have come to the church's defense, arguing that compassion for migrant families affected by the crackdown cannot justify violating a sacred space during worship.

Vance, speaking in Toledo ahead of his Minnesota visit, warned the church protesters: ""Those people are going to be sent to prison so long as we have the power to do so. We're going to do everything we can to enforce the law.""

Arrests follow a DOJ civil rights investigation

A longtime activist in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, Levy Armstrong has helped lead local protests after the high-profile police-involved killings of Black Americans, including George Floyd, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. She is a former president of the NAACP's Minneapolis branch.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted a photo on X of Levy Armstrong with her arms behind her back next to a person wearing a badge. Noem said she faces a charge under a statute that bars threatening or intimidating someone exercising a right.

FBI Director Kash Patel posted on X that Chauntyll Louisa Allen, the second person Bondi said was arrested, is charged under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which prohibits physically obstructing or using the threat of force to intimidate or interfere with a person seeking reproductive health services or seeking to participate in a service at a house of worship. Patel said William Kelly has also been arrested.

It's unclear which attorneys would represent Allen and Kelly.

Saint Paul Public Schools, where Allen is a member of the board of education, is aware of her arrest but will not comment on pending legal matters, according to district spokesperson Erica Wacker.

Allen and Levy Armstrong are part of a community of Black Minnesota activists who have protested the deaths of African Americans at the hands of police.

Kelly defended the protest during a news conference Tuesday, criticizing the church for its association with a pastor who works for ICE.

The Justice Department's swift investigation into the church protest stands in contrast to its decision not to open a civil rights investigation into the killing of Good. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said last week there was ""no basis"" for a civil rights investigation into her death.

Administration officials have said the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in ""an act of domestic terrorism"" when she pulled toward him. But the decision not to have the department's Civil Rights Division investigate marked a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials.

The Justice Department has separately opened an investigation into whether Minnesota officials impeded or obstructed federal immigration enforcement though their public statements. Prosecutors this week sent subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Judge rejects charges against a journalist

A magistrate judge rejected federal prosecutors' bid to charge journalist Don Lemon related to the church protest, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the ongoing investigation.

Lemon was among those on who entered the church. Lemon has said he is not affiliated with the protest organizers and was there chronicling as a journalist.

""Once the protest started in the church we did an act of journalism which was report on it and talk to the people involved, including the pastor, members of the church and members of the organization,"" Lemon said in a video posted on social media. ""That's it. That's called journalism.""

It wasn't immediately clear what the Justice Department would do after the judge's decision. Authorities could return to a magistrate judge to again seek a criminal complaint or an indictment against Lemon before a grand jury.

CNN, which fired Lemon in 2023, first reported the ruling.

VP visits Minnesota

Vance, a Republican, arrived amid tense interactions between federal immigration law enforcement authorities and residents. State and local elected officials have opposed the crackdown that has become a major focus of Department of Homeland Security sweeps.

His visit comes less than a month after Renee Good was killed. He has called Good's death a ""tragedy of her own making.""

Vance said early Thursday that the ""far left"" has decided the U.S. shouldn't have a border.

""If you want to turn down the chaos in Minneapolis, stop fighting immigration enforcement and accept that we have to have a border in this country. It's not that hard,"" Vance said.

A federal appeals court this week suspended a decision that barred immigration officers from using tear gas or pepper spray against peaceful protesters in Minnesota. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals froze the ruling that had barred retaliation, including detaining people who follow agents in cars.

After the court's stay, U.S. Border Patrol official Greg Bovino, who has commanded the administration's big-city immigration campaign, was seen on video repeatedly warning protesters on a snowy Minneapolis street ""Gas is coming!"" before tossing a canister that released green smoke into the crowd.

Bovino, speaking Thursday during a news conference, urged better cooperation from local and state officials in Minnesota, and blamed an ""influx of anarchists"" for the anti-ICE sentiment.

""The current climate confronting law enforcement ... is not very favorable right now in Minneapolis,"" he said. The Associated Press left messages for the Minneapolis Police Department requesting its response to Bovino's comments.

Trump himself weighed in during the proceedings, using social media to call for Smith to face criminal charges, though he did not offer any evidence that would justify a prosecution.

“Based on his testimony today, there is no question that Deranged Jack Smith should be prosecuted for his actions,” Trump wrote. “He destroyed the lives of many innocent people, which has been his history as a prosecutor. At a minimum, he committed large scale perjury!”

All the while, Smith told the committee his investigations were nonpartisan — and that there were, indeed, grounds to bring two federal indictments against Trump during the period between his two terms in office.

“I made my decisions without regard to President Trump’s political association, activities, beliefs or candidacy in the 2024 election,” Smith told the congressional panel.

“President Trump was charged because the evidence established that he willfully broke the law — the very laws he took an oath to uphold.”

Formerly a war-crimes prosecutor at an international tribunal in The Hague, Smith was selected to serve as special counsel in 2022, under former Democratic President Joe Biden.

Special counsels are tapped to operate independently, without the usual day-to-day oversight from politically appointed Justice Department leadership.

But Smith’s mandate was particularly sensitive. He was charged with investigating Trump, Biden’s 2020 election rival whom the Democrat would face again in the 2024 race.

Inside the investigations

The 2020 election was a central part of Smith’s investigation. So were Trump’s actions on January 6, 2021, when thousands of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in an apparent attempt to disrupt the certification of the election results.

Smith ultimately determined that Trump had intentionally attempted to subvert the vote. In August 2023, a grand jury indicted Trump on four charges: conspiracy to defraud the country, obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against the free exercise of rights under the US Constitution.

A separate grand jury, this time in the state of Florida, issued a second federal indictment in June 2023, related to another probe Smith led.

That investigation focused on Trump’s decision to withhold classified documents after leaving office and defy a subpoena for their return. Trump was ultimately charged with 40 counts, including conspiracy to obstruct justice, making false statements, and failing to adhere to standards concerning sensitive documents under the Espionage Act.

Both federal cases were dropped after Trump was re-elected in 2024. It is Justice Department policy not to investigate or prosecute sitting presidents. Smith himself resigned shortly before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025.

Nevertheless, at Thursday’s hearing, Smith defended the indictments and suggested his cases would have been successful had the circumstances been different.

“I want to be clear: I stand by my decisions as special counsel, including the decision to bring charges against President Trump,” Smith told the committee.

“Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in criminal activity. If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Democrat or a Republican.”

He added that the evidence compelled him to move forward with the indictments, regardless of the high-profile defendant.

“The law required that he be held to account,” Smith said. “So that is what I did. To have done otherwise on the facts of these cases would’ve been to shirk my duties as a prosecutor.”

Later on in his testimony, he emphasised his stance: “ We were ready, willing and able to go to trial in the case.”

Republican criticisms

But Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee sought to portray Smith as a partisan shill whose mission was to take down Biden’s political rival.

Some of the most aggressive questioning came from Republican Representative Darrell Issa of California, who cast doubt on Smith’s independence as special prosecutor.

“You, like the president’s men for Richard Nixon, went after your political enemies. Maybe they’re not your political enemies, but they sure as hell were Joe Biden’s political enemies, weren’t they?” Issa asked.

“They were the enemies of the president. And you were their arm, weren’t you?”

Smith replied to the accusation with a single word: “No.”

Issa went on to assert that, in spreading false statements denying his 2020 election defeat, Trump was simply expressing his First Amendment right to free speech.

“ You understand the Constitution? Do you understand the Bill of Rights that someone has the absolute right to believe something, whether it’s true or not, and to advocate for something whether it’s true or not?” Issa said at one point.

“So if you know that people have a right to opine, lobby for, assert [and] do everything they can legally to ask for people to make different decisions, then why is it you saw criminal conduct on behalf of a president who believed he didn’t win?”

Smith was not able to respond to that question, but his indictment asserts that Trump went beyond simply voicing his disagreement with the results.

Rather, it argues that Trump and his allies attempted to recruit “false electors” to submit fraudulent Electoral College votes for certification, and it highlights evidence that Trump pressured elected officials to reject unfavourable vote outcomes.

Another key point of criticism among Republicans was Smith’s decision to seek “limited toll records” from the telephones of nine lawmakers who communicated with Trump during his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

Then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, was among the Congress members targeted.

Such toll records do not include the content of the calls in question. Rather, they identify where the call originated from, who it was received by, and how long the connection lasted.

Republicans argued that subpoenaing the telephone records amounted not only to a violation of privacy but also to an infringement of the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause, which protects lawmakers from legal action stemming from their legislative duties.

Conservative members of the committee also questioned the secrecy of the subpoenas, something Smith argued was necessary.

“The subpoenas that we secured, we secured with non-disclosure orders from a judge because I had grave concerns about obstruction of justice in this investigation,” Smith responded.

“Specifically with regards to Donald Trump, not only did we have the obstruction of justice that we were investigating in the classified documents case, but I was aware during the course of our investigation of the targeting of witnesses.”

Smith defends team’s work

While Republicans blasted Smith for what they perceived to be prosecutorial missteps, Democrats praised him as a paragon of integrity.

“I want you to lean in today. You have nothing to be ashamed of. You did everything right, sir,” Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell told Smith.

He then proceeded to accuse his Republican colleagues of hypocrisy, particularly after the 2021 attack on the Capitol.

“These guys are so lucky they’re not under oath because they would have to tell you what they really think of Trump,” Swalwell said, gesturing to the Republicans on the panel. “ They call him crooked. They call him cruel. They call him a scumbag. I’ve heard you all say it.”

Swalwell invited Smith to reflect on the Capitol attack and how he felt watching Trump supporters break into the legislature while lawmakers fled. At the time, Smith was in Europe on behalf of the State Department, working on the war-crimes tribunal.

“ I was shocked by it. Being in Europe and not following things as closely, I was not frankly up to speed on the events leading up to it,” Smith replied. “ I just had never seen anything like that happen in our country.”

Smith also denied that he faced any pressure from the Biden administration to come to any foregone conclusion.

“ I was given the independence to conduct my investigation,” he said.

Since being named special prosecutor, Smith has become a frequent target for criticism on the political right. Just this week, Trump himself called Smith a “sick son of a b****” who led a group of “ handpicked radical-left Marxist prosecutors”.

Over the past year, the Trump administration has largely removed the nonpartisan federal employees who were involved in the two federal investigations Smith led.

Smith used Thursday’s committee hearing to lash out at those employment decisions, accusing Trump of seeking retribution against government workers who served presidents of both parties.

“ I’m proud of the work my team did, and I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to correct false and misleading narratives about our work,” Smith told the panel.

“President Trump has sought to seek revenge against career prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff simply for having worked on these cases,” he added. “To vilify and seek retribution against these people is wrong. Those dedicated public servants are the best of us.”

President responds to Smith’s testimony

Trump, meanwhile, appeared to be watching Smith’s testimony live. In the midst of the committee’s back-and-forth dialogue, the president posted on Truth Social a message applauding Republicans for their takedowns of Smith.

“Deranged Jack Smith is being DECIMATED before Congress. It was over when they discussed his past failures and unfair prosecutions,” Trump wrote. “He destroyed many lives under the guise of legitimacy. Jack Smith is a deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”

Trump also suggested Smith should face professional penalties or even prosecution, in a message seemingly directed at the Justice Department.

“If he were a Republican, his license would be taken away from him, and far worse! Hopefully the Attorney General is looking at what he’s done,” Trump continued.

“The whole thing was a Democrat SCAM — A big price should be paid by them for what they have put our Country through!”

Trump has deployed a similar tactic in the past, using his social media account in September to direct the Justice Department to indict other critics of his actions, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey.

Smith was subpoenaed by the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee in early December and testified later that month in a closed-door hearing, despite his protestations that the proceedings should be public.

He is currently under a gag order barring him from divulging evidence about the classified documents case, though US District Judge Aileen Cannon indicated she would allow his report to be released on February 24. The Trump administration has appealed that decision.

Key takeaways

Religious leaders in Minnesota have been both publicly and quietly tending to their communities in the wake of ICE and DHS surges to the state as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Many view this moment as a time for moral clarity and resistance. But not every congregation or denomination is responding in the same way.

There’s every reason to believe this dynamic will intensify so long as ICE continues to operate in the state.

In Chicago last year, religious leaders were pepper sprayed or shot with pepper balls. In Minneapolis this month, they’ve joined protesters in calling for restraint from federal agents and humane treatment of immigrants. And nationally, there is growing realization from some leaders of the need for moral clarity and pushback to the Trump administration.

But religious leaders and their followers aren’t all reacting in the same way to the federal government’s mass deportation surges.

A recent anti-ICE protest in St. Paul, which interrupted a service at a Southern Baptist church with alleged ties to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, grabbed national attention, sparked outrage from the religious right, and impelled the White House to promise arrests and investigations. And it also triggered responses from some Christian leaders who have been more reticent to criticize the administration.

To break down these divisions and the different ways that religious leaders in and beyond Minnesota are responding, I decided to ask an expert. Jack Jenkins is a national reporter for the Religion News Service, where he covers religion and politics. He spoke to me in between trips to Minneapolis, where multifaith leaders will be meeting this week to organize and discuss ways to tend to their communities and respond to ICE’s presence.

Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

I want to start off with a bird’s-eye view. Can you describe how religious communities, both believers and their leaders, are responding to ICE’s presence in Minnesota right now?

I spent most of my time in Minneapolis and it is much easier to find someone who is vehemently opposed to ICE than the opposite. I think for a lot of faith communities there’s an immediate concern for the people they serve.

For instance, pastors that oversee immigrant-heavy congregations. I spoke to a pastor out there; that’s a lot of stress. They are also very much organizing, but for a variety of reasons that organizing isn’t necessarily public. And it’s relatively rare for a lot of those pastors to be even as public or talking to the press because of concerns for their community. And that’s not just Christian pastors, that’s also imams because the Somali American community also has become a target of this administration.

Then there is also this piece of religious communities that are not as at risk, not as vulnerable, who’ve been very involved in pushback to ICE and to DHS agents. That runs the gamut. There’s one church in particular who helps gather food and supplies to feed large numbers of immigrant families that are afraid to leave their homes in the midst of heavy DHS presence in the region. A lot of churches are involved in that kind of effort.

There’s also more direct acts of resistance too, though, aren’t there?

Yes. I rode along with a pastor who was involved in patrolling the neighborhood where she lives, which happens to be the same neighborhood where Renee Good was killed, looking for DHS agents. In the hour and a half that I rode along with her, we spotted likely DHS agents at least twice as they were driving by being tailed by other cars that were honking horns and blowing whistles to alert the community.

Even after Renee Good was killed, there were multiple clergy that ran to the site of the killing, including that same Unitarian minister, Reverend Ashley Horan, who lives a block away, to try to provide some level of immediate response. Both that pastor and another were shot at or hit with pepper spray or pepper powder.

But when I was patrolling that area with that pastor, every other corner had somebody with a whistle around their neck looking out for DHS. Faith groups are very much a part of that.

Does there seem to be any difference in how faith leaders or communities within the state are responding compared to how voices nationally are talking about this?

“We are seeing far more faith leaders get directly involved as cities are targeted.”

Religious pushback to President Trump’s mass deportation agenda began on day one.

There was that sermon that Bishop Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, gave at the Washington National Cathedral with Trump sitting in the pews in front of her asking the president to have mercy on immigrants. That drew headlines. Religious pushback to his immigration policies hasn’t let up since. We’ve had two popes criticize Trump’s immigration policies. Pope Leo specifically addressed concerns about whether detainees in Chicago were being granted access to faith leaders.

But what’s interesting is what has happened as the administration has launched concentrated efforts in various cities. Early on, I covered a pastor in Southern California where apparent DHS agents showed up on her church property. She ran out and filmed them, demanding they leave. Similarly in California, a pastor got a call that two parishioners were being detained. He ran out and filmed the DHS agents while questioning them.

As these campaigns moved from LA to Portland to DC to Chicago to North Carolina, faith leaders have told me they were in conversation with clergy in cities targeted earlier, training them and sharing information about how to push back against ICE and DHS. When Border Patrol had an influx of agents in Charlotte, within 24 to 48 hours, hundreds of people packed churches hosting ICE watch trainings. Those trainings had actually been planned months earlier.

We are seeing far more faith leaders get directly involved as cities are targeted. Chicago was a good example, where faith leaders were arrested at one protest outside a DHS facility. That likely wouldn’t have happened without these concentrated campaigns.

I want to ask about the outrage after the ICE protest that interrupted a church service in St. Paul. What happened?

The allegation, which I cannot independently confirm, is that one of the pastors of that church is also head of a local ICE or DHS office. Old versions of the church website list him as having been involved in law enforcement. That appears to have been the impetus for that protest.

What followed was interesting. Even religious leaders critical of DHS were uneasy with the nature of that protest and said so publicly. At the same time, many were frustrated by the administration’s reaction and by conservative Christian responses, because dozens of faith groups have opposed DHS actions, have signed onto lawsuits against the administration for claims of violations of religious freedom.

In Chicago last year, viral footage showed DHS agents shooting a Presbyterian minister in the head with pepper balls. I’ve spoken to several pastors who’ve been hit with pepper spray or pepper balls. By my count, between eight and 10 pastors over the last year. That Presbyterian minister, Reverend David Black, was part of a lawsuit that won a temporary restraining order based on religious freedom claims.

Some faith leaders argue there’s a selective concern for religious liberty. One activist involved in that St. Paul protest said, paraphrasing, that houses of worship are either sanctuaries or they’re not. Who gets attention for religious freedom concerns has become a running theme.

What about Catholic leaders? I’ve seen criticism about when they do or don’t speak up, against Trump, specifically some of the most vocal Catholic bishops, like Robert Barron, a conservative leaning Catholic media mogul, and the bishop of the diocese of Winona-Rochester in Minnesota.

It’s very rare to see a bishop involved in a protest. That’s why it stood out when an auxiliary bishop in Chicago participated in a demonstration outside a DHS facility over detainees being denied access to priests. There is also a lawsuit filed by Catholic organizations, priests, and nuns on that issue.

There’s been an awkward dance where the pope has often spoken louder and faster than local bishops. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops has issued a critical statement and video opposing the administration’s immigration policies, and the conference has sued the administration before.

Now Bishop Barron is an interesting figure. He sits on the president’s Religious Liberty Commission and has enormous influence. When concerns were raised about detainee access to priests, Barron joined in voicing concern, but later emphasized that he was not criticizing the administration.

There’s increasing tension inside the bishops’ conference. Groups of bishops are issuing statements independently on immigration. That didn’t use to happen. It reflects deeper division over how to respond to the president’s immigration agenda.

Why does that division exist?

Some bishops occupy different institutional positions. Sitting on a federal religious liberty commission is different than leading a diocese. Holding leadership within the USCCB conference matters. Since Pope Francis and now Pope Leo, the pope has often been more vocal than the conference as a whole, which creates tension. Now that there is an American pope from Chicago, those tensions are sharper.

Let me ask you about a quote from a bishop in New England. You spoke to him because he attracted attention for telling other faith leaders that the time is coming when they may have to to “put [their] bodies on the line.” What did he mean by that?

When I spoke to the Episcopal bishop of New Hampshire, who said clergy should get their “wills in order,” he told me he’s said similar things in the past around gun control advocacy. He was seconded by the Episcopal bishop of Minnesota. In Chicago, more than 200 faith leaders signed a letter referencing putting their bodies on the line.

Many reference Selma, the protests and marches of the civil rights movement, clergy who were killed there, and figures like Bonhoeffer, the Lutheran pastor who was ultimately killed for his part in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Many faith leaders I speak to say those in more privileged positions should go first because they are least vulnerable. If faith leaders aren’t doing it, they argue, then who will?

Should we expect more of this?

I’m about to return to Minneapolis for a gathering of clergy from around the country. They are explicitly likening it to a call to Selma. As long as the administration continues targeted campaigns in cities, I would expect more of this.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2255294223.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.852336924521%2C100%2C78.295326150957&w=1200,N,,2026-01-22 23:37:43.932136

Immediately after Judge Sara Ellis dismissed that case Thursday afternoon, she held another hearing, where attorneys representing the state of Illinois asked if they could essentially share the same discovery that was gathered in the now-dismissed lawsuit.

An attorney for the Trump administration said he would need to confer with his clients before weighing in - but noted they still have several weeks to respond to the latest lawsuit brought by the state of Illinois.

As part of the litigation in the now-dismissed lawsuit, the federal government turned over hundreds of pieces of potential evidence - including surveillance video, body camera recordings and use of force reports that were assembled as part of the lawsuit in the case brought by the protesters, clergy and journalists.

Attorneys representing the Illinois Attorney General's office filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month - making similar criticisms to the one filed this fall by the group of protesters, clergy and journalists.

In this latest lawsuit, attorneys for the state of Illinois argue that the Trump administration's immigration crackdown disrupted the lives of citizens in the Chicago area - made arrests without warrants, randomly questioned people about their citizenship and used chemical weapons on law-abiding citizens.

Senate Bill 4, a measure signed by Governor Greg Abbott amid rising tensions over border security, has been on hold since a federal district judge in Austin issued a preliminary injunction in February 2024, ruling it likely violates federal supremacy over immigration. At the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans Thursday, Texas Solicitor General William R. Peterson urged a full panel of federal judges to toss out the injunction, arguing that challengers like the plaintiff immigrant advocacy groups — Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and American Gateways — don’t even have the legal standing to sue. He leaned on precedents such as FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine to argue nonprofits have no standing based on indirect harms or resource diversion.

“Like Las Americas, Alliance challenged that governmental action impaired its ability to provide services and achieve its organizational mission,” Peterson said, drawing a parallel to the recent Supreme Court case on abortion pills. “The Supreme Court [said] that argument does not work.”

El Paso County joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff. Together, they argue SB4 oversteps by creating a parallel state system for immigration enforcement, potentially clashing with federal laws that govern entry, asylum and removal. Penalties under the law range from misdemeanors for first-time unauthorized entries to felonies carrying up to 20 years in prison for repeat offenses or failing to comply with removal orders.

Peterson likened the nonprofits’ claims to “spending [their] way in” by diverting resources to fight SB4, calling it self-inflicted rather than a true injury. He contrasted this with Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman , a 1982 housing discrimination case where a group had standing because defendants directly lied to its employees about apartment availability.

“Havens was an unusual case,” Peterson told the judges. “The court has been careful not to extend [its] holding.”

The en banc panel of judges peppered Peterson with questions, with Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod drawing an analogy to the abortion pill case, asking why emergency room doctors there lacked standing despite a “flood of new patients,” while immigrant groups here claim harm from SB4’s changes. U.S. Circuit Judge Stephen A. Higginson pressed on Texas’ earlier “invasion” argument under the Constitution’s state self-defense clause, which allows states to act in war-like scenarios without congressional approval.

Peterson downplayed it, saying standing was the “easiest” path to victory, but added that if the court reached the merits, federal laws don’t preempt SB4 because they are “straightforward criminal statutes” that Texas merely supplements.

Higginson also quizzed Peterson on practical conflicts, including whether Texas would drop SB4 prosecutions if suspects couldn’t be deported. Peterson said the law’s text was open to ongoing interpretation, but he highlighted a potential for foreign policy snarls — a key concern for challengers who say SB4 could strain foreign relations.

Cody Wofsy, an ACLU attorney arguing for the nonprofits and El Paso County, countered that SB4 inflicts real harm. He cited District Court findings that the law “will completely change the manner in which plaintiffs must reach counsel and represent noncitizens as they navigate the federal immigration process while in state prison.”

Wofsy argued this isn’t speculative but a direct blow to groups like Las Americas, which help migrants seek asylum.

“If your goal as the organization is trying to make sure people have access to the protections that are available,” he said, SB4 forces a total overhaul.

Wofsy invoked Arizona v. United States , where the Supreme Court in 2012 struck down parts of Arizona’s similar law for intruding on federal turf. He emphasized field preemption — the idea that immigration entry and removal are exclusively federal domains — and conflict preemption, where SB4 clashes with federal laws, including those which guarantee asylum opportunities for those entering without inspection.

“Texas is stepping in and saying, ‘actually, we agree that people should be expelled from the country with no opportunity to apply for asylum,” Wofsy told the judges. “That could not be a more straightforward supremacy clause [violation].”

The panel probed Wofsy, too. One judge asked about the “newness” of SB4, questioning if updating pamphlets or advising clients in state jails truly creates novel requirements. Another asked, “Where’s the constitutional right to file an asylum application?”

Wofsy responded that while states can cooperate with federal efforts, SB4’s unilateral arrests and deportations go too far, echoing rulings against similar laws in Iowa, Florida and Oklahoma.

Elrod returned to standing, noting the nonprofits’ reliance on the law’s novelty. Wofsy distinguished it from the* Alliance* abortion case.

“There’s nothing like that [chain of causation] here,” he said. “Obviously, SB4 is directly affecting the clients of Las Americas’ operation.”

The en banc hearing — involving all 17 active Fifth Circuit judges — follows a rollercoaster appeal. A three-judge panel initially stayed the injunction, allowing SB4 to take effect briefly in March 2024, but the full court reinstated the block.

A ruling could come in months, potentially heading to the Supreme Court.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2023/05/Fifth-Circuit-Court-of-Appeals-New-Orleans-LA2.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2026-01-22 21:39:11.790964

ICE said it has asked for feedback on the project from the Department of Historic Resources (DHR) and the Hanover County Department of Planning.

County officials said they did not initiate the project. Hanover and the tribes now have 30 days to respond to ICE.

The county’s board of supervisors will meet to discuss the notice at the next regular meeting on Wednesday, Jan. 28. Hanover said it will provide a statement on the issue after the meeting.

Richmond Mayor Danny Avula said on Jan. 22 that he understands residents are concerned about the planned ICE facility, and that he wants to remind residents of their rights and options when engaging with law enforcement agencies.

“It’s incredibly important to us that we keep this line of demarcation between local law enforcement and federal agents,” Avula said. “We’ve been very clear that we’re not participating in deportation activities, we’re not coordinating with ICE in any way, and that our local law enforcement exists to do the work of local public safety, to keep the community safe.”

Avula issued a statement on Jan. 21 reiterating his support for the immigrant community as federal agencies ramp up immigration activities across the country.

The vote was 220-207, with seven Democrats breaking with their party and voting yes. The House also passed a separate package of bills to fund other federal agencies in a broad, bipartisan vote in a bid to avert a partial government shutdown on Jan. 31.

In a twist, the House unanimously voted to add an amendment to the package repealing a law crafted by the Senate that allows eight particular Republican senators to sue the government for a minimum of $500,000 in damages after their phone records were collected as part of a Jan. 6 investigation.

House members in both parties have criticized that law since it passed as part of the deal to end the government shutdown two months ago. Thursday's vote puts the Senate in a jam, forcing it to accept repeal or shut down the government next week, when the House is scheduled to be on recess.

The House has combined the repeal amendment and six of its approved spending bills into one package. It now heads to the Senate, where Appropriations Committee leaders have signed off on the funding deal. The package represents the final tranche of the 12 spending bills Congress needs to pass every year to keep the government open, and it will fund it through the end of September.

House Republicans were in a celebratory mood after the vote, and aides were seen taking Champagne bottles to a private room just off the chamber floor.

""Despite the noise, despite our slim margins, despite the fact that most members in the House have never gone through a regular, member-driven appropriations process before, this team got it done,"" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., flanked by GOP colleagues, said at a news conference after the vote. ""The House has now passed all 12 appropriations bills, the Senate will soon do the same, and the president is going to sign them into law — what a concept.""

Some on the far left called on Democrats to defund Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Good, a Minneapolis woman and U.S. citizen, this month.

And in a sign of how the ICE issue has become a major political issue for Democrats, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and his top lieutenants joined rank-and-file Democrats in voting no on the DHS funding bill, saying it lacked sufficient guardrails and accountability for ICE.

Liberal Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., a lead negotiator of the broader funding deal, also voted no on the DHS bill — an unusual move for House Democrats' top appropriator.

Jeffries told reporters, “ICE is out of control and operating, in far too many ways, in a lawless fashion.” He accused ICE of “using taxpayer dollars to inflict brutality on the American people,” including by killing Good “in cold blood.”

The leaders made that decision even after DeLauro and other top Democratic appropriators — who work closely with leadership — struck the bipartisan, bicameral deal to fund the government through the 2026 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.

“You have to ask every individual member who’s going to vote the best interest of their district why they’ve chosen to vote one way or the other,” Jeffries said when he was asked about the decision over ICE.

The seven Democrats who voted in favor were: Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, both of Texas; Jared Golden of Maine; Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington; Don Davis of North Carolina; and Laura Gillen and Tom Suozzi, both of New York.

Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote no.

Some Democrats lamented that their party had not fought for ICE as hard guardrails as they had for an extension of Affordable Care Act funds, when they forced a 43-day shutdown last fall. (Eight Senate Democrats ultimately relented without ACA concessions.)

“Instead of explaining to the American people where we are and what the immigration system is and why it is broken — it is broken, but why it’s broken and what are fixes for it — we just have a bunch of Democrats who have gone around trying to be tougher on immigration than Republicans. It’s never worked,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. “You can’t out-Republican Republicans, because you’re going to lose your base and you’re not going to get any of the Republicans to come over to you.”

She said many Democrats are afraid to lean in to pro-immigrant stances after President Donald Trump used immigration in his 2024 campaign victory.

Jayapal suggested that DeLauro and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top two Democratic appropriators, negotiated DHS funding as part of the broader bill because “they wanted to get this all done. Appropriators often — they just care about getting the bills through.”

DeLauro and Murray have pointed out that Democrats did secure $20 million for body cameras for ICE personnel, as well as cuts in ICE funding for enforcement and removal operations and the number of detention beds.

While most Democrats are treading carefully on immigration, others in the party are going all out in opposition to ICE as they seek to channel the public backlash to the agency. Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., facing a fierce primary challenge from the left, has introduced the Abolish ICE Act, which would dismantle the agency.

Meanwhile, Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., this week introduced the MELT ICE Act, which would end DHS’ funding to detain or monitor immigrants, and redirect that money to health care, housing and other social services in local communities.

Neither stands a chance of passage under Republican majorities in the House and the Senate.

Murray, instead, focused on a series of victories she said Democrats scored in the wider government funding package, including funding for child care, housing assistance, mental health and Pell Grants — in many cases defeating Trump’s proposed cuts.

“There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for,” Murray said. “But the hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260121-ice-officer-vl-502p-2332ad.jpg",N,,2026-01-22 21:38:42.703985

The Trump administration’s surge in Minnesota has emerged as the focal point of the national conversation over ICE’s aggressive enforcement tactics.
Vance, too, said he was struck by the image of the child, remarking that he is a father of a 5-year-old himself.
“Many of the most viral stories of the past couple of weeks have turned out to be, at best, partially true,” Vance said.","Vance on Thursday focused on public safety and crime, and his desire to lower the temperature and support law enforcement. He acknowledged the viral videos circulating on social media could concern many Americans even as he said they often don’t tell the whole story.

“It doesn’t mean there aren’t occasionally stories, there aren’t occasionally videos that suggest that these guys or at least some of the people who work for them are not doing everything right, but very often if you look at the context of what’s going on, you understand these people are under an incredible amount of duress, an incredible amount of chaos,” Vance said, blaming “far-left agitators and local and state officials’ lack of cooperation with the federal government.”

He added that the administration wants to enforce the country’s immigration laws, while also ensuring “people in Minneapolis are able to go about their day.” But, he said, some mayors and police officers refuse to help ICE agents under assault or federal officials locate allegedly violent criminals.

Spokespeople for Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who have repeatedly called for ICE to de-escalate their aggressive tactics or even leave the city, did not respond to requests for comment.

Vance’s trip to Minneapolis comes as Republicans struggle to coalesce around a message that explains their tactics to an increasingly anxious public uneasy with armed agents patrolling communities.

The vice president billed the trip as an opportunity to better understand why Minneapolis has devolved into chaos, and comes as hundreds of military police troops remain on alert for potential deployment if President Donald Trump decides to invoke the Insurrection Act — a move that Democrats warn will spur more unrest in the city.

“Right now, we don’t think that we need that,” Vance said. “The president could change his mind, of course things could get worse, but right now we think that federal law enforcement officers can do the job of federal law enforcement.”

His remarks also followed Trump’s appearance in the White House briefing room this week, when the president said his administration needs to do more to highlight the criminals they’ve arrested in Minnesota during their enforcement crackdowns. Trump, who said he felt sorry for Good’s family, spent several minutes showing photos of immigrants who had committed violent crimes, including murder, saying people “don’t know” who ICE is detaining.

And a new POLITICO poll found that nearly half of all Americans — 49 percent — say Trump’s mass deportation campaign is too aggressive, including one in five voters who backed the president in 2024, the poll finds. And more than one in three Trump voters say that while they support the goals of the president’s mass deportation campaign, they disapprove of the way he is implementing it.

The Trump administration’s surge in Minnesota has emerged as the focal point of the national conversation over ICE’s aggressive enforcement tactics. The Trump administration has repeatedly had to explain why federal immigration agents have arrested U.S. citizens and attempt to justify agents’ actions captured in other captivating and controversial videos and photos, including one of a 5-year-old boy that circulated on the internet Thursday.

Vance, too, said he was struck by the image of the child, remarking that he is a father of a 5-year-old himself. But he said it’s a good example of the false narratives rippling through social media, and that when he did more research, he learned that the father was in the country illegally and ran from law enforcement, leaving the child behind. He said ICE stayed with the boy, though school officials claimed the boy was used as bait to lure in the father — a claim Democrats amplified and spread widely.

The firm noted that ""the results of the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office autopsy have not yet been released to the family or legal team.""
That legal team also commissioned an independent autopsy that contradicted aspects of the Hennepin County medical examiner's autopsy.""
Tim Walz, state Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Saint Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, and Ramsey County Attorney John Choi.","""As a lawyer, I've been waiting for this,"" New York University law professor Ryan Goodman said early Thursday after attorneys for Renee Good's family released findings from an independent autopsy conducted as part of a civil investigation into her death.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fatally shot Good in Minnesota two weeks ago. While the Trump administration has tried to paint the 37-year-old US citizen and mother of three as a ""domestic terrorist,"" and argue that the ICE agent was acting in self-defense, videos, eyewitness accounts, and analyses of the shooting have fueled calls for Ross' arrest and prosecution.

The independent autopsy provides ""strong evidence against Agent Ross, given what it means about [his] second or third shot through [the] left-side window"" of Good's vehicle, Goodman wrote on social media. Those shots make the ""easiest criminal case of a willful killing.""

The Chicago-based law firm Romanucci & Blandin said in a Wednesday statement that it commissioned a ""highly respected and credentialed medical pathologist"" to conduct the autopsy at the request of Good's family, and the expert found:

There were three clear gunshot wound paths to Renee's body;

One gunshot wound struck the left forearm, causing soft tissue hemorrhage;

One gunshot wound traversed the right breast without penetrating major organs;

One gunshot wound entered the left side of her head near the temple and exited the right side of her head;

The breast and left forearm wounds were not immediately life-threatening; and

A fourth wound was a graze wound consistent with a firearm injury, but with no penetration.

""We believe the evidence we are gathering and will continue to gather in our investigation will suffice to prove our case,"" said lead Attorney Antonio M. Romanucci. ""The video evidence depicting the events of January 7, 2026, is clear, particularly when viewed through the standards of reasonable policing and totality of circumstances. Additionally, our legal team will continue its unwavering and proactive advocacy for Renee's life and her family.""

The firm noted that ""the results of the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office autopsy have not yet been released to the family or legal team.""

The Washington Post highlighted that ""Romanucci, one of the firm's founding partners, was on the legal team that represented the family of George Floyd after he was killed by a Minneapolis police officer. That legal team also commissioned an independent autopsy that contradicted aspects of the Hennepin County medical examiner's autopsy.""

The day after Good's death, Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, announced that the probe into the fatal shooting ""would now be led solely"" by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Meanwhile, several officials with the US Department of Justice (DOJ), including prosecutors and others in the Civil Rights Division, have recently resigned over the case.

The DOJ has refused to open a civil rights investigation into Good's killing but is investigating Minnesota officials for alleged conspiracy to impede the thousands of federal immigration agents sent to the Twin Cities.

The DHS bill will be bundled alongside three other spending bills, totaling a combined $1.2 trillion in federal spending. The entire package’s passing is a significant step toward averting a government shutdown come Jan. 30.

Lawmakers in the House of Representatives voted on two separate packages on Thursday afternoon. One groups together three spending bills to fund the departments of War, Education, Labor, Transportation and Health and Human Services. The second is a standalone bill funding DHS, which includes ICE.

ILHAN OMAR VOWS 'NOT TO GIVE ICE A SINGLE CENT' IN HEATED CONGRESSIONAL FUNDING FIGHT

The DHS bill passed by a 220-207 vote with the help of seven Democrats. Only one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted in opposition. The larger package passed with much broader bipartisan support in a 341-88 vote, with 149 Democrats joining Republicans to pass it.

Most Democrats bucked the DHS funding legislation after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other top Democrats said they were opposed to the bill due to insufficient restrictions against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

With the legislation in the rearview mirror, the House advanced the last pieces of the puzzle needed to avoid a government shutdown by the end of the month. It’s also the first time in nearly 30 years that Congress has avoided funding the government through one massive spending bill known as an ""omnibus"" or through short-term incremental funding extensions called ""continuing resolutions"" (CRs).

CONGRESS UNVEILS $1.2T SPENDING BILL AS PROGRESSIVE REVOLT BREWS OVER ICE FUNDING

With the passage of Thursday’s package, lawmakers will have advanced four small bundles of two to three of their 12 annual appropriations bills.

While some conservatives still called for the 12 bills to be passed as individual pieces of legislation, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., framed the GOP effort as a step toward returning Congress to the way the process is supposed to work on paper.

""This is a big thing,"" Johnson told Fox News Digital. ""We will be making history this week, having moved 12 [appropriations] bills through the process. A lot of people thought it would be impossible. But we stuck to it, stuck together — it’s a big thing.""

House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., echoed Johnson’s framing.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: PROGRESSIVES EYE SHUTDOWN LEVERAGE TO REIN IN ICE, VENEZUELA OPERATIONS

""We aren’t here for just another stopgap temporary fix,"" Cole said on the House floor. ""We are here to finish the job by providing full-year funding. This measure is a product of sustained engagement and serious legislation.""

If passed by the Senate, the bills will eliminate the possibility of a government shutdown for the remainder of FY 2026.

Despite eventually drawing support from Democrats, the final DHS bill faced fierce opposition from most of the party. In their view, the bill failed to shore up safeguards against ICE abuses in the wake of a fatal confrontation between an ICE agent and a woman named Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Good was shot and killed in her car and was accused by Republicans of impeding ICE operations just before her killing.

""Kristi Noem and ICE are out of control. Taxpayer dollars are being misused to brutalize U.S. citizens, including the tragic killing of Renee Nicole Good. This extremism must end,"" Jeffries said in a statement ahead of the vote.

While the final bill does include some new safeguards — such as requiring ICE agents to adopt body cameras and to undergo additional training on how to interact with the public — Democrats said those measures fell woefully short.

HOUSE PASSES NEARLY $180B FUNDING PACKAGE AFTER CONSERVATIVE REBELLION OVER MINNESOTA FRAUD FEARS

""All the guardrails in the world don’t make sense if the administration isn’t going to follow the law and the language that we pass. Members have to take that into account,"" Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 3 Democrat in the House, said. ""Ultimately, members are going to vote [for] what’s in the best interest of their districts.""

The Senate will move on the package next week, with the deadline to avert a partial government shutdown fast approaching at the end of this month.

Senate Republicans and Democrats have reached a tenuous truce in the upper chamber after having just exited the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with neither side inclined to once again shut the lights off in Washington, D.C.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and the bulk of his caucus, contend that the best way to rein in some of the administration’s actions, particularly with Trump’s usage of ICE, was through the government funding process.

But despite the four-bill package being constructed with a bipartisan touch, its passage in the upper chamber isn’t guaranteed.

That’s because there is a cohort of Senate Democrats frustrated with the restrictions in the DHS funding bill who contend, like their colleagues in the House, that they do not go far enough.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Committee, signaled that he would not support the package once it comes to the Senate despite being a part of negotiations on the final product.

The woman, Nekima Levy Armstrong, also appears to have darker skin in the altered image. Armstrong was one of three people arrested on Thursday in connection to a demonstration that disrupted church services in St Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday. Demonstrators alleged that one of the pastors, David Easterwood, was the acting field director of the St Paul Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. Bondi announced the arrests on social media on Thursday morning.

The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, posted an image of Armstrong’s arrest at 10.21am on Thursday, less than an hour after Bondi’s announcement. The image shows a law enforcement agent, face blurred out, escorting Armstrong, who appears to be handcuffed. Armstrong, dressed in all black, appears to be composed in the picture.

A little more than 30 minutes later, the White House posted another image of Armstrong’s arrest in which she is crying. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, reposted the image. The image posted by the White House is altered, a Guardian analysis found.

The Guardian overlaid the White House photo with the Noem photo and found that the law enforcement agents in both pictures line up exactly, confirming they are the same image. There are other similarities between the photos. An unidentified person can be seen in the same place behind the arresting agent.

United States

WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed an appropriations bill that would renew ICE’s excessive budget, with no strings attached, adding to the over $170 billion in taxpayer funds already allocated for immigration enforcement in July 2025. This bill also comes amidst public fear and outrage in response to widespread abuses and violence by ICE and Border Patrol, including their continued, escalating assault on Minneapolis. Recent public opinion polling in the wake of the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis shows ICE’s approval rating is at its lowest since President Trump took office in January 2025.

If passed in the Senate, the bill would signal a stamp of approval for ICE, even as the agency continues to operate with impunity and growing disregard for constitutional rights.

In response to this news, Kate Voigt, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, had the following reaction:

“The House vote in favor of excessive funding for ICE with no meaningful accountability measures is wildly out of touch with polling that shows the majority of voters oppose ICE and Border Patrol’s attacks on our communities. The bill fails to rein in ICE and Border Patrol at a time when they are engaged in an unprecedented assault on our rights, safety, and democratic way of life. The billions in funding in this bill will only embolden ICE and CBP to continue arresting our neighbors – immigrant and U.S. citizen alike – no matter the costs to our communities, economy, and integrity of our Constitution.

“While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the Members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation. Now we need our Senators to hold firm and refuse to be complicit in fueling ICE’s reckless abuses in our communities.”

The House approved the funds with overwhelming bipartisan support – with one exception.

Just seven House Democrats voted for the bill funding the Department of Homeland Security through September, citing Immigration and Customs Enforcement tactics in Minneapolis and elsewhere.

""ICE is totally out of control using taxpayer dollars to brutalize American citizens and law-abiding immigrant families,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Thursday.

Despite the paper-thin Republican majority in the House, the measure still passed 220-207. Democrats saw the vote as an opportunity to rebuke the Trump Administration's immigration crackdown after an ICE officer shot and killed 37 year-old Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.

The Senate is expected to vote next week on these remaining funding measures as a group, forcing Democrats to choose between approving or opposing the full slate of funding, which also include billions of dollars for defense, health, transportation and housing.

Democrats had attempted to insert more stringent measures to reign in ICE, such as prohibiting the agency from deporting or detaining American citizens, banning officers from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from conducting raids at places of worship, hospitals and schools.

The Democrats who begrudgingly backed the final package said they won dedicated funds to provide body cameras for ICE officersfor the first time and allocated more money for oversight and de-escalation training. The final legislation also holds funding for ICE flat, while reducing the budget for enforcement and removal operations by $115 million and cutting detention bed capacity.

""This bill is not perfect,"" said Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district covers a long stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border. ""However this bill is better than the alternatives of either funding the department under a continuing resolution or shutting down the government.""

Democratic leadership concluded that these concessions were not sufficient, though they did not stop members from voting in favor of the measure.

The top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), ultimately decided that grave concerns over ICE outweighed gains in the bill, like increases for funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Agency and pay raises for air traffic controllers and members of the Coast Guard.

""We have to deal with what's happened in this country and we cannot turn a blind eye,"" she said. ""Make the decision based on where your heart is and what you believe in.""

Rep. Tom Cole, (R-Okla.), Appropriations Committee chair, said Democrats were ignoring most of the contents of the funding measure, which includes appropriations for a host of agencies Americans rely on.

""You're voting against the people that will help you in a hurricane or a tornado or disaster of some sort,"" Cole said. ""Why in the world should they be penalized?""

House members are departing Washington ahead of a forecasted winter storm for a week-long recess, leaving the Senate to finish the appropriations process before the deadline at the end of next week.

Funding ran out for the federal government at the end of last September. The government remained shuttered for a record 43 days as Democrats fought to renew expiring health insurance subsidies. The shutdown ended with a deal to fund three of twelve appropriations packages through September 2026, but only provided a short-term extension through Jan. 30 for the remaining funding categories.

Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she will be voting in favor of the remaining funding measures, which keep funding mostly flat and stave off the steep cuts the Trump Administration had called for.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2000x1125+0+104/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff7%2F65%2F918409a9447e9a05a236db087a99%2F021025-capitol-zayrharodriguez-4-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 21:39:03.010790

Leaked ICE memo asserts authority to enter homes without a judge’s warrant

A leaked memorandum dated May 2025 but revealed publicly on January 22, 2026 has ignited a legal firestorm around U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) practices. First reported by the Washington Post, the document instructs deportation officers that they may enter private residences to make arrests using only an administrative removal order (Form I-205), bypassing the long-standing requirement for a judicial warrant.

Civil-liberties advocates and former ICE officials say the policy runs head-on into Fourth-Amendment protections, which make the home the apex of privacy expectations. While courts have allowed warrantless entry at the U.S. border, they have traditionally required a judge’s signature to breach a residence door. The memo’s disclosure follows recent heavily publicised ICE operations in Minnesota and Texas in which agents forced entry and detained individuals later found to be U.S. citizens.

For corporate mobility programs, the stakes are high. Hundreds of thousands of employees on temporary visas live in mixed-status households; surprise home raids could chill workforce morale and raise security concerns for company-provided housing. Employment lawyers are advising HR teams to refresh “Know-Your-Rights” trainings, ensure emergency hotlines are staffed, and review privacy clauses in relocation leases.

Amid this atmosphere, VisaHQ can serve as a practical resource for employers, HR teams, and individual travelers who need up-to-date guidance on U.S. entry documentation and compliance. Through its online platform (https://www.visahq.com/united-states/), users can quickly check visa requirements, obtain application support, and receive alerts on regulatory changes—helping to minimize the risks that arise when enforcement policies shift overnight.

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have demanded hearings, and litigation is expected. If courts strike down the policy, prior arrests made under the memo could also face challenges, adding further uncertainty. Until then, employers should assume increased enforcement activity and counsel foreign national staff on how to respond if agents arrive at their door.

A different political approach to migration

Spain’s position sets it apart from many EU countries that have tightened immigration policies amid the rise of far-right political movements. The country’s center-left government has framed migration as an economic asset, promoting legal pathways for entry while seeking to reduce irregular arrivals.

That strategy appears to be delivering results. Irregular arrivals to Spain fell by 42 percent last year to around 36,000, compared with Italy’s largely unchanged figure of approximately 66,000.

""I believe that our figures and migration policy overall greatly strengthen Spain’s role in defining migratory policy within the European Union,"" Grande-Marlaska said.

Unlike many of its European neighbors, Spain's government has credited migration with helping to lead the country out of a long recession that lasted over a decade, with foreign workers making up over 14 percent of the workforce. However, it is worth noting that Spain’s migration landscape is shaped overwhelmingly by Latin American migration, a trend that researchers and official data trace over years. This might generally flatten out some of the integration and employment challenges facing migrants in other countries, who might not necessarily have a shared language and some similar cultural practices, as Spain shares with many Latin American countries.

PorCausa’s research has highlighted that a large majority of irregular migrants historically come from Central and South America -- around 77 percent in earlier analyses -- while Africans accounted for only about 9.2 percent of irregular immigrants, with Moroccans being the largest group among them.

Official Spanish figures show that as of late 2025, nearly 20 percent of the population was foreign-born, with Latin Americans representing roughly 60 percent of registered foreign residents, including large communities from Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador -- a composition that reinforces the importance of cultural and linguistic integration in Spain’s labor market and society.

Broader EU debate on migration policy

The debate comes as Denmark announced last month that a majority of EU countries support processing asylum claims in what it called ""safe third countries"" to deter arrivals. The European Parliament is also expected to move toward more restrictive migration rules later this year.

To reinforce its own approach, Spain has expanded its presence in West Africa, particularly in Mauritania, Senegal and The Gambia. Nearly 100 Spanish police officers have been deployed alongside surveillance equipment aimed at preventing dangerous sea crossings to Spain’s Canary Islands.

Analysts say regional politics are also shaping migration partnerships. Morocco has positioned itself as a key partner for European governments, including Spain and France, in exchange for financial support and diplomatic backing -- including recognition of its claims over Western Sahara, a move strongly opposed by Algeria. Observers say this rivalry has added momentum to Algiers’ own efforts to strengthen ties with international and European migration agencies.

Human rights concerns and official response

Human rights groups, however, have raised concerns about the impact of such measures. Human Rights Watch has alleged that support from Spain and the EU to West African authorities has led to abuses, particularly in Mauritania, where Spanish police were reportedly present during the detention of migrants under abusive conditions.

In an August 2025 report, Human Rights Watch documented broader concerns about European Union and Spanish cooperation with Mauritania, a key transit country on the Canary Islands route. The group alleged that Mauritanian security forces carried out violence, arbitrary arrests, inhumane detention and collective expulsions of migrants and asylum seekers between 2020 and early 2025, while continuing to receive equipment, training and funding from the EU and Spain.

The report cited Spain’s deployment of police and civil guard units to Mauritania and pointed to a 2024 EU-Mauritania migration partnership backed by a 210 million euro EU funding package, which it claimed lacked adequate human rights safeguards.

Grande-Marlaska denied any wrongdoing, saying Spain had ""not seen any illegal action or action against refugees' fundamental rights."" He added that Madrid was working to strengthen its teams in Mauritania and Senegal and to provide additional drones and vehicles to local forces.

Human Rights Watch has raised similar concerns about EU migration cooperation with Tunisia, where it says security forces have carried out collective expulsions of migrants to desert border regions, despite EU and member state funding and equipment support.

According to Spanish government data, migrant arrivals to the Canary Islands fell by 62 percent last year from record levels seen in 2024.

European Commission response and 'innovative solutions'

Speaking to InfoMigrants at the end of December, a European Commission spokesperson said the Commission had received the joint letter signed by ministers of 19 Member States ""on new and innovative solutions to counter and prevent irregular migration to Europe,"" calling it ""a welcome sign of support for our comprehensive approach to migration management.""

The spokesperson said the EU was strengthening its internal migration framework through the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum, while also focusing on cooperation with third countries.

""Externally, we work with partners to address the root causes of migration, fight migrant smuggling, strengthen readmission cooperation and promote legal pathways,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the Commission was ""stepping up work on returns and with partner countries as well as to explore innovative solutions when it comes to managing migration.""

According to the Commission, the approach is already showing results. Irregular arrivals ""are down another 26 percent this year. And our ambition is to strengthen it further,"" the spokesperson told InfoMigrants.

Return hubs and legal framework

The Commission also highlighted its proposal for a New Common European System for Returns, including a legal framework for so-called return hubs. These would apply only to people with enforceable return decisions who have ""exhausted all appeals and still found to have no legal right to remain in the EU,"" the spokesperson said.

Any such hubs, the Commission added, would have to be established through international agreements with third countries that ""respect international human rights standards, including the principle of non-refoulement,"" and would exclude unaccompanied minors and families with children.

The spokesperson also stated the framework would require an independent monitoring mechanism, clear conditions for stays in the hubs, defined procedures for what follows, and provisions for addressing any breaches of the agreements.

The spokesperson confirmed that the proposal is currently with the Council and the Parliament.

On funding, the spokesperson told InfoMigrants the Commission has proposed a new multi-annual financial framework reflected its determination ""to support our intentions and defend our interests with the necessary firepower,"" while urging EU co-legislators to reach a swift agreement on the legal framework.

As EU lawmakers weigh the Commission’s proposals, the debate over return hubs and external partnerships is likely to test the limits of how far member states are prepared to externalize migration management, amid growing calls from countries such as Denmark to revisit or sidestep existing European human rights constraints.

The Memo, signed in May 2025 by Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, asserts that administrative warrants (Form I-205 Warrants) may be relied upon as a basis to enter a place of residence and conduct immigration arrests. Notably, administrative warrants may be issued by ICE agents directly and are not issued or approved by federal district court or magistrate judges. An ICE administrative warrant must be supported by a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge (also a member of the executive branch, not a federal district court or magistrate judge). The Memo instructs ICE officers to knock and announce and “use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter” if admittance is refused.

This policy departs from past practice and raises significant constitutional and legal questions. Historically, administrative warrants were limited to supporting arrests in public places, and only warrants issued by a “neutral and detached magistrate” (a judicial warrant) could authorize ICE agents to enter nonpublic areas like residences. The memorandum itself acknowledges that the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) “has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone” for this purpose, but states that DHS’s Office of General Counsel has “recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.” The Memo does recognize at least some constitutional and policy- or practice-based limitations to its position, but it is not clear whether and how even those acknowledged limitations are applied in practice.

This Memo was made public through a whistleblower complaint brought by two anonymous U.S. officials. According to that complaint, the Memo has not been formally distributed to all personnel—although it is addressed to “All ICE Personnel”—but rather apparently has been provided to select DHS officials who were then directed to verbally brief on the policy when training others.

In a court hearing today, Friends of the Everglades continued its legal fight to get public records about the Florida Division of Emergency Management’s arrangement with federal agencies to fund an ICE detention center known as “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades. The court ordered the agency to comply with Friends’ records requests within 21 days.

The failure to disclose those records violates Florida’s Government-in-the-Sunshine Act, which requires agencies to make official records available to the public. Florida and federal agencies have been withholding information about federal involvement and funding to claim they were not required to comply with federal environmental law before building the facility.

The lawsuit was filed in the Second Judicial Circuit for Leon County.

Friends of the Everglades, represented in this matter by Earthjustice and attorney Paul Schwiep of the Coffey Burlington law firm, has been requesting public records about the hastily constructed Everglades detention center, under Fla. Stat. Ch. 119, since June 24, 2025. The detention center is still operating because an August 2025 court injunction to shut it down over environmental violations was paused while the state and federal agencies appeal. The court of appeals has scheduled a hearing on that case for April 2026.

In the federal lawsuit challenging the government’s failure to account for the detention center’s environmental impacts, Florida and federal agencies claimed in September that there was no federal involvement — including any federal funding decision — that would require compliance with federal environmental law.

But new evidence produced in response to this lawsuit confirms that state and federal officials agreed as early as June, before the facility opened, that the facility would receive millions of dollars in federal funding. The Department of Homeland Security provided an official “notice of award allocation” to Florida for $608.4 million in July. These facts were not disclosed to the public, while the agencies continued to claim in court that no funding application or decision had been made. There is every reason to believe that more records exist that have yet to be produced.

“The State and the Trump Administration have taken the untenable position that Florida constructed a 5,000-bed immigration detention facility in the Everglades for federal use without any coordination or communication between them. That claim defies common sense. Documents exist, and under the Florida Constitution, they belong to Florida’s taxpayers and should be disclosed,” said attorney Paul Schwiep of Coffey Burlington.

“Alligator Alcatraz was shrouded in secrecy from the start, as the government tried to dodge its legal duty to protect the Everglades. If the state won’t voluntarily comply with public records laws about this ICE detention center, we must insist on accountability through the courts,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/everglades-detention_daniel-torok.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 18:39:10.238208

Mr. Trump’s deportations under the Alien Enemies Act represent a small but highly contested fraction of the roughly 500,000 immigrants he has expelled since returning to office.

But the court has not yet ruled on whether Mr. Trump’s use of the act is itself legal.
memo rejects one of the core claims of Mr. Trump’s March Alien Enemies Act proclamation — that Mr. Maduro’s government controls the actions of Tren de Aragua.","A federal appeals court on Thursday considered whether the United States was in fact suffering an “invasion” by the “hybrid criminal state” of Venezuela, as President Trump argued in March when he invoked an 18th century war power to deport migrants.

In what is known as an “en banc” hearing, all 17 active-status judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard roughly an hour of arguments about whether the administration could lawfully use Mr. Trump’s proclamation to summarily deport immigrants it accused of having ties to a violent Venezuelan gang under the Alien Enemies Act, a 227-year-old wartime law.

In September, a three-judge panel of the court ruled 2 to 1 that Mr. Trump’s proclamation had wrongly declared an “invasion or predatory incursion,” but the full court agreed to rehear the matter this week.

Mr. Trump’s deportations under the Alien Enemies Act represent a small but highly contested fraction of the roughly 500,000 immigrants he has expelled since returning to office. The effort to put his military and national security powers in the service of his immigration agenda represents one of his most aggressive assertions of presidential power, one that has led to a prolonged clash with the courts.

When the United States is in a declared war, or faces invasion or predatory incursion, the Alien Enemies Act gives the president the power to arrest and deport citizens of hostile nations who are at least 14 years old. The Trump administration has argued that members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, have taken over apartment complexes and committed enough acts of violence that their presence amounts to an “invasion,” one that is backed by the Venezuelan state.

On Thursday, the government argued that Mr. Trump’s proclamation was “conclusive” and that the judges would be overstepping their role to second-guess its findings about what constituted an invasion.

That prompted a hypothetical question from Chief Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod, an appointee of President George W. Bush’s. “What if the proclamation said we’re having a British invasion? They’re sending all these musicians over to corrupt young minds, and the Prime Minister is in on it?” she asked, referring to the influence of the Beatles and other British rock groups on U.S. popular culture during the 1960s.

“Is there some point where it becomes preposterous on its face?” she continued. “Or is it always defer, defer, defer?”

Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the Trump administration, responded that it would be up to Congress, not the courts, to push back.

“That is a question for the political branches,” he said. “The solutions are political.”

While the law has been used by presidents only during three declared wars, Mr. Ensign noted that its text also gave the president special deportation powers if an invasion were merely “attempted” or “threatened.” He cited a case in which the Supreme Court allowed President Harry S. Truman to expel a German immigrant and Nazi propagandist using the act after World War II had already ended.

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has been representing three Venezuelan detainees and sued over the administration’s effort to use the statute, argued that Mr. Trump was misusing a wartime authority and that the courts had the power to step in.

The Alien Enemies Act, he said, was not “a blank check” from Congress “for the president to use his war powers any time he considers it valuable.” He noted the array of other tools, such as criminal prosecution and immigration courts, that the government had to deal with members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang.

The A.C.L.U. has also questioned how the administration has gone about identifying members of Tren de Aragua on the basis of their “urban street wear” and tattoos. After the administration rushed to send planeloads of deportees to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, a district court judge in Washington opened an inquiry into whether administration officials might be guilty of contempt for refusing to turn three of the planes around.

The Supreme Court has made two preliminary rulings on the Alien Enemies Act, first requiring the government to give detainees more due process and then pausing the deportations altogether while litigation over the statute’s use proceeded through the courts.

But the court has not yet ruled on whether Mr. Trump’s use of the act is itself legal. A majority of the justices said they wanted to first hear from the judges of the Fifth Circuit on that question. The hearing on Thursday offered a preview of arguments that were likely to reach the Supreme Court — the appeals court is expected to rule in the coming weeks.

Judge James C. Ho, one of the six Trump appointees on the court, said that for the purposes of the Alien Enemies Act, Mr. Trump’s proclamation was itself sufficient to satisfy the statute’s requirements, comparing it to a congressional declaration of war. “Declaration comes from Congress,” he said. “Invasion from the president.”

Since the March proclamation, Mr. Trump has taken further steps to militarize his approach to Venezuela. The United States began attacking boats, some off the coast of Venezuela, that it alleged were trafficking in drugs. Experts say the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings that violate the laws of armed conflict. In January, U.S. forces captured President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela and spirited him away from Caracas in the middle of the night to be prosecuted for alleged drug trafficking and other crimes.

Other national security claims that the administration has made about Venezuela have turned out to be dubious. A declassified C.I.A. memo rejects one of the core claims of Mr. Trump’s March Alien Enemies Act proclamation — that Mr. Maduro’s government controls the actions of Tren de Aragua.

In its filings, the government argued that Mr. Maduro’s arrest made “even clearer that the president’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act was part of a high-level national security mission that exists outside the realm of judicial interference.”

That argument was discussed only briefly at Thursday’s hearing. Mr. Ensign reiterated that Tren de Aragua “is intimately tied up with the Maduro regime,” while Mr. Gelernt pointed out that Mr. Maduro’s removal from power could therefore serve to lessen the threat.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22dc-immig-pfhv/22dc-immig-pfhv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 17:38:21.371169

Divisions over DHS funding have only deepened as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, even far from the border.
Democrats were hoping to put significant guardrails on the conduct of ICE and CBP officers in the spending bill.
The compromise bill that includes funding for body cameras and additional training did not satisfy most on the Democratic side.","It was a victory for House GOP leaders, who overcame attendance issues and concerns about the overall size of the spending package within their ranks. The chamber has now passed all 12 annual appropriations bills.

Democrats demanded a standalone vote on the DHS funding bill so that their caucus could voice their objection to the Trump administration’s harsh enforcement tactics — a concern that has been amplified by recent ICE and CBP operations in Minnesota.

The bills passed Thursday rejected many of the steep funding cuts to major domestic agencies that the Trump administration sought in the White House budget request earlier this year, but neither do they offer significant funding boosts. The Department of Housing and Urban Development would see a 9 percent boost over current funding levels, totaling $84.3 billion for HUD.

The Education Department would receive $79 billion, a slight increase of $217 million above current funding. The Department of Health and Human Services would be funded at nearly $117 billion, a $210 million increase, while the Department of Labor would get $13.7 billion, a $65 million hike.

As recently as Tuesday morning, it was not clear that the two parties would be able to strike a compromise on funding DHS.

“That was really negotiated right to the end,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democratic appropriator in the House, told reporters. “And I believe that portion of the negotiation had to go to the White House, where you had Stephen Miller and somebody who was really making a determination on it.”

DeLauro was among the Democrats who voted against the bill, announcing on the floor that she had too many misgivings about the Trump administration’s immigration agenda. Only seven Democrats ended up voting for the bill; some argued that the negotiated bill was preferable to the alternatives — a stopgap measure that would give Trump a freer hand to run the department, or a shutdown that would affect key nonimmigration agencies such as TSA. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only Republican opposed.

Divisions over DHS funding have only deepened as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, even far from the border. Coming to an agreement only got harder as Democrats stepped up their criticism after two incidents in Minnesota: one where an ICE agent shot and killed U.S. citizen Renée Good and another when an ICE officer shot an undocumented man during an arrest.

Democrats were hoping to put significant guardrails on the conduct of ICE and CBP officers in the spending bill. The compromise bill that includes funding for body cameras and additional training did not satisfy most on the Democratic side.

House Democratic leaders, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, spoke out against the bill during a closed-door caucus meeting Wednesday. Leadership heard “overwhelmingly” from their caucus members ahead of the vote that this bill did not do enough to rein in ICE following recent clashes in Minnesota.

Some Democrats wanted more than guardrails, calling instead for defunding and dismantling ICE altogether.

“It has some additional provisions for body cameras, for extra training, things like that, that we think will increase the professionalism, but it’s a good, solid bill,” House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said Wednesday.

The final compromise would keep ICE funded at $10 billion for the fiscal year and would reduce the agency’s budget for enforcement and removal efforts. It would require DHS to use $20 million to outfit immigration enforcement agents with body cameras, direct the department to give officers more training on defusing conflict while interacting with the public and provide a separate $20 million for independent oversight of DHS detention facilities.

The House voted separately on the three-bill measure to fund the Pentagon and other departments through the end of September. Under a procedural measure approved earlier Thursday, those bills will be bundled together with the DHS measure and a previously approved two-bill package before being sent to the Senate.

Lawmakers voted down two amendments from conservatives before final passage. The chamber voted 291-136 to reject a proposal from Rep. Ralph Norman (R-Ark.) to eliminate all earmarks in the Labor-HHS-Education portion of the bill.

It also rejected, in a 268-164 vote, a proposal to overturn a mandate that automakers equip new vehicles with technology that prevents drunk driving. The amendment from Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Scott Perry (R-Pa.) would scrap the mandate Congress enacted in 2021 for the Department of Transportation to create those regulations.

The package also includes a scaled back attempt at reining in drug middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers and renewals for several major public health programs, along with $4.6 billion in funding for community health centers pushed for by Democrats.

The measure also includes the customary payment to the widows or heirs of lawmakers who have died in office, this time to Jill LaMalfa, widow of Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.), who died earlier this month.

The Senate is expected to consider that six-bill package when the chamber returns from recess next week. While many Democratic senators are already announcing their opposition based on the ICE funding, others will be hard-pressed to reject spending on the Pentagon and key domestic agencies — many of which are being funded at levels well beyond what the Trump administration proposed.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F2e%2F18%2F68ae36df4abca42471a34e8eee23%2Fu-s-congress-48773.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 17:57:21.741330

Ignore his egomaniacal addition of his name on the Kennedy Center. Such travesties are easily undone once he’s gone.

Alas, the same can’t be said for the incalculable damage that Trump has done in just one year to the nation’s precious intangibles: its character and constitutional protections at home, and its alliances and reputation globally.

Trump’s is a perversely remarkable achievement in so short a time. The havoc he’s brought — in lost healthcare coverage, unfunded medical research to cure diseases, crackdowns on academia, higher prices from tariffs, inflated debt, erosion of the rule of law and the tarnishing of America’s credibility and leadership abroad — is worse than many, myself included, expected. The impacts of many actions will outlast him. Some losses will be irreparable.

Americans knew what cruel coarseness Trump was capable of, knew that he promised retribution and a makeover to some backward-looking imagined American greatness devoid of diversity. But what most people didn’t bank on was just how unchecked he would be by Congress or, so far, the Supreme Court — his constitutionally coequal partners, or so the founders thought.

As it happens, never has Trump’s unhinged radicalism and affinity for force been so plain and threatening as it’s been in this month of the first anniversary of his return to power, looking from Minnesota to Greenland and Venezuela.

He has Minneapolis under siege: Thousands of masked, armed agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement outnumber local police about 6 to 1. More than in Trump’s militarization of Los Angeles, Chicago and other Democratic-run cities before, in Minneapolis Americans are seeing countless witness videos of the abuses of his “mass deportations” campaign by newly created paramilitary forces. After the killing of citizen protester Renee Good, the officer who shot her three times is going uninvestigated, let alone punished, while Trump’s Department of Injustice served subpoenas on Minnesota’s governor and five other Democratic officials, accusing them of obstructing operations.

Thanks to a compliant Republican-run Congress, Trump has tens of billions more for the rest of his term to hire additional storm troopers, ill-trained in police tactics or the Constitution. Meanwhile, he repeatedly threatens to invoke the Insurrection Act, a 219-year-old law, rarely used (contrary to Trump’s claims), allowing him to deploy military troops domestically. Red states apparently need not fear.

Trump’s reshaping of domestic law enforcement to emphasize force and his politicization of the military will be hard to unwind. Civil liberties and essential respect for law enforcement and the military will be the loser if they’re not.

Consider the declaration on Sunday of Trump’s resident White House brownshirt, Stephen Miller, that “only federal officers are upholding the law” in Minnesota and that local and state police must “surrender.” Back the blue? Nah, only the ones in fatigues or plainclothes, tactical vests and masks. It’s madness. He and Trump have it backward.

One member of Minneapolis-area law enforcement, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley, on Tuesday stood flanked by other area police chiefs to say they’d all had “endless complaints about civil rights violations in our streets from U.S. citizens, including local cops — all people of color.” Bruley told of one of his off-duty officers who was stopped without cause by ICE agents, guns drawn, and asked for proof of citizenship. When the encounter grew threatening, she started to record. An agent slapped her phone away. The feds left when she finally told them she was a police officer. Said Bruley: “If it is happening to our officers, it pains me to think how many of our community members are falling victim to this every day. It has to stop.”

Yes, it does. But here’s a safe bet: It won’t. Even after Trump, that lawless attitude will persist among federal agents who were hired during his term.

Simultaneously, there are the Trump-provoked events abroad. In his grubby grab for North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally Denmark’s autonomous island of Greenland, after his takeover of Venezuela, Americans and the globe see that Trump aspires to be not the leader of the free world, like American presidents for 80 years, and not even a mere king of America, but emperor of the Western Hemisphere, unbound by alliances and international law.

Even as Trump falsely claims U.S. possession of Greenland is necessary for national and world security against China and Russia — the United States has long had the right to use Greenland for security bases and operations — he repeatedly acknowledges that he simply covets the icebound island the way he did big properties in his Manhattan real estate days. Ownership is “psychologically important for me,” he told the New York Times this month. That’s crazy.

Meanwhile, at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, allied leaders served notice that they’re fed up with mollycoddling the needy American president to maintain the U.S.-led system, notably NATO, that’s prevented a third world war.

As Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney put it in his address, “We are in the midst of a rupture.” He got a standing ovation. Meanwhile, for the first time in a century, Canada’s military has reportedly created a hypothetical model of an invasion by the United States. A model friendship between two neighbor nations, broken.

On Wednesday the man all of Davos was talking about — just as Trump likes it — arrived. The U.S. president seemed to rule out using force against Greenland and Denmark (and other NATO allies) but nonetheless played the mob boss: “You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember.”

The only folks enjoying his chaos more than Trump himself are Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. Kremlin lieutenant Kirill Dmitriev reposted one of Trump’s diatribes against U.S. allies and added approvingly, “Collapse of the transatlantic union.”

Not yet, but Trump has time: 1,095 days to go. Who’s counting? The whole world.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d947259/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5500x2888+0+389/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fda%2F56%2F75b9aaf24587bf9f638ec634f895%2F2256861106.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 16:57:29.901526

Congresswoman Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) is calling on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem to provide a full and detailed accounting of the legal basis for arrests made during her agency’s expanded immigration enforcement operation in Maine. In a letter to Noem on Thursday, Pingree expressed her outrage over the operation, which DHS has disturbingly dubbed “Catch of the Day.”

“While Congress has given the Department of Homeland Security the authority to enforce federal immigration law, that authority is neither unlimited nor exempt from oversight,” Pingree wrote. “Enforcement actions that result in hundreds of individuals being abducted, serious and numerous apparent violations of due process rights, and widespread fear in immigrant communities require immediate, forthright answers.”

Pingree is demanding answers about who DHS has detained and why, where they were taken, whether their due process rights are being protected, and more pressing questions the Administration has so far not answered.

Beyond the conduct of the operation itself, Pingree said DHS’s name for the operation is “dehumanizing, offensive, and wholly inappropriate for a federal law enforcement action involving real people, families, and communities.”

“Referring to human beings as something to be caught in a net reflects a disturbing disregard for human dignity and reinforces the perception that this operation was designed to intimidate and degrade rather than to uphold the law responsibly,” Pingree said. “Such language is not humorous, and not consistent with the Department’s supposed commitment to professionalism and civil rights.

Dear Secretary Noem,

I write to express my profound outrage regarding the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation underway in my home state of Maine. The execution of this operation and the Department’s related public messaging represent a deeply troubling breakdown in accountability, transparency, and respect for the Constitution.

While Congress has given the Department of Homeland Security the authority to enforce federal immigration law, that authority is neither unlimited nor exempt from oversight. Enforcement actions that result in hundreds of individuals being abducted, serious and numerous apparent violations of due process rights, and widespread fear in immigrant communities require immediate, forthright answers.

In my capacity as a Member of Congress, I demand a full accounting of the legal basis for arrests made during this operation.

I am requesting a comprehensive report of “Operation Catch of the Day” that answers:

How many individuals were taken into custody pursuant to valid judicial warrants signed by a federal judge or magistrate;

how many were arrested without such warrants;

of those detained, how many had prior convictions for violent or otherwise dangerous crimes; and

how is the Department defining “dangerous criminal” when publicly characterizing this operation?

Alarming reports suggest that basic due process protections may have been disregarded. Please explain, in detail:

How ICE ensured that individuals were informed of their constitutional and statutory rights at the time of arrest;

how many detainees were provided timely access to legal counsel; and

how many were placed into expedited or summary removal proceedings without a meaningful opportunity to present claims for relief under U.S. law.

The Department must also account for the immigration status of those detained:

How many individuals taken into custody possessed documentation demonstrating authorization to remain in the United States, including pending asylum claims, Temporary Protected Status, lawful permanent residency, or other valid authorization?

What verification procedures were followed prior to detention, and how many lawfully present individuals were nevertheless detained, even temporarily, as a result of this operation?

Additional transparency is necessary regarding where detainees were taken following arrest.

Where are these individuals currently being held, and under what custody classifications?

Were families, legal representatives, or local officials notified prior to or following such transfers, or were individuals effectively disappeared from their communities without notice?

I am also outraged by multiple reports from Maine indicating that ICE agents engaged in brazenly intimidating and threatening behavior toward bystanders and local residents. According to local reporting, an ICE agent drove to the home of a resident who was observing and documenting an operation that morning and told her, “This is a warning. We know you live right here.” Residents also reported that agents threatened bystanders with pepper spray, creating a climate of fear and coercion. Agents’ visible presence during a school commute alarmed parents and community members, sending a clear message that ordinary citizens could be targeted simply for lawfully observing activity. You state that you are no longer allowing American citizens to be terrorized, yet that is exactly what your agents are doing: terrorizing everyday Americans for practicing their legal rights. This, yet again, suggests your operation was never intended to be a targeted enforcement activity, but rather an attempt to sow confusion, disrupt daily life, and create a pervasive atmosphere of cruelty.

Beyond the conduct of the operation itself, I am deeply disturbed by its name, “Operation Catch of the Day.” This terminology is dehumanizing, offensive, and wholly inappropriate for a federal law enforcement action involving real people, families, and communities. Referring to human beings as something to be caught in a net reflects a disturbing disregard for human dignity and reinforces the perception that this operation was designed to intimidate and degrade rather than to uphold the law responsibly. Such language is not humorous, and not consistent with the Department’s supposed commitment to professionalism and civil rights.

Finally, I am appalled that ICE appears to have prioritized a partisan media narrative over communication with the communities and officials most directly impacted by this operation. It appears Fox News received an exclusive look into the operation, as local officials, community leaders, legal service providers, and impacted families went without basic information. This approach gives the unmistakable impression that the operation was designed to generate political optics rather than to carry out careful, targeted, and lawful immigration enforcement. If the Department is prepared to publicly showcase this operation to the press, it should have no difficulty providing Congress, and therefore the affected communities, with full transparency and accountability.

Let me be clear: congressional oversight of federal law enforcement is not discretionary, and it is not subordinate to public relations strategy. I expect full and prompt cooperation. I look forward to your written response to all questions posed above within the next 48 hours, along with all relevant documentation.

Because immigrant communities often face discrimination, harassment, and violence, ACP identifies these harms as public health issues.

ACP advocates for evidence-based policies to reduce disproportionate harm to racial and ethnic communities and upholds longstanding principles: physicians’ ethical duty to care for all, society’s obligation to ensure equitable and universal access to health care, and the need for ongoing U.S. health reform to expand access.

ACP affirms health as a human right grounded in the dignity and equality of all patients and emphasizes that strengthening patient–physician relationships and building health systems that ensure equitable access can help the United States better respect, protect, and fulfill everyone’s opportunity for health.

ACP’s Ethics Manual states that medical and professional ethics should be based on the principles that include the duty to promote good and act in the best interest of the patient; respect for patient autonomy; the duty to do no harm to the patient; and a duty to protect and foster a patient’s free, uncoerced choices.

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Representative:

On behalf of our 3 million members and the 50 million students they serve, we urge you to VOTE NO on the Fiscal Year 2026 funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Votes on this issue may be included in NEA’s report card for the 119th Congress.

We strongly oppose any increase in DHS funding due to the deeply troubling violations of civil liberties by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol (USBP) agents—and the lack of accountability for behavior that has traumatized students, interrupted learning, and eroded trust in public safety. Educators are seeing the impact firsthand—in increased anxiety, absenteeism, and a mounting need for counseling and mental health support.

Recently, a federal immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis resulted in the fatal shooting of Renée Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, by an ICE agent. A few miles away, federal agents assaulted and pepper-sprayed high school students on school grounds—a clear violation of the basic premise that schools are safe places to learn.

Good was killed during a large-scale DHS action that has since drawn national scrutiny and widespread protests. But her senseless death is not an isolated incident. The ongoing deployment of federal agents throughout the country has included thousands of arrests, aggressive confrontations with civilians, and racial profiling. Schools, medical facilities, places of worship, and other community spaces have been invaded. Over the last year, ICE and USBP have taken more than 325,000 people; at least 24 of them suffered gunshot wounds, resulting in six fatalities.

This is no longer solely an immigration issue. It has become a matter of human rights, civil rights, and the safety of our communities.

We urge you to oppose any increase in DHS funding that enables the continued deployment of armed and masked federal agents by a lawless agency lacking adequate oversight and accountability. Congress must demand transparency, enforce strict limits on the use of force, and prioritize resources that protect civil liberties and public safety.",https://www.nea.org/themes/custom/locker/storybook/images/NEA-base-metaimage.png,N,,2026-01-22 17:38:00.420325

In press releases, media interviews, and in court, Trump administration officials have said repeatedly that ICE agents and their families are at risk of being doxed.","Last week, a website called ICE List went viral after its creators said that they had received what they described as a leak of personal information about nearly 4,500 Department of Homeland Security employees. However, a WIRED analysis of the site found that the database relies heavily on information that apparent DHS employees have posted publicly online themselves. This comes at a time when DHS has characterized reporting on or publicizing the identity of ICE officers as “doxing” and has threatened to prosecute perceived offenders to the fullest extent of the law.

ICE List operates as a crowdsourced wiki maintained by volunteers, who have discretion over who is added and what is marked as “verified.” Like Wikipedia, with which it has no affiliation, ICE List has category pages that feature a link to every page included in that category. Not everyone on the list is an ICE employee or even affiliated with a federal agency; former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, for example, whom DHS told the Associated Press is not an ICE agent, is included in the wiki’s “Agents” category. On his actual page, his “Agency” is listed as “N/A” and his “Role” is listed as “Propagandist; Agitator.” (Tarrio posted on X that he wished he worked for ICE, but called the ICE List page disinformation.)

Dominick Skinner, the owner of ICE List, says he does not believe that what ICE List does is doxing. ICE List doesn’t post the home addresses of identified agents, and says on its About page that “false submissions, harassment, or attempts to misuse the platform will be removed.”

“If this were doxing, then we dox ourselves by simply being present in online environments,” Skinner says, “which is just rather ridiculous.”

WIRED reviewed individuals’ pages that were included in the “Agents” category on ICE List as of January 22. Of the 1,580 pages, nearly 90 percent mention LinkedIn as a source of information, though some of the links cited now appear to be broken, and not all of the links support claims made on the wiki. (Someone listed as “active” on ICE List may, for example, have a LinkedIn depicting them as a former legal advisor for ICE. On its About page, ICE List says that “errors may occur.”) Other linked profiles lack photos and don’t appear to be very active. Some of the links, however, appear to match federal immigration agents who have previously been named in official ICE press releases and court records.

Like other LinkedIn users, those who self-identify as ICE deportation officers and other types of DHS employees are in many cases posting New Year’s resolutions, reacting to meandering motivational posts about the meaning of leadership, and letting people know they’re #opentowork.

The DHS did not respond to requests for comment.

Some individuals’ pages on the ICE List wiki cite OpenPayrolls, a searchable database of public employees’ salaries that includes some ICE employees, and SignalHire, a data broker that specializes in lead generation, as sources of information.

A spokesperson for OpenPayrolls wrote in an email that it has no affiliation with ICE List and that the ICE-related payroll records on its site were released by the US Office of Personnel Management in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The spokesperson also said, “To date, we have not received outreach from any government agency expressing concerns regarding the display of public records on our transparency website.”

SignalHire did not respond to a request for comment, but it also includes direct links to the LinkedIn profiles of people representing themselves as ICE officers on its website.

There’s no fancy trick to finding ICE officers on LinkedIn. WIRED was able to surface hundreds of profiles belonging to people who say they are ICE employees by simply clicking the “Show more results” button on the “People” tab of ICE’s LinkedIn page. LinkedIn did not respond to a request for comment.

In press releases, media interviews, and in court, Trump administration officials have said repeatedly that ICE agents and their families are at risk of being doxed. In October, a DHS press release said that ICE officers were “facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them and their families are being doxxed and threatened online.”

Last week, DHS secretary Kristi Noem admonished a CBS News journalist interviewing her for saying the name of Jonathan Ross, a deportation officer in ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division who shot and killed Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good. Federal officials aided the identification of Ross, apparently inadvertently, by telling news outlets that the officer, who hadn’t yet been identified, had been previously dragged by a car during an immigrant enforcement operation in June. (“DHS will never confirm or deny attempts to dox our law enforcement officers,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told WIRED earlier in January in response to questions about Ross. “Doxing our officers put their lives and their families in serious danger.”)

As part of their duties, ICE deportation officers are expected to support prosecutions or administrative actions by helping prepare investigative reports. Like other deportation officers, Ross has given court testimony and submitted declarations to support court cases, including the one linked to the incident during which he was dragged. Court filings that detail his appearances in court and his written declarations are a matter of public record.

Agents also have their own responsibilities when it comes to maintaining their online presence. Independent journalist Ken Klippenstein has reported on US Border Patrol–branded documents that instruct employees, “Be mindful of what you post on social media.” CBP did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment.

The federal government has used federal agents’ purported fear of doxing as an argument for why they should be allowed to wear masks and other facial coverings, a practice the state of Minnesota has sought to suspend in its lawsuit against Noem in her capacity as secretary of DHS.

In a declaration filed in the Minnesota lawsuit, Kyle Harvick, a CBP official who oversees Border Patrol operations for El Centro Station in California, said that “the rise of doxing, the advancement of facial recognition technologies, and the proliferation of bad actors on social media has created an unprecedented operational risk for federal law enforcement officers that necessitates appropriate protective steps such as wearing masks in public to protect their identities.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/696fa182d1a0acbc27fdeb0e/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/012025-ice-dox-ice.jpg",N,,2026-01-22 16:40:15.169825

Many of the building’s residents were rounded up and detained, regardless of citizenship status, as their homes were ransacked by members of the U.S. Border Patrol, the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies.

The Illinois Department of Human Rights announced Wednesday it would launch a new investigation of the building’s landlords. The state alleges the raid in the city’s South Shore neighborhood came after the building’s owner and management tipped off federal authorities, claiming the 130-unit apartment building was becoming overrun by members of Tren de Aragua — a violent Venezuelan gang.

Shortly after the arrests, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said two confirmed gang members were arrested. But according to reporting by ProPublica and others, no one arrested during the raid was ever charged with a crime. Federal officials have not provided evidence that any Venezuelans arrested were members of Tren de Aragua.

The complaint alleges that the building’s owner, a Wisconsin-based firm, according to state records, “sought to intimidate and coerce the building’s Black and Hispanic tenants into leaving their apartment units based on stereotypes about Venezuelan immigrants” in violation of state law prohibiting discrimination and intimidation against tenants based on their race, ancestry and national origin.

IDHR said violations also occurred when the landlords refused to carry out maintenance.

“7500 S. Shore building management blamed Venezuelan tenants for their own failure to provide needed locks and security service, as well as other needed maintenance and repairs, and perpetuated stereotypes about Venezuelan gang members to send a message that tenants born outside the United States were considered gang associates, even if they were law abiding,” IDHR’s complaint states.

The complaint adds building management began clearing units within hours of the raid that left many people’s doors off the hinges and their belongings destroyed. Residents who remained at the apartment building were forced to move out in December after the building was deemed unsafe by a Cook County judge, according to Block Club Chicago.

“These allegations of housing discrimination raise serious concerns for people struggling to maintain housing – and the communities that have been profiled and relentlessly targeted by the federal government during its violent immigration enforcement operations,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement.

The owners could be subject to civil penalties if found in violation of the Illinois Human Rights Act.

Details of the raid

The raid was part of Operation Midway Blitz, the federal immigration enforcement campaign that began in the Chicago area in early September and lasted through mid-November.

The raid was the subject of a video produced by DHS and set to dramatic music that shows federal agents led by Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino searching through apartments and detaining residents in vans. Homeland Security’s social media caption read: “To every criminal illegal alien: Darkness is no longer your ally. We will find you.”

Thirty-seven immigrants were arrested and several were eventually deported, according to ProPublica, while U.S. citizens were also detained with zip ties for several hours during the raid.

In raw video footage released by NewsNation, Bovino said U.S. citizens living at the apartment were temporarily detained because it was a “high-risk operation” and “no rights have been violated today.”

Several residents said in interviews with ProPublica that agents hit them in the head with guns, pushed them up against the wall, and threw flash-bangs into their units. Others said their children were taken outside with few clothes on.

The state additionally alleges that people were separated based on their race, ancestry and national origin, and children were among those detained with zip ties. Federal agents also did not honor any requests to see warrants or speak to attorneys.

Apartment issues

The apartment had issues before the feds arrived, however. The building failed 18 of 21 inspections over the last two years and the city sued its owners in 2024 for failing to maintain the building, according to ProPublica.

ProPublica also reported several tenants described positive relationships with Venezuelans who lived there, many of whom arrived in Chicago in 2022 during an influx of migrants to Texas’ southern border who were sent to Chicago via bus.

But other residents describe issues with guns, parties, drugs and prostitution by both citizens and immigrants. Conditions in the building were also generally abhorrent with water leaks, trash piling up, bug and rodent infestations and damaged walls, according to ProPublica.

The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act would establish clear standards on the use of force by federal immigration enforcement, limit the use of face coverings and specific crowd control equipment, and require the use of body and vehicle cameras during enforcement activities.","Washington, D.C.—Today, Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49) released the following statement on his vote against the Fiscal Year 2026 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill due to the exclusion of guardrails on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from the legislation:

“Congress cannot continue writing blank checks to any federal agency that fails to meet basic standards of accountability, transparency, and respect for constitutional rights.

“I want to be clear at the outset: the vast majority of law enforcement officers, including our local police and sheriffs, serve their communities with professionalism and integrity. They earn public trust every day by following clear rules, respecting due process, and accepting oversight.

“Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for ICE under the direction of DHS Secretary Noem. Multiple documented incidents have raised serious concerns about ICE’s conduct. We have seen repeated cases involving excessive force, mistaken detentions, and enforcement actions affecting U.S. citizens and lawful residents. At the same time, ICE continues to operate with fewer safeguards than most major law-enforcement agencies.

“In response, we have proposed straightforward, commonsense accountability measures: requiring judicial warrants for home entries, setting clear limits on use of force, mandating body-worn cameras, and explicitly prohibiting the detention or deportation of U.S. citizens. These are standard professional practices across law enforcement and are rooted in the Constitution.

“Every one of these protections was rejected by Republican leadership.

“ICE was created after September 11 to strengthen national security and public safety. That mission depends on public trust and strict adherence to the law. When an agency operates without adequate guardrails or oversight, it undermines both.

“DHS is responsible for other critical functions that I fully support, including disaster response, port and border security, and cybersecurity. But Congress also has a duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used to excuse misconduct or evade accountability.

“My position is simple: federal agencies must follow the law and operate transparently. Until meaningful safeguards are in place, I will not support funding that enables ICE to operate without proper oversight.

“Congress must insist on reforms that restore professionalism, accountability, and public confidence. This legislation does not do that, and that is why I oppose it.”

Background About Rep. Levin’s Actions on Immigration

Since entering Congress in 2019, Rep. Levin has taken action to reform our nation’s immigration system, protect communities, and strengthen border security. His actions include signing four amicus briefs regarding birthright citizenship and data sharing for immigration enforcement to push back against the Trump Administration; conducting oversight visits to ICE detention facilities; and championing bills that would tackle our nation’s immigration and border challenges. Those bills include:

The Dignity Act is a comprehensive bipartisan immigration package that would expand enforcement at the border in exchange for increased pathways to legal status and substantive changes to our nation’s immigration system.

The American Dream and Promise Act would provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders, and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) recipients. It would establish a permanent resident status for Dreamers for 10 years and grant individuals with TPS or DED a full lawful permanent resident status.

The American Families United Act would provide the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security the power to prevent the deportation of certain individuals if such a deportation would result in hardship for that individual’s American citizen spouse, parent, or child.

The Farm Workforce Modernization Act would improve the H-2A visa program, establish a new Certified Agricultural Worker (CAW) status, and provide support for farmers and farmworkers.

The National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants (NO BAN) Act would strengthen the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to prohibit discrimination on the basis of religion and limits the broad executive authority to issue future travel bans.

The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act would make comprehensive reforms to our nation's immigration detention system by ending the use of private, for-profit detention facilities, prohibiting the practice of detaining families, repealing mandatory detention, and increasing oversight, accountability, and transparency of the immigration detention system.

The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act would establish clear standards on the use of force by federal immigration enforcement, limit the use of face coverings and specific crowd control equipment, and require the use of body and vehicle cameras during enforcement activities.

Trump’s persistent desire to acquire Greenland raises the question of how international law treats the acquisition of another State’s territory, whether by force or by other means.
Finally, U.S. threats to acquire Greenland by conquest already constitute a violation of international law.
Cession: When it is Permissible Under International Law While international law prohibits the acquisition of territory through force, it does not prohibit territorial change altogether.
This is so under both domestic Danish law and international law.","In early 2026, President Donald Trump renewed a goal he had set in his first term, acquiring Greenland, a territory over which Denmark exercises sovereignty. Trump escalated the situation by threatening to use force to do so, warning that he was “going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not,” and that while he “would like to make a deal the easy way, … if we don’t do it the easy way we’re going to do it the hard way.” He later told reporters aboard Air Force One, “one way or the other, we’re going to have Greenland.” The president’s threats have also taken the form of Truth Social posts showing him planting the U.S. flag on Greenland and chairing a meeting with European leaders, with a map in the background showing Canada and Greenland covered in an American flag. Taking a less bellicose stance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has informed members of Congress that the United States is trying to buy Greenland, although he, too, has at times left the door open to using force.

As we’ll explain below, the acquisition of territory by the threat or use of force is not only prohibited under international law binding on the United States, but that rule forms the backbone of the entire international system and constitutes the major achievement of the post-WWII era. While sometimes violated, to be sure, naked threats to acquire territory by threat or use of force without even purporting to justify that action under international law (say, as an act of self-defense) are rightfully seen as belonging to a bygone era that was less secure and less prosperous than one in which sovereignty and stability are valued over sheer military might – and perhaps most important, in which self-determination is recognized as a foundational right, while imperial conquest is outlawed.

Danish Prime Minister Frederiksen has responded to the threats by unambiguously stating, “Greenland is not for sale. Greenland is not Danish. Greenland belongs to Greenland.” Other leaders have echoed her stance. For instance, seven European heads of State issued a joint statement on Greenland that noted “Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.” They emphasized that all NATO Allies were obligated to “uphold the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.” European Union leaders likewise pointed to “territorial integrity and sovereignty,” confirming the “EU stands in full sovereignty with Denmark and the people of Greenland.” In the hope of deterring a U.S. attack, a number of European States also deployed small troop contingents to Greenland as a military “trip wire” (although framed as an “exercise” to avoid unduly escalating the situation), one that would presumably draw those countries into any conflict between Denmark and the United States.

Whether because the world rallied around the bedrock principles of international law in response to Trump’s threats or for other reasons, on Jan. 21 at Davos, the president shifted towards appearing to rule out the use of force – “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force” – while still insisting that the United States must acquire the territory, stating:

We want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won’t give it. We’ve never asked for anything else … So, they have a choice. You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember.

Following a subsequent meeting with NATO Secretary General Rutte, Trump announced on Truth Social that they “formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,” one that, “if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations.”

At this point, it is unclear whether Trump is willing to shelve his desire to acquire Greenland, including the use of force to achieve that objective, if he finds the European response unsatisfactory. The track record thus far demonstrates that his hunger for Greenland is something he has difficulty shaking. Moreover, as Trump’s positions frequently vacillate, little is certain at this point. The risk of cleaving the transatlantic alliance, which has benefitted the Western world (and globally, all who value global goods like open shipping lanes) for over 75 years, remains real.

Trump’s persistent desire to acquire Greenland raises the question of how international law treats the acquisition of another State’s territory, whether by force or by other means. There are two general methods. The first is “conquest,” which the Permanent Court of International Justice defined in 1933 as “a cause of loss of sovereignty when there is war between two States and by reason of the defeat of one of them sovereignty over territory passes from the loser to the victorious State” (Eastern Greenland case, page 47). Note that war, or “international armed conflict” as it is labeled today, can be triggered even by an unopposed occupation of the territory of one State by another (Common Article 2, Geneva Conventions I-IV), as could be the case if U.S. troops seized a remote area of Greenland. The second is “cession,” which denotes the consensual transfer of territory from one State to another. Historical U.S. examples include the purchase of Louisiana from France in 1803 or Alaska from Russia in 1867.

In this essay, we examine these modalities of territorial acquisition in general and with respect to Greenland. Before doing so, however, it is essential to emphasize that Denmark unquestionably exercises sovereignty over Greenland. As one of us (Mike) explained in a previous Just Security article, Greenland

enjoys broad autonomy under Denmark’s 2009 Self-Governing Act, especially in internal affairs. However, that autonomy is an issue of domestic law. Under international law, Denmark undeniably enjoys sovereignty over Greenland. In 1933, the Permanent Court of Justice, in a dispute between Norway and Denmark, found that Greenland was a Danish possession (Legal Status of Eastern Greenland). Subsequently, Denmark listed Greenland as a non-self-governing territory under Chapter XI of the UN Charter. In 1953, Greenland was incorporated into Denmark through domestic legislation, a status recognized by the General Assembly the following year (GA Res. 849). The United States has long acknowledged Danish sovereignty over Greenland (see, e.g., the 1916 Secretary of State declaration, the 1951 Defense of Greenland Agreement, and the 2004 Amendment to the Defense of Greenland Agreement).

Therefore, military action into Greenland would be a use of force against Denmark, which would destroy the NATO alliance from within. Cessation would also be a matter to be negotiated at the inter-State level between Denmark and the United States, although, as will be explained, the people of Greenland would have a say in any such negotiations.

Conquest and its Prohibition

Although international law historically recognized that title to territory could be transferred through conquest, as we referenced above, that premise was put to rest in the 20th century (see here). Most notably, Article 2(4) of the UN Charter addresses the issue head-on:

“All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations” (emphasis added).

It is a prohibition that undeniably reflects customary international law (Paramilitary Activities, ¶ 190).

A U.S. military operation, even if unopposed, to seize Greenland would qualify as a violation on both grounds. First, the mere presence of U.S. troops (or even operations into Greenland from outside the territory, such as missile strikes) would amount to a violation of Danish territoriality. Second, the annexation of Greenland as a result of a U.S. use of force (or any alteration in the territory’s governance) would violate 2(4) on the basis that the force was directed at Denmark’s political independence.

During the decolonization that followed the immediate post-WWII period, the international community reaffirmed this prohibition in several forms. In 1970, the General Assembly, in its Declaration on Friendly Relations (adopted by consensus), famously confirmed the prohibition: “The territory of a State shall not be the object of acquisition by another State resulting from the threat or use of force” (GA Res. 2625(XXV)). Along the same lines, the 1974 Definition of Aggression Resolution states that “no territorial acquisition or special advantage resulting from aggression is or shall be recognized as lawful” (art. 5(3)). And in its 1986 Frontier Dispute judgment, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) emphasized that even where States have effective control over territory, they do not acquire title if that control was secured through unlawful means (¶ 63).

Since any forcible action against Greenland would trigger an international armed conflict between the United States and Greenland, the prohibition on the permanent transfer of territory during occupation under the law of armed conflict is also relevant. Specifically, Article 47 of Geneva Convention IV provides that the rights of protected persons in occupied territory are inviolable. It is a fundamental LOAC rule that occupation of territory is temporary and is not permitted to morph into annexation. Another way of stating this prohibition is that the rights of protected persons in occupied territory would be violated if title to that territory changed hands. The ICRC’s Commentary to Article 47 explains,

The law of occupation is predicated on the temporary and provisional nature of occupation; it thus follows that the Occupying Power does not acquire sovereign rights over the occupied territory.

Although international humanitarian law does not expressly prohibit the forcible acquisition of territory, any such annexation during an ongoing occupation would inescapably lead to violations of that law. For example, the annexed territory would, by definition, be subject to the legislation of the annexing State, which would exceed the limited scope of the Occupying Power’s legislative competences in the occupied territory. More broadly, unilateral annexation would entail the exercise of sovereignty over the occupied territory and purport to create a permanent situation that would eliminate the status quo ante. In the ICRC’s view, both of those consequences are inconsistent with the law of occupation’s underlying principles, namely that the Occupying Power does not acquire any sovereignty over the occupied territory and that it must maintain the status quo ante.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual makes the same point: “Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the GC by any change introduced…by any annexation…of the whole or part of the occupied territory” (§ 11.6.3).

The prohibition on acquiring territory through conquest is likewise supported in case law. Perhaps most notably, in United States v. Ulrich Griefelt et al. (the RuSHA case), the U.S. Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held that

Any purported annexation of territories of a foreign nation, occurring during the time of war and while opposing armies were still in the field, we hold to be invalid and ineffective. Such territory never became a part of the Reich but merely remained under German military control by virtue of belligerent occupancy.

Treaties to which the United States is not Party, but that represent further testament to the extent to which international law condemns the acquisition of territory by conquest, are in accord. The 1977 Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions expressly provides that “occupation of a territory… shall [not] affect the legal status of the territory in question” (art. 4). Moreover, under international criminal law, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court criminalizes “annexation by the use of force of the territory of another State or part thereof” (art. 8bis(2)(a)).

The Duty of Non-Recognition of Annexed Territory

Importantly, even if the United States seized Greenland and annexed it, other States would be prohibited from treating the territory as if it were the United States. As noted in the Declaration on Friendly Relations, “No territorial acquisition resulting from the threat or use of force shall be recognized as legal.” In its Wall advisory opinion, the ICJ recognized this statement as reflecting customary international law (¶ 87, implemented at ¶ 159).

In Paramilitary Activities, the ICJ noted that the United States has long recognized the principle of non-recognition of territory unlawfully seized. In doing so, it pointed to the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States (¶ 189). Article 11 provides,

The contracting states definitely establish as the rule of their conduct the precise obligation not to recognize territorial acquisitions or special advantages which have been obtained by force whether this consists in the employment of arms, in threatening diplomatic representations, or in any other effective coercive measure. The territory of a state is inviolable and may not be the object of military occupation nor of other measures of force imposed by another state directly or indirectly or for any motive whatever even temporarily.

As the United States is Party to the Montevideo Convention, other Parties (States in Central and South America) would be prohibited by the terms of the treaty from recognizing the unlawful U.S. acquisition of Greenland. More significantly, as noted by the ICJ, Article 11 reflects the customary law principle of non-recognition, which would bind all States from recognizing the U.S. action.

UN organs, with the support of the United States, have likewise emphasized the obligation not to recognize unlawful seizure of territory. For instance, in 1990, following Iraq’s annexation of occupied Kuwait, the Security Council “call[ed] upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize that annexation and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as an indirect recognition of the annexation” (SC Res. 662). Following Russia’s unlawful annexation of Crimea in 2014 following its occupation and a sham referendum, the General Assembly did the same, “Calling upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol on the basis of the above-mentioned referendum and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status” (GA Res. 68/262).

What about Self-Defense?

Might the seizure of Greenland be justified on U.S. security grounds? After all, administration officials have suggested that taking control of Greenland is necessary in the face of threats by Russia and China in the Arctic (we must note here that working within NATO to address any security concerns would be a lawful, legitimate, and likely effective course). While self-defense is a “circumstance precluding the wrongfulness” of a use of force under Article 51 of the UN Charter (Articles on State Responsibility, art. 21), forcible defensive actions may only be directed at a State that has engaged in an “armed attack” against the State taking them. Accordingly, even if U.S. security were threatened by Russia or China moving into the Arctic, that fact would not, in itself, legally justify any action against Denmark.

It should not be lost in the current discussion that Russian President Vladimir Putin attempted to employ pretextual self-defense claims in his war of attempted conquest against Ukraine. That attempt remains ongoing but has been resoundingly and repeatedly rejected by the United States, the United Nations General Assembly (but not the Security Council due to Russia’s veto), the European Union, notable international law associations, and scholars. Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea (undertaken largely without firing shots in 2014) and parts of Ukraine’s Donbas region are not recognized by the majority of States, owing to their obligation not to do so as described above.

Solely for the sake of discussion, let us assume that a State had a valid self-defense claim, was involved in an international armed conflict as a result of an armed attack against it, and attempted to lay claim to territory it seized during that conflict. This raises the question of whether a State legitimately acting in self-defense may acquire territory. In this regard, the International Law Commission (ILC) has concluded, correctly in our view, that “States may not recognize as lawful, for example, a unilateral acquisition of territory procured by the use of force, even if the use of force was arguably lawful” (Third Report on State Responsibility, page 107). This conclusion also bears on the earlier point regarding other States’ recognition of territory acquired through conquest.

Finally, U.S. threats to acquire Greenland by conquest already constitute a violation of international law. As we explained in an earlier Just Security article, “Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary law prohibit States from even threatening to use force unlawfully if the threats are communicated to the threatened State, coercive, and capable of being carried out.” Administration officials have repeatedly indicated a willingness to resort to force if Denmark does not cede Greenland to the United States (though they have see-sawed on these threats in recent days, it is difficult to discount them once issued so repeatedly and forcefully by a sitting head of State); the coercive nature of the threats is evidenced by the alarm they have caused in Europe, Canada, and beyond; and the U.S. military has recently demonstrated its substantial capacity to employ significant force abroad. Perhaps most notably, the U.S. willingness to attack Venezuela in clear violation of international law renders the threats against Greenland much more credible than they would otherwise be.

Cession: When it is Permissible Under International Law

While international law prohibits the acquisition of territory through force, it does not prohibit territorial change altogether. Instead, a sovereign may transfer parts of its territory by cession, usually through a treaty or other international agreement. When that happens, the transferring State relinquishes title, and the acquiring State assumes sovereignty. The practice is quite rare in the contemporary (post-WWII) era and is generally limited to minor border adjustments or resolving longstanding ambiguities in inherited post-colonial borders. Such exchanges typically result in compensation or form part of a broader political agreement.

Contemporary international law subjects such transfers to two conditions. First, the State making the transfer must give its consent freely; it cannot be coerced. Second, the transfer must be consistent with the right of self-determination under international human rights law.

Lack of coercion: Since any transfer would likely be concluded by treaty, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties establishes the framework for determining the validity of consent to transfer. Article 52 of the instrument provides, “A treaty is void if its conclusion has been procured by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations.”

That is precisely what has happened in the case of U.S. demands for Greenland. It is almost unimaginable that the threat of U.S. military action would not have significantly influenced any agreement by Denmark to transfer Greenland, or portions of the territory, to the United States. Although the United States is not a Party to the Vienna Convention, Article 52 is well recognized as reflecting customary law (Fisheries Jurisdiction, ¶ 24).

Self-determination: The second condition is that a transfer be consistent with the principle of self-determination. Article 1(2) of the UN Charter recognizes the principle, which also plays a prominent role in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). They provide, in identical Articles 1(1), “All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.” The United States is Party to the ICCPR (but not the ICESCR).

The ICJ has applied the principle of self-determination in the context of territory on multiple occasions. In its Western Sahara advisory opinion, the Court “confirm[ed] and emphasize[d] that the application of the right of self-determination requires a free and genuine expression of the will of the peoples concerned” (¶ 54). Similarly, in its East Timor judgment, the Court labeled the assertion that the right is of erga omnes character (owed to all States) as “irreproachable,” and called self-determination “one of the essential principles of contemporary international law” (¶ 29).

Denial of a right to participate in the decision to transfer territory is a paradigmatic example of a violation of the right to self-determination. It is a right that applies to “peoples.” That term is not well-defined in international law. However, as a general matter, it refers to a significantly large group of individuals who share common characteristics such as history, language, ethnicity, or religion; have a connection to the territory concerned; and consider themselves a distinct community.

Despite the imprecision of the term “peoples,” it is clear that it applies to Greenland’s inhabitants. Indeed, the 2009 Act on Greenland Self-Government expressly recognizes that “the people of Greenland is a people pursuant to international law with the right of self-determination” (pmbl). Importantly, this is a legally binding acknowledgment that the people of Greenland have a right to participate in determining their political status. Moreover, the act provides, “Decisions regarding Greenland’s independence shall be taken by the people of Greenland ((art. 21(1)). If they enjoy a legal right under Danish law to decide on independence, they surely enjoy no lesser right vis-à-vis the transfer of sovereignty.

Moreover, as noted, Greenland was formerly a non-self-governing territory and has been moving towards independence. As such, it is subject to the decolonization principles outlined in the 1960 UN General Assembly Resolution 1541(XV). Those principles emphasize the “freely expressed wishes” of a territory’s people concerning the status of the territory upon which they reside. In its Chagos advisory opinion, the ICJ observed that although the resolution was formally a recommendation, “it has a declaratory character with regard to the right to self-determination as a customary norm” (¶ 152). That means under international law, the principle of self-determination prohibits the transfer of sovereignty over a territory inhabited by a “people” without their consent.

Finally, the Declaration on Friendly Relations repeatedly highlights the right of self-determination. It provides,

By virtue of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, all peoples have the right freely to determine, without external interference, their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development, and every State has the duty to respect this right in accordance with the provisions of the Charter.

The establishment of a sovereign and independent State, the free association or integration with an independent State or the emergence into any other political status freely determined by a people constitute modes of implementing the right of self-determination by that people.

The Declaration then ties together the right of self-determination and the use of force: “Every State has the duty to refrain from any forcible action which deprives peoples referred to in the elaboration of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of their right to self-determination and freedom and independence.” The principle would apply equally to the threat of the use of force that might, in turn, lead to non-consensual cession.

As discussed above with respect to territory secured by force, other States would be barred from recognizing the transfer of Greenland through cession, given that it was secured by coercion and failed to respect the right of the Greenlandic people to self-determination. The ILC has acknowledged as much in Article 41(2) of its Articles on State Responsibility: “No State shall recognize as lawful a situation created by a serious breach within the meaning of article 40, nor render aid or assistance in maintaining that situation.”

As a consequence of the above, any transfer of Greenland to the United States would require the freely given consent of both Denmark and Greenland. This is so under both domestic Danish law and international law. That consent is unlikely.

Finally, if Denmark were to cede Greenland to the United States in violation of the right of self-determination of the Greenlandic people, under principles of the law of State responsibility, the United States arguably would also shoulder responsibility for that “internationally wrongful act.” Article 18 of the Articles on State Responsibility, which in significant part reflects customary international law binding on the United States, provides that “a State which coerces another State to commit an act is internationally responsible for that act if: (a) the act would, but for the coercion, be an internationally wrongful act of the coerced state; and (b) the coercing State does so with the knowledge of the circumstances of the act.” Threats of the use of force clearly qualify as coercive (“conduct which forces the will of the coerced State”) according to the Article’s commentary. Moreover, as the right of self- determination is customary, all States shoulder the obligation. And, of course, the United States is aware of the circumstances, for it is their author.

Concluding Thoughts

It is indisputable that, under current circumstances, any acquisition of Greenland by the United States–whether by force or through coerced agreement–would directly violate fundamental principles of international law, including the prohibition on the threat or use of force, the principle of non-recognition of territorial acquisition by such means, the invalidity of agreements secured through coercion, and the right of the people of Greenland to self-determination. These are insurmountable legal barriers to the legitimacy of such an action. Accordingly, consistent with long-standing legal norms, any U.S. effort to claim sovereignty over Greenland, or parts of the territory, must continue to be met with international non-recognition and political condemnation.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257168580.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 17:38:25.407366

The lockouts were lifted after it was determined that the activity did not affect the schools, according to NBC affiliate WCSH of Portland.
DHS did not say how long the ongoing operation across the state of Maine would last.","A new immigration enforcement operation is underway in Maine, the Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin did not say how many arrests were made during the first day of the Maine operation, dubbed “Catch of the Day.” In a statement Wednesday, she only said DHS “arrested illegal aliens convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child.”

On Tuesday, as residents in the cities of Portland and Lewiston noticed a heightened presence of immigration officers in their communities, they began posting videos on social media and calling a community hotline to report the sightings and some arrests.

The hotline, managed by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, received significantly more calls than usual on Tuesday, Ruben Torres, the organization’s advocacy and policy manager, told NBC News.

On Tuesday evening, the advocacy group said they were only able to verify two of the reports because they didn’t have enough volunteers who could quickly verify all the reports from the hotline.

The two verified incidents “seemed to be very targeted,” Torres said. In one, officers appeared to be serving a warrant to someone at a house, and in the other officers arrested one individual outside a Home Depot.

Reports of immigration enforcement activity around Portland on Tuesday morning led to a brief lockout at two high schools in the area, with the school not allowing anyone to come into the buildings. The lockouts were lifted after it was determined that the activity did not affect the schools, according to NBC affiliate WCSH of Portland.

“It really is a very stressful moment in time,” Torres said. “We have people who are unsure if it’s safe to go out in public because they may get picked up.”

This has resulted in a rise in residents volunteering to do grocery runs and drive children with immigrant parents to school, according to Torres. He added that many families who have relatives with different types of immigration status are also having difficult conversations about who would care for their children if their parents get picked up by ICE.

“Those aren’t fun conversations to be having, especially with one’s children,” Torres said. “They’re laying down the emergency planning at home.”

Immigrants make up about 4% of Maine’s population (compared to 14% nationally) and nearly half of them have been in the U.S. for over 20 years, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute. Almost half of Maine’s immigrants are from Asia and Europe, 20% from Africa, 19% from Northern America — mainly Canada — and about 10% from Latin America and the Caribbean.

DHS did not say how long the ongoing operation across the state of Maine would last. They stated they’re “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.”

Patricia Hyde, deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Fox News in an exclusive interview that they planned on targeting about 1,400 individuals in Maine.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills made statements last week anticipating the incoming ICE activity.

Mills said she directed the Maine State Police “to work closely with local law enforcement, as necessary, to provide whatever support is needed in advance of and during any potential federal operations.”

“I want any federal agents — and the president of the United States — to know what this state stands for. We stand for the rule of law. We oppose violence. We stand for peaceful protest,” the governor said. “We stand for compassion, for integrity and justice.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251211-ice-badge-gk-49c6c7.jpg",N,,2026-01-22 15:37:44.086919

It was unclear if the agents had arrested anyone.

A woman who gave her name only as Olivia said she lives nearby, and responded when she heard that ICE agents were in the area.

""Came out, walked around, found them. There are a lot of other folks out here with whistles and bull horns trying to alert folks,"" she said.

Olivia said she witnessed an immigration arrest earlier that day just up the block.

""I just feel like it's insane that this is allowed to be happening,"" she said.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed Wednesday it is undertaking an enforcement operation in Maine, dubbed ""Catch of the Day,"" saying it was focused on the ""worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""

The agency cited four examples of arrests, including one person convicted of an OUI.

An agency spokesperson did not immediately answer questions about how many people had been arrested, but Fox News reported Tuesday that officials said nearly 50 people had been detained so far.

Cassandra Linton, who runs a company that supports adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities, said one of the people arrested on the first day of the surge was one of her employees.

""One of our house managers had stepped out to go grab something to eat. He was on the phone with his friend when he was detained by ICE,"" she said.

Linton said the man, originally from Burundi, has a pending asylum claim and was working at her company's Saco location. According to ICE's online detainee locator system, he's currently being held at an ICE facility in Massachusetts.

Linton said the vast majority of her direct support professional employees are immigrants, who go through multiple rounds of screening.

""It's just a huge mess of fear for people who are here legally,"" Linton said. Her employee who was detained, she said ""is legal. We've done all the checks. He is not a criminal, and he's just gone.""

Now, Linton said, she's also concerned about what would happen to her clients, some of whom are nonverbal, should their caregiver be arrested while they're out in public.

Another arrest was an Angolan man living in Portland taken into custody Tuesday during a routine ICE check-in in Scarborough, according to court records. Those filings say the man's family is not sure where he is, but believes he's still being held in Scarborough, and a federal judge has ordered ICE not to transfer him out of state.

The enforcement surge has elicited mixed reactions from Maine's elected leaders at the state and federal level, including from state Senate President Mattie Daughtry, a Democrat, who said the name of the operation itself is reason for concern.

""Language that compares people to fish to be caught and hauled in is dehumanizing and dangerous,"" Daughtry said in a statement, adding that ""The rhetoric being used feels less like law enforcement and more like people are being hunted for sport.""

Local officials in the cities experiencing what appears to be the brunt of ICE activity, including Portland, Lewiston, and Westbrook, were unified in their condemnation, with some of the harshest words coming from Portland city councilor Wes Pelletier.

""I want to be really clear, this is a war of terror that's being waged on our city by the federal government,"" Pelletier said. Speaking alongside fellow councilors at a press conference on Wednesday, he rejected the need for increased ICE activity in the first place.

""No one asked the federal government to come here,"" Pelletier said. ""This is one of the safest cities in the country.""

And as some immigrant advocacy groups warned families to stay home and Portland school officials report a drop in attendance districtwide, Pelletier said some locals are forming networks to deliver food and other necessities to those sheltering in place.

While the duration and intensity of the crackdown remain to be seen, ICE deputy assistant director Patricia Hyde told Fox News earlier this week her agency has a target list of 1,400 people in Maine. That would represent about 10% of all immigrants without permanent legal status in the state, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fd214da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3024+0+408/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2Ff4%2F5631b7d14c8d944db215c571f291%2F01212026-icefieldoffice-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 17:38:13.004635

A five-year-old boy, wearing a blue tuque with droopy ears, carrying a Spider-Man backpack, was reportedly apprehended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in his Columbia Heights driveway on Tuesday.

Liam Ramos was essentially used ""as bait,"" said Columbia Heights Public Schools (CHPS) Superintendent Zena Stenvik in a statement Wednesday.

""Another adult living in the home was outside and begged the agents to let them take care of the small child, but was refused,"" Stenvik said.

""Instead, the agent took the child out of the still-running vehicle, led him to the door, and directed him to knock on the door, asking to be let in, in order to see if anyone else was home — essentially using a five-year-old as bait.""

Liam and his father are being held at the Dilley Immigration Processing Centre in Dilley, Texas, the family’s lawyer Marc Prokosch told CBC News Thursday.

Columbia Heights is a suburb of Minneapolis, where a massive immigration crackdown has seen thousands of officers sent into the Twin Cities. It's become a powder keg of protests and aggression ever since an ICE shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, a mother of three.

Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBC News in a written statement that ICE didn't target Liam Ramos, but was conducting a ""targeted operation"" to arrest his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who she described as an ""illegal alien from Ecuador.""

“ICE did NOT target a child,"" McLaughlin said.

""As agents approached the driver Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot — abandoning his child. For the child's safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias.""

She added that parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, ""or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates.""

The statement did not say what happened to Liam after the arrest or where he is now. The Department of Homeland Security has yet to respond to CBC's requests for that information.

'Why detain a 5-year-old?'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz criticized Liam's reported detainment, writing on X Thursday that ""this campaign of retribution has got to stop.""

Minnesotans want safety. They want freedom. They want what’s best for our kids. Masked agents snatching preschoolers off the street and sending them to Texas detention centers serves none of those purposes,"" he wrote.

The photos of Liam, which were provided to CBC News by Columbia Heights Public Schools, were taken by ""known and confirmed community members who were on site,"" school officials said.

Twenty minutes after Liam and his father were taken, an older son in middle school arrived home ""to a missing dad, a missing little brother and a terrified mother,"" said Stenvik .

""Why detain a five-year-old? You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal,"" she said.

In her statement, Stenvik said the family ""is following U.S. legal parameters"" and has an active asylum case with no order of deportation.

""I have viewed the legal paperwork with my own eyes,"" she said.

According to the school district officials, three other children have also recently been detained by ICE.

On Tuesday, a 17-year-old high school student was taken by armed and masked agents while on their way to school, with no parents present, Stenvik said. Two weeks ago, a 10-year-old and her mother were arrested on their way to school, she added.

""By the end of the school day, they were already in a detention centre in Texas, and they are still there,"" Stenvik said.

She also said that last week, another 17-year-old high school student in the district was detained.

Chad Newton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Wayne County Airport Authority, said in his report to the board during the meeting that he is often asked if the airport authority has any contracts with ICE.
Airlines conducting ICE flights out of Willow Run include Colorado-based Key Lime Air, as well as Eastern Air Express.
Photos shared with Michigan Advance by the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, showed people with shackled wrists boarding a plane at Willow Run.
A report by Human Rights First said there were 88 outbound ICE flights from Willow Run in 2025.","Activists called on airport officials to halt the flights by ICE out of Willow Run Airport near Ypsilanti during the public comment period of the Wayne County Airport Authority board meeting on Wednesday.

According to the ICE Flight Monitor, a project by the organization Human Rights First, ICE used Willow Run as a stop for flights, usually to major immigration detention hubs in the South, regularly throughout the second half of 2025.

Steve Conn, an activist with the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, called the airport “a key link in the chain, down to Texas or Louisiana overnight” during the public board meeting.

Chad Newton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Wayne County Airport Authority, said in his report to the board during the meeting that he is often asked if the airport authority has any contracts with ICE.

“Our response remains, the Wayne County Airport Authority does not have any involvement in the agreements between airlines and their partners, including federal agencies, as long as those agreements meet legal and safety requirements,” he said.

But many present did not find Newton’s argument about the authority’s lack of responsibility convincing, arguing that no activity takes place at an airport without approval and urging those in attendance to use their power to stop such activity and make it more difficult for it to continue.

George Washington, a lawyer in the Detroit area, similarly said that, while the board may not have made the decision to initially permit ICE to use the airport, they should be acting on it now.

“We know that this board did not set up that system that was set up by the Trump administration, but we know also that by allowing Willow Run to do this, you’re collaborating with this system,” he said. “You’re collaborating because you said nothing about it, because even till this day, you will not condemn it. You will simply say it’s not our problem.”

Colorado airline operates flights for ICE, records show

Washington also criticized the board for not mentioning the usage of the airport by ICE during the main portion of the meeting, a significant portion of which focused on upgrades to restrooms in the McNamara terminal.

Airlines conducting ICE flights out of Willow Run include Colorado-based Key Lime Air, as well as Eastern Air Express. Photos shared with Michigan Advance by the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, showed people with shackled wrists boarding a plane at Willow Run. Additionally, online records from the Federal Aviation Administration show that the tail number on one of the aircraft seen in the pictures matched up with a plane operated by Eastern Air Express.

A report by Human Rights First said there were 88 outbound ICE flights from Willow Run in 2025. According to the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, the planes then usually flew “from Ypsilanti to major immigration detention hubs in the South, such as Alexandria, Louisiana,” where ICE maintains a deportation staging facility operated by the GEO Group. That’s the same corporation which operates the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, ICE’s largest detention facility in the Midwest.

Jessi Hanson-DeFusco, an assistant professor of public policy at Lawrence Technological University, also shared the potential risks for airports like Willow Run that are being used by ICE.

“Anyone who comes through one of our airports who has damages, suffers personal injuries, property damage, or was wrongfully detained, or has medical malpractice, will legally be able to sue any partners or entities, including counties like Wayne County for having taken part in that,” she said. “Are you sure, out of the thousands of people who have come through our airports, that each individual has received due process and was detained legally, lawfully and ethically?”

Conn also urged the broader Wayne County community to protest the use of the airport by ICE, adding that he urged airport employees to shut the airport down if needed.

“You must act. You must do everything you can, and you can do so much,” he said. “When this is such an injustice and so critical to the future of our country, we must take action. We must do everything we can.”

“This is a threat to you and you and me, every single person here,” he said.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/screenshot-2026-01-21-at-3.14.21-PM-scaled-e1769033638717-1024x5721769100594.png?h=335cd77d&itok=QePA1pK4,N,,2026-01-22 19:38:12.433524

The new Mexico City policy decision deepens the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown on DEI efforts, and rights for transgender and nonbinary people.
Fox News Digital first reported on the news of the extended Mexico City policy.","The Trump administration will block organizations from using US foreign aid to subsidize diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and what the administration calls “gender ideology”. The new policy will affect about $30bn in foreign assistance.

The decision, confirmed to the Guardian by a state department spokesperson on Thursday morning, marks a dramatic expansion of the so-called “Mexico City policy”, which blocks non-US non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from receiving some forms of US funding if they provide abortion-related services or advocate for abortion rights overseas. Now, that policy – which abortion rights supporters call the “global gag rule” – will also apply to international organizations and US-based NGOs operating abroad.

“President Trump continues to deliver on his promise to end woke foreign assistance,” the state department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

First introduced by Ronald Reagan in 1984, the Mexico City policy is typically rescinded whenever a Democrat wins the White House and reinstated whenever a Republican wins. Usually, the policy applies only to dollars that have been set aside for family planning assistance, which account for about $600m worth of aid.

However, during his first administration, Trump extended the policy to apply to all global health assistance, changing the terms of an estimated $7.3bn worth of aid. The effect was ruinous, advocacy groups say. MSI Reproductive Choices, a global family planning organization that works in nearly 40 countries, has said that the policy led it to shutter services in countries like Uganda, Madagascar and Nepal.

“You then end up with a whole generation of women and girls who are growing up in this stigmatized environment with no notion of where to go to find out information about their health and their rights,” said Sarah Shaw, Marie Stopes International’s associate director of advocacy. “Any effort to expand this is even more catastrophic.”

After returning to power in January 2025, Trump reinstated his version of theMexico City policy. Now, his newest expansion of the policy will affect not only money earmarked for global health aid, but vast swathes of foreign assistance.

It will also block groups from using foreign assistance funds to pay for what the state department spokesperson called “abortion as a form of family planning”. The spokesperson did not immediately reply to a request for clarification about how that requirement differs from past versions of the Mexico City policy.

The new Mexico City policy decision deepens the Trump administration’s ongoing crackdown on DEI efforts, and rights for transgender and nonbinary people. (“Gender ideology” is the rightwing shorthand for the idea that gender is fluid and trans and non-binary people exist.) Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders that generally ended the federal government’s support for DEI initiatives, proclaimed that there are only two genders and attacked government efforts to recognize trans people. His administration has also undermined research that worked to further racial and gender equity.

Fox News Digital first reported on the news of the extended Mexico City policy.

The state department will officially release three final rules outlining the new policy on Friday, when thousands of anti-abortion activists are expected to gather in Washington DC for an annual gathering called the March for Life.

Without those final rules, experts say, it is difficult to know how the policy will work or how many people it will affect.

“The impacts could be endless. They could have impacts in ways we can’t even imagine right now,” said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. “This policy not only exports harsh US abortion bans around the world – we’re also exporting ideologically driven mandates to countries and the world that are anti-human rights, anti-health, anti-equity. It’s just devastating.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ae83553108481901fc0a96d4c5893ee93836c87/17_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=196335dd88cb2583e5fd39866bfcb479",N,,2026-01-22 16:57:37.773777

The analysis covers 12 key areas, including threats to electoral integrity, due process, and assembly, mirroring global patterns where leaders manipulate elections to consolidate power.

“We are all witness to a dangerous trajectory under President Trump that has already led to a human rights emergency. By shredding norms and concentrating power, the administration is trying to make it impossible for anyone to hold them accountable,”

warns Paul O’Brien in the report, underscoring how these policies close civic space and undermine the rule of law. Trump's aggressive policies on voting access, despite constitutional limits on federal overreach, amplify these risks, with courts blocking several initiatives amid lawsuits from 19 states.

Authoritarian Playbook Targets Electoral Integrity

Trump's policies echo Amnesty's warnings by targeting mail-in voting and voter data, aiming to reshape the electoral landscape before November 2026. A March 2025 executive order cut federal funding to states accepting mail ballots postmarked after Election Day—except for military and overseas voters—sparking legal challenges and judicial blocks. This policy, defended as essential for “maintaining clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards for ensuring free and fair elections” by Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K.

Dhillon, affects roughly 48 million voters who used mail-in options in 2024. Federal judges, including U.S. District Judge John Chun, have ruled to

“restore the proper balance of power among the Executive Branch, the states, and Congress envisioned by the Framers,”

halting provisions like proof-of-citizenship requirements on voter forms. The Justice Department's requests for state voter data, including Social Security numbers, further heighten Human Rights concerns over privacy and potential disenfranchisement of naturalized citizens.

These moves dismantle anti-corruption safeguards and scapegoat migrants, aligning with Amnesty's documentation of broader Human Rights rollbacks, such as expanded surveillance and weakened non-discrimination protections. Local officials like Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows note a lack of federal support, while Minnesota's Steve Simon urges vigilance against efforts to

“extend his legal authority and interfere with state elections”.

With the U.S. exiting the Human Rights Council, WHO, Paris Agreement, and 63 other bodies last month, international Human Rights norms face parallel erosion, intensifying domestic vulnerabilities.

Midterm Redistricting and Power Consolidation

Mid-decade redistricting emerges as a pivotal policy tool, with Republican-led states like Texas, Missouri, Florida, Indiana, and Louisiana redrawing maps to gain GOP seats and protect Trump's agenda on immigration and fiscal issues.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott's August 2025 map targets five additional Republican seats, while Missouri faces voter referendums on changes approved by Governor Mike Kehoe. Democrats counter in California, Virginia, Maryland, and Illinois, but these battles risk entrenching power imbalances that Amnesty flags as authoritarian consolidation. Trump's floated idea of canceling elections—later retracted—paired with insistence on voter ID, reflects skepticism rooted in 2020 claims, as he stated to the House Republican Conference:

“The election was rigged... You ought to have voter ID. You ought to insist on it... When somebody says, ‘No, we don’t want voter ID,’ that means they’re crooked,”

without evidence.

Legal expert Derek Clinger affirms “the Constitution gives no authority to the president to do any of these things,” yet the push persists, threatening Human Rights like voting access ahead of midterms that will test Republican unity. Ohio's repeal of mail-in grace periods exemplifies state-level victories for these policies, potentially disenfranchising millions and mirroring global tactics of electoral manipulation.

Amnesty ties this to risks for journalists, protestors, students, and voters, especially after federal responses like deploying 300 Marines to Los Angeles protests.

Assault on Mail-In Voting and Election Infrastructure

Restrictions on mail-in ballots form the core of Trump's policy assault, with an August 2025 threat of a nationwide ban stalling due to legal barriers, shifting focus to congressional allies. A Supreme Court review on late-postmarked ballots looms, critical for the 30% of voters relying on this method. The March executive order also disrupted voting machines and froze funding for the Election Assistance Commission, facing injunctions.

Election security falters as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency lost one-third of its staff by June 2025 amid initiative halts, while the DOJ's Civil Rights Division pivots from protections to roll ""cleaning,"" misapplying laws per recent rulings.

Local officials prepare for federal interference, eroding public trust in a process vital for Human Rights like free expression and assembly. Amnesty's report links these policies to a human rights emergency, urging Congress, states, and international actors to intervene, much like French President Emmanuel Macron's Davos critique of a “lawless world” with “imperial ambitions”. PolitiFact notes stalled promises like paper ballots only, highlighting executive limits, but the cumulative effect risks democratic backslide.

International Echoes and Domestic Stakes

Global exits from Human Rights bodies compound domestic policies, isolating the U.S. as midterms approach and amplifying Amnesty's 12-point warnings on freedoms from expression to asylum rights. Federalizing the National Guard for protests foreshadows suppression of voting dissent, while detaining activists like Mahmoud Khalil signals chilling effects. Election law expert Richard Hasen warns of efforts to reshape democracy, with Republicans eyeing sustained control through DOJ probes, infrastructure cuts, and gerrymandering.

And why should successors follow the law if some presidents exempt whole classes of people from the immigration law, what is to prevent others from not enforcing the tax code against other classes?
When a president of Party A refuses to enforce a law that his party’s activists dislike, he angers members of Party B.
The administration has signaled its determination to enforce immigration laws by taking steps that no administration has before and that are likely to provoke political backlash.","Stuck in traffic last fall as a “No Kings” rally in Chicago brought our car to a standstill, I listened to a familiar charge: President Donald Trump was acting like an unrestrained monarch. Many signs and chants particularly complained about his immigration policy: his detaining and deporting immigrants who had no legal right to remain in the country. But whatever one thinks of the soundness of our immigration laws, it is clear that they are, indeed, laws. What struck me was how strange it was that enforcing a duly enacted law can plausibly be confused with royal prerogative.

Enforcing immigration law is not an act of political discretion on the part of a king but an obligation of a republican executive simply implementing congressional directives. Such legal restrictions may be debatable, but it is up to Congress to change them. And it is likely that some of Trump’s agents are not complying with constitutional requirements in rounding up illegal immigrants, but that would be a complaint primarily about methods, not their objectives.

Far from reflecting a regal prerogative, the enforcement posture now inspiring such protests was partly a response to an earlier presidential claim of one. President Barack Obama refused to enforce a substantial part of the immigration law. First, he bestowed “lawful presence” on children who were in the country illegally and then extended these rights to their parents. Indeed, lawful presence went beyond a mere failure to enforce and granted permission to work in the country. Congress has consistently failed to pass laws incorporating these judgments despite their being proposed on many occasions. Texas v. United States indeed dismissed a challenge to the Biden administration’s deportation priorities. But the decision did not validate the Obama administration’s DACA or DAPA programs. While DACA and DAPA affirmatively conferred lawful presence and eligibility for benefits on large, predefined classes, the Biden guidance challenged in Texas largely involved prioritizing whom to arrest and remove. The Court emphasized that such prioritization reflects necessary enforcement triage discretion given resource constraints. But the majority underscored limits on discretion, warning against executive “abdication” and distinguishing non-enforcement from programs that alter legal status that were at the core of the Obama program.

As it happens, the Constitution specifically memorializes the republic’s prohibition of the prerogative of abdication. It requires that the president “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”—a direct repudiation of executive dispensing power. Thus, the Clause was designed at least in part to deny the president the so-called dispensing power by which English monarchs had sometimes claimed the authority to refuse to enforce the laws of Parliament.

The Framers were particularly familiar with James II’s refusal to enforce the Test Act by exempting army officers from the prohibition on Catholics holding office. It was one of the acts that sparked the “Glorious Revolution” that dispensed with James. After James had fled in 1688, the English Bill of Rights abolished this executive prerogative “as it hath been assumed and exercised of late.” This history was the background against which the Take Care Clause was written.

The exemption of certain classes of people from the enforcement of the immigration laws has not been the only act in recent times when our recent presidents have brazenly refused to enforce the law. For instance, the Affordable Care Act established explicit statutory deadlines for the enforcement of the individual mandate. Yet the Obama administration delayed enforcement, no doubt for fear of the political backlash it would cause. As with immigration, this was not case-by-case discretion but a categorical, prospective refusal to enforce a statute.

Another instance of disdain for carrying out the law emerged in the Biden administration’s treatment of federal student loans. Even after the formal pandemic emergency had ended, the executive continued to suspend loan repayment and interest accrual. While the student loan statute required both repayment and accrual, the Biden administration abrogated these requirements. Again, this cannot be analogized to case-by-case prosecutorial discretion. The suspension was not limited to hardship cases or individualized determinations of inability to pay. It applied to tens of millions of borrowers instead. As with immigration and health care, the executive substituted its own policy judgment for that of the legislature by failing to enforce statutory obligations in a comprehensive manner.

More recently, President Donald Trump refused to enforce legislation requiring that TikTok either give up its Chinese ownership or be banned in the United States. The statute used mandatory language, leaving no room for presidential discretion once statutory predicates were satisfied.

These unilateral actions by presidents in both parties are lawless and dangerous. First, they suggest that policy imperatives can trump the law. It is the bedrock of limited government that respect for the deliberate process of law is more important than any passing policy interest. Such disrespect for the law by the chief magistrate can ripple outward. Why should citizens respect the law when the president does not? And why should successors follow the law if some presidents exempt whole classes of people from the immigration law, what is to prevent others from not enforcing the tax code against other classes?

Second, it makes the president more important than Congress. Most obviously, it makes his judgments more decisive than those of past Congresses, because he can make their enactments a dead letter.

Third, it sidelines the current Congress. In each of these cases, Congress could have acted. It has the authority to pass immigration reform. It could have delayed the Affordable Care Act or amended it so that a delay was not needed. It could have modified the prohibition on TikTok to give President Trump time to pursue his “art of the deal.”

But the consequences are worse than the distortion of the formal separation of powers. When the president declines to enforce the law against a class of persons or a company, the law ceases to provide the legal framework that stabilizes a republic. Law becomes just a temporary policy choice, reversible by the next executive who disagrees with it.

Presidential elections then become much more momentous and divisive because they determine far more than how the president may exercise discretion within the interstices of the law. Instead, they determine whether laws, laboriously created by the bicameral process and reflecting bipartisan buy-in, will be enforced at all.

Moreover, the law loses its settlement function when the executive can dispense with it. Many issues, like immigration, elicit intense disagreement. The way to resolve disagreements in a pluralist society is for Congress to reach a compromise that best represents conflicting interests. Non-enforcement destroys that compromise and makes people less interested in compromise in the future.

Moreover, non-enforcement abets political polarization. When a president of Party A refuses to enforce a law that his party’s activists dislike, he angers members of Party B. Such polarization can lead to two unfortunate reactions. First, when a president of Party B takes power, he may also choose not to enforce laws his party dislikes, but that Party A supports. Second, he may resort to drastic enforcement measures of the law that the president of Party A refused to enforce, using unreasonable means to signal his disagreement with the non-enforcement of the previous administration.

It is at least plausible that this dynamic explains the Trump administration’s unusually aggressive approach to immigration enforcement. The administration has signaled its determination to enforce immigration laws by taking steps that no administration has before and that are likely to provoke political backlash.

One problem with policing the fundamental issue of non-enforcement is that citizens often lack standing to complain. The failure to enforce the law injures the public at large but does not give rise to the kind of concrete grievance necessary to bring a suit in federal court. Moreover, courts are concerned about issuing injunctions to enforce the law because the executive does need some enforcement discretion to reflect priorities and budgetary constraints. Courts are not well-positioned to evaluate these. As a result, while the Take Care Clause is both an essential and express restraint on the executive, current limitations on standing render judicial enforcement implausible in many circumstances. And in our closely divided political era, it is unlikely that Congress will have the substantial majorities necessary to discipline the president for particular failures to enforce.

But perhaps Congress could include as an appropriation rider that would defund parts of the executive office of the president for failure to enforce, so long as it would take effect after the next presidential election. In that way, Congress could restore the stickiness of its legislative judgments under a veil of ignorance as to which party would be immediately disadvantaged.

Americans should, of course, be vigilant when enforcement of the law threatens individual constitutional rights. But another corrosive danger lies in the president’s failure to enforce the law. It weakens Congress. It dissolves the law’s settlement function. It accelerates political polarization by teaching citizens that legality depends on electoral outcomes. A republic cannot endure if its laws bind only when the executive approves of them.",https://lawliberty.org/app/uploads/2026/01/No_Kings_protest_in_Chicago_145043-1060x596.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:57:33.991883

WATCH LIVE: Jack Smith testifies about Trump criminal investigations

House Democratic leaders Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Rep. Pete Aguilar of California announced in a closed-door meeting that they would oppose the Homeland Security bill. Their members are demanding a forceful stand in response to the Republican president's immigration crackdown, most recently centered in the Minneapolis area, where more than 2,000 officers are stationed and where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot Renee Good, a mother of three.

""There's a very big concern about ICE being out of control,"" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the ranking Democratic lawmaker on the House Appropriations Committee.

But Democrats have few good options to express their opposition. DeLauro said that passing a continuing resolution to fund Homeland Security at current levels for the remainder of the budget year would cede spending decisions to Trump. There's also little appetite for another shutdown, even if it would affect only a portion of the federal government.

""There is much more we must do to rein in DHS, which I will continue to press for. But the hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" said Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.

This year's Homeland Security bill holds spending for ICE roughly flat from the prior year. It also restricts the ability of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to unilaterally shift funding and allocate federal dollars as she sees fit.

""It's not everything we wanted. We wanted more oversight. But, look, Democrats don't control the House. We don't control the Senate or the White House. But we were able to add some oversight over Homeland,"" said Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, a member of the Appropriations panel. He said he intends to vote for the bill.

Democrats voice their concerns privately and publicly

But most Democrats who emerged from the closed-door caucus meeting on Wednesday had a different view.

""I never support lawless operations,"" said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio.

""If it's the status quo, I'm a no,"" said Rep. Brad Schneider, D-Ill.

DeLauro, along with Cuellar, made a presentation about the bill to House Democrats during their closed-door meeting. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said she told her colleagues why she thought it was a mistake. Others who spoke up agreed, she said.

""I think this is just a really horrific time, and people understand what's at stake,"" Jayapal said. ""We can't treat this like it's anything else. Our eyes are not lying to us.""

She explained that extra money for body cameras and other changes was insufficient. The bill provides $20 million that must be used for ICE and Customs and Border Protection officers when conducting enforcement actions.

She said she told her colleagues, ""Nobody should try to sell this as an improvement. It's not an improvement.""

But some Democrats in key swing districts will likely be seeing campaign ads targeting them if they vote against the Homeland Security funding bill. The campaign arm for House Republicans issued press releases on Wednesday targeting some 20 Democrats, saying they ""will do anything to appease the 'defund ICE' crowd even if it means risking national security.""

Meanwhile, liberal advocacy groups are also applying pressure, saying Congress must take clear, immediate action to rein in the department.

""The DHS bill that was released clearly falls far short, and should be roundly rejected. Every Democrat should be voting against this funding bill, and Democratic leadership in both chambers should be actively whipping their caucus in opposition,"" said Andrew O'Neill, national advocacy director for the group Indivisible.

Republicans are confident the bill will pass

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was optimistic that the funding bills would pass, including the Homeland Security measure. He can afford a few defections given the GOP's razor-thin majority.

""All we do is win,"" Johnson said.

The overall funding package before the House on Thursday contains roughly $1.2 trillion in spending. About two-thirds of that will go to the Defense Department.

Other departments that are funded through the package include Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. Most federal spending is unaffected by the yearly battles in Congress, most notably Social Security and Medicare.

Shooting involving ICE officers

ICE officers spotted a white van, registered to Sousa-Martins, in the parking lot of a Lowe's Home Improvement store in Severn, according to documents. The officers followed the van to the 500 block in Glen Burnie when they attempted a traffic stop.

ICE officers blocked the van from taking off and approached the van before demanding the driver get out of the vehicle. According to documents, when the driver refused to get out of the van, the officers broke the window to try to get him out.

That's when prosecutors say Sousa-Martins then drove back, rammed into an officer's vehicle, and then drove forward towards other vehicles and officers.

Officers then fired shots, striking Sousa-Martins in the shoulder and thigh areas. The van then crashed in between two homes.

“I’m grateful to the thousands of residents who joined our first town hall of the year,” Sherman said. “One year into this administration, we’ve seen chaos, overreach, and a disregard for both civil liberties and international norms. Staying connected with constituents is essential as we work to confront these challenges and prepare for what lies ahead.”

In his opening remarks, Sherman reviewed the Trump administration’s record over the past year, focusing on aggressive immigration enforcement policies that have torn families apart and spread fear throughout Los Angeles–area communities and beyond. He addressed widespread outrage following the fatal shooting of Minnesota mother Renee Good by an ICE officer earlier this month, calling the incident a tragic consequence of an administration that has abandoned oversight and restraint. Sherman said he will refuse to vote for any federal appropriations bill that funds ICE and noted that he has joined efforts to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whom he has described as the “worst cabinet secretary in U.S. history.”

Sherman also discussed what he described as reckless actions by the Trump administration on the world stage, including repeated threats and rhetoric regarding Greenland. As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Sherman warned that such actions undermine U.S. alliances as well as global peace and security. Congressman Sherman highlighted his recent unveiling of the “Hands Off Greenland” Act to block any unilateral effort to seize or acquire the territory.

Throughout the event, Sherman answered questions and addressed concerns about immigration enforcement, rising costs, threats to civil rights, and the broader direction of the country under the Trump administration. He reiterated his commitment to holding the administration accountable and continuing to fight for the values and interests of California’s communities.

The Town Hall also featured California Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo, representing the Northwest San Fernando Valley in the 40th Assembly District, as a special guest. Assemblymember Schiavo discussed priorities in the State Legislature and the importance of coordination between state and federal leaders to protect families and uphold fundamental rights during a period of political uncertainty.

According to the ICE Flight Monitor, a project by the organization Human Rights First, ICE used Willow Run as a stop for flights, usually to major immigration detention hubs in the South, regularly throughout the second half of 2025.

Steve Conn, an activist with the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, called the airport “a key link in the chain, down to Texas or Louisiana overnight” during the public board meeting.

Chad Newton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Wayne County Airport Authority, said in his report to the board during the meeting that he is often asked if the airport authority has any contracts with ICE.

“Our response remains, the Wayne County Airport Authority does not have any involvement in the agreements between airlines and their partners, including federal agencies, as long as those agreements meet legal and safety requirements,” he said.

But many present did not find Newton’s argument about the authority’s lack of responsibility convincing, arguing that no activity takes place at an airport without approval and urging those in attendance to use their power to stop such activity and make it more difficult for it to continue.

George Washington, a lawyer in the Detroit area, similarly said that, while the board may not have made the decision to initially permit ICE to use the airport, they should be acting on it now.

“We know that this board did not set up that system that was set up by the Trump administration, but we know also that by allowing Willow Run to do this, you’re collaborating with this system,” he said. “You’re collaborating because you said nothing about it, because even till this day, you will not condemn it. You will simply say it’s not our problem.”

Colorado airline operates flights for ICE, records show

Washington also criticized the board for not mentioning the usage of the airport by ICE during the main portion of the meeting, a significant portion of which focused on upgrades to restrooms in the McNamara terminal.

Airlines conducting ICE flights out of Willow Run include Colorado-based Key Lime Air, as well as Eastern Air Express. Photos shared with Michigan Advance by the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, showed people with shackled wrists boarding a plane at Willow Run. Additionally, online records from the Federal Aviation Administration show that the tail number on one of the aircraft seen in the pictures matched up with a plane operated by Eastern Air Express.

A report by Human Rights First said there were 88 outbound ICE flights from Willow Run in 2025. According to the Detroit Committee to Stop ICE, the planes then usually flew “from Ypsilanti to major immigration detention hubs in the South, such as Alexandria, Louisiana,” where ICE maintains a deportation staging facility operated by the GEO Group. That’s the same corporation which operates the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan, ICE’s largest detention facility in the Midwest.

Jessi Hanson-DeFusco, an assistant professor of public policy at Lawrence Technological University, also shared the potential risks for airports like Willow Run that are being used by ICE.

“Anyone who comes through one of our airports who has damages, suffers personal injuries, property damage, or was wrongfully detained, or has medical malpractice, will legally be able to sue any partners or entities, including counties like Wayne County for having taken part in that,” she said. “Are you sure, out of the thousands of people who have come through our airports, that each individual has received due process and was detained legally, lawfully and ethically?”

Conn also urged the broader Wayne County community to protest the use of the airport by ICE, adding that he urged airport employees to shut the airport down if needed.

“You must act. You must do everything you can, and you can do so much,” he said. “When this is such an injustice and so critical to the future of our country, we must take action. We must do everything we can.”

We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” Bellows said.
“The Trump administration has deployed ICE agents to Portland, Lewiston, and possibly other Maine communities.","The Trump administration is now targeting its mass deportation campaign on Maine, a state with relatively few residents in the United States illegally but notable African refugee communities in its largest cities.

The Department of Homeland Security named the operation “Catch of the Day,” an apparent play on Maine’s seafood industry, just as it has done for other enforcement surges, like “Patriot” in Massachusetts, “Metro Surge” in Minnesota and “Midway Blitz” in Chicago.

Reports of a surge in immigration arrests have struck fear in immigrant communities of Portland and Lewiston and prompted backlash from Gov. Janet Mills and other Democrats, including a refusal to help ICE agents obscure the identity of their vehicles by issuing undercover license plates.

Mills said Wednesday that if federal agents have warrants, they should show them, but if they are separating parents who have committed no crime from their children, they are ""only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors.”

Citizens have formed networks to alert neighborhoods to the presence of ICE agents and bring food to immigrants in their homes. Portland's superintendent said the school district is developing an online learning plan for its students — more than half of whom aren't white. Many businesses have posted signs saying ICE agents aren't welcome.

“While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach,” Portland Mayor Mark Dion said at a news conference Wednesday where he was joined by other local officials. “This council doesn’t stand apart from our immigrant communities, we stand with them.”

Portland and Lewiston have thousands of residents of African descent. Somali immigration accelerated in the early 2000s, leaving Maine with one of the nation’s highest Somali populations.

Now the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents is causing great anxiety in Portland, said city council member Pious Ali, a native of Ghana.

“Our schools have seen about a quarter of immigrants not showing up,” Ali said, and many fear going to work as well: “There are immigrants who live here who work in our hospitals, they work in our schools, they work in our hotels, they are part of the economic engine of our community.”

ICE agents don't need to spread trauma by smashing doors and windows, he said: ""The federal government has the ability to contact these people without unleashing fear into our communities.”

Portland Councilor Wes Pelletier said business owners, teachers and college students have shared information to alert neighborhoods to enforcement activity, while volunteers have delivered groceries and diapers to families too afraid to go outside.

“Every arrest feels like a wound to Portland,” the councilor said.

Gov. Janet Mills speaks about increased ICE presence in Maine

Mills held a press conference Thursday afternoon, addressing the ICE presence in Maine and the fear that is spreading across the state.

""This target of 1,400 people seems pretty broad and we're hearing that there's a lot of fear within schools, within the employment community, among businesses who are losing employees who have either been detained or are not showing up...businesses are very worried about being able to carry on, all kinds of businesses who rely on employees who are here legally, lawfully, and who have a good work ethic and a good work record with these employers.""

Mills said she's hearing that many of the people who are being detained or who are on the target list are family members here in Maine, people who are working here in Maine, people who have children in the school system, people who have children in homes in Maine, and people with no criminal records: ""And that's concerning.""

""Obviously it's very disruptive to a child's life, disruptive to a business, disruptive to a school, to a city and town, and tends to engender a lot of fear and anxiety naturally on the part of these families and these communities,"" Mills said. ""And think what it does to the children to think of their parent being hauled away, a parent with no criminal activity, no criminal charges, no criminal record, being hauled away in their presence and not being told when is mom or dad is coming home. Where do I go next? Who do I turn to? Pretty tough.""

Mills said she'd love to know the numbers of arrests in real time but that it would be hard to determine that without following ICE around, which she's not going to be doing. The governor said they try to keep track of a lot of anecdotal reports, as do police departments and mayors, who are getting those reports also.

She also noted that people are freely using their cell phones, which is their absolute right, to record incidents they see, as long as they don't interfere or obstruct.

Mills, a former district attorney and state attorney general, said she knows about crime in the state. She says they take crime very seriously, and are proud of the fact that Maine has one of the lowest crime rates in the country, certainly one of the lowest violent crime rates.

""We take allegations of criminal activity seriously, no matter who the person is. I don't sense that there's any greater incidence of crime among non citizens than there is among citizens, in fact I think probably the opposite,"" Mills said. ""But that's not what we're hearing about. We're hearing about perhaps a handful of people with criminal convictions who, I don't know what their status is, but you know what I've asked for, if you have warrants, show the warrants. In my experience you've gotta get a judicial warrant to arrest somebody. It's not automatic. And they have warrants to come here and arrest people, then that should be public record.""

Mills said in America, we don't believe in secret arrests or secret police. She said as for Maine, she knows the state's law enforcement are subject to professional training, substantial qualifications and high expectations or performance standards.

""And I'll tell ya, they don't wear masks to hide their identity, they don't need to wear masks, they don't need to hide their identity, and they don't go out and set numbers and goals and quotas and detain people subject to some quota wherever that may come from. That's not very professional.""

As for why is ICE targeting Maine? Mills could only surmise.

""Well [Trump's] gone to a lot of blue states, hasn't he? He went to Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, all democratic governors. I happen to be a democratic governor. Ostensibly they're coming here, they say, because of an immigrant population that they find in disfavor, so I don't know, you'll have to ask them why they're here.""

As for there allegedly being 1,400 people in Maine with criminal backgrounds, Mills says, ""Let's see the documents.""

""I'd be shocked if they found 1,400 people with criminal charges against them but what we're hearing is not that anyway,"" Mills continued. ""What we're hearing is that people with no criminal backgrounds are being detained and subject to perhaps deportation, or at least arrest, people who are being torn from their families and from young children, people who are part of the workforce here in Maine, a workforce that we desperately need and desperately value, and that's a shame, you know? It's disruptive and it's causing a lot of fear, unnecessary anxiety in the community and among families who don't deserve this kind of treatment.""

Mills said school superintendents are very much on alert, particularly in Portland and Lewiston where schools have a fairly high number of children of immigrant families.

When asked about a recently leaked memo, dated May 2025, that shows ICE told officers they can forcibly enter homes during immigration operations without a judicial warrant, Mills said: ""That's very disturbing news assuming it's true.""

""Look the Fourth Amendment, the basic premise of our Bill of Rights, for god's sake its words couldn't be plainer, you've got to have a judicial warrant before you enter somebody's home.""

Dozens of arrests

The enforcement action is arriving in Maine, a mostly rural state with about 1.4 million residents, as confrontations between ICE and demonstrators continue in Minnesota, where ICE is under scrutiny following an agent’s fatal shooting of Renee Good.

ICE didn’t respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the agency’s plans for Maine, where the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that increased enforcement began on Tuesday.

“We have approximately 1,400 targets here in Maine,” Patricia Hyde, the ICE deputy assistant director, told Fox News, adding that agents had made 50 arrests by Tuesday.

“We have launched Operation Catch of the Day to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in the state. On the first day of operations, we arrested illegal aliens convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child,” added Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.

No new undercover license plates

Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said state officials received a request from U.S. Customs and Border Protection for confidential, undercover Maine license plates and decided against issuing them. The licenses plates are used on unmarked vehicles, and Bellows said she wants more assurance they will be used appropriately.

ICE’s use of license plates in other states has raised concerns: Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, a Democrat, issued a warning to ICE agents last year that swapping or altering license plates is illegal.

“These requests in light of rumors of ICE deployment to Maine and abuses of power in Minnesota and elsewhere raise concerns. We have not revoked existing plates but have paused issuance of new plates. We want to be assured that Maine plates will not be used for lawless purposes,” Bellows said.

Bellows, a Democrat who has repeatedly clashed with the Trump administration, cited accountability concerns.

Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request seeking comment, but a top Maine Republican said withholding the undercover plates would jeopardize public safety.

“That really, one, puts us at odds as a state. Puts us at one end of an extreme that we really shouldn’t be on,” Senate Leader Trey Stewart said.

Maine’s top federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson, joined Democrats in calling for any demonstrations in the state to remain peaceful and civil. Benson, a Trump appointee, warned people to stay out of the agents' way or be prosecuted.

Schools, Democrats call for caution

Portland Public Schools, the largest and most diverse school district in the state, said in a statement Wednesday that it conducted a “lockout” at two schools to prevent anyone from entering the building during the school day Tuesday because of concerns about ICE activity nearby.

“It was quickly determined that there was no threat to our school communities and the lockouts were lifted within minutes. This is an understandably tense time in our community, as reports and rumors of immigration enforcement actions grow,” the district's statement said.

Maine Democrats have condemned the ICE activity.

“The Trump administration has deployed ICE agents to Portland, Lewiston, and possibly other Maine communities. This is not about public safety. It is about fear, control, and political theater,” Devon Murphy-Anderson, executive director of the Maine Democratic Party, said in a statement Wednesday.

Tensions appeared unlikely to subside after school officials in a nearby suburb said ICE agents had detained a 5-year-old boy. Federal authorities showed little sign of softening their approach, announcing on Thursday the arrest of two people in connection with a protest that disrupted a church service in St. Paul on Sunday.

Minneapolis has remained on edge as heavily armed federal officers roam the streets, rounding up suspects they assert are dangerous criminal immigration violators while sometimes ensnaring law-abiding U.S. citizens. They have been met with throngs of demonstrators conducting their own patrols, blowing warning whistles and chanting at the agents.

4 CHILDREN DETAINED THIS MONTH: SCHOOL

In Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb, school officials said at a press conference that immigration officers had detained at least four children this month, including a 5-year-old boy on Tuesday.

A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, Tricia McLaughlin, said ICE had not targeted the child but his father, who she said left his son behind when he fled on foot after agents attempted to stop him. An officer remained with the child for his safety while others arrested the man, she added.

Parents targeted by ICE are asked if they want their children to be placed with someone they designate or removed with their parents, she said. She did not address the school district's allegation that three other children were detained.

Separately, Trump administration officials said on Thursday they had arrested at least two people involved in a demonstration that interrupted a Sunday service in a St. Paul church, where protesters alleged a pastor has been assisting ICE.

FBI Director Kash Patel said one of the organizers was charged with violating a federal law that bars physical obstruction of reproductive health centers and houses of worship.

VANCE'S LEADING ROLE IN DEFENDING ICE

Vance has taken a leading role in defending the Minnesota ICE shooting. Less than 24 hours after Good's death, Vance made a rare appearance in the White House briefing room, where he defended the officer involved, blamed the woman who was killed, and said the incident should be a political test ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

Even some Republican supporters have grown wary of President Donald Trump's approach to immigration enforcement, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.

But the administration has expressed no intention of backing down after Trump deployed some 3,000 federal law enforcement officers to the Minneapolis area in what DHS described as its largest immigration operation ever. The city is the latest Democratic-leaning jurisdiction that Trump has targeted with a federal show of force.

Trump has said he acted partly in response to fraud allegations against some members of the state's sizable Somali American community; the president has described Somali immigrants as ""garbage"" and said they should be thrown out of the country.

While Trump officials say the operations are a necessary response to lax Democratic policies on immigration, local Democratic leaders have accused ICE agents of racial profiling and argued that Trump is intentionally fomenting chaos to justify his aggression.

In a speech in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday, ahead of flying to Minneapolis, Vance blamed protesters for the unrest.

""If you want to turn down the chaos in Minneapolis, stop fighting immigration enforcement and accept that we have to have a border in this country,"" he said. ""It's not that hard.""

Vance is scheduled to host a roundtable event with local leaders and community members in Minneapolis, where he will discuss ""restoring law and order in Minnesota"" and meet with officers in a show of support, the White House said.

The vice president is also planning to discuss Trump's vow to cut off federal funding from sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with the administration's immigration crackdown, starting on February 1.

'POLITICAL THEATER'

Richard Carlbom, chair of Minnesota's Democratic Party, said he hopes Vance will promote calm but fears political agitation.

“I think he is simply coming here for political theater. This entire situation we're being faced with is a retribution campaign by him and the president of the United States against Minnesotans,"" Carlbom told Reuters.

Trump faulted Minnesota's leaders during his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, saying, ""We actually are helping Minnesota so much, but they don’t appreciate it.""

Patty O'Keefe, a 36-year-old Minnesotan and non-profit worker who was pepper-sprayed and detained by federal agents in January after documenting ICE movements in the city, did not welcome Vance's visit.

""He's calling for law and order when it's his federal agents who are creating chaos and escalating violence,"" O'Keefe said. “His divisive rhetoric is not welcome here.""

The president and the White House have tied the ICE operation to allegations of welfare fraud in the state. Since 2022, at least 56 people have pleaded guilty, according to the Justice Department.

“Minnesota reminds us that the West cannot mass import foreign cultures,” Trump said in Davos.

“No one is safe. Not immigrants, not innocent children, not even citizens.

State Rep. Leonora Dodge, a Democrat from Essex and Essex Junction, said she and her constituents have been horrified by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions across the nation.

“As a Latina legislator, I know personally how fear and uncertainty ripple through immigrant families when enforcement crosses the line into abuse. My friends and family are afraid.”

As a result, Dodge has helped draft legislation to protect state residents from federal actions. She outlined these proposals during a “No Secret Police” press conference at the State House in Montpelier this week.

“The bills include requiring law enforcement to be clearly identifiable, strengthening protections against vigilantes impersonating immigration agents, keeping ICE out of our schools, health facilities and libraries and guaranteeing access to legal counsel for people facing deportation. Our constituents have been loud and clear: defend Vermont from the chaos and violence of federal assaults on immigrants, on their allies and on anyone unlucky enough to land in the middle of ICE operations.”

State Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, a Progressive and Democrat from the Chittenden Central District, says her chamber has introduced similar legislation.

“We believe from the testimony from a constitutional law professor at Columbia that we do have the right to do this. We do not have the right to say only federal law enforcement, but we do have the right to say all law enforcement. We are working to continue crafting that language so it is as strong and protective and as defensible as possible because in Vermont we do not want secret police.”

The Senate also plans to expand the list of sensitive locations in Vermont, where civil arrests without a judicial warrant are prohibited. Vyhovsky said she is frustrated about how little the state can do, but says she and other members of the Judiciary Committee are determined to protect residents.

“We will not let our civil rights be eroded upon. We will not let our neighbors be rounded up and sent to concentration camps. We will not allow the death of democracy and the erosion of the rule of law because this brave little state says no to hate, says no to white supremacy and says no to extrajudicial secret police.”

Wednesday’s event at the State House drew dozens of people – support that Falco Schilling, Advocacy Director for the ACLU of Vermont, said he was overwhelmed to see.”

“We have all seen the images coming out of Minnesota and around the country of heavily armed and unidentified federal agents ignoring basic human rights and violently targeting people based on the color of their skin, their accents, or because they simply exercise their First Amendment rights. We are here today to say enough is enough. Vermont can and will act to protect our communities.”

Sen. Becca White, a Democrat from Windsor County, said ICE activity hits close to home. She was with Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and legal resident of Vermont and the United States, when he was detained by ICE last April.

“I'm really, really angry. A few months ago, I had a friend who was detained by ICE when we were outside of his citizenship interview. And when I asked the men with masks, and I said I'm a state senator, who are you? They said, I don't need to tell you who I am. It was shocking to me that even in a position of privilege when I demanded information, I was told I don't have to do that.”

Olga Cruz is an immigrant worker and leader with Migrant Justice. Speaking through an interpreter, she urged support of the House and Senate bills.

“I want to be treated with the fairness and justice that I deserve. I want to be able to live and travel freely, to go to church, to go to the store, to bring my children to school or to a park.

This tragedy is not an isolated event; the Trump administration has been killing and disappearing people of color long before this tragedy came to light.

As a formerly undocumented immigrant, a woman of color, an immigration lawyer for 10 years, and a clinical law professor, I thought I understood pain and despair. However, nothing in my personal or professional experience prepared me for the reckoning that this administration is inflicting on my community.

Take, for example, the case of a client of mine, a 31-year-old man who died in 2025. My law students and I fought relentlessly for his opportunity to secure asylum in the United States. Having survived years of persecution and torture by his home government and months of detention by the U.S. government at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, he fought as hard as he could. Despite having a legally sound and compelling case, it was summarily denied. His fight was lost before it even started. The immigration judge, a former ICE attorney, prioritized legitimizing a violent and punitive legal system, rather than existing legal precedent. The judge did exactly what the Trump administration has demanded of the immigration system: detain for profit, deny meritorious claims, and deport mercilessly.

After being deported to his home country, he went into hiding from his persecutors, embraced his children, and kissed his wife one last time. The following day, he committed suicide, unable to withstand what the U.S. government had done to him. His young family will live forever with the consequences of a death caused by the Trump administration's policies and the immigration laws currently in effect.

Make no mistake: The Trump administration is responsible for my client's suicide. Kristi Noem is responsible for his death and for the deaths of many others persecuted and detained by the various agencies under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. My client's case is not unique. It is not an anomaly; it has become increasingly common under the most racist and violent legal system in the United States.

Trump's ""mass deportation"" agenda has drawn significant media attention. Actions in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and now Minnesota have exposed the war-like tactics Noem and Gregory Bovino have unleashed against communities of color. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the humanity and suffering of those who have been on the receiving end of Trump's militarized harm and cruelty long before January 2026.

It has been barely a year since this administration took office — and the deadliest for immigrants. Human rights organizations have documented the abuse and violence that result from the U.S. immigration system. Although ICE underreports the deaths of immigrants under its custody, independent nonprofit organizations report that 32 people died in ICE custody in 2025. This is the highest number of deaths reported by ICE since 2004. And while 32 deaths are too many, the loss for families and loved ones is simply immeasurable. These families will never be made whole again.

Not enough attention is brought to the government-sanctioned disappearances happening every day throughout the entire nation — a particularly egregious trend utilized by Trump's immigration law enforcement agencies. Take the example of Vicente Ventura Aguilar, who is yet to be found after being arrested by masked ICE agents in Los Angeles on Oct. 7–8, 2025. Based on witness accounts and available information, Ventura's lawyer and family fear he died in government custody, while DHS denies their allegations.

Those who support the Trump administration's extermination of immigrants of color, or who haven't witnessed what I have, will claim that this administration is only ""targeting the worst and most dangerous criminals."" That is simply not true. DHS's own data reports almost 97% of people detained for an immigration violation have never been convicted of a criminal offense, yet they are deported in violation of due process. Even if the administration's claim was true, the immigration system is a civil — not criminal — legal system, yet people are routinely punished, dehumanized, and tortured by the immigration system with impunity.

Why was the violence and tyranny of Trump's America not exposed sooner? And what is our moral duty during these dark times? This administration is succeeding in the systematic erasure of people of color. These atrocities must be named and shouted from every rooftop, because what we do not name does not exist, and silence creates complicity. Now that you know, what will you do to fight these injustices?

One case accused Trump of conspiring to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election, while the other accused him of unlawfully holding onto classified documents.

The hearing marks the first time the American public will hear at length from Smith, whose historic prosecutions dominated Trump’s years out of power and helped fuel the Republican president’s quest for retribution since returning to office.

“President Trump was charged because the evidence established that he willfully broke the very laws that he took an oath to uphold,” Smith told the House panel. “If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so, regardless of whether that president was a Democrat or a Republican.”

Republican lawmakers are seeking to discredit Smith’s investigation and buttress Trump’s claims that the probes were an abuse of the legal system.

“It was always about politics,” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Republican chair of the Judiciary Committee, said at the start of the hearing. “To get Donald Trump, they were willing to do just about anything.”

Democrats Defend Smith

Democrats defended Smith as an apolitical career prosecutor who was guided by the evidence in building his cases against Trump.

Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the panel, said Trump has assailed Smith “not because you did anything wrong, but because you did everything right.”

“You had the audacity to do your job,” Raskin added.

Smith’s testimony is expected to focus primarily on the case that accused Trump of using false voter fraud claims to obstruct the certification of election results following his 2020 defeat to Democrat Joe Biden.

A federal judge has barred the Justice Department from disclosing many of the details surrounding Smith’s second case, which accused Trump of stashing highly sensitive government documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence following the end of his first term in 2021.

Trump Pleaded Not Guilty

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and has repeatedly argued the charges were improperly aimed at damaging his 2024 campaign.

Neither case reached trial and Smith dropped them after Trump won re-election, citing a Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.

Trump, who called Smith a “sick guy” earlier this week, has called for his prosecution. The Trump administration has fired dozens of Justice Department lawyers, FBI agents and staffers who worked on the investigations.

Republican lawmakers are expected to press Smith on disclosures from the Justice Department showing that his investigators examined limited phone records from several Republican senators in the days surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.

Trump allies have argued that the records show Smith’s investigation was overzealous and aimed at the political opposition.

Smith has said the records were necessary to examine Trump’s efforts to pressure Republican lawmakers to block certification of the election.

Congress created federal question jurisdiction to empower federal courts to secure federal rights, like the constitutional rights T.M.
During Reconstruction, Congress passed a series of laws meant to protect and secure federal rights, in part through access to the federal courts.
Ever since, litigants who want to vindicate their federal rights have often sought to do so in federal court.
Because there was no final judgment of a state court of last resort in T.M.’s case, Rooker-Feldman does not apply.","T.M., the petitioner in this case, has a rare condition that can cause temporary psychosis. After one such episode, she was involuntarily committed to a state hospital, which took steps to medicate her against her will. In a lawsuit to vindicate her rights in federal district court, T.M. alleged that she agreed to a consent decree in state court under duress to secure her release. She alleged that the state court consent order, which indefinitely dictated her treatment plan going forward, violated her constitutional rights. She argued that her lawsuit belonged in federal court because federal courts have jurisdiction in cases arising under federal law and, specifically, in lawsuits against state officials for civil rights violations.

The federal district court dismissed T.M.’s case, applying the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, which prohibits federal courts from adjudicating cases attempting to appeal a judgment of a state’s highest court. But T.M. was not seeking review of a judgment of a state’s highest court—at the time T.M. filed her lawsuit in federal court, she had also appealed the consent decree to a state appellate court, and that appeal remained pending.

The Fourth Circuit affirmed, and T.M. asked the Supreme Court to hear her case. In January 2026, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining why Rooker-Feldman does not bar T.M.’s search for justice in federal court.

Congress created federal question jurisdiction to empower federal courts to secure federal rights, like the constitutional rights T.M. is trying to vindicate. At the Founding, the Framers recognized that existing state court systems would not always be sufficient to protect federal interests. In subsequent decades, Congress expanded federal question jurisdiction, often reflecting Congress’s increasing frustration with brazen and unlawful conduct in the state courts. During Reconstruction, Congress passed a series of laws meant to protect and secure federal rights, in part through access to the federal courts. While opponents protested that these laws would let federal courts interfere with state judicial systems, supporters countered that this was precisely the point, due to widespread abuses by the state courts. By granting the federal courts civil rights jurisdiction in 1871 (in the same statute that created the cause of action for civil rights cases now known as § 1983) and federal question jurisdiction in 1875, Congress empowered lower federal courts to protect federal rights at a time when state courts could not be trusted to do so.

Ever since, litigants who want to vindicate their federal rights have often sought to do so in federal court. But in the twentieth century, in decisions separated by nearly sixty years, the Supreme Court dismissed two cases for lack of jurisdiction when state-court litigants, complaining of constitutional violations, sought review in federal district court of judgments of state courts of last resort. These cases created the “Rooker-Feldman doctrine.” Now, despite the Supreme Court’s subsequent admonishments that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine should be exceptionally narrow in scope, the lower federal courts sometimes apply it capaciously to dismiss cases brought in federal court.

The Supreme Court has never applied the Rooker-Feldman doctrine in a case like this one, where the state-court judgment is still subject to further review in the state court system. Rather, the Supreme Court’s precedents establish that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine only applies to final decisions of state courts of last resort, for which the exclusive avenue for review is to seek a Supreme Court writ of certiorari. Any expansion of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine beyond this narrow scope would be completely at odds with the history of Congress’s effort to throw open the doors of the lower federal courts for the vindication of federal rights.

Because there was no final judgment of a state court of last resort in T.M.’s case, Rooker-Feldman does not apply. The lower federal courts have jurisdiction to hear her case, just as the Reconstruction Congress that conferred that jurisdiction intended.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-22 12:38:17.413868

While the victims reported more than $100m in losses, Brink’s said the stolen items were worth less than $10m.","Federal immigration authorities allowed a suspect in a $100m jewelry heist believed to be the largest in US history to deport himself to South America in December, a move that stunned and upset prosecutors who were planning to try the case and send him to prison.

Jeson Nelon Presilla Flores was one of seven people charged last year with stalking an armored truck to a rural freeway rest stop north of Los Angeles and stealing millions worth of diamonds, emeralds, gold, rubies and designer watches in 2022.

Flores faced up to 15 years in federal prison if convicted on charges of conspiracy to commit theft from interstate and foreign shipment and theft from interstate and foreign shipment. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported Flores in late December after he requested voluntary departure, prosecutors said in court filings.

ICE did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Flores’s attorney, John D Robertson, motioned to dismiss the indictment against his client, asking for the charges to be permanently dropped and the case closed.

Federal prosecutors oppose the motion and say they still hope to bring Flores to trial, asking for charges to be dropped “without prejudice” to keep the door open for criminal prosecution in the future.

Despite Flores being a lawful permanent resident and released on bail, he was taken into ICE custody in September, according to court filings from his defense attorneys. Federal prosecutors say they were unaware Flores had an immigration detainer.

This was a violation of his criminal prosecution rights and warrants his case getting dismissed, Robertson said in his motion.

Flores opted for deportation to Chile during a 16 December immigration hearing, according to court documents. The judge denied his voluntary departure application but issued a final order of removal, and he was sent to Ecuador.

“Prosecutors are supposed to allow the civil immigration process to play out independently while criminal charges are pending,” federal prosecutors wrote in their motion opposing the case dismissal. “That is exactly what they did in this case – unwittingly to defendant’s benefit in that he will now avoid trial, and any potential conviction and sentence, unless and until he returns to the United States.”

What happened to Flores is extremely unusual, especially in a case of this significance, former federal prosecutor Laurie Levenson said.

Ordinarily, if a criminal defendant had immigration proceedings against them – which is common – immigration officials would inform prosecutors what was happening. In minor cases, a defendant can sometimes choose to self-deport in lieu of prosecution.

“It’s just beyond me how they would deport him without the prosecutors … being in on the conversation,” Levenson said. “This really was the left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing.”

The jewelers who were stolen from are also demanding answers.

“When a defendant in a major federal theft case leaves the country before trial, victims are left without answers, without a verdict, and without closure,” Jerry Kroll, an attorney for some of the jewelry companies, told the Los Angeles Times.

The infamous jewelry heist unfolded in July 2022 after the suspects scouted the Brink’s tractor-trailer leaving an international jewelry show near San Francisco with dozens of bags of jewels, according to the indictment. While the victims reported more than $100m in losses, Brink’s said the stolen items were worth less than $10m.

A lawsuit filed by the Brink’s security company said one of the drivers was asleep inside the big rig and the other was getting food inside the rest stop when the thieves broke in.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d8580c024ba910ad50ec6d7dc51d1760a8a45aa/188_289_2800_2240/master/2800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=073bd7fb74ff8b9a043f595645feee3d",N,,2026-01-22 13:39:20.330607

However, there is no evidence that the city’s little-known agreement is connected to reports of a planned immigration detention facility in south Kansas City.
Those members, which include Kansas City, determine what other agencies are allowed on the system.","Over the past two years, Kansas City has received $42,000 from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of a little-noticed agreement between the city and the federal immigration agency.

The agreement, revealed in federal government spending records reviewed by The Star, runs from September 2024 to May 2026. The payments, which have been obligated, allow the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE access to a multi-agency law enforcement radio network known as the Metropolitan Area Regional Radio System (MARRS), according to a city spokesperson.

Multiple city officials, including Mayor Quinton Lucas, said they were unaware of the payments until contacted by The Star this week. The full scope of the city’s financial relationship with ICE remains unclear and The Star has requested a copy of any formal agreements.

Centralized communications systems are common among local, state and federal law enforcement agencies and Lucas downplayed the agreement when informed about it. The mayor pointed to its low dollar amount, the fact that it began under the Biden administration and that it appeared to solely deal with radio communications.

“(The) agreement appears not to be born out of recent efforts toward mass warehousing of persons or recent efforts challenged in federal courts to apprehend persons without due process,” Lucas said in an email to The Star.

Revelations about the agreement have sparked concern from at least one law enforcement accountability advocate. A series of high-profile arrests and rumors of a potential detention facility have thrust Kansas City into a national fight over the Trump administration’s sweeping crackdown on American cities.

However, there is no evidence that the city’s little-known agreement is connected to reports of a planned immigration detention facility in south Kansas City.

Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, said Kansas City and other cities should review all potential agreements with ICE and consider canceling those contracts if city leaders are opposed to the Trump administration’s immigration efforts.

“To the extent they want to, you know, publicly say that they’re opposed to the brutality that we’re seeing with ICE and potentially allowing members of their community to be targeted by ICE,” Bonds said, “There shouldn’t be a contract in place like this.”

Two Kansas City Councilmembers, Johnathan Duncan and Wes Rogers, said they were also unaware of the agreement until contacted by The Star. Duncan said he would look into it. Rogers said the agreement was concerning, but that he needed to know more about it.

“It’s OK to have secure borders and have homeland security agents here,” Rogers said. “It’s not de facto bad. I just want to know more about it.”

City spokesperson Sherae Honeycutt, in a series of emails to The Star, said the payments allow ICE and DHS to use 111 active radios on the MARRS system. DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection use the system, but DHS is the only federal agency billed directly by the city.

Both federal agencies have “dedicated talk groups” on the radio system, allowing them to communicate with regional partners, Honeycutt said.

“DHS coordinates with local law enforcement as needed; the system enables communication during joint operations or incidents, but it is not a surveillance or data-sharing platform,” Honeycutt said.

The joint radio system is facilitated by Mid-America Regional Council (MARC), but governed by the MARRS Management Council, Honeycutt said.

Eric Winebrenner, MARC’s public safety communications program director, in a statement to The Star, listed nine cities and counties that are part of the MARRS system.

Those members, which include Kansas City, determine what other agencies are allowed on the system. Agreements are then brought to the MARRS Management Council for approval. Winebrenner did not immediately have information detailing how long DHS and ICE have been part of the system.

When asked what ICE and DHS would use the system for, Winebrenner said public safety agencies use it for dispatch and communications between first responders.

While centralized law enforcement communications are common and Lucas and city officials have downplayed the payment, Kansas City’s agreement was also the focus of a recent report that highlighted the immigration agency’s sprawling network of partners.

Sludge, a news outlet that focuses on money in politics, included a portion of Kansas City’s agreement with ICE in an interactive map that showed every company or agency that either entered into a new contract with ICE or was awarded new obligations under the Trump administration.

The news outlet’s report focused on $25,601 that was obligated as part of the agreement on Sept. 29. That portion, which is mentioned in federal records available online, states that the payment was for access to a communication system for law enforcement personnel.

For Bonds, the law enforcement accountability advocate, one of the major concerns about the agreement is a lack of control over how much information is shared between agencies.

“Even if you aren’t intentionally trying to share information with ICE, with DHS, you don’t really have a lot of control over who sees it and who uses it if you decide to participate in something like this,” Bonds said.",https://www.kansascity.com/public/latest-news/qqzb1b/picture275902766/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/KCM_KCSkylineBuildings_0331%20(3),N,,2026-01-22 11:38:53.162725

What to know today...

SPECIAL COUNSEL HEARING: Former special counsel Jack Smith is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee about his investigations into President Donald Trump. Smith previously told a congressional committee that his team found “proof beyond a reasonable doubt” that the president engaged in a ""criminal scheme"" to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

OPENING REMARKS: House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, criticized Smith and the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which was related to an investigation into the alleged mishandling classified documents. Ranking Judiciary member, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., defended Smith in his opening remarks and acknowledged that there is information he cannot speak about during the hearing, pointing to a decision from Judge Aileen Cannon.

BOARD OF PEACE LAUNCH: Trump launched his Board of Peace at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland. Major allies did not join the body for resolving global conflicts, and it's unclear if any countries have agreed to pay the $1 billion price tag for permanent membership.

GREENLAND DEAL ‘FRAMEWORK’: Trump scrapped planned tariffs on European nations, saying he agreed to the “framework of a future deal” on Greenland with the head of NATO. The president had gone to Davos seeking a deal that would hand the U.S. more control over the semi-autonomous Danish territory's security, but talks are preliminary.

Jordan berates Smith over Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony about Trump's Jan. 6 actions

Jordan berated Smith in his line of questioning over the testimony that Cassidy Hutchinson provided to the former House select committee that investigated Jan. 6 about Trump's actions in the motorcade that day.

""Everybody knows she wasn't telling the truth,"" Jordan said.

Asked if federal prosecutors were planning to call Hutchinson to the stand if their case against Trump had made it to trial, Smith said they had not finalized their witness list before the case was dismissed.

Jordan said ""the left and Democrats"" were willing to put her on the stand despite her story being told second hand or not confirmed by other witnesses. Jordan claimed everyone knew that Hutchinson was ""making it up.""

Hutchinson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Republican chairman was referring to Hutchinson's 2022 bombshell public testimony to Congress in which she shared what she said she was told by the White House deputy chief of staff for operations, Tony Ornato, and Secret Service agent Bobby Engel on Jan. 6.

After Trump's speech at the Ellipse that morning, Hutchinson said that she was told by Ornato that Trump grew livid when his security told him his motorcade was heading to the White House rather than the Capitol after the rally. Engel was inside Trump's vehicle with him when this happened.

“I am the f---ing president. Take me up to the Capitol now,” Hutchinson recounted to lawmakers, relaying what she was told.

Trump made a grab for the steering wheel from the back seat, wrestled with one of the bodyguards for control of the car and ultimately grabbed the bodyguard’s throat, Hutchinson said.

After her testimony, a source close to Ornato told NBC News that he was willing to testify under oath disputing that account, while a source close to the Secret Service separately told NBC News that Engel was also willing to do the same.

Vance says he’ll try to calm tensions in Minneapolis — while still criticizing officials and protesters there

Vice President JD Vance, previewing a trip to Minneapolis later today to meet with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and members of a community awash in tension, said he will aim to “turn down the chaos” and project calm.

He also used coarse language to reinforce Trump’s position that Democrats there are impeding ICE operations and have created an environment that breeds unruly protests.

“If you disagree … fine, make that argument,” Vance said in response to a question from a reporter during an event here to promote the White House’s economic policies. “But make that argument at the ballot box. Write an op-ed in the newspaper, argue about it on social media. Don’t go to the streets and start assaulting federal law enforcement officers because you disagree with the policies of our administration. It’s cowardly bulls---, and it’s got to stop.”

The remarks came hours before Vance was expected to hold a roundtable discussion and deliver a speech in Minneapolis, where a federal officer this month fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, 37, during a confrontation. Trump, Vance and other administration officials have, without offering conclusive evidence, said that Good was connected to left-wing protesters and that she was a threat to officers as they approached her car and she began to drive.

Smith says attacks on DOJ were 'unjustified'

Asked by Raskin for his response to the ""attack"" on the Justice Department and Smith's team for ""doing your jobs,"" the former special counsel answered that it was ""unjustified.""

Raskin had referred to how Republicans are responding to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Many Republicans have sought to cast rioters as peaceful protesters, and Trump pardoned people convicted of crimes related to the attack. Since then, many Republicans have criticized the Justice Department's handling of Jan. 6-related cases, in addition to Smith's investigations into Trump.

""I think the attack is unjustified,"" Smith said. ""I think the people who worked with me as career public servants are people — they're part of the reason I've been a prosecutor for so long, is to work with people like that.""

Smith added that the ""attacks are unwarranted based on the facts and I think that they have no basis in who we are as Americans."" He added that he did not believe the attacks were ""appropriate.""

Smith says he stands by his decisions to bring criminal charges against Trump

In his opening statement, Smith defended his decision as special counsel to indict Trump in two separate federal criminal cases.

“As I testify before the committee today, I want to be clear I stand by my decisions as special counsel, including the decision to bring charges against President Trump. Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in criminal activity,"" Smith said.

He said if he were asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, he would do so regardless of whether the president was a Democrat or a Republican.

""No one should be above the law in this country, and the law required that he be held to account. So that is what I did,"" Smith said.

Raskin defends Smith and the 'four American heroes' who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6

Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, began his opening statement by recognizing ""four American heroes"" who defended the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.

The four officers were in the hearing room: Michael Fanone, Aquilino Gonell, Daniel Hodges and Harry Dunn.

Raskin also defended Smith and his investigations in light of Trump saying Smith belongs in prison.

""He says you belong in prison not because you did anything wrong, mind you, but because you did everything right,"" Raskin said. ""You pursued the facts, you followed the law, you stuck with extreme caution, to every rule of professional responsibility. You had the audacity to do your job.""

He continued, ""Everybody here knows what you did wrong in Donald Trump’s eyes,"" saying that Smith ""found proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.""

Raskin said he knows there's still a lot of information Smith can't talk about because of a gag order. He said that Smith ""developed what he calls powerful evidence that Trump stole documents containing our country's most sensitive secrets, hoarded them in the ballrooms and the bathrooms of his well-trafficked Mar-a-Lago social club.""

House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan argues Smith's actions were motivated by politics

House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, predicted there would be “yelling and screaming” from Democrats, and said people should “never forget” what Democrats did to Trump, referring to investigations into the president.

During his opening remarks, Jordan criticized the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which was related to an investigation into alleged mishandling of classified documents.

Jordan also referenced Judge Aileen Cannon’s decision to dismiss the classified documents case after deciding that Smith’s appointment was unlawful. He went on to accuse Smith of abandoning proper procedure and being motivated by wanting to stop Trump.

“It was always about politics. The good news is, the American people saw through it,” Jordan argued.

Ranking member Jamie Raskin, D-Md., will deliver opening remarks next.

Jack Smith testimony will warn Americans not to take the rule of law ‘for granted’

Former special counsel Jack Smith is set to testify shortly in front of the House Judiciary Committee. He will warn Americans not to take the rule of law for granted in his first public testimony before Congress about the investigations into Trump, according to his prepared statement obtained by NBC News.

“I have seen how the rule of law can erode. My fear is that we have seen the rule of law function in this country for so long that many of us have come to take it for granted,” Smith plans to tell members of the committee.

“But, the rule of law is not self-executing — it depends on our collective commitment to apply it. It requires dedicated service on behalf of others, especially when that service is difficult and comes with costs,” he plans to say. “Our willingness to pay those costs is what tests and defines our commitment to the rule of law and to this wonderful country.”

France says won’t join Peace Board for now, partly contrary to U.N. charter

France will not join Trump’s Board of Peace for now because its charter does not correspond with a United Nations resolution to resolve the war in Gaza, and some of the charter’s elements were contrary to the U.N. charter, its foreign ministry spokesman said Thursday.

“It was not corresponding on the one hand with the pure Gaza mandate, which is not even mentioned, and on the other hand, there are elements of this charter which are contrary to the United Nations charter,” Pascal Confavreux told reporters.

Could Trump's tariffs reversal be a turning point for Europe's dealings with the president?

Trump’s U-turn on hitting eight European countries with tariffs over Greenland could mark a turning point in how the continent deals with the president, a former Obama White House staffer said.

“It was an illustration that when our allies are firm and not accommodating on some of these outrageous demands, that they can actually push him back,” said Brett Bruen, director of global engagement for President Barack Obama.

“I hope that we’re going to see a turning point where Europe and others are finally going to say to Trump, ‘We accommodated you for a year, and we accepted even imbalanced trade agreements so that you could claim a win and a prize, but now you’ve gone too far,’” he said.

Having ramped up his threats to his own allies, Trump said yesterday he would not use force to seize Greenland and dropped tariffs set to hit eight NATO members.

“In the history of diplomacy, we have not seen such a rapid about-face, which just speaks to how strategically stupid this move was,” Bruen added. He said the response to Trump’s hostility, not just from world leaders but CEOs and the bond market, was like “a bucket of cold water that got dumped on him from the Swiss Alps.”

Jamie Dimon on Trump's immigration policies: 'I don't like what I'm seeing'

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been a strong supporter of Trump’s border policies, criticized his immigration crackdown in a rare public rebuke by a U.S. corporate leader.

“I’m still angry at the Biden administration for what they allowed to happen, OK? And I think it severely damaged our country,” Dimon said yesterday at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “And then they say, ‘Oh, there’s nothing you can do about it.’ No, because Trump comes in — boom, it’s closed. God bless them.”

Dimon said that when Trump was elected president, he told him, “When you get the borders controlled, fix the rest of it,” including protecting recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and other “merit-based” cases, and that Trump said, “Absolutely.”

Dimon said he had yet to see much evidence of that, aside from “a little bit in the merit side.”

“Of course, I don’t like what I’m seeing, you know, with five grown men beating up little women,” he said, referring to ICE operations. “So I think, we should calm down a little bit on the internal anger about immigration.”

Japanese exports to the U.S. fall for the first time in 5 years under Trump's tariffs

Japanese exports to the U.S. fell last year for the first time in five years, government figures showed, largely because of Trump’s tariffs on the U.S. ally’s automobiles.

Exports to the U.S. dropped 4.1% by value to 20.4 trillion yen ($129 billion), according to preliminary results from the Japanese Finance Ministry, the first decrease since the Covid pandemic in 2020. Shipments of vehicles, Japan’s biggest export, were down 11.4%, while auto parts were down 10.7%.

The Trump administration has imposed a 15% tariff on Japanese auto imports, down from 25% earlier last year.

Japanese imports from the U.S. increased for the second consecutive year, up 1.6% to 12.9 trillion yen ($81.3 billion). Japan’s trade surplus with the U.S. fell for the second year in a row to 7.5 trillion yen ($47.3 billion), down 12.6%.

British PM skips Davos to host Danish counterpart

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomes Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to Chequers, the official countryside residence outside London today. The Danish leader is in the United Kingdom to discuss Trump's demand to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of the kingdom of Denmark.

Trump says meeting with Zelenskyy was 'very good'

Following his one-on-one with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines in Davos, Trump told reporters the meeting was ""very good.""

""Everybody wants to have the war ended,"" Trump added. He said earlier today that a deal on ending the war in Ukraine is ""getting close.""

His envoy Steve Wiktoff will be heading to Moscow later today for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Zelenskyy also called the meeting ""productive and substantive"" in a post on X, signaling that peace deal documents were now ""even better prepared.""

E.U. lawmakers to revisit U.S. trade deal Monday after Trump backs off tariff threat

A top European Union lawmaker says parliamentarians will revisit the E.U.'s trade deal with the U.S. on Monday after Trump backed off his threat to impose new tariffs on European nations.

Yesterday, the European Parliament's trade committee halted the implementation and approval of the trade deal amid rising rhetoric from the Trump administration on Greenland. The deal would reduce tariffs for importers and consumers in both regions.

""Hardly any details are known yet about the proposed Greenland deal,"" European Parliament member Bernd Lange said on X. ""But we need them in order to decide how to proceed with the implementation of the EU-US trade deal.""

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick commented shortly after Lange's post, writing that ""we remain committed to implementing the U.S.-EU trade agreement and will always value our deep ties with our friends in Europe.""

Leaders of the 27 E.U. countries will meet today in Brussels for an emergency summit to discuss the latest developments related to Trump's efforts to exert control over Greenland.

Belgium says it did not join Board of Peace after being included by the White House

The deputy prime minister of Belgium has corrected the list released by the White House to the media of the more than 20 nations that it said signed the charter of the newly inaugurated Board of Peace this morning in Davos.

“Belgium has NOT signed the Charter of the Board of Peace. This announcement is incorrect,” Belgian Deputy Prime Minister Maxime Prévot said on X. “We wish for a common and coordinated European response. As many European countries, we have reservations to the proposal.”

The original list circulated by the White House included Belgium, alongside Bahrain, Morocco, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan.

A source familiar with the matter told NBC News that Belgium originally signed on to joining the Board, but backed out at the last minute. NBC News has not confirmed this with Belgian officials.

Many Western European nations allied with Washington have voiced their reservations about joining the Board out of concerns that it could replace the United Nations and over the invitations being extended to regimes such as Russia and Belarus.

Trump claims the U.S. will have 'total access' to Greenland in new deal

Trump said in an interview on Fox Business this morning that the U.S. will have ""total access"" to Greenland under a framework of an agreement he announced after a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

“Essentially, it’s total access,"" Trump told anchor Maria Bartiromo on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""There’s no end, there’s no time limit.”

“I’m not gonna have to pay anything,"" Trump added. ""We’re gonna have total access to Greenland. We’re gonna have all military access that we want. We’re going to be able to put what we need on Greenland because we want it. We’re talking about national security and international security.”

Negotiations on a deal are preliminary and it's unclear what a final agreement will entail. The U.S. already has a military base in Greenland and has wide leeway to establish more military installations on the semi-autonomous Danish territory.

Trump also noted in the interview that ""a piece"" of the Golden Dome missile defense system will be located on Greenland.

""If the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,"" he said. ""So we knock it down.""

Zelenskyy meeting with Trump now

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with Trump in Davos, his office has confirmed, after the U.S. president said an end to the war with Russia was ""getting close.""

Zelenskyy arrived in Davos this morning. He had said he would not attend unless agreements on security guarantees and post-war reconstruction funding could be signed with the U.S. He also said he had wanted to remain in Kyiv to focus on the energy crisis in Ukraine.

Zelenskyy lamented earlier this week that the world's attention had switched away from Ukraine to Trump's threats over Greenland and the future of NATO, but the U.S. is signaling it wants to push forward with talks again.

Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff will be going to Moscow later today to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

U.S. outlines plan for Gaza with slides and maps, tells critics to 'calm down'

After the signing ceremony earlier, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner presented the U.S. vision for Gaza's future, complete with a slide presentation and maps that resembled a real estate plan.

It features a timeline for the redevelopment of Gaza, which Trump said was a ""great location,"" citing his real estate experience. The Palestinian enclave was largely reduced to rubble by Israel's military campaign.

Kushner said the focus has to be on security plans to encourage investment in the Palestinian enclave, which has to start with Hamas' demilitarization, as well as plans for transitional governance and redevelopment of Gaza, which he said had ""amazing potential.""

But he also urged critics to ""calm down"" and ""turn a new chapter.""

""If we believe that peace is possible, then peace really can be possible,"" he added.

Musk to speak at Davos in newly scheduled session

Tech billionaire Elon Musk is set to speak at Davos on Thursday in a newly scheduled session.

The World Economic Forum, which Musk previously criticized, confirmed it will be the Tesla owner’s first time attending the elite event in the Swiss Alps.

His address is billed as a conversation with Laurence Fink, BlackRock’s CEO and interim co-chair of the forum.

Musk is embroiled in a war of words with Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary that began with a dispute over installing Starlink systems on Ryanair planes. Yesterday, O’Leary dismissed the tech titan’s suggestion he would buy the budget airline.

Trump sought Greenland deal that would hand U.S. more control over security

Despite his escalated rhetoric about acquiring Greenland, including potentially by military force, Trump arrived in Davos looking to negotiate a deal that would give the U.S. more control over security there and in the broader Arctic region, a congressional official and two former U.S. officials told NBC News.

Trump has mentioned possibly adding U.S. troops and more military bases in Greenland, particularly with respect to supporting the Golden Dome missile defense system, the two former U.S. officials said.

Trump went into his meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte with the expectation that he would announce a broad framework of a deal on Greenland, the congressional official and one of the former U.S. officials said. Negotiations on a deal are preliminary, with Trump describing it as a “framework,” and it’s not clear the president will secure a final agreement or what that would entail.

Witkoff and Kushner appear ahead of Russia-Ukraine talks

Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner took to the stage after the signing ceremony to talk to about progress in implementing Trump's peace plan in Gaza.

It will be a long day for Witkoff, who will head to Moscow later today to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin about a deal to end the war in Ukraine.

Witkoff said earlier today that ""a lot of progress"" had been made and the negotiations were ""down to one issue.""

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Davos this morning for talks with Trump. Zelenskyy earlier said he would not be attending unless he could sign agreements with Trump on security guarantees and post-war reconstruction funding.

Trump thanks attendees in concluding remarks

Trump is called to the podium for closing remarks.

""I just wanted to tell you, it's all happening,"" he said, as he thanked those who made the Board of Peace happen. ""It's a big one, but it's very doable,"" he added.

Rubio vows other countries will join despite allies’ reservations

Rubio thanked the world leaders on the stage who just signed the charter of the Board of Peace, but vowed that those who might have reservations will ultimately join in.

""Others will join,"" Rubio said. ""Many want to be a part of this effort, because it is going to be a successful effort,"" he added. He downplayed some countries' reservations, saying that many just needed to get domestic approval before joining.

No major Western allies were among the signatories today, with some voicing concerns about the possibility of the board replacing the United Nations, and invites for countries such as Russia and Belarus.

Rubio says Board of Peace ushers in new era of 'action'

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking after the signing ceremony, said the newly inaugurated Board of Peace is about ""action"" and not just ""strongly-worded statements"" the world is used to from global leaders.

""We often find ourselves at events where people are reading these scripted statements, these strongly worded letters that they put out, but no action. Nothing happens,"" Rubio said.

He added: ""This is a group of leaders that are about action, and the president of the United States is a president of action, of getting things done. And today is the beginning of that, of a new era and a new stage that we think is so important as a model to the rest of the world of what is possible.""

Trump finishes speaking, signs Board of Peace charter

Trump has finished speaking and is leading a signing ceremony for the Board of Peace charter.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt proclaimed: ""The charter is now in full force, and the board of peace is now an official international organization.""

She is now calling the world leaders on the stage to come up in pairs to sign the charter.

Trump vows to work with U.N., says Board of Peace could be 'one of the most consequential bodies ever'

Signaling broad ambitions, Trump says his Board of Peace ""has the chance to be one of the most consequential bodies ever created,"" adding that it was an ""enormous honor"" to serve as its chairman.

Initially envisioned as part of his plan for peace in Gaza, the body's charter views it as a way to resolve global conflicts. That has raised fears among allies that Trump intends to replace the United Nations with a body chaired by him.

But Trump said his board would work alongside the U.N., which he said has ""got tremendous potential."" The two bodies together ""can be something very, very unique for the world,” he said.

Trump: Iran wants to talk and we'll talk

In his opening speech, Trump says Iran was ""two months away from having a nuclear weapon"" before a U.S. bombing campaign last June.

""Can’t let that happen, and Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk,"" he added.

It comes after Trump's threats to retaliate against Tehran over its crackdown on mass protests earlier this month.

Trump runs through conflicts he says he settled

In his opening speech, Trump is touting his peacemaking credentials.

The president is going over a number of global conflicts he claims to have settled, including the war in Gaza, the conflict between Cambodia and Thailand, Pakistan-India and Armenia-Azerbaijan. He also mentioned tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia among others.

Some surprise world leaders join Trump on stage, but no major Western allies

Trump is joined on stage by a number of world leaders who have agreed to join the Board of Peace.

They feature a few surprises, including the leaders of Bulgaria and Mongolia, who had not publicly accepted an invite. But no major Western allies are there, and the number of attendees is lower than the U.S. had suggested.

Those present, according to the White House, are: Bahrain, Morocco, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE, Uzbekistan

Signing ceremony for Trump's Board of Peace begins

Trump is appearing now at a ceremony launching his Board of Peace in Davos.

Trump is joined on stage by a hostof world leaders for the signing of the board's charter.

Some 35 countries have agreed to sign on to the project, a senior State Department official told reporters, with more than 50 nations invited to join.

What we know about Trump's Board of Peace

The Board of Peace was first proposed by Trump as an entity that would oversee the next phase of his peace plan for the Gaza Strip, but has since morphed into something with a much broader remit.

The proposed charter for the board, as confirmed by NBC News, makes no direct mention of Gaza and proposes a broad mandate for a new international organization that “seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.”

Trump has suggested his Board of Peace ""might"" replace the United Nations, but that has raised concerns among some key allies.

The charter states that Trump will chair the board and can only be replaced as chairman through “voluntary resignation or as a result of incapacity, as determined by a unanimous vote of the Executive Board.”

It also states that each member state “shall serve a term of no more than three years,” with an exception for those “that contribute more than"" $1 billion.

Among the founding executive board members are Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and World Bank President Ajay Banga.

NATO’s Rutte says he had ‘very good discussion’ with Trump on how to keep Arctic safe

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in Davos this morning he had a ""very good discussion"" with Trump after the U.S. president announced they had agreed to a ""framework of a future deal"" on Greenland yesterday.

Rutte said the discussion involved talking about how all the Arctic nations, including the U.S., can ""collectively make sure that the Arctic stays safe, that the Russians and the Chinese stay out.""

Echoing Trump's consistent argument about the alleged danger to Greenland coming from Beijing and Moscow, Rutte said it was important that ""the Chinese and the Russians will not gain access to the Greenland economy, militarily to Greenland, and that will be a discussion taken forward.""

U.K. says it will not join Trump's Board of Peace today

Britain will not be signing Trump's Board of Peace charter in Davos today despite being invited, foreign minister Yvette Cooper said, citing concerns about Russia's involvement.

“We won’t be one of the signatories today, because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace when we still haven’t seen any signs from Putin there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine,” Cooper told BBC News.

Another key U.S. ally, France, has indicated it will not join as have Sweden, Norway, and Slovenia. Italy said it needed more time.

In another interview with the BBC, Cooper shared further details on the ""Arctic sentry"" discussed as part of the deal framework that Trump announced yesterday on Greenland, saying it would be a combined operation program that draws NATO countries together to work on a ""shared threat.""

NATO says it did not promise any compromise to sovereignty in Trump meeting

NATO has said this morning that Secretary General Mark Rutte did not propose any compromise on Greenland's sovereignty in his meeting with Trump.

Trump’s announcement of a ""framework"" for a future deal came hours after the possibility of the United States obtaining sovereignty over land for military bases was discussed during separate meetings in Brussels among top military officers from NATO member states, the New York Times reported, citing three senior Western officials familiar with the talks.

Asked about the reporting by NBC News, NATO Spokesperson Allison Hart stressed that Rutte did not propose any compromise to sovereignty during his meeting with Trump in Davos on Wednesday.

Danish PM says she won’t negotiate on nation's sovereignty

Denmark's leader warned this morning that she will not negotiate on her country's sovereignty, after Trump announced yesterday that he had agreed to the “framework of a future deal"" on Greenland.

Trump said it came after a very productive meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte. There were no details provided on what the deal would actually entail.

""Security in the Arctic is a matter for the entire NATO alliance,"" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement. ""Therefore, it is good and natural that it is also discussed between the NATO Secretary General and the President of the United States. The Kingdom of Denmark has long worked for NATO to increase its engagement in the Arctic.""

But she said NATO was fully aware of her position. ""We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy,"" Frederiksen said. ""But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty. I have been informed that this has not been the case either. And of course only Denmark and Greenland themselves can make decisions on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.""

Doubting U.S. resolve, Europe looks to bolster its own nuclear arsenal

Questioning America’s decades-long commitment to guard them against a nuclear-armed Russia, European nations are looking at ways to bolster their own arsenals rather than continue to rely on the U.S., according to six senior European officials.

European leaders are discussing whether to rely more on nuclear-armed France and Britain instead of the U.S. or even develop their own atomic weapons, three of the senior European officials said. The discussions have taken on a new urgency in recent weeks as Trump demands the U.S. acquire Greenland, these officials said.

Greenland is ‘not just a block of ice,’ residents say

Trump’s renewed demands for Denmark to hand over Greenland have received an icy response from locals on the remote Arctic island, usually far removed from world affairs.

There was a chill in the air in Greenland‘s capital, Nuuk, thousands of miles away from Trump's speech and meeting with world leaders.

“It’s crazy. Totally crazy,” Peter Jensen, an office supply store’s owner in Nuuk, said before Trump’s speech. “But many are scared.”

Tillie Martinussen, a former member of Greenland’s parliament, was incensed by Trump’s remarks. “We’re not just a block of ice,” she said in an interview on Wednesday. “We are human beings. We have elderly people here who are so afraid right now. We have children that are afraid of the United States.”

Trump pauses tariffs on European powers, saying ‘framework’ of Greenland deal agreed

Trump said he is dropping his threat to slap new tariffs on European nations in a fresh sign that he is prepared to reach a peaceful settlement to a tense standoff over the future of Greenland.

Trump announced on social media that after a private meeting with NATO’s secretary general in Davos, Switzerland, he agreed to the “framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region.”

Trump gave no details, nor did he say he was abandoning his effort to wrest control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. Earlier, Trump gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in which he said that the U.S. needs to absorb Greenland for global security reasons and that European countries need to meet the demand.

Deploying paramilitary forces with police powers, a military mentality and an aggressive mindset without proper training and oversight leads to the abuses of power witnessed in Minneapolis.
Dictatorships, on the other hand, rely heavily on paramilitary forces that are answerable only to the regime.","Democratic societies need soldiers and police. When they combine the two into a single body, tragedies like the Minnesota shooting are inevitable.

Forty years of studying internal security operations around the world have taught me that units empowered as police but armed like soldiers will lack the discipline of either. The behavior of federal agents conducting the administration’s immigration crackdown clearly demonstrates the danger they pose.

Soldiers operate under “rules of engagement,” guidelines defining the circumstances in which they can use lethal force. In wartime, those guidelines are quite permissive, but even then there are still restrictions. The “Law of War,” a set of agreed upon international principles accepted by most militaries, forbids (for example) the intentional killing of non-combatants and the abuse of prisoners.

Armed forces around the world abide by these laws — not merely on moral grounds, but to make sure their own troops and civilians receive fair treatment. The outrage over the killing of two men clinging to a burning boat by U.S. forces in September illustrates the wide regard in which these principles are held.

Because of their professional ethos, soldiers in democratic societies assiduously avoid internal security operations. When troops have been deployed in that role — which occurred in Northern Ireland during the Troubles (1969 to 1998) — problems invariably arise. The Jan. 30, 1972 “Bloody Sunday” massacre of demonstrators in Londonderry by members of the Parachute Regiment still haunts the British Army.

Police operate under far more restrictive rules of engagement than soldiers. According to Department of Justice guidelines, officers may only use deadly force when “the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.” The rules explicitly forbid use of lethal force “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.”

Whereas soldiers and police have a clear understanding of their rules of engagement, the same cannot be said of hybrid paramilitary forces. The behavior of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement illustrates the problem.

Even before the Trump administration’s massive roundup of illegal immigrants, the Border Patrol had been accused of using excessive force. Since 2010, the force has killed 362 people. Equipped with military grade weapons and body armor, members of this paramilitary force often behave like soldiers, even though they are technically police.

Before Trump took office last January, the Border Patrol confined its operations primarily to the southern border. Now it operates in U.S. cities alongside ICE agents, who are also heavily armed.

In addition to deploying Customs and Border Protection agents more extensively, Trump has given them freer rein. He has lifted restrictions on immigration raids in “sensitive” areas such as schools, churches and hospitals. In September, the Supreme Court upheld the power of Customs and Border Patrol and ICE to apprehend people based on their language, location and appearance — what many experts call “racial profiling.”

Although operating under law enforcement rules of engagement, agents show up in body armor and carrying assault weapons and behave more like soldiers than police.

The rapid expansion of ICE and its recruitment methods have led to concerns over vetting and training. Cash incentives and an appeal to rid the country of undocumented immigrants, described in dehumanizing terms, may be drawing recruits with a vigilante mentality. Pressure to deploy more agents as fast as possible makes it difficult to train them properly.

To make matters worse, under Secretary Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security has created a permissive institutional culture in which its agencies feel empowered to use violence with little fear of accountability. Their officers and agents wear masks and do not show identification or warrants.

Noem’s response to the Minneapolis shooting illustrates her permissive attitude. Before an investigation had even occurred, she defended the shooting of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, portraying Good as a “domestic terrorist.” The FBI has taken over the investigation and is excluding Minnesota officials, even though murder is a state crime over which local authorities have jurisdiction.

Deploying paramilitary forces with police powers, a military mentality and an aggressive mindset without proper training and oversight leads to the abuses of power witnessed in Minneapolis. Since the death of Good, two more people have been shot (not fatally) by a federal agent in Portland, Oregon. More tragedies are bound to occur.

As a military historian who focuses on violent extremism, I have examined internal conflicts throughout history and across the world to learn how distinct types of government respond to threats. Democracies rely on disciplined police. They rarely deploy troops inside their countries but, when they do, employ them in an extremely limited role, such as riot-control.

Dictatorships, on the other hand, rely heavily on paramilitary forces that are answerable only to the regime.

Typically, administrative warrants authorize immigration arrests but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes without consent.
If people inside are then given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully,” but do not open the door, the memo says the officers can enter with force.
For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” she added.
The whistleblower disclosure, dated earlier this month, comes amid escalating tensions in cities across the country over the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers are asserting broad authority to enter people’s homes without first obtaining a warrant from a judge, according to an internal memo.

The memo signed by the acting ICE director Todd Lyons, and obtained by The Associated Press, authorizes immigration officers to forcibly enter someone’s home and arrest immigrants using just a signed administrative warrant, known as an I-205, if they have a final order of removal issued by a judge.

Typically, administrative warrants authorize immigration arrests but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes without consent. Traditionally, only warrants signed by judges carry that authority. But the memo says the department has come to a different conclusion, the AP reported.

“Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose,” the memo reads.

It also instructs officers first to knock on the door and identify themselves and the reason for their visit. If people inside are then given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully,” but do not open the door, the memo says the officers can enter with force.

“Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent’s authority and intent to enter,” the document reads.

The memo was issued last May and has only been shared with “select DHS officials,” according to a whistleblower disclosure obtained by the AP.

But the contents of the directive have been used to train ICE officers who have been deployed to cities during the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, according to the document, which claims immigration enforcement officers undergoing training are instructed to follow the memo, even though it contradicts the agency’s written training materials.

The news wire obtained the whistleblower disclosure from an unnamed member of Congress and said it verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.

The nonprofit legal organization, Whistleblower Aid, filed a complaint, saying it represents two government officials “disclosing a secretive — and seemingly unconstitutional — policy directive.”

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stood by the reasoning provided in the internal memo, saying in a statement to The Hill, “Every illegal alien who DHS serves administrative warrants/I-205s have had full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.”

“The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause. For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” she added.

The whistleblower disclosure, dated earlier this month, comes amid escalating tensions in cities across the country over the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement.

In Minnesota, protests have at times turned violent, as demonstrators have chucked rocks and fireworks at law enforcement, who have responded with tear gas and force. Two officer-involved shootings, including one that was fatal, have also further inflamed tensions.

The decision to put the spotlight on the US for Thursday’s “International Day of the Endangered Lawyer” underlines how rapidly America has plummeted in global esteem. For decades the US has been held up as a role model of a democratic judicial system.

Now, just a year into Donald Trump’s renewed presidency, it is widely seen around the world as a state in which lawyers and judges are attacked just for doing their jobs.

The “endangered lawyer” epithet brings the US into the company of dictatorships and autocracies that have been previous holders of the title. Last year’s focus was Belarus, while other highlighted states since 2010 when the annual event was created include Afghanistan, Iran and China.

The US was selected through a vote of more than 40 bar associations and lawyer organisations globally. A report released by the coalition on Thursday explained the decision by saying that members were alarmed by the Trump administration’s “sustained and co-ordinated campaign aimed at undermining the independence of the legal profession and the judiciary”.

It added that the past 12 months displayed a “troubling pattern of political intimidation and institutional destabilization unprecedented in the modern history of the US”.

Symone Gaasbeek, a co-founder of the coalition, said that it was surprising to find a country normally lauded for its commitment to democracy and justice added to the list of largely authoritarian countries. Speaking to the Guardian from the Netherlands, she said that “we look at the facts, we don’t deal in labels”.

Led by the facts, she said, “you see a systematic attack on the legal profession in the US. As the past year has progressed, those attacks have intensified – it has become more and more clear that the government is trying to control the legal profession and that the rule of law is threatened.”

One of the influences behind the coalition’s decision was the work of the UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Margaret Satterthwaite. She acts as an independent monitor of the treatment of legal professionals around the world.

Over the past year Satterthwaite has raised mounting concerns about the actions of the Trump administration. She has sent two official letters to top US diplomats and the US state department objecting to the abusive treatment of American lawyers.

The first letter, sent a month after Trump’s inauguration, objected to the dismissal of scores of career lawyers from the Department of Justice. The firings were in apparent retaliation for their participation in earlier prosecutions against Trump over the January 6 insurrection and other alleged crimes.

The second letter, dated 6 May 2025, addressed the attacks emanating from Trump and his inner circle against judges who had ruled against the administration. Those assaults included Trump’s call for the impeachment of James Boasberg, chief judge of the US district court in Washington DC, after Boasberg blocked the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

The president called the judge a “radical left lunatic” and a “troublemaker”.

Satterthwaite told the Guardian that presidents were entitled to publicly disagree with court rulings. But, she said, “this kind of smearing is completely inappropriate”.

The UN rapporteur said that in other countries such verbal assaults had incited violence against judges. She pointed to the Philippines under the former strongman president Rodrigo Duterte.

In the US, scores of federal judges have endured a wave of violent threats in the wake of Trump’s rhetorical attacks. Several have been intimidated by anonymous pizza deliveries to their homes.

Satterthwaite said the ominous pizza deliveries were a “horribly good example” of the dangers of vilifying judges. “Attacking lawyers and judges for their work is a hallmark authoritarian move,” the UN monitor said.

She added that the administration had so far failed to reply to either of her official letters.

Tension between the executive branch and the judiciary has been a feature of both Trump’s presidencies. In his first term, the administration was partly frustrated in its policy ambitions in areas such as immigration and law enforcement by hundreds of lawsuits pursued in federal courts.

That confrontation has only intensified in the second term. A litigation tracker curated by the Just Security website is currently following 585 legal cases involving the administration.

As the clash continues, some of the territory has shifted to Trump’s advantage. He has benefited from largely favorable temporary rulings from the US supreme court, facilitated by Trump’s own three appointments to the top bench which sealed its hard-right majority.

Trump’s aggressive approach to filling seats on federal courts during his first term is also paying dividends in the appeals courts. A recent New York Times analysis found that the 54 appellate judges picked by Trump during his first four years in the White House have sided with the administration in an overwhelming 92% of recent cases.

Federal courts continue, though, to act as a last bastion against Trump’s anti-democratic onslaught. The newly released Endangered Lawyers report chronicles the many different ways that the president has stepped up his attack on lawyers and judges.

He has unleashed a raft of executive orders targeting specific law firms considered to be acting on behalf of Trump’s enemies or opponents. Firms such as Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block were threatened with the removal of all federal contracts, scrapping security clearances for their lawyers and barring them from entering federal facilities.

The UN rapporteur said that such an attack on private law firms was unprecedented and dangerous. “Lawyers are meant to represent their clients without them being seen as aligned with those clients. There’s a reason for that: so that everyone has access to a lawyer.”

The endangered lawyer coalition warns that there is a “chilling effect” on legal advocacy. Law firms and individual lawyers who represent marginalised clients in cases involving immigration, LGBTQ rights or Palestinian activism are finding themselves under intensified scrutiny.

At the same time, prosecutors are under growing pressure to conform to the political agenda of the White House. The 50-year norm that has shielded the justice department from presidential interference, dating back to Watergate days, has been shattered by Trump.

As an example of the weaponisation of the justice department, federal prosecutors stepped up their investigation of leading Democratic officials in Minnesota on Tuesday amid the ongoing immigration tussle with ICE. The governor, Tim Walz, Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, and several other top state Democrats were served subpoenas in what Frey said was a “crackdown on local voices” of opposition.

Trump has also expanded his war against lawyers beyond US borders. He has used executive orders to impose sanctions on 11 judges on the international criminal court at The Hague.

The president said the moves were in response to the court’s investigations into US military conduct in Afghanistan and the Israeli war in Gaza.

Vânia Costa Ramos, president of the European Criminal Bar Association that is a member of the coalition, said she feared the sanctions would put a chill on lawyers working with the ICC. She said that it was critical for people in the US and around the world to resist the intimidation.

“If lawyers and all citizens don’t stand up and denounce abuses and bring them to daylight, then in a few years we could see the entire US justice system impacted in ways that would be very difficult to reverse.”

Costa Ramos said that a fundamental principle of any democracy was that lawyers should be free to carry out their work. “Whenever there is a climate of threats, sanctions, or bankruptcy it makes lawyers think twice before they even take a case, and that would mark the end of a free legal profession.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1d0dda46f140e18623ffe4de78bbea4da6274d/513_0_5133_4107/master/5133.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a93dc0eda978f18bee2a7b7d2958fb90",N,,2026-01-22 11:39:04.892230

In July 2025, multiple federal agencies announced a reinterpretation of provisions of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), which prohibits “an alien who is not a qualified alien” from accessing “Federal public benefits,” unless an exception applies. The notice issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (the HHS Notice) declares the Health Center Program—which qualifies certain community clinics for federally qualified health center (FQHC) reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare and 340B drug pricing, among other benefits—to be one of thirteen newly identified Federal public benefit programs for which such “not qualified aliens” are not eligible under PRWORA.1

The HHS Notice is not law or regulation, and it has been preliminarily enjoined in some states by a federal district court.2 It may eventually be permanently blocked or narrowed by courts. In the meantime, the HHS Notice raises thorny practical issues for community clinics operating within the Health Center Program (Health Centers). As they evaluate their evolving compliance obligations, Health Centers should consider at least the following unanswered questions:

How does the HHS Notice apply to Health Centers? What in the Health Center Program does HHS now view as a “Federal public benefit”—is it the federal grants awarded to some qualifying community clinics, or does HHS also view ancillary features of Health Center status, such as FQHC reimbursement, to be “Federal public benefits”?

Could Health Centers be required to verify patient eligibility? Does the HHS Notice imply that individual Health Centers need to implement eligibility verification procedures for patients seeking services? Does it matter whether the Health Center is a nonprofit or public entity?

How will HHS enforce eligibility restrictions for the Health Center Program? What are the consequences if a Health Center inappropriately provides a “Federal public benefit” to an alien who is not a “qualified alien”? Can a Health Center provide services for ineligible individuals outside of its federal scope of project?

Following a brief discussion of the HHS Notice and current litigation, this article unpacks each of these critical questions.

How Did HHS Reinterpret “Federal Public Benefit” in its July 14 Notice?

The HHS Notice aims to broaden the prohibition in PRWORA on a non-citizen who is not a “qualified alien” from accessing “any Federal public benefit.”3 Similar notices were released by the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Justice (referred to collectively as the “PRWORA Notices”).4

The PRWORA Notices do not interpret what it means to be an alien who is “not a qualified alien.” Under PRWORA, all non-citizens are subject to the prohibition unless they fall within enumerated categories of “qualified aliens,” including non-citizens who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States, have certain asylum or refugee status, or are lawfully resident in certain U.S. territories.5 Most individuals lawfully present on a temporary basis—such as individuals with a student visa or H-1B, H-2A, or H-2B work visas—are not qualified aliens. Individuals who do not have documentation of their immigration status are also not qualified aliens.

The statutory definition of “Federal public benefit” includes two prongs. Under the grant prong, a Federal public benefit is “any grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”6 Under the benefits prong, a Federal public benefit may also be “any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”7

The HHS Notice broadened the interpretation of “Federal public benefit” under both prongs to include an expanded set of federally funded social, educational, workforce, and emergency services. For example, the HHS Notice concludes that the Health Center Program, as well as federal block grants to states and localities, are Federal public benefits.

What is the Status of the Multi-State Litigation Challenging the PRWORA Notices?

The PRWORA Notices have been challenged in court by a group of 21 states and the District of Columbia.8 Specifically, in State of New York, et al v. U.S. Department of Justice, et al., the plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration that the PRWORA Notices violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution and request the court enjoin defendants from implementing them in the plaintiff states.9 On September 10, 2025, the court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from enforcing or implementing the PRWORA Notices in the plaintiff states during the pendency of the lawsuit. With respect to Health Centers, the court concluded that the Health Center Program statute—which was enacted subsequent to PRWORA and requires Health Centers to provide services for all residents within its catchment area—exempts Health Centers from PRWORA limitations.10 On November 7, 2025, the defendant agencies appealed the court’s September 10 order to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.11 The appellant’s brief is due January 5, 2026.12

While litigation is likely to continue, it is important to note that following the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, courts are not required to afford the same level of deference to agencies such as HHS.13 While the federal administration has tried to argue that Loper Bright supports its reinterpretation, the first court to consider the issue did not share that view.14

How Does the HHS Notice Apply to Health Centers?

While the HHS Notice offers general reasoning for why HHS believes more of its programs are Federal public benefits, it does not address how this conclusion applies to particular programs. HHS has argued in ongoing litigation that it is not obligated to “minutely explain why every individual program listed in the HHS Notice provides Federal public benefits.”15 This reasoning gap is particularly important for the Health Center Program, which includes community clinics that receive federal grants as well as community clinics that meet similar qualifying criteria but do not receive any grant funds (i.e., lookalikes). The details of why HHS believes the Health Center Program is a Federal public benefit impacts which entities are subject to the HHS Notice and how it might be enforced against them.

For example, one straightforward position would be for HHS to view the Health Center Program as a Federal public benefit under the “grants” prong of the definition rather than the “benefits” prong. While it is indisputable that some Health Centers receive federal grants, it is much less clear that they constitute or administer a “health benefit.” The mere fact that Health Centers have a federal status qualifying them at times for favorable treatment (e.g., FQHC reimbursement, Federal Tort Claims Act protections, 340B drug pricing) does not obviously transform them from a provider of services into a Federal benefit “provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit.”

If the Health Center Program qualifies as a Federal public benefit solely under the “grants” prong of the definition, then Health Center lookalikes should not be subject to the PRWORA exclusion because they do not receive federal grants. In other words, there is a simple textual argument—not addressed by HHS in the Notice—that only certain clinics regulated under the Health Center Program should be subject to PRWORA even under HHS’s broader interpretations.

The application of PRWORA to Health Centers through the “grants” prong of the definition is also not straightforward. Health Center grants are available only to designated public and nonprofit private entities, not to individual persons.16 This raises a natural question: Does a Health Center comply with PRWORA merely by ensuring it does not distribute federal grant funds it receives directly to any alien who is not a “qualified alien”? The HHS Notice, focusing on narrow issues of statutory interpretation, does not defend—or even articulate—the more expansive alternative that PRWORA prohibits federal grantees from expending grant funds on activities that benefit aliens who are not qualified aliens.17 Yet certain HHS rhetoric in the Notice at least implies that HHS might believe its action to have a broader impact.18

Could Health Centers be Required to Verify Patient Eligibility?

Under PRWORA, non-citizens who are not qualified aliens are not “eligible” for any Federal public benefit, unless an exception applies.19 In addition, the law directs the U.S. Attorney General, after consultation with HHS, to promulgate regulations requiring verification that persons “applying for” a non-excepted Federal public benefit are qualified aliens and are eligible to receive such benefit.20 The Attorney General issued interim verification guidance in 1997, but has not issued regulations imposing affirmative verification obligations.21

Verification requirements are not substantively addressed in the HHS Notice.22 As a result, there is no new information about whether or how HHS expects Health Centers to conduct eligibility verification activities. The plain text of PRWORA provides, subject to a requirement for the Attorney General to promulgate regulations, that a “nonprofit charitable organization” is “not required under this chapter to determine, verify, or otherwise require proof of eligibility of any applicant for such benefits.”23 Because the Attorney General has not yet promulgated regulations, there is therefore a straightforward textualist argument that this statutory provision exempts the more than 16,000 nonprofit Health Center sites from conducting eligibility verification.24

While there is not a comparable statutory exemption directly applicable to the minority of public Health Centers, local government entities are not expressly required by PRWORA to verify eligibility. Instead, PRWORA most directly gives the states responsibility for verification by directing “a State that administers a program that provides a Federal public benefit” to “have in effect a verification system that complies with the regulations” issued by the Attorney General within 24 months of the date such regulations are adopted.25

In short, there is no clear requirement at this time for Health Centers to modify their eligibility verification processes—or direction about how to do so. While Health Centers may choose to make changes, they should take care to balance risks and benefits if they do so. For example, the potential benefits of reducing the likelihood of future PRWORA enforcement should be weighed against potential risks involving noncompliance with federal Health Center Program requirements to serve all residents of the catchment area and state discrimination claims grounded in disparate treatment of protected classes. Federal agencies may address the subject of eligibility verification in the future, such as through the Attorney General promulgating the verification regulations required by PRWORA.

How Will HHS Enforce Eligibility Restrictions for the Health Center Program?

Finally, the HHS Notice does not address enforcement. During the multi-state litigation discussed above, HHS agreed to stay enforcement and application of the Notice through September 10, 2025.26 And the court’s September 11 order temporarily enjoins HHS from enforcing or implementing the revised interpretation in the plaintiff states. As noted above, the preliminary injunction is currently on appeal before the First Circuit. At the time this article was drafted, appellate briefs had not yet been filed. In part for these reasons, there is limited information available about what enforcement would look like for Health Centers.

While the prior sections of this article underscore the uncertainty of whether and how PRWORA applies to Health Centers under the new HHS interpretation—and point to several defenses Health Centers could raise if faced with enforcement—there is nonetheless a risk that HHS may pursue termination of the Health Center status (and any accompanying federal grant) for a Health Center that knowingly provides services to aliens who are not “qualified aliens.”

One significant unanswered question is whether Health Centers that knowingly serve aliens who are not “qualified aliens” could insulate themselves from potential enforcement actions by carving those activities into a separate line of business outside their federal scope of project. Under this approach, the line of business would be separately accounted for so that no federal grant money would be used to pay for the services. There is a reasonable position that carved-out services would not constitute a Federal public benefit; for example, HHS guidance has long acknowledged that Health Centers need not comply with HHS requirements for separate lines of business.27

Conclusion

The HHS Notice demonstrates executive intent to exclude certain non-citizens from the Health Center Program. Courts have already begun to address the expanded interpretation and the government’s authority to issue the notices. For now, the interpretation of PRWORA—and its application to Health Centers—is deeply unsettled. Even apart from the overarching question of whether the notice is lawful and the new interpretation will be upheld, there are a number of critical follow-up questions about how it would be applied to the Health Center Program. Health Centers should ensure they have a thoughtful and defensible position on each of these questions as they consider potential changes to their operations.

State officials will probe whether the owner of a South Shore apartment building raided by federal agents in September in an extravaganza designed to go viral on social media tipped off immigration agents in an effort to force out Black and Latino residents, officials said.

The Illinois Department of Human Rights will investigate whether the three firms that own and manage the building at 7500 S. South Shore Drive committed housing discrimination, officials said.

The investigation will focus on “allegations that the building owner and management tipped federal officials about the presence of Venezuelan immigrants in the building in order to intimidate and coerce the building’s Black and Hispanic tenants into leaving the building, based on stereotypes or hostility toward Venezuelan immigrants,” according to a statement from state officials.

“These allegations of housing discrimination raise serious concerns for people struggling to maintain housing — and the communities that have been profiled and relentlessly targeted by the federal government during its violent immigration enforcement operations,” Governor JB Pritzker said in a statement. “State law prohibits discrimination, and that includes aiding or abetting conduct intended to interfere with housing and civil rights. Illinois will not tolerate conduct that puts anyone in Illinois at risk of discrimination or harm.“

Representatives of 7500 Shore A LLC, Trinity Flood, and Strength in Management LLC could not be reached for comment.

Pritzker, who is running for a third term as governor and considering a run for president in 2028, ordered state agencies on Oct. 3 to evaluate the treatment of four children detained during the Sept. 30 raid, which touched off an international furor.

No results from that probe have been announced.

Without providing evidence, federal officials said 300 agents raided the South Shore apartment building to arrest members of the Tren de Aragua criminal organization, which originated in Venezuela. Federal officials said 37 people were arrested, but no one was ever charged with a crime, ProPublica reported.

Federal officials have never disclosed why agents chose to raid a nondescript apartment building in the heart of South Shore. Some residents told reporters they saw people they believe to be federal agents in the building before the high-profile raid.

WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times found a map of the building after the raid that labeled each unit inside the five-floor building as “vacant,” “tenant” or as “firearms.”

White stickers, made out of duct tape and a marker, remained on the doors of units that had been broken down after the raid, according to WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times.

The apartment building became a home for dozens of migrants who made their way to Chicago from the southern border on buses paid for by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in an attempt to bolster President Donald Trump’s bid for reelection.

Approximately 300 federal agents conducted the late-night raid, with some landing on the building from Blackhawk helicopters, according to a video produced by federal officials and posted on social media.

Other agents arrived in moving vans and large trucks, according to the video.

The charge allows state officials to begin probing whether “armed federal agents in military uniforms forcibly entered nearly all the 130 units in the 5-story building,” according to a statement. “Agents dragged tenants and their children outside, separated them based on their race, ancestry, and national origin, and left them zip-tied for hours outside the building.”

State officials will also probe reports that when “tenants were permitted to return to the building, they found their doors kicked down or ripped from the hinges and their furniture and belongings removed, tossed, or damaged,” according to the statement. “The raid left their residences uninhabitable. The charge also alleges that within hours after the raid, workers employed or contracted by 7500 S Shore building management began putting tenants’ belongings in the trash and clearing out units vacated by the raid.”

“The conduct alleged in this matter reflects more than isolated harm,” Illinois Department of Human Rights Director Jim Bennett said in a statement. “It describes a pattern of intimidation that reverberates through our communities.”

Liam Ramos, a preschooler, and his father were taken into custody while in their driveway, the superintendent of the school district in Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb, said at a press conference on Wednesday. Liam, who had recently turned five, is one of four children in the school district who have been detained by federal immigration agents during the Trump administration’s enforcement surge in the region over the last two weeks, the district said.

Liam and his father had just arrived home when they were detained, according to Zena Stenvik, the superintendent, who said she drove to the home when she learned of the detentions.

When she arrived, Stenvik said the father’s car was still running and the father and son had already been apprehended. An agent had taken Liam out of the car, led the boy to his front door and directed him to knock on the door asking to be let in, “in order to see if anyone else was home – essentially using a five-year-old as bait”, the superintendent said in a statement.

Stenvik said another adult living in the home was outside during the encounter and had pleaded to take care of Liam so the boy could avoid detention, but was denied. Liam’s older brother, a middle schooler, came home 20 minutes later to find his father and brother missing, Stenvik said. Two school principals from the district also arrived at the home to offer support.

Marc Prokosch, an attorney representing the family, said the family had an active asylum case and shared paperwork showing the father and son had arrived to the US at a port of entry, meaning an official crossing point.

“The family did everything they were supposed to in accordance with how the rules have been set out,” he said. “They did not come here illegally. They are not criminals.” He said there was no order of deportation against them and he believes the father and son have remained together in detention.

School officials released two photos of the encounter, one showing Liam, in a blue knit hat, outside his front door with a masked agent by his side, and another showing Liam standing by a car with a man holding on to his backpack.

“Why detain a five-year-old? You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal,” Stenvik said.

Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in a statement on Wednesday night that ICE was conducting a “targeted operation” to arrest Liam’s father, who she called an “illegal alien”. “ICE did NOT target a child,” she said. McLaughlin also alleged the father “fled on foot – abandoning his child”, saying, “For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended [his father].

“Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates,” she added.

The school district provided a statement from Liam’s teacher, who expressed shock over the boy’s detention: “Liam is a bright young student. He is so kind and loving, and his classmates miss him. He comes into class every day and just brightens the room. All I want is for him to be back here and safe.”

The detention of a young child will have ripple effects, said Prokosch. “Once his classmates learn the government took him away … I’m not qualified to talk about how much damage that is going to cause. It’s not just the family, it’s the entire community and all of those kids who are now going to be facing secondary trauma.”

Also on Tuesday, a 17-year-old Columbia Heights student was taken by “armed and masked agents” without parents present, Stenvik said. That student was removed from their car, she said.

In another case on 14 January, ICE agents “pushed their way into an apartment” and detained a 17-year-old high school girl and her mother, Stenvik said.

And in a fourth case, on 6 January, a 10-year-old fourth-grade student was allegedly taken by ICE on her way to elementary school with her mother. The superintendent said the 10-year-old called her father during the arrests and said that ICE agents would bring her to school, but when the father arrived at the school, he discovered both his daughter and wife had been taken. By the end of that school day, the mother and daughter were in a detention center in Texas.

Stenvik reported that as school officials were preparing for the press conference on Wednesday afternoon, an ICE vehicle drove on to the property of the district’s high school and were told by administrators to leave.

“ICE agents have been roaming our neighborhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lots and taking our kids,” Stenvik said.

The DHS did not respond to inquiries about the other arrests and the report of ICE’s arrival on campus.

In an interview after the press conference, the superintendent said the arrests and looming presence of ICE had taken an enormous toll on students, parents and school staff.

“Our children are traumatized. The sense of safety in our community and around our schools is shaken,” Stenvik said. “I can speak on behalf of all school staff when I say our hearts are shattered. After our fourth student was taken yesterday, I just thought someone has to hear the story. They’re taking children.”

School officials said some families were choosing to stay home out of fear of ICE.

Stenvik said school leaders were working to aid families affected by ICE. “Our role is to educate children during the school day. But now we’re trying to help people navigate this legal system.” She added: “Our main priority is to keep children safe. They’re children. They are not violent criminals. They are little kids.”

One year after Donald Trump’s second inauguration, a pattern emerges. Across dozens of executive orders, agency memos, funding decisions and enforcement changes, the administration has weakened federal civil rights law and the foundations of the country’s racially inclusive democracy.

From the start, the U.S. was not built to include everyone equally. The Constitution protected and promoted slavery. Most states limited voting to white men. Congress restricted naturalized citizenship to “free white persons.” These choices were not accidents. They shaped who could belong and who could exercise political power, and they entrenched a racial political majority that lasted for generations.

That began to change in the 1960s. After decades of protest and pressure, Congress enacted laws that prohibited discrimination in employment, education, voting, immigration and housing.

Federal agencies were charged with enforcing those laws, collecting data to identify discrimination and conditioning public funds on compliance. These choices reshaped U.S. demographics and institutions, with the current Congress “the most racially and ethnically diverse in history,” according to the Pew Research Center. The laws did not eliminate racial inequality, but they made exclusion easier to see and harder to defend.

The first year of the second Trump administration marks a sharp reversal.

Cumulative retreat

Rather than repealing civil rights statutes outright, the administration has focused on disabling the mechanisms that make those laws work.

Drawing on over two decades of teaching and writing about civil rights and my experience directing a GW Law project on inclusive democracy, I believe this pattern reflects not isolated administrative actions but a cumulative retreat from the federal government’s role as an enforcer of civil rights law.

Over the past year, the president and his administration have taken a series of connected actions:

• On its first day in office, announced the end of all federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, including diversity officers, equity plans and related grants and contracts.

• Shut down or sharply cut funding for federal programs aimed at reducing inequality, including offices focused on minority health, minority-owned businesses, fair federal contracting, environmental justice and closing the digital divide in broadband.

• Warned schools that diversity programs could jeopardize their federal funding, opened investigations into colleges offering scholarships to students protected under DACA – the Obama-era policy providing deportation protection for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children – and signaled that colleges risk losing federal student aid if their accrediting agencies consider diversity.

• Revoked security clearances and access to federal buildings for employees at law firms with diversity policies. The FCC investigated media companies for promoting diversity and threatened to block mergers by companies with similar programs, leading several companies to drop their initiatives.

• Issued a government-wide memo labeling common best practices in hiring, admissions and other selection and evaluation processes – such as compiling diverse applicant pools, valuing cultural competence, considering first-generation or low-income status and seeking geographic and demographic representation – as potentially legally suspect. The memo warned that federal funding could be cut to schools, employers and state and local governments using such practices. Federal prosecutors reportedly investigated federal contractors that consider diversity, characterizing such initiatives as fraud.

• Weakened enforcement against discrimination by ordering agencies to stop using disparate impact analysis. That kind of analysis identifies disparities in outcomes, assesses whether they are justified by legitimate objectives, and intervenes when they are not. The Department of Justice, the EEOC, the National Credit Union Administration and other agencies complied and dropped disparate impact analysis. Because algorithmic systems typically operate without explicit intent, eliminating disparate impact analysis reduces federal agencies’ ability to detect and address discriminatory outcomes produced by increasingly automated government and private-sector decision-making.

• Rescinded an executive order that barred discrimination by federal contractors, required steps to ensure nondiscriminatory hiring and employment, and subjected contractors to federal compliance reviews and record-keeping. This weakened a key mechanism used since 1965 to detect and remedy workplace discrimination.

• Eliminated data used to track inequality, including rolling back guidance encouraging schools to collect data on racial disparities in discipline and special education. The administration also removed data used to identify racial disparities in environmental harms.

• Dismantled or sharply reduced civil rights offices across federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education. About three-quarters of lawyers in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division left.

• Pressured the Smithsonian to remove exhibits about racial injustice, restored Confederate monuments and military base names, and barred schools and teacher training programs from including material the administration labeled divisive, such as unconscious bias.

• Declared English the nation’s only official language, repealed a requirement that federal agencies provide meaningful access to government programs and services for people with limited English proficiency, and prompted the General Services Admininistration and the departments of Justice, Education and other agencies to scale back language-assistance requirements and services.

• Attempted to limit birthright citizenship guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and adopted practices that treat ethnicity and non-English accents as legitimate reasons for immigration stops.

The pattern is hard to miss

Taken together, these shifts have practical consequences.

When agencies stop collecting data on racial disparities, discrimination becomes harder to detect. When disparate impact analysis is abandoned, unfair practices with no legitimate purpose go unchallenged. When diversity programs are chilled through investigations and funding threats, institutions respond by narrowing opportunity. When history and language are recast as threats to unity, truth and freedom of speech and thought are suppressed and undermined.

Administration officials argue that these steps are needed to prevent discrimination against white people, promote unity, ensure “colorblind equality” and comply with a Supreme Court decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions. But that ruling did not ban awareness of racial inequality, or neutral policies aimed at reducing it. Many of the administration’s actions rely on broad claims of illegality without providing specific violations.

The selective nature of enforcement is also telling.

Books about racism and civil rights were removed from military libraries, while books praising Nazi ideas or claiming racial intelligence differences were left untouched. The administration suspended admissions of refugees – over 90% of whom have been from Africa, Asia and Latin America in recent years – but then reopened the refugee program for white South Africans.

One year in, the pattern is hard to miss.

The administration is not simply applying neutral rules. It is dismantling the systems that once helped the U.S. move toward a more open and equal democracy. It is replacing them with policies that selectively narrow access to economic, cultural and educational participation.

The result is not simply a change in policy, but a fundamental shift in the trajectory of American democracy.

But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party’s playbook.

Now Democrats are trying to translate visceral outrage into political strategy, even though there’s little consensus on how to press forward on issues where the party has recently struggled to earn voters’ trust.

Some Democrats want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a proposal that echoes “defund the police” rhetoric from Trump’s first term, and impeach administration officials such as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others have taken a different approach, introducing legislation intended to curb alleged abuses by federal agents. But those ideas have been criticized by activists as insufficient, and there is mounting pressure to obstruct funding for deportations.

“We’re Democrats. I’m sure we’re going to have 50 different ideas and 50 different ways to say it,” said Chuck Rocha, a party strategist who is advising several House and Senate candidates on immigration this year.

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under Democratic President Joe Biden helped return Trump, a Republican, to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden’s former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

“It’s not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people’s civil and human rights,” she told The Associated Press. “This country has done that before, and it can do it again.”

Violent scenes force a strong Democratic response

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

“I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,” said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. “We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,” Garcia added, “which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.”

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats.

On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared with 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

“If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

“I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for ICE to be doing this,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last week. “The cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this.”

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

Trump faces his own public opinion challenges

The president’s approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, from 49% in March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

“Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it’s going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,” he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party’s strategy since Good’s death was captured on video.

“I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,” he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

“Are we really going to be the Gestapo?” he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state’s Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said “there’s a lot of pain and anguish.”

“It’s heartbreaking,” he said in a recent interview. “It’s chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.”

Federal authorities — such as ICE and border patrol agents — can enforce federal law so long as they do so in a manner consistent with the Constitution.","The president cannot constitutionally threaten to withhold funds from so-called sanctuary cities.

If he carries out his threat to cut off funds to jurisdictions that resist his immigration policies, President Donald Trump will violate the Constitution. In a speech on Tuesday, January 13, Trump announced that starting February 1, he will deny federal funding to any states that are home to local governments resisting his administration’s immigration policies.

This, of course, is not the first time Trump has made threats to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with deportation efforts led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He tried to do exactly this in his first term, only for the federal courts to declare his actions unconstitutional. Last year, just a day after the inauguration, Acting Deputy Attorney General (and now federal court of appeals judge) Emil Bove wrote a memo to the Justice Department calling on United States Attorneys to prosecute state and local officials who do not cooperate with the deportation efforts of the Trump administration.

President Trump also has expressed this, saying that state and local officials face prosecution for failing to assist his immigration policies.

These pronouncements, which obviously are meant to intimidate state and local governments, ignore the constitutional limits on the ability of the federal government to coerce state and local governments to carry out federal mandates. The Supreme Court has long held that the federal government may not commandeer state and local governments and force them to administer federal mandates.

In 1992, in New York v. United States, the Court declared unconstitutional a federal law that required that every state clean up its nuclear waste by 1996 or face significant legal consequences. The Court held that this violates state sovereignty and the Tenth Amendment. In an opinion by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the Court explained that Congress can try to induce state and local governments to act, but forcing them to adopt laws or enact regulations is unconstitutional. For example, when Congress wanted there to be a 21 year old drinking age it said that every state receiving federal highway money had to adopt this or it would lose five percent of those funds. This was deemed to induce, but not coerce state and local governments to act.

Under the Constitution, state and local governments are not enforcement arms of the federal government and cannot be treated as such.

The Court extended this in 1997, in Printz v. United States, declaring unconstitutional a provision of the Brady Handgun Control Act that required state and local law enforcement departments to conduct background checks before issuing permits for firearms. Once more, the Court said that the federal government could do its own background checks, but it could not conscript state and local governments and compel them to administer a federal law. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, stressed that the federal government cannot require state and local governments to serve as its enforcement arm — and concluded that it violates the Tenth Amendment for Congress to commandeer the states and force them to administer a federal mandate.

More recently, in 2018, in Murphy v. NCAA, the Court unanimously concluded that the federal government could not force New Jersey to have a law banning betting on college sports. Congress certainly could use its power to regulate commerce among the states to prohibit such gambling everywhere in the country. But the Court, in an opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, ruled that it violates the Tenth Amendment for Congress to compel that state legislatures adopt laws.

Thus, the law is clear that Trump cannot force state and local governments to assist federal immigration officials. This would be impermissible commandeering.

Indeed, this was the basis for declaring similar efforts in Trump’s first term unconstitutional. Then, too, Trump adopted a policy to cut off federal law enforcement money to local governments that did not cooperate with ICE. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that this was unconstitutional. Also, California, during the first Trump term, adopted a law limiting state and local cooperation with federal immigration officials. A federal district court upheld this law as constitutional.

There is a separate, important constitutional reason why Trump cannot unilaterally cut off funds: Only Congress, not the president, has the spending power and can set conditions on the receipt of federal money. The Supreme Court has held that the legislature can put strings on federal grants, but only if the conditions are clearly stated, they relate to the purpose of the program and they are not unduly coercive. Congress has not conditioned federal law enforcement money on state and local governments cooperating with ICE. As mentioned above, this is why Congress could say that state governments would lose five percent of their federal highway money if they did not set a 21-year-old drinking age: the condition was clearly stated, it related to the purpose of the highway funds and five percent was not unduly coercive. The Trump administration cannot add requirements that are not found in the federal spending law.

Throughout American history, it has been conservatives, and conservative justices, who have championed states’ rights and federalism.

Additionally, the Supreme Court has been clear that the federal government cannot coerce state and local action by withholding federal funds. In 2012, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, the Court declared unconstitutional a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required state governments receiving Medicaid funds to provide coverage to those within 133% of the federal poverty level. Those not complying would lose all federal Medicaid funds. The Court said that this was “dragooning” the states, impermissibly commandeering them to comply with a federal mandate. Such coercion, it ruled, violated the Tenth Amendment.

But that is exactly what Trump is trying to do if he cuts off money to state and local governments for not adequately cooperating with federal immigration officials. He is using federal money to coerce state and local governments that disagree with his immigration policies.

These cases reflect the Supreme Court’s upholding of the basic principles of federalism, which safeguard the autonomy of state and local governments. These are not new, and they are not historically liberal. Quite the contrary: Throughout American history, it has been conservatives, and conservative justices, who have championed states' rights and federalism. That is why it is realistic to imagine that the Roberts Court, which so far has generally been supportive of President Trump, would be likely to rule against his administration if he carries through his threats to cut off federal funds to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities to his satisfaction.

To be clear, despite the use of the phrase “sanctuary cities,” that is a misnomer. No state or city can or does protect undocumented individuals from ICE enforcement or deportation. Rather, “sanctuary cities” are jurisdictions that say that they will not explicitly assist the federal government in its immigration efforts. In other words, the state or local government cannot literally provide sanctuary to anyone, but they also don’t have to assist the federal government’s immigration enforcement efforts.

There are compelling reasons for cities to adopt such policies. Law enforcement agencies are understandably concerned that victims of crime and witnesses to crime will not come forward to the police if they fear deportation. This is not a new concern. In 1979, the Los Angeles Police Department adopted Special Order 40, which provides that “Officers shall not initiate police action with the objective of discovering the alien status of a person. Officers shall not arrest nor book persons for [violating] the United States Immigration code.”

Public health officials worry that sick people, including those with communicable diseases, will not go for treatment if they fear that it could lead to their deportation. Education officials fear that parents will not send their children to school if they think it might lead to deportation. This is not hypothetical. Cities are reporting significant absenteeism in schools as parents fear ICE actions there.

Under the Constitution, state and local governments are not enforcement arms of the federal government and cannot be treated as such. Federal authorities — such as ICE and border patrol agents — can enforce federal law so long as they do so in a manner consistent with the Constitution. But whether state and local governments wish to cooperate is entirely up to them. Cutting off funds from jurisdictions that don’t assist ICE would be unconstitutional.","https://images.prismic.io/vitalcity/aXIxEAIvOtkhB0eb_25295032366785.jpg?auto=format,compress",N,,2026-01-22 09:57:45.508804

Democrats oppose DHS funding bill over immigration crackdown

House Democrats protest ICE actions, citing lack of guardrails

Spending bills show Congress reasserting control over federal spending

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday were girding to oppose a Department of Homeland Security funding bill, in protest of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which could risk a partial government shutdown at the end of the month.

This comes as Congress stares down a January 31 deadline to pass spending bills to keep federal agencies across the Trump administration operating, or risk the second government shutdown in four months.

But leading Democrats in the House are planning to oppose the Homeland Security spending bill as the nation is reeling over the January 7 killing of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.

Democratic leaders say the bill lacks sufficient guardrails against ICE excesses and their opposition could prompt many rank-and-file Democrats to follow suit.

""They should not be able to fire at moving vehicles unless their life is in danger and they are and that's wrong,"" No. 2 House Democrat Pete Aguilar of California told reporters on Wednesday.

Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said the bill empowers frontline agents to uphold immigration laws.

With Republicans' razor-thin 218-213 House majority, it was unclear whether Speaker Mike Johnson could win passage of the $64.4 billion bill. Prospects are also unclear in the Senate.

Defeat could trigger furloughs of DHS workers deemed ""unessential,"" which likely would not have an impact on ICE operations. Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" enacted last year, lavished ICE with an additional $75 billion whether or not the House passed the DHS spending bill.

Some Democrats are calling on colleagues to recognize their limits and support the package.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of (ICE) accountability we need,"" said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, referring to November's congressional elections.

Aside from the immigration dispute, experts say the spending bills show some evidence that Congress is moving to reassert its control over federal spending, after Trump refused to spend billions of dollars that had already been signed into law last year.

Brendan Duke of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the spending bills protect many programs targeted by Trump, such as medical research, housing and education.

""We will see if President Trump respects this agreement,"" he said.

“I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,” she said.

Party leaders told a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that they would vote against the homeland security funding bill, citing insufficient provisions to rein in Immigration Customs and Enforcement, more widely known by its acronym.

Signals for a no vote came from Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader in the House of Representatives, along with Pete Aguilar, the chairman of the party’s caucus, and Katherine Clark, the chief whip.

Their sentiments are expected to influence the vast majority of the Democrats’ 213-strong House caucus to vote no – although sufficient Democrats are believed to be ready to vote in favor to enable the legislation to pass. The party has no plans to whip its members into line to enforce the leadership view.

The anticipated Democratic thumbs-down comes despite provisions in the bill that keeps the agency’s $10bn annual budget flat, reduces ICE enforcement and removal operations, and imposes a 5,500 reduction to its number of detention beds. The legislation also secured $20m for the “procurement, deployment, and operations of body worn cameras” to be worn by ICE agents, thanks to Democrats’ efforts.

Such palliatives are unlikely to placate anger in the party over the agency’s operations in Minnesota, including the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a mother of three, in Minneapolis, this month.

“In the last 24 hours, we’ve heard our members speak loudly that ICE isn’t doing enough, these reforms aren’t doing enough. This lawlessness has to stop,” Aguilar told reporters after the meeting. “They are only doing this because the president of the United States wants to use them to terrorize communities, to terrorize US citizens.”

Rosa DeLauro, a representative from Connecticut and the ranking Democrat on the appropriations committee, said it was still better for the bill to pass rather than run the risk of a renewed government shutdown that could affect other agencies. “I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE,” she said.

“I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency. I encourage my colleagues to review the bill and determine what is best for their constituents and communities.”

But she added: “The Homeland Security funding bill is more than just ICE. If we allow a lapse in funding, TSA [transportation security administration] agents will be forced to work without pay, Fema [federal emergency management agency] assistance could be delayed, and the US Coast Guard will be adversely affected. All while ICE continues functioning without any change in their operations due to $75 billion it received in the One Big Beautiful Bill.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/065fc575db672d238064bb2766da740ede256289/577_0_5419_4335/master/5419.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4fcdf26e11fa76626b29b2fc8ca94ae",N,,2026-01-22 11:38:57.154660

Americans need a Homeland Security secretary who will follow the law, respect Congress and tell the truth to the public.","In the wake of the fatal shooting of a Minnesota mother by an immigration agent this month, House Democrats have filed articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

These lawmakers are on the right track, but they need not have waited so long. Throughout her year at the Department of Homeland Security, Noem has shown disregard for judicial and congressional authority, and she has misled the American people. Her leadership is endangering the country. She should be removed from office before she can do more of the same and worse.

As secretary, Noem has displayed a troubling pattern of unethical behavior. Her infamous photo op last March, posing in front of detainees in El Salvador’s CECOT prison, was not just grotesque; it may have violated Geneva Convention provisions against the public exploitation of prisoners.

In October, Noem ordered a video blaming Democrats for the government shutdown to be played at airports nationwide. This was in direct conflict with the Hatch Act, which restricts federal employees from engaging in partisan political activity.

In November, the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica reported that a company tied to Noem got money from $220-million Homeland Security ad contracts in a secret, no-bid process.

None of these instances reflect sound judgment by the person charged with keeping our country safe.

Noem does not seem to respect the judicial branch. She defied a federal judge by not turning around deportation flights to El Salvador last March. Her agents in Chicago have used chemical sprays on protesters multiple times despite a court order forbidding them from doing so. Speaking on “Meet the Press” in November, Noem said, “We’ll continue to do the right thing, continue to work and protect Americans, no matter what radical judge comes out and tries to stop us.” These actions, coupled with her own words, reveal an unacceptable disdain for our constitutional system of checks and balances.

Under Noem, officials from the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have flouted congressional authority. Members of Congress have for months been denied their lawful right to inspect detention facilities in Minnesota, New Jersey, Florida and California. Such oversight is critical to protecting the well-being of detainees, especially because the department gutted its own watchdog agencies.

Noem has also made false or misleading statements to Congress, the press and the public. She made so many derogatory remarks about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man deported by mistake to El Salvador, that a federal judge rebuked her for inflammatory comments. Noem has often declared that ICE does not detain or deport U.S. citizens, even though it does. ProPublica has, in fact, documented more than 170 cases of Americans detained by immigration agents. And although Noem likes to repeat that ICE agents are going after “the worst of the worst,” internal agency data show that they have arrested nearly 75,000 people with no criminal records.

When summoned before a congressional committee in December, Noem struck a defiant tone. “I will consider your asking me to resign as an endorsement of my work,” she told one lawmaker. However, this was before the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis. Now the public appears to have lost confidence in Noem, whose job approval recently slipped to 36%.

True, Noem was appointed by President Trump to execute his aggressive immigration enforcement agenda. Anyone else put in the role would probably also have carried out these policies.

It is how Noem has carried out her responsibilities that demonstrates unfitness for her job — not only pursuing the president’s agenda but also racking up a body count, defying the law and lying.

She is also failing at the most basic functions of her role. Consider that, under her leadership, FEMA has been widely faulted for responding too slowly to natural disasters in Texas and North Carolina. Or that Noem has allowed department social media accounts to feature white nationalist memes and questionable messaging, including recruitment posts saying, “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?”

Noem’s tenure has already had grave consequences. Thirty-two people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the agency’s deadliest year in more than two decades. During Trump’s second term, immigration agents have shot at people at least 16 times.

Americans need a Homeland Security secretary who will follow the law, respect Congress and tell the truth to the public. Kristi Noem is not that person. Under her, the department is harming citizens, not protecting them. Lawmakers should press her impeachment forward and remove her from office — unless she has the decency to resign first.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b5aea9a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5141x2699+0+364/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffe%2Fcd%2F5ace0e3b4dd3be72939a0be442f1%2F2256461977.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 09:37:36.645055

The Justice Department has refused to open a criminal investigation into the shooting, hastily declaring it an act of self-defense that does not warrant a criminal inquiry. But despite statements by administration officials to the contrary, there is more than enough for DOJ to investigate here. I know from experience.

For over a decade, I was a prosecutor in the Criminal Section of DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, the office dedicated to—and staffed with experts on—investigating and prosecuting officer-involved shootings and other uses of excessive force. From reviewing, investigating, and prosecuting law-enforcement misconduct cases, I know both whether and how DOJ, across administrations, would look into something like the Jan. 7 shooting.

I also know just how challenging such investigations can be and how difficult these cases are to prove. Prosecutors must first find that the force used was excessive as a matter of constitutional law. That means, in Fourth Amendment parlance, the force was an objectively unreasonable seizure. Prosecutors must prove this under a legal standard that explicitly allows “for the fact that [] officers are often forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving—about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.” Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396-97 (1989).

And even if the force is excessive, prosecutors must also prove the agent’s intent. The law sets an exceptionally high bar here. Prosecutors must prove that the agent acted “willfully,” meaning that he must have had the specific intent to deprive someone of a constitutional right. As I and many other civil rights prosecutors have explained to juries in these cases, willfulness requires the agent to know what he is doing is wrong and decide to do it anyway, one of the most stringent mens rea requirements in criminal law. That standard permits prosecution of agents who purposefully or consciously choose to act in violation of the Constitution (not to mention in violation of their training and experience). But it precludes prosecution of agents who, no matter how unreasonable their use of force, nonetheless acted unknowingly, negligently, or in the good faith (but incorrect) belief that the force was necessary. One result of these requirements is that federal prosecutions for excessive force are typically brought only on the most unassailable evidence and are, in the grand scheme of things, relatively rare.

This legal framework is governed by 18 U.S.C. § 242, the statute DOJ uses to prosecute excessive force cases at the federal level. That provision makes it a crime when “[w]hoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.” The statute, which dates to the post-Civil War Reconstruction Era, applies when any government official, including an immigration agent, willfully violates a person’s constitutional rights. The Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section, often in partnership with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices across the country, has used that statute to successfully prosecute cases like the Rodney King beating, the fatal shooting of Walter Scott, and the murder of George Floyd, among others.

Since Good’s shooting, facts have incrementally emerged that point to both the excessiveness of Agent Ross’s use of force and to his intent. Exhaustive reporting has helped establish many of the circumstances surrounding the Jan. 7 shooting, including through a multi-angle, step-by-step analysis of the incident. It’s a good start in determining whether the force was unreasonable. The fact that agents had been able to pass by Good’s vehicle; that Good was clearly turning her steering wheel and vehicle away from the agents at the time shots were fired; that there was a notable gap between Agent’s Ross’s body and the vehicle, at least at the time of the second and third shots; that he was the only agent on the scene to even attempt to use any kind of force—all indicate that resorting to deadly force was not reasonable under the circumstances. Prosecutors would, of course, want to test, corroborate, and build on that evidence through, among other things, ballistics analysis, complete autopsy and medical reports, and witnesses accounts. Definitively establishing where the agent was positioned when he fired the shot that, according to an independent medical pathologist’s report, struck the left side of Good’s head and likely killed her, will be critical.

The more difficult question, as in so many of these cases, is one of intent. Prosecutors must prove the agent’s thinking and motivation. To this end, there is evidence that Agent Ross did not view Ms. Good as an imminent physical threat. Multiple videos show, for instance, that Agent Ross’s own vehicle was able to get around Ms. Good’s SUV, that he chose to walk around the front of Ms. Good’s vehicle (thereby exposing himself to possible harm, and against DHS policy) with one hand occupied by a cell phone, and that, just prior to the shooting, Ms. Good told the agents, “I’m pulling out.” Other evidence suggests that Agent Ross may have shot because he felt annoyed or disrespected by Ms. Good and her partner, rather than out of fear for his safety. The former are improper motivations that would support § 242’s willfulness prong. From the outset, for example, videos show that Ms. Good and her partner stopped their SUV in the street and honked the horn repeatedly in apparent protest of the ICE agents. Additionally—and courtesy of the agent’s own cellphone video, which importantly provides a view of the incident from his perspective—we can hear Ms. Good say, “That’s fine dude, I’m not mad at you,” and her partner sarcastically tell Agent Ross to “go get yourself some lunch, big boy.” Perhaps giving a window into his irritation at these remarks or Ms. Good’s attempt to drive away, Agent Ross muttered after firing his weapon at her, “f*cking b*tch.” He walked away from Ms. Good’s SUV, which had by that point crashed into a parked vehicle (a clear sign that Ms. Good was injured or dead), and gestured to someone else to “call 911.”

Together, these facts are more than enough to show the allegation that Agent Ross willfully used excessive force when he shot Ms. Good is a serious one. And because that allegation, if proven, would constitute a violation of federal law, it is wholly appropriate to open a formal investigation into the shooting. (Indeed, it is no wonder that an initial FBI review reportedly concluded that opening an investigation was justified.)

Based on my experience, further investigation should build on the early indications of Agent Ross’s intent. That issue will almost certainly boil down to whether evidence shows the agent actually did fear for his (or others’) safety, or whether he unlawfully acted out of anger, in retaliation, or to stop Ms. Good as she drove away. On the last point: to the extent Agent Ross was taught even the most basic law governing uses of force, he was likely told that the use of deadly force to prevent someone who poses no immediate threat from escaping is constitutionally unreasonable. Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 11 (1985).

What specifically would investigators look for? Several categories of evidence are relevant here, and the list below is far from exhaustive:

Radio traffic and witness accounts that might capture, in real time, how Agent Ross experienced the incident and in particular any comments he made before, during, and after the shooting that could provide a window into his mindset;

Medical records for Agent Ross, which, in addition to bearing on allegations that Ross was hit by Ms. Good’s vehicle and suffered internal bleeding, may contain the agent’s account of whether and how he received any injuries;

Witness accounts, particularly from other agents on the scene who experienced the incident from a similar vantage point and who could speak to whether they viewed Ms. Good as a physical threat;

Routine incident and use-of-force reports from Agent Ross and others containing their accounts of the shooting, which could reveal inconsistencies between early and later accounts;

Training records, to determine whether Agent Ross’s actions were consistent with or in contravention of how he was taught and trained; and

Other personnel records to identify prior uses of force or displays of his firearm and any resulting remediation or discipline that might have put Agent Ross on notice about unlawful force.

None of these investigative steps remotely resembles how this administration has approached the shooting. In the wake of Ms. Good’s death, administration officials rushed to judgment, suggesting that the agent shot Ms. Good in self defense and condemning Ms. Good’s actions as “domestic terrorism.” Less than three hours after the incident, DHS tweeted that Ms. Good had “weaponized her vehicle” and “attempt[ed] to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them.” With no investigation whatsoever, DHS apparently concluded that the agent had “fired defensive shots” out of fear for his and others’ lives. In line with these premature conclusions, the administration has refused to seriously examine what happened. On Jan. 13, DOJ Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche declared that there was “no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” Blanche has since reiterated his belief that it is not “appropriate to investigate” the shooting and has definitively stated that DOJ is “not investigating.”

But only after completing a fair and thorough investigation involving the steps described above (and likely many others) would prosecutors be able to decide whether to pursue criminal charges—which requires that they believe the “conduct constitutes a federal offense, and that the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction” by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This process—from initial allegation through investigation to charging decision—is highly important. It supports the legitimacy of our criminal justice system by allowing charges to be brought only when supported by evidence obtained through an unbiased investigation. It seeks to spare crime victims the heartache of acquittals or dismissals for insufficient evidence. It benefits officers, too. The process ensures that any decision to decline charges is credibly based on a thorough review, rather than a political whim. And finally, a careful investigation serves an important social good by helping ensure that the rules around the use of force are carefully followed and signaling to officers that, this administration’s false assurances aside, they do not have absolute immunity for criminal conduct.

Perhaps an investigation would ultimately support the administration’s predetermination that the Jan. 7 shooting does not merit prosecution. Perhaps not. Additional evidence is sure to emerge that could cut either for or against seeking charges. But it is absolutely clear that the evidence at this point is more than sufficient to justify opening a criminal investigation into the agent’s conduct—a step that would be consistent with decades of DOJ practice and, until recently, would have been considered largely unremarkable.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2255170397.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 12:38:09.180564

In a rare statement issued last weekend, the Maine Law Enforcement Coalition raised concerns about ""inflammatory political rhetoric and misleading public narratives"" without naming names.
""The Maine Law Enforcement Coalition calls on elected officials, advocacy groups, and media outlets to act responsibly,"" said the coalition, whose members include the Maine Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Maine State Law Enforcement Association, the Maine Association of Police and the Maine State Troopers Association.
""We can't rise to take the bait,"" said Bennett, a former chairman of the Maine Republican Party.","The increased presence of federal law enforcement in Maine is raising tensions in some communities — and among state political leaders.

Republicans are welcoming federal immigration agents and accusing Democrats, including Gov. Janet Mills, of inflammatory rhetoric that could endanger federal agents and the public. Democrats, meanwhile, respond that they are looking out for the civil rights of Maine residents in the wake of the heavy-handed tactics seen in Minneapolis and other cities.

The full extent of the federal operation in Maine remains unclear even as reports begin emerging about detentions and communities targeted by immigration agents. Mills said Wednesday that her administration is maintaining close contact with officials in Portland and Lewiston — two cities frequently mentioned as likely targets of immigration enforcement — and with organizations across the state.

""If the Federal government has warrants, then it should show them,"" Mills said in a statement on Wednesday. ""But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the Federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors — none of which is welcome.”

In a press conference on Tuesday, Republican lawmakers accused Democrats — including Mills — of fanning the flames of fear.

""The governor's remarks last week have really served to only escalate tensions and concerns, particularly around public safety, both for law enforcement and the general public here in the state of Maine,"" said Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart of Presque Isle.

Stewart was referring to a 3-minute video released by Mills on Jan. 14 as state and municipal officials began hearing about a surge in federal law enforcement coming to Maine. In that video, Mills pledged to protect the safety and the rights of Maine residents and urged anyone protesting to so peacefully and to ""meet any hostility with reserve and resolve.""

But Mills added: ""To the Federal government I say this: if your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused – those tactics are not welcome here.""

Stewart described the situation since last week as a feeding frenzy on the political left. And Stewart said that frenzy is being led or inspired by Democratic leaders like Mills and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows as they run for higher office. Mills is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican Sen. Susan Collins while Bellows hopes to win the Democratic ticket to succeed Mills.

""And unfortunately what our concern is with that, as things continue to escalate in that regard, you are going to see people take what she says to heart, take what other Democratic leaders say and take it seriously,"" Stewart said. ""And when that happens, the end result is going to be that people get hurt.""

That's a concern echoed by police officials.

In a rare statement issued last weekend, the Maine Law Enforcement Coalition raised concerns about ""inflammatory political rhetoric and misleading public narratives"" without naming names.

""The Maine Law Enforcement Coalition calls on elected officials, advocacy groups, and media outlets to act responsibly,"" said the coalition, whose members include the Maine Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Maine State Law Enforcement Association, the Maine Association of Police and the Maine State Troopers Association. ""De-escalation, accuracy, and accountability must take precedence over political gain. Public safety depends on it.""

Not all Democrats are unified in their messaging.

On Wednesday, Democratic Congressman Jared Golden, who lives in Lewiston, released a statement saying that as long as the federal law enforcement operations are targeting individuals who have engaged in criminal activities then ""I believe it legitimately serves the public interest.""

In an interview with Fox News earlier this week, a deputy assistant director at ICE said the surge in Maine that they've dubbed operation ""Catch of the day"" is targeting approximately 1,400 people with such offenses as drug trafficking, assault, sexual assault of children and driving under the influence. The Fox News report said that 50 people had been detained on Tuesday.

But Senate President Mattie Daughtry, a Democrat from Brunswick, said federal officials have not been responsive to the state.

""We're getting more information from watching Fox News than from official communications,"" Daughtry said.

Daughtry flatly rejected Republican suggestions that Mills and other Democratic leaders have been using inflammatory rhetoric that could incite violence against federal agents or others. She said Democrats are urging people to behave peacefully — but also to know their rights.

""When we are seeing families separated, people scared, people not leaving their homes and the fact that people are concerned that they could be pulled over just for being black or brown — that is something that I will continue to say is wrong,"" Daughtry said. ""And I can say that civilly and continue to have that conversation. And if folks think that me speaking out against that is violent rhetoric then I really urge them to . . . check themselves and make sure that they are willing to have a dialogue. Because it takes both voices.""

State Sen. Rick Bennett of Oxford, who recently withdrew from the Republican Party and is running for governor as an independent, said he is also hearing that people are afraid. And Bennett believes that's the intention of the Trump administration.

""We can't rise to take the bait,"" said Bennett, a former chairman of the Maine Republican Party. ""I think there is an effort by the White House and the administration in Washington to, as I said, scare people and to provoke. So I think we have to be measured. I think we have to take each step at a time and see what actually happens.""

Bennett also blames the Trump administration for increasing the temperature around immigration.

""It's one thing for Republicans to say let's lower the temperature,"" Bennett said. ""And I agree. But maybe they should be telling that to the people they support in Washington.""

Back at Tuesday's Republican press conference at the State House, Stewart and his House counterpart, Rep. Billy Bob Faulkingham of Winter Harbor, said they are asking for a sit-down meeting with Mills to discuss the issue.

In the meantime, they called on the governor and other Democrats to drop what Faulkingham described as the state's antagonistic and ""almost insurrectionist approach towards the federal government."" Faulkingham criticized some Democratic talk of ""lawless"" federal agents who he said are being sent to Maine to enforce the law and root out fraud.

""The talk that I would like to see is that we are going to cooperate with federal law enforcement — that these are the same FBI, border patrol and ICE agents that have faithfully served the U.S. government for many years and that we are going to cooperate with them to get to the bottom of this,"" Faulkingham said.

She said she was alarmed by the number of federal agents flooding her hometown and the violent scenes that have accompanied their presence.
“In some communities, activists have posted fliers with information about the ICE agents involved in arrests and other actions in the community,” he said.
However, it appears the administration has adopted the view that any posting of personal information regarding ICE agents is unlawful.
Zick said posting threats to federal agents is unlawful and not protected speech.","One day after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis earlier this month, a Minnesota immigrant advocacy group reported a threefold increase in the number of people signing up to become legal observers.

“To say this: The killing of Renee Good lit a fire under the community, would be an understatement,” said Ryan Perez, a leadership and organizing director with the advocacy group COPAL, part of a network of 5,000 trained civilians who monitor immigration enforcement. “It really is a remarkable moment.”

As the Trump administration deploys thousands of federal officers to carry out turbocharged immigration operations across the country – with the Minneapolis area now the epicenter – growing networks of volunteers who call themselves ICE observers appear to be intensifying their efforts.

Volunteers document arrests, some tail ICE agents in vehicles, while others blow whistles warning community members of ICE enforcement –– tactics under increased scrutiny since the fatal shooting, which has led to more aggressive enforcement operations and sparked protests across the US.

Good, who served on the board of her son’s school, was linked, in school documents, to similar activities encouraging parents to monitor and possibly disrupt ICE operations –– an association Trump officials are placing at the center of their review into the incident as the activist and mother of three partially blocked ICE agents with her car.

An ICE officer who was filming Good shot her after she started to accelerate her SUV on January 7. Videos of the encounter show Good was turning her vehicle away from the agent as she pulled forward, but it is unclear whether she made contact with him before he fired.

Experts say while some practices by volunteers are acts of nonviolent civil disobedience, others may fall into murkier legal territory. Here’s what we know.

Who is involved in the ICE observer groups?

Across the country, thousands of parents, teachers, clergy members and community organizers have sought training on what they can legally do when they see an immigration arrest. They have been trained on documenting federal immigration agents’ actions with cell phone video and quickly warning migrant neighbors with whistles and car horns.

“People that look a lot like Renee Good, we have a lot of moms. We have a lot of retirees, people that would be volunteering at the ballot box,” Perez said of the volunteers.

Kateri Heymans, a 29-year-old Spanish teacher in Minneapolis, registered as an observer the day after Good was fatally shot. She said she was alarmed by the number of federal agents flooding her hometown and the violent scenes that have accompanied their presence.

In North Carolina, the immigrant worker group Siembra NC operates an ICE watch hotline and a verification system tracking the operations of federal agents in the community.

“Safety concerns are a daily reality,” said Andrew Wills Garces, a senior strategist with Siembra NC. “After the killing of Renee Nicole Good, our volunteers are asking, ‘Can they get away with this?’ They see an administration labeling legal observers as ‘domestic terrorists’ and feel a target on their backs.”

How are ICE observers trained?

Nationwide, volunteers are being trained not only to honk horns and blow whistles to warn anyone in earshot immigration agents are present but also to document the actions of federal officers.

Critics of the immigration crackdown say observers are necessary given what they describe as dangerous tactics by federal agents which put people at risk. Trump administration officials counter they are taking necessary steps to keep Americans safe, and ICE officers are facing a significant increase in assaults. Officers exercise restraint despite facing threats and attacks, according to federal officials.

“Our observers are trained to walk in and say, ‘I demand to see a warrant. Show me a warrant. I need to see a signed judicial warrant. Why are you here? What are you doing here?’ And all of that creates a legal record as well,” Perez said.

Their notes and videos are shared with attorneys and advocacy groups to be used in possible court cases, he said. Volunteers also watch video of enforcement actions and participate in simulations as part of their training.

What actions are legal?

“If you’re in a public space, using whistles to signal that law enforcement officers are present and recording law enforcement activities are expressive activities protected by the First Amendment,” said Gregory Magarian, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.

“If we take the First Amendment seriously, and if we look at our nation’s history, we see that a wide range of protest and pushback activities are protected by the First Amendment … and have been essential to social movements – the Civil Rights Movement, women’s suffrage, the run-up to the American Revolution itself – that almost everyone views positively.”

Tim Zick, a professor at William and Mary Law School in Virginia, said some volunteers have sought to identify mostly masked ICE officers by badge numbers or other accessible information, occasionally posting information about their identities online.

“In some communities, activists have posted fliers with information about the ICE agents involved in arrests and other actions in the community,” he said.

Distribution of factual and lawfully obtained public information is generally protected by the First Amendment, according to Zick.

“The Trump administration has initiated investigations and prosecutions of some activists who have posted information about agents online or distributed it,” Zick said.

But context matters.

“If the information is posted with the intent or purpose of inciting violence against agents or threatening them, it may not be protected. However, it appears the administration has adopted the view that any posting of personal information regarding ICE agents is unlawful. That position is contrary to First Amendment case law.”

What is illegal?

President Donald Trump has warned leaders in Minnesota he may be forced to intervene further if widespread protests continue during his administration’s surge in immigration enforcement operations.

“In Minnesota, the Troublemakers, Agitators, and Insurrectionists are, in many cases, highly paid professionals,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Friday.

ICE watch activities and protests appear to be escalating as aggressive arrests become more common in public, with some federal officers using tactics such as shattering car windows and tackling their targets.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has said agents who “put their lives on the line every day to enforce the law” are facing “smearing” by claims they’re employing “harsher approaches.”

“ICE and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves,” McLaughlin told CNN. “Our officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training.”

Physically interfering with the actions of agents is illegal.

“If a person directly interferes with a law enforcement officer, for example by deliberately blocking the officer’s path, that is not protected by the First Amendment and is generally unlawful,” Magarian said.

It is also unlawful to disobey an order from law enforcement to disperse, he said.

Zick said posting threats to federal agents is unlawful and not protected speech.

“So is inciting others to engage in unlawful actions against the agents, if the incitement is likely to produce an imminent attack,” he added.

Perez, the Minneapolis activist who trains ICE watchers, said his group instructs volunteers to stay eight feet away from agents and to avoid touching or blocking them.

“We have a 100% no obstruction protocol as observers,” he insisted.

Perez added, “We have people that were so afraid before and I think the fear is still there. There’s so much violence from law enforcement against community members and yet there’s also more bravery than ever … because people are feeling like, ‘Now’s my time to act.’”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-11-08t022404z-1512418995-rc2xrhaz3fwf-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-22 10:39:31.949027

They’ve promised civil rights legislation that could offer alleged victims another route to courts, ordered up official tribunals to gather video and other records, or asked cities to refuse requests to cooperate with raids. But for the most part, states looking for concrete ways to push back find themselves largely hamstrung.

Violence in immigration enforcement is on the rise. A federal immigration agent’s killing of Renee Good in Minnesota on Jan. 7 was one of half a dozen shootings since December. An immigrant’s death in a Texas detention facility this month was ruled a homicide. And detention deaths last year totaled at least 31, a two-decade peak and more than the previous four years combined.

There also have been dozens of cases in the past year of agents using dangerous and federally banned arrest maneuvers, such as chokeholds, that can stop breathing.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in masks and tactical vests have been recorded firing pepper spray into the faces of protesters, shattering car windows with little warning, punching and kneeing people pinned face down on the ground, using battering rams on front doors, and questioning people of color about their identities.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended many recorded incidents as legitimate uses of force against dangerous people. And some Republican state lawmakers have said they’ll work to bolster ICE’s work within their borders.

Some lawmakers, legal experts and immigrant advocates worry about whether a lack of oversight from the federal government and the weak positions of state governments could give rise to even more violence as President Donald Trump continues his push to arrest immigrants who are living illegally in the United States.

Previous administrations have prioritized arresting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who also have criminal records, but that isn’t the case in Trump’s second term.

“You can’t go after a murderer and a garden-variety immigration violator like a poor nanny or a poor landscaper with equal emphasis. This administration has abandoned all discretion and all priorities, and you create this narrative that you’re doing this patriotic, godly thing,” said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank.

Chishti said there has been a surge in abusive tactics that comes from a series of federal policies. He cited the massive infusion of inexperienced officers under heavy pressure to make arrests, the military-style tactics meant to create spectacle and fear, and the harsh rhetoric aimed, he said, at instilling warlike hostility toward immigrants and protesters.

More agents, more incidents

The number of ICE law enforcement agents doubled in less than a year, with Homeland Security announcing this month it has hired 12,000 new agents out of some 220,000 applicants. More agents have surged into cities such as Chicago and Minneapolis, their semiautomatic weapons, bulky vests and balaclavas often contrasting with local police officers wearing name badges and carrying sidearms.

Noem has insisted that ICE and other officers are the real victims of increased violence, citing instances like one on Jan. 14, when a man was shot in the leg by an ICE agent. She said in a news release that bystanders struck an officer with a snow shovel and broom handle in Minneapolis as the officer tried to catch a fleeing suspect. Noem called it “an attempted murder of federal law enforcement” in which, “ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired a defensive shot to defend his life.”

ICE is using Medicaid data to find out where immigrants live

Court papers released Jan. 20 included an officer’s account of only two assailants, the suspect and a friend who owned the car he had been driving, and said the injured suspect was trying to escape into the apartment building and that tear gas had been used to force the men to surrender.

Noem, who claimed Monday that more than 10,000 immigrants have been arrested in Minnesota, has described some people living in the U.S. illegally as “foreign invaders.” She characterized Good’s shooting as self-defense against “an act of domestic terrorism.”

And in a press briefing Tuesday, Trump told reporters that the people being deported “make our criminals look like babies. They make our Hells Angels look like the sweetest people on Earth.”

Such descriptions have become a tool that incites violence, Chishti said.

“When they say that they were doing God’s work with Renee Good, that she was a domestic terrorist, when you frame it that way from the highest leadership of the agency, you’re basically sending a signal that there’s no accountability,” he said.

Democrats push back

State leaders who say they’re worried about violence are trying different approaches, though they can’t completely curb federal policies.

New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said state resources would not be used to assist in immigration raids, citing the shooting of Good. But local agencies in New York could still use other funds to help with raids.

New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham called for curbs on immigrant detention in the state, though two of three existing detention centers there could still continue to operate.

Colorado has launched a new system for claims of misconduct by federal agents, including ICE agents.

Democrats shrug as Trump threatens ‘sanctuary’ cities again with February funding cutoff

Some Republican-led states are taking the opposite tack, with Tennessee proposing legislation that would go beyond cooperation with federal immigration by setting up its own state immigration laws. If enacted, it would test the limits of a 2012 Supreme Court decision that struck down state-based immigration enforcement based on a similar Arizona law.

Tennessee is using White House guidance to draft the legislation, and other states are likely to follow. That would create new civil rights concerns if states pick up some of the same tactics as the federal government.

“That’s another way of unleashing the states, not only to work with the federal government, but also to acquiesce in the states’ enactment of their own immigration enforcement, detention, and removal regimes,” said Lucas Guttentag, a Stanford Law School professor who runs a project tracking federal immigration policy, speaking in a May interview published by Berkeley Journal of Criminal Law.

Combating the federal moves is already fraught, said Guttentag, who has served in immigration policy positions in the Obama and Biden administrations.

“No single political strategy can change it,” Guttentag told Stateline this week. “But litigation has proven both critical and effective in limiting some of the most egregious violations. The violence is a clear violation.”

It’s hard to police an administration that constantly pushes legal boundaries, Guttentag added.

“It’s like a ‘catch me if you can’ administration. They adopt tactics and basically challenge anyone to try to stop them.”

Two former federal prosecutors, Kristy Parker and Samantha Trepel, argued for state civil rights legislation and investigation in a Jan.14 op-ed published in The Guardian with the headline “Cities and states must hold ICE accountable for violence. The feds won’t.”

Accountability commissions — like one created by Illinois in October after ICE operations there — can help, they wrote, preserving evidence and gathering testimony in the face of federal obstruction, like the blocking of a state investigation into Good’s death in Minnesota.

Potential civil rights legislation

Another method mentioned by the former prosecutors: State civil rights legislation could theoretically give people harmed by federal agents a hearing in state court under a legal concept called “converse-1983.”

GOP redistricting could backfire as urban, immigrant areas turn back to Democrats

New York’s Gov. Hochul has proposed such legislation. A similar Wisconsin measure died in July when the Republican majority on the Assembly judiciary committee would not give it a hearing, said Democratic Rep. Andrew Hysell, the bill’s sponsor.

“It’s a positive approach to preserving our rights here in Wisconsin, our constitutional rights, because you can no longer count on the federal government to do that,” Hysell said. “In the situations we’ve seen in Minnesota, the federal government is crossing the line into what appears to be violations of constitutional rights.”

However, the idea of “converse-1983” has yet to be used successfully to sue a federal agent, and might never succeed, said John Preis, a law professor at the University of Richmond.

“I would be shocked if converse-1983 [lawsuits] went anywhere,” Preis said. “States may not enact laws that impede federal officers who were doing their jobs. A converse-1983 action would seem to do this.”

However, in some cases, such as the shooting death of Renee Good, victims may be able to successfully sue the federal government without such a state law, Preis said. The process is difficult but the lawsuit could succeed if a constitutional civil rights violation can be proven, he said.

Here are some takeaways from the arguments in the case, a crucial test for the central bank's independence.

A RULING AGAINST TRUMP SEEMS LIKELY

Comments by the justices during the two hours of ​arguments indicated that the court is not likely to grant the Trump administration's request to lift a judge's decision barring ​the Republican president ‌from immediately firing Cook while her legal challenge continues to play out. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority.

A majority of the justices seemed focused on the manner in which they should rule in favor of Cook, rather than whether they should rule for her.

David Law, a constitutional law professor at the University of Virginia, said on X midway through the arguments that ""it's already clear that Lisa Cook will be keeping her job on the Fed.""

FOCUS ON DUE PROCESS

The president announced last August on his Truth ‌Social platform that he was ​firing Cook in light of unproven allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump ​appointee, that she committed mortgage fraud. Cook has publicly denied the allegations - calling them a pretext to remove her over monetary policy differences - and has not been charged with wrongdoing.

The judge who ruled against Trump in September found that his attempt to remove Cook without notice or a hearing likely violated her right to ‍due process under the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment. Some of the justices on Wednesday suggested Cook should have been provided by the administration with a formal opportunity to address the allegations.

Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Justice Department lawyer D. John Sauer on why the Trump administration was ""afraid"" of giving Cook such a hearing. Barrett said it ""would not have been that big ⁠of a deal"" for Trump to have sat down with Cook and presented the alleged evidence against her.

KAVANAUGH A LIKELY VOTE FOR COOK

Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, ‍who like Barrett was appointed by Trump to the Supreme Court, also signaled that he is likely to rule in favor of Cook. Kavanaugh said at one point that the ""simplest ‌way to ‌decide this case"" would be to declare that ""there was insufficient process"" provided to Cook. Kavanaugh told Sauer that his arguments in the case would lead to presidents ousting Fed governors over policy disagreements and ""would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve.""

QUESTIONS ABOUT AN 'INADVERTENT MISTAKE'

Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether the evidence against Cook is more consistent with an ""inadvertent mistake"" on her part rather than intentional wrongdoing. Sauer responded that, even if Cook made a mistake on mortgage ⁠paperwork, ""it is quite a big mistake.""

Roberts seemed ⁠skeptical of that argument, saying ""we can ​debate that, how significant it is in a stack of papers you have to fill out when you're buying real estate.""

'BIG PICTURE' THOUGHTS

It seemed clear that the justices understood that a ruling in favor of Trump could upend the U.S. economy by eroding the Fed's independence.

""If this were set as a precedent, it seems to me - just thinking big ‍picture - what goes around comes around, and all the current president's appointees would likely be removed for cause on January 20, 2029, if there's a Democratic president, or January 20, 2033,"" Kavanaugh said, referring to the dates for presidential inaugurations following the next two U.S. elections.

Barrett asked Sauer about the practical implications of allowing Trump's unprecedented firing of a Fed governor, and noted ​that some economists had warned that Cook's firing would trigger a recession. Barrett asked that if ‍such a risk exists at this stage of the case ""doesn't that counsel caution on our part?""

We are far from that reality at present. As we enter a new year, global power remains decidedly in the grip of a status quo dominated by corporate politicians, war criminals, and financial elites. Led by President Donald Trump, the worst of these political mobsters represent leadership on a moral caliber with history’s most malevolent barbarians.

In Minneapolis, the murder of Renée Good on January 8 by a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent has rightly provoked an outpouring of popular grief, anger, and resistance. In turn, the Trump administration’s response makes it clear that even the pretense of accountability or expectation of due process are nonexistent for this government. With even more federal agents flooded into Minneapolis in response, this lawless administration has made it clear it is at war with the American people.

A man with a reputation for lying about almost everything, President Trump has recreated his second administration in his own likeness. It took director of Homeland Security Kristi Noem only a couple hours after the shooting to brand Good a “domestic terrorist,” claiming the ICE agent acted in “self-defense” when she attempted to strike him with her vehicle. Noem also claimed Good had been stalking and impeding ICE’s activities “all day,” even though it was only just after 9:30 am when she was shot. She offered no evidence to support these charges.

The Trump presidency is an authoritarian cancer on what’s left of the body politic of democracy, led by the mendacious real estate blowhard turned politician and his hand-picked cabinet of sycophants, grifters, opportunists, and assorted incompetents.

In fact, ICE agents reportedly waited nearly three minutes before even calling 911 emergency services. Nor did they initiate CPR on Good or allow a doctor on the scene to assess her in the moments after the shooting. Instead, ICE agents briefly assessed Good and then left her bleeding and unattended until paramedics arrived several minutes later. It was more than 10 minutes before Good, who reportedly still had a pulse, received CPR from paramedics.

MAGA’s Hack Propaganda

Not surprisingly, President Trump and MAGA loyalists in the media and elsewhere quickly echoed Noem’s fantastical narrative. But anyone who watches video of the incident and thinks this victim blaming is a closed case requiring no further investigation is just serving the cause of hack propaganda.

Incredulously, it took Homeland Security more than a week to claim the agent who shot Good, Jonathan Ross, had received medical treatment for “internal bleeding” in the torso after being hit by Good’s car. No corroborating evidence was offered in support of this claim. But what does this claim even mean? That Ross was slightly bruised after being bumped by Good’s car as she attempted to drive away? In videos of the incident Good is clearly turning her vehicle to the right (not toward Ross) as she attempted to drive away. Further, the ICE agent is plainly visible standing to the side of Good’s vehicle when he fired two more shots at her. Did Good also deserve to be shot in the face because she didn’t immediately comply with one agent’s order to exit her vehicle? Actually, the MAGA hive mind has no shortage of reasons to justify her murder. She was a “lesbian agitator” with pronouns in her bio, after all.

But not to worry. Vice President JD Vance has assured us the ICE agent who killed Good has “absolute immunity” from prosecution, a view many legal experts strongly refute. The Trumpified FBI has also barred Minnesota state criminal investigators from access to materials in the case, exposing the Trump administration’s utter disregard for both the law and the truth. Tellingly, the US Department of Justice shows zero interest in even investigating the killing, a move that has prompted resignations of several federal prosecutors in Minnesota.

It’s a sign of the urgency of our times that scheduled antiwar rallies across the United States on January 10 to oppose the recent US military assault on Venezuela and kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Celia Flores... had to be quickly amended to include a response to Good’s murder and the escalating threats from ICE.

The litany of ICE atrocities in the past year are many. For months, these thugs have terrorized American neighborhoods, pursuing a mass deportation policy that is inhumane and racist. In the first nine months of 2025 alone, approximately 220,000 people were arrested by ICE officers. Despite the president’s bogus claim that the immigration crackdown is necessary to target murderers, rapists, and gang members, more than 75,000 of those arrested last year had no criminal record. Can Trump make the same claim?

Actually, available data does not distinguish detainees with serious legal offenses from those with minor violations. In many instances, being in the United States illegally is a civil violation or misdemeanor offense, not a felony. As of early December, there were about 65,000 or more persons being held in ICE detention facilities.

The shooting of Good is also not an isolated incident of government violence. In fact, since September, ICE agents have been involved in 11 shooting incidents. In Santa Ana, California, federal officers shot two people in the face with “less lethal” projectiles, causing permanent eye damage. In Minneapolis, federal agents deployed flash-bang devices and tear gas on a family with six children in their car who were driving home from a sports practice.

The exploding lawlessness of the Trump administration now constitutes a blatant threat to democratic and human rights everywhere. Indeed, it’s a sign of the urgency of our times that scheduled antiwar rallies across the United States on January 10 to oppose the recent US military assault on Venezuela and kidnapping of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Celia Flores, initiated by the Democratic Socialists of America and the Party for Socialism and Liberation, had to be quickly amended to include a response to Good’s murder and the escalating threats from ICE.

Obviously, the military assault on Venezuela’s sovereignty was less about drugs and democracy than oil, power, and money. Maduro’s alleged complicity in narco-terrorism and weapons charges is only a specious pretext for an attack on a nation that just happens to have the world’s largest oil reserves. Venezuela’s real crime is that it operates independently of US foreign policy, which under Trump’s crudely resurrected version of the Monroe Doctrine now constitutes an unforgivable sin. Does anyone seriously believe Trump, who recently pardoned convicted former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez of drug trafficking and weapons charges, actually cares about narco-trafficking?

With escalating threats now against Columbia, Cuba, Mexico, Denmark, Greenland, and Iran, there is little coherent or reasoned policy in this intensifying US global aggression. But there is Trump’s need to distract the American people from his personal scandals and failures as a leader, and from the basic truth that he has absolutely nothing to offer to improve life for the majority of the people.

Gaza: Preface to a World Under Siege

Of course, we should not be surprised at what is happening now in the United States. Trump’s wild assault on democratic and human rights, his unhinged violent imperialism, are just the logical next expression of two years of genocidal destruction unleashed upon the people of Gaza by the Israeli state. This was a campaign of pure evil facilitated with decisive military support from both the Biden and Trump administrations.

Ironically, in 2025 the president who thought he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize conducted military attacks on seven countries, and launched air assaults on alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean. But don’t feel too sorry for Trump the Nobel loser. To thank him for bombing her country, Veneuelan right-wing coup plotter Maria Corina Machado has now given Trump her Nobel Prize. In his own name, Trump has also been awarded the Israel Prize by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a war criminal and fugitive from an international arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court.

Watching Trump and MAGA politics in action over the past year is like viewing a film documentary in reverse motion, as established rights are undone and the rule of a lunkhead mob of far-right extremists takes over.

These war criminals and obsequious grovelers before the American president can give each other all the awards they want, it won’t erase the moral censure they deserve. Whatever hope for this world exists belongs instead to the many millions of human beings who don’t support targeting Palestinian children for bullets to the head or chest, starving families, bombing hospitals and schools, the forced displacement of around 2 million people, and other crimes against humanity. They don’t believe 250,000 Palestinians deserved to die, to be maimed or left buried under rubble by a genocidal apartheid state. Nor do these many millions believe in kidnapping leaders of foreign states, bombing and threatening other nations with capricious indifference to their sovereignty, and ignoring international law.

The Trump presidency is an authoritarian cancer on what’s left of the body politic of democracy, led by the mendacious real estate blowhard turned politician and his hand-picked cabinet of sycophants, grifters, opportunists, and assorted incompetents. Watching Trump and MAGA politics in action over the past year is like viewing a film documentary in reverse motion, as established rights are undone and the rule of a lunkhead mob of far-right extremists takes over. For what it’s worth, Trump is already floating his interest in finding a way to subvert or even cancel this year’s midterm elections. That’s the direction his addled extremism is going.

Those who support the democratic and human rights of migrants and citizens, who oppose genocide and imperialist violence, are in a moment now that demands an escalation in mass action, solidarity, and resistance. Enough of the entrenched timidity of the Democratic leadership, many of whom remain hesitant even to curtail ICE funding. We need a mass united front built on grassroots organizing power, fueled by the activism, energy, and strength of unions, communities, students and everyone with a vested desire to stop ICE terror and the larger and growing authoritarian threat.

The call by labor and community leaders in Minneapolis for a general shutdown of the city on January 23—an “economic blackout”—to protest Good’s murder and the ongoing harassment, abductions, and violence by ICE is an important initiative. This means no school, no work, and no shopping. Significantly, the Minnesota Labor Regional Federation AFL-CIO has announced support for the Minneapolis Day of Truth and Freedom, demanding ICE leave Minnesota now and the agent who killed Renée Good be held legally accountable.

This call for justice represents a significant step toward building an ever more forceful campaign of popular mass resistance to the current threats to our democratic and human rights.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62701942&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2026-01-22 08:38:06.079798

She said her agents were “absolutely” allowing ICE agents access to passenger data to help with their deportation efforts.
Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., pressed McNeill whether the TSA had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents.
“We are absolutely within our authorities to share information within the Department of Homeland Security to further the national security mission,” she said, before promising to get back to McIver.
Rep. Tim Kennedy, D-N.Y., asked how many TSA employees had been reassigned to immigration enforcement, but McNeill initially deflected the question.","WASHINGTON — The acting director of the Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday defended her agency’s practice of sharing information about travelers suspected of having deportation orders with agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a House oversight hearing.

“It is not new policy to share information between the agencies of the Department of Homeland Security,” the acting TSA director, Ha Nguyen McNeill, told lawmakers in a hearing before the Homeland Security Committee. She said her agents were “absolutely” allowing ICE agents access to passenger data to help with their deportation efforts.

The New York Times reported in December that the agency was collaborating with ICE to identify air travelers subject to deportation orders, allowing immigration agents to detain them at airports and quickly deport them.

The practice came under scrutiny after it led to the arrest of Any Lucía López Belloza, a college student detained by immigration authorities at Boston Logan International Airport on Nov. 20 as she prepared to fly home to Texas for Thanksgiving. She was deported to Honduras two days later, despite a court order preventing her removal. The Trump administration later acknowledged that it made a mistake by deporting her.

The Trump administration has deported hundreds of thousands of immigrants since President Donald Trump returned to the White House a year ago, and the harsh methods of ICE agents carrying out the crackdown has incited protests across the nation.

The complaints about ICE tactics have intensified, especially from Democrats, after an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis this month. The Trump administration has defended the shooting, and conservatives, citing a video of the incident, have said the agent had reason to fear for his life. Democratic officials in Minnesota have used words like “propaganda” to describe the federal government’s account of the shooting.

During the hearing Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration that the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, declined a request to testify and so was not there to face questioning.

“The urgency in this country right now is what’s going on with ICE,” said Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y. “Why are we having a hearing with Department of Homeland Security officials who know nothing about ICE?”

With no ICE official to put on the stand, the Democrats peppered McNeill with questions about her agency’s involvement in immigration operations.

For their part, Republicans on the committee were mostly quiet when it came to the TSA’s collaboration with ICE. “There’s been a lot of talk about ICE, and, unfortunately, really outside the scope of this hearing,” said Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn. “And for that, to our witnesses, I apologize.”

Republican committee members praised TSA workers who worked without pay during last year’s government shutdown and challenged how airport security is funded in the United States.

They also asked McNeill about allegations that Somalis had smuggled cash through Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., pressed McNeill whether the TSA had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents. McNeill could not cite a specific statute or policy granting her the authority.

“We are absolutely within our authorities to share information within the Department of Homeland Security to further the national security mission,” she said, before promising to get back to McIver. “I can get you the exact policy,” she said.

Rep. Tim Kennedy, D-N.Y., asked how many TSA employees had been reassigned to immigration enforcement, but McNeill initially deflected the question.

When Kennedy pressed McNeill about news reports that air marshals from her agency were reassigned to deportation flights from commercial flights, McNeill said that providing flight security for deportation flights “was not a reassignment” and that it fell “within their mission.”

She rejected the notion that reassigning air marshals to deportation flights from commercial flights might mean a greater risk for ordinary passengers flying in the United States, saying that “providing in-flight security for deportation flights keeps our sky safe.”

The Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting immigrants lacking permanent legal status, undermining a wide range of law enforcement operations in response to mounting pressure from Trump.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01212026_tsa-tzr_tzr_183402.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-22 01:56:55.642077

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed in an email that it began on Tuesday what it’s calling “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine, after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier told Fox News that it had arrested nearly 50 people so far.

Those numbers have not been independently verified by Maine Morning Star nor community organizers because of Homeland Security’s otherwise silence on the matter and the inherent challenges with tracking people in the immigration system. Maine’s congressional delegation, the governor and local public officials have also not gotten responses from President Donald Trump’s administration about operations in Maine.

“We have no information,” said Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins Press Secretary Blake Kernen.

The community hotline tracking enforcement action in Maine began ringing continuously with reports of sightings on Tuesday, after the mayors of the state’s two largest cities announced last week that they were expecting a surge in ICE activity.

As organizers continue to crowdsource sightings and attempt to track down specifics, Project Relief Maine, Presente! Maine and No ICE for Maine are advising immigrants to shelter in place, especially in the Greater Portland area.

“Right now, it is unsafe to be outside, whether walking, driving, or waiting at bus stops,” the group posted on social media.

Sightings of federal agents in Maine were centered around Portland and Lewiston on Tuesday but on Wednesday expanded to Westbrook, South Portland, Biddeford, Scarborough, Waterville and Belfast, said Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition, which runs the hotline.

By 12:30pm Wednesday, the hotline had received 522 calls, with the most being about federal agent sightings. At the end of the day yesterday, organizers had fielded 870 calls. For comparison, the hotline received 288 calls in the entire month of December, and 195 in November.

Gov. Janet Mills said she’s monitoring ICE activity, too. “If the Federal government has warrants, then it should show them,” she said in a statement Wednesday evening. “But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the Federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors — none of which is welcome.”

Maine’s members of Congress have responded to the ICE operations in their state with varying support. While Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and independent U.S. Sen. Angus King offered clear condemnation, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden and Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins said they’re supportive so long as it is a targeted operation focused on people who have engaged in criminal activity.

DHS Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News that the agency has 1,400 targets in Maine. In an email, DHS said they are “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.” DHS only released information about four of the nearly 50 people reported to have been arrested Tuesday. Those the agency highlighted have convictions such as aggravated assault and operating under the influence of alcohol.

Maine organizers have long been preparing for ICE to arrive

Meanwhile, ICE detained an Angolan man at a routine check in on Tuesday at the Scarborough field office and his lawyer told the Bangor Daily News that he has no criminal record to justify his detention. A federal judge has ordered ICE to explain why the agency detained him.

As of the latest data from November, about 73% of people held nationwide in ICE detention have no criminal conviction. And, many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.

DHS has not responded to requests from Maine Morning Star to confirm overall arrest numbers or the reasons for those arrests.

Community impacts

Maine is not seeing a singular method for arrests. There’s been apprehensions in parking lots and of people walking in downtown areas or pulled over on the highway. “There’s a reason we call it a dragnet,” Ruben said.

As a result, he said, “Some folks have been avoiding work. Some folks have been avoiding sending their kids to school and going to appointments altogether. Some folks have been creative in working with community networks that have been established to be able to get rides to go to doctors appointments.”

It’s not only immigrants who are altering their daily lives out of fear. Ruben, who is a person of color, said he’s had people accompany him to places like the grocery store so that he is not the only one in the car.

These changes in behavior ripple out to the entire community, such as businesses that rely on foot traffic and employers who may face staffing shortages for an unknown amount of time.

MaineHealth has reported higher than usual call-outs in some segments of its workforce.

Portland Public Schools is reporting a drop in attendance. Though the specific reasons for absences don’t show up in the data, Superintendent Ryan Scallon said Wednesday during a press conference overall attendance is down more than 5%, with some schools down as much as 15-20%.

Project Relief Maine has called for the district to close for the remainder of the week, in light of a mother who was detained after dropping her child off at school.

Local police cooperation

Echoing Maine Republicans, Hyde and DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine for restricting local police cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” McLaughlin said in a statement.

Police are already not required to and generally do not have the authority to enforce immigration laws. A new state law, which won’t take effect until 90 days after the current legislative session adjourns, aims to prevent local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, while still permitting police to investigate crimes and execute judicial warrants.

However, Maine State Police is already following the law. Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck issued a directive last month that essentially implemented its underlying policies.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5436-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:56:51.501533

ICE issued another contract for the GEO Group dated Dec. 1 for the Hudson facility but redacted the terms and pricing.
Now, the 34-year-old is organizing and leading protests against the proposed ICE facility that could open in her county.
Then she heard rumors about the former private prison in Hudson being repurposed into a new ICE detention center.","HUDSON — Scores of demonstrators lined up outside a defunct private prison in northern Colorado on Wednesday then filled the Town Council’s chambers as they protested U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s plans to turn the facility into a detention center.

The prison in the small Weld County town of Hudson, about 30 miles northeast of Denver, was identified by ICE last year as a likely site of a new federal immigration detention facility.

“These are our neighbors,” Sydney Engel, who lives in nearby Fort Lupton, told the Hudson Town Council of the immigrants being apprehended by ICE. “It’s hard, but I won’t stand here and let my voice not be heard, especially living so close to this community.”

After nearly three hours of public comment from Coloradans across the state opposing an ICE facility coming to Hudson, Mayor Joe Hammock said,”Public comment is closed. Let’s move on.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado has sued ICE multiple times, forcing the agency to turn over documents that revealed plans for additional detention centers in the state, including the use of the former Hudson Correctional Facility. The most recent document release, this month, confirms ICE is moving forward with plans to turn the former private prison into what the agency is calling the Big Horn Correctional Facility, said Tim Macdonald, the ACLU of Colorado’s legal director.

The documents show ICE inked a six-month deal last year worth nearly $40 milion with contractor GEO Group for services at the Hudson prison. They also reference the Huerfano County Correctional Facility, another former private prison — in Walsenburg — that has been eyed by ICE for expanded detention capacity in Colorado.

However, most details, including operational timelines and contracts, were redacted or withheld, Macdonald said.

“They’re trying to hide what they’re doing,” Macdonald said in an interview with The Denver Post. “We know that ICE is trying to do this in secret. We’re seeing ICE act in renegade ways across the country. Shooting people, killing Renée Good in Minneapolis, shooting people in Portland. ICE has gone rogue. … We don’t know exactly how they’re proceeding with the expanded detention here, but we know they’re trying to do it in the dark without transparency, even though they’re using our public taxpayer dollars to do this. They should be accountable to us, the people.”

Representatives of Highlands REIT, the Chicago-based real estate investment trust that owns the Hudson Correctional Facility, could not be reached for comment this week. A spokesperson for ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Post.

Weld County resident Jenifer Montes helped organize Wednesday afternoon’s protest at the prison site, which drew more than 100 people. Many of those demonstrators then attended the Town Council meeting, where they addressed the elected leaders to voice their opposition to the detention center.

An October protest outside the facility drew about 70 people.

On Wednesday, Jody Whitmore, a 67-year-old Frederick resident, held a sign outside the closed prison that said “No to concentration camps in Hudson.”

Whitmore attended the Hudson protest in October and returned Wednesday even angrier than before, she said, after witnessing the recent ICE activity in Minneapolis.

“It is disgusting,” Whitmore said. “It’s out of control. The federal government is out of control, and they want to ramp it up even more.”

Whitmore said the inhumane treatment of detained immigrants was why she likened the facilities to concentration camps. “Plus they’re wasting our taxpayer dollars,” she said

Gina McAfee, 71, said there were so many misconceptions about immigrants. Growing up in Greeley, she knew many immigrants and has worked in the immigrant rights space for about 10 years.

When McAfee learned about the Hudson ICE facility, she said, she felt compelled to protest.

“I was appalled,” she said. “The inhumane treatment currently going on at the Aurora detention center is just shocking. The fact they want to add another facility is just appalling.”

State Sen. Julie Gonzales, a progressive who is challenging U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper in this summer’s Democratic primary, implored the crowd to keep speaking out.

“You all demonstrate the power of the Constitution of this country,” she said. “The Constitution protects us all. I don’t care what ICE has to say about it.”

‘The wishes of the people of Hudson’

Hudson Mayor Joe Hammock did not respond to a request for comment. Before Wednesday’s meeting, The Post also reached out to the members of the Hudson Town Council — Matt Cole, Candace Nolf, Lisa Marie Buesgens, Zachary Reyes, Don Post and Rachel E. Thwaites — asking what they knew about ICE taking over the former prison and their thoughts on the situation.

Only Reyes responded, saying in an email that as a nonpartisan elected official, his personal viewpoint was “irrelevant.” He said Hudson has not been approached by the federal government or the GEO Group — which also runs ICE’s current 1,530-capacity detention center in Aurora — regarding permits or use of the facility.

“I will always act with the wishes of the people of Hudson,” Reyes wrote.

“The town has minimal say in what the owner of the property chooses to do with their property. The town can only enforce code requirements set forth with current ordinances in effect both locally and with the state. … We as the council know just as much about the rumors as you, the public, knows.”

Macdonald said a review of the town documents suggests Hudson officials believe ICE is moving ahead with the detention center, which could open within a year. Hudson has about 1,600 residents, and the new ICE facility effectively would double the town’s population with an expected capacity of about 1,300 detainees.

“That doesn’t even include workers, so the demand for water will go through the roof, and we know from their planning documents they’re concerned about how they’re going to manage that and what that will mean for existing water uses in Hudson,” Macdonald said.

The documents turned over to the ACLU also revealed:

ICE last year issued a contract to the GEO Group for more than $39 million for six months of services, between April and October, at the Hudson facility.

ICE issued another contract for the GEO Group dated Dec. 1 for the Hudson facility but redacted the terms and pricing.

ICE redacted more than 100 pages of documents from late August that appeared to be in justification of why the agency should award a sole contract to the GEO Group for the Hudson facility without full and open competition.

A contract for the Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center, valued at less than $100,000, was submitted to the Department of Homeland Security for approval in August. No details about whether the proposal was approved could be located. Documents previously obtained by The Washington Post indicated ICE planned to add 28 beds to the existing Southern Ute detention center in Ignacio.

Another potential detention site, the former Huerfano County Correctional Facility in Walsenburg, was declared “funded,” but no additional details about the facility could be found in the documents.

Macdonald said the addition of any ICE detention centers in Colorado would be “a travesty.”

“They’re housing people who have in large measure never been accused or convicted of any crimes whatsoever,” Macdonald said. “They are people who have come to this country for a better life, and the way we treat them reflects on the values we have as a society. When we mistreat immigrants who are in civil detention, that’s a sign of how our government is treating all of us, so people should care when our government abuses the civil rights of anyone in our community.”

‘Nobody should have to live in fear’

Before this summer, Montes wasn’t an activist, but increasing ICE activity lit a fire beneath her. Now, the 34-year-old is organizing and leading protests against the proposed ICE facility that could open in her county.

“I don’t want to be on the wrong side of history,” Montes said. “I don’t want to look back and say all this happened before my eyes and I just stayed silent just because I was scared of some white guy.”

Montes’ parents came to the United States illegally from Mexico but now have legal status. Her family moved to Colorado in 2007, a year after one of the largest immigration raids in U.S. history played out at a Greeley meatpacking plant.

“We knew about it, and I have had family that worked there. And it’s something you always think about,” Montes said.

When ICE activity ramped up across the nation and in Colorado last year under the Trump administration’s push for mass deportations, Montes said she was too scared to speak up.

Then she heard rumors about the former private prison in Hudson being repurposed into a new ICE detention center.

“That’s way too close for comfort,” Montes said. “I wanted to be more involved and help the community also be prepared instead of just living in fear because nobody should have to live in fear.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GRE-L-HudsonICEProtest0121-0531x.jpg?w=1024&h=701,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:41.175303

WASHINGTON—Yesterday, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed its opposition to a renewed motion to dismiss made by the DC Board of Elections, which FAIR is suing over DC’s law letting aliens—including illegal aliens and diplomats—vote in DC local elections. In the suit, FAIR represents Ralph Chittams and five other registered U.S. citizen voters in DC. (DC politician Stacia Hall, formerly the lead plaintiff in the case, has moved away from DC and withdrawn from the case.)

In its motion to dismiss, the Board of Elections claims that DC has a rational basis for the alien voting law, since the law is meant to expand DC’s political community to include resident aliens who are affected by the outcome of local elections.

In its opposition, FAIR shows that DC’s law in fact has no rational basis. The Supreme Court has ruled that, under the Constitution, the political community of the United States—including localities such as DC—consists only of U.S. citizens. DC has no legitimate governmental interest in, and therefore no rational basis for, expanding its political community beyond the limits set by the Constitution.

The reason for these limits is obvious. Since 1776, the people of the United States—that is, American citizens—have always been regarded as the ultimate sovereign of this country. That is, citizens have a right to govern themselves through voting and holding office. This right is infringed if U.S. citizens are, in part, governed by the votes of citizens of foreign countries.

“‘We the People’ established the Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “That means the people are sovereign, and laws like DC’s that diminish that sovereignty and deprive Americans of their right to govern themselves violate the Constitution. We hope the Court sees that, because DC’s law lets those who are not part of the American people govern in America, it is unconstitutional at the most basic level.”

I want to thank every Portlander for making their voice heard about ICE's presence in our city. I agree with those saying loud and clear that our public safety is undermined by the actions taken by federal agents. That is why I called on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed of the January 8 shooting by federal agents in the Hazelwood neighborhood.

Regarding the notice of violation issued to the ICE facility, we must follow the process. Any attempt to unilaterally revoke the conditional land use approval would surely be challenged. We cannot allow hasty action to prevent us from taking meaningful action.

The land use process is just one way the City is standing up to federal overreach. We are fighting back with legal action. We are fighting back as a Sanctuary City that does not assist federal immigration enforcement. We are fighting back with the Protect Portland Initiative, passed unanimously by the City Council. We are fighting back alongside you and will continue to do so with every legal and legislative tool we have available to protect our residents' civil and human rights.

The Trump administration is ramping up its aggressive approach to immigration as it begins its second year.

The Associated Press reported today that an internal memo shows some new federal immigration officers have been trained to forcibly enter homes without a judge's warrant, a sharp reversal of guidance that protected constitutional limits.

That comes amid news that ICE's latest surge has targeted the state of Maine. At least 50 people were arrested there earlier this week. Some top local officials have condemned ICE's aggressive approach, including Portland Mayor Mark Dion during a news conference today.

Mark Dion, Mayor of Portland, Maine: While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. What we have been concerned with as a council is the enforcement tactics that ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations.

Geoff Bennett:

In Minnesota, there's been no letup in ICE's surge there now in its third week. Today, a federal appeals court put a hold on a lower court's order that had restrained federal immigration agents' use of force against peaceful protesters.

State and local officials are continuing to push back against the federal presence in the Twin Cities. And more details are coming to light about a naturalized U.S. citizen with no criminal record, according to his family, who was arrested and detained by ICE in an incident that went viral.

Chongly Scott Thao, a resident of St. Paul, Minnesota, was later released and spoke recently about the ordeal after he was pulled from his home out through the snow.

Chongly Scott Thao, Detained By ICE:

So I just said, OK, let's open the door, see what they want. And then, suddenly, there's guns pointed at us. I was like, whoa. Then, suddenly, they just handcuffed me. They didn't ask for my I.D. or anything until after they handcuffed me.

Geoff Bennett:

And we are joined now by Kaohly Her, the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota.

Thank you for being with us.

Give us the latest picture of what's happening right now on the ground in your city with federal immigration enforcement. And is there any coordination between ICE and local law enforcement?

Kaohly Her, Mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota: So there is no coordination between ICE and local law enforcement. We are not informed when they go out on their assignments or who they're targeting. We do not get that kind of information.

And I think that that is what is causing the environment on the ground right now. People are afraid. They are frustrated. They are angry. But, I mean, there's also a lot of hope that we see on the ground as well with the love and the care and the kindness that people are showing each other. And so I feel hopeful about what can be the outcome, even if it feels like there's despair all around us right now.

Geoff Bennett:

The police chief of the Minneapolis suburb Brooklyn Park said that off-duty police officers of color had been targeted by ICE, at least on one occasion with guns drawn.

Are St. Paul officers seeing that kind of activity?

Kaohly Her:

We are seeing accounts of off-duty officers being stopped by ICE. This is not an isolated incident of in the Brooklyn Park area. We have heard accounts across the state of law enforcement being stopped by ICE.

Geoff Bennett:

I also want to ask you about this incident in St. Paul where protesters disrupted a church service where one of the pastors is an ICE official.

At this moment, when tensions are already high, do you believe entering a house of worship during a service is an acceptable form of protest or does that cross a line?

Kaohly Her:

You know, there is an active investigation into that situation. I wouldn't -- police did arrive on the scene, but by the time they got there, the individuals who disrupted the service were already gone.

So I can't expand too much on really that particular situation, but I will say that, for me personally, I am somebody who is a person of faith. I'm a Christian. I think that places of worship are sacred spaces. But I have said this before, is that, if our federal government and our friends from the other side of the aisle want us to respect sacred spaces, which I believe are churches, a place of worship is a sacred space, that means that we have to also respect other spaces, such as hospitals, places of which people are needed to get exams or needed to be treated because of the hands of ICE have been injured.

That means that schools, where children are present, should be off-limits. And so I think that it is really important that if there's going to be call for respecting sacred spaces, then our federal government and the agents of the federal government should be respecting those sacred spaces as well. That is the only way that we're going to bring calm and order back to our city is if everyone on both sides of the spectrum agree that they're going to respect sacred spaces.

Geoff Bennett:

You are among a number of Democratic state and local officials to receive a Justice Department subpoena tied to an investigation into alleged disruption of ICE operations.

What's your reaction to being subpoenaed and how will your office respond?

Kaohly Her:

Yes, I mean, I wasn't surprised by it.

Our president has stated very clearly that he -- that there's retribution to be paid by states and municipalities that do not agree with him. And so -- but we remain committed to protecting our residents, our neighbors and our communities. It doesn't change the process or our actions moving forward.

But, yes, I wasn't surprised by it.

Geoff Bennett:

How do you intend to respond?

Kaohly Her:

I mean, we are having our legal team look at it right now. I mean, we will -- we are law-abiding citizens. We will comply with this subpoena.

But it doesn't mean that it's lawful what has been done and what we have been served with. But we will comply and we will work with our legal team to figure out the best steps forward.

Geoff Bennett:

What do you want people to know about what's happening in your city right now and how the folks you represent are responding?

Kaohly Her:

I mean, I think it's important for people to remember that they should not just believe in the rhetoric from their sides of the party, that the -- what I'm hearing out there is, if people would just comply with the law, that if they would just not resist, that if they were here legally, that they have nothing to worry about, that they shouldn't be scared.

And that is just not true. I mean, ICE has made it very clear, the federal government, HSI, has made it really clear that anybody in the path of anything that they're -- any task that they're executing on or any mission that they're executing on in that, they are fair game. And so we're allowing people to target based on the way someone looks and the way that they sound.

And now we have incident after incident after incident of American citizens being detained and being injured at the hands of ICE, people with no criminal record at all. We are hearing more of those cases than actual situations where somebody had a criminal record or is a danger to our communities, that we are hearing less of those stories and more of just everyday Americans being targeted.

We should not listen to the rhetoric of just our own sides of the party and hear the real stories of individuals who have been impacted. And I want people to know that this administration can punish our city and can punish our state, but they will never break our spirit, and that we will show and continue to love each other and create networks to support each other and that we will continue to show kindness to those who are the most hurt by what this federal government is doing.

We will continue to be Minnesotans.

The group released a copy of a memo dated May 12, 2025, and apparently signed by Todd Lyons, the acting leader of ICE, that advises agents that they can enter homes on the basis of an administrative warrant.
An administrative warrant is different from a judicial arrest warrant.
A judicial arrest warrant is a court order based on probable cause that a crime was committed.
The May 12 memo acknowledged that relying on administrative warrants to enter homes would be a new practice.","A whistle-blower group on Wednesday said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials drafted guidance saying that deportation officers are allowed to enter homes to arrest people without a judicial warrant.

The claim was based on information provided by two government officials, said the group, called Whistleblower Aid. The group released a copy of a memo dated May 12, 2025, and apparently signed by Todd Lyons, the acting leader of ICE, that advises agents that they can enter homes on the basis of an administrative warrant.

An administrative warrant is different from a judicial arrest warrant. It is typically drawn up after an immigration judge has ordered someone deported, and serves as the basis to arrest them. A judicial arrest warrant is a court order based on probable cause that a crime was committed.

Whistleblower Aid said the guidance violates the constitutional protection from unreasonable search and seizure.

“D.H.S.’s new policy to permit arrests in an alien’s residence, without a judicial warrant or consent, is a complete break from the law and undercuts the Fourth Amendment and the rights it protects,” Whistleblower Aid said in a statement. “As far as our clients understand, D.H.S. has failed to articulate any change in the law to allow for a policy reversal of this magnitude.”

The Times has not independently verified the memo or spoken to the whistle-blowers involved, who are described as two U.S. government officials. The whistle-blowers’ claim was reported earlier by The Associated Press.

One Homeland Security Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, had not seen the memo but said their understanding was that the idea was piloted in one or two locations earlier this year.

The whistle-blower group said that the memo was not widely distributed within ICE. Rather, some ICE officials were provided an opportunity to read the memo in the presence of a supervisor and give it back. One of the whistle-blowers, according to the group, said that agents were entering homes without judicial warrants in Texas, and that the practice was carried out there because of the conservative judges in the area.

Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, called for hearings and demanded an explanation from the Homeland Security Department’s leader, Kristi Noem.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Mr. Blumenthal said in a statement. “It is a legally and morally abhorrent policy that exemplifies the kinds of dangerous, disgraceful abuses America is seeing in real time.”

Department of Homeland Security officials did not contest the specific allegations made by the whistle-blower group.

“Every illegal alien who D.H.S. serves administrative warrants/I-205s,” said Tricia McLaughlin, an agency spokeswoman, has had “full due process” and a final order of removal from an immigration judge.

“The officers issuing these administrative warrants also have found probable cause,” she added. “For decades, the Supreme Court and Congress have recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement.”

ICE officers historically have relied on people voluntarily opening the doors of their homes to make arrests, or by tracking down targets in public spaces. The inability to enter homes has long stymied officers, in part because rights advocates advise immigrants not to open their doors when immigration officials arrive.

A 2025 Homeland Security training manual indicated that the agency itself agreed that entering homes without a judicial warrant was prohibited.

“Entering a home to arrest a person without a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement is typically a violation of the Fourth Amendment, regardless of whether the officer has probable cause to arrest the suspect,” the manual reads.

The May 12 memo acknowledged that relying on administrative warrants to enter homes would be a new practice.

“Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence,” the memo reads, “the D.H.S. Office of General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

The memo adds that officers and agents must knock and announce themselves first but says that if an immigrant does not respond, they can use a “reasonable amount” of force to enter the home.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/13/multimedia/21dc-ice-warrant/13nat-minneapolis-protests-01-jlqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:45.580494

Ahmed said that she was in the area when she believes ICE were targeting two men she did not know, only for agents to shove her to the floor. She said that one of them called her a racial slur before putting her into a vehicle, where she said she met another woman who was detained.

""We were holding each other tight. I'll never forget the fear that we both felt in our hearts that day,"" Ahmed said, ""they pushed me hard, they used a lot of violence.""

Ahmed spent the next two days detained, only to be released without any charges. The 23-year-old was born in the United States and WCCO found no evidence of a criminal record.

Her story is one of many reported instances where ICE has detained an American citizen without charging them since Operation Metro Surge began in December. MN Ice Witness, a website driven by independent citizens, is recording media reports that detail these detainments. According to their efforts and WCCO's own review, ICE has detained at least 12 Americans, at times violently. DFL Representative Mohamud Noor shared video which he said shows ICE pulling an American man from his car in St. Cloud on Wednesday.

During a press conference on Tuesday, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino did not answer a question about the number of Americans ICE has detained. The agency provides no public data regarding these arrests, with many of those involved accusing the agency of profiling them. WCCO has asked multiple times for data related to American detainments, questions the agency is choosing to ignore.

Can courts review a president's determination that he has fired a governor of the Federal Board -- Federal Reserve Board for cause?
Ali Rogin: The Supreme Court, Amy, has had to weigh in on a number of these sort of existential questions this term.
And the Supreme Court in that case said, essentially, the Fed is special, and don't worry about the Fed.
And so the case of Lisa Cook today suggests that the Supreme Court does regard the Fed as special.","Geoff Bennett:

The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments today in a landmark legal battle centered on President Trump's efforts to shape the Federal Reserve in his image.

Our justice correspondent Ali Rogin has more on the case that could threaten the independence of the nation's Central Bank -- Ali.

Ali Rogin:

Geoff, you may recall it was a key moment in the president's standoff with the Federal Reserve. Back in August, President Trump posted on his social media platform that he was firing one of the Central Bank's governors, Lisa Cook, alleging she'd committed mortgage fraud.

But Cook, who was appointed by President Biden, sued Trump to block her removal, claiming her firing was illegal, and lower courts have blocked her dismissal. A majority of the justices had tough questions today for Solicitor General John Sauer, expressing skepticism about the rushed nature of the case and Cook's lack of recourse.

Samuel Alito, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice:

Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody, by the executive branch, by the district court, by the D.C. Circuit, in such a hurried manner?

Ketanji Brown Jackson, U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice:

Was Ms. Cook given the opportunity in some sort of formal proceeding to contest that evidence or explain it?

D. John Sauer, U.S. Solicitor General:

Not a formal proceeding. She was given an opportunity in public because she was notified.

Ketanji Brown Jackson:

In the world?

D. John Sauer:

Yes.

Ketanji Brown Jackson:

Like, she was supposed to post about it, and that was the opportunity to be heard?

Ali Rogin:

The case comes as the Trump administration has moved to exert greater control over the Federal Reserve. This month, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into Chairman Jerome Powell over comments he made to Congress about a building project.

For analysis on today's argument, we're joined now by ""News Hour"" Supreme Court analyst and SCOTUSblog co-founder Amy Howe and David Wessel, director at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings institute.

Thank you so much, both of you for being here.

Amy, this case has massive implications for the independence of the Federal Reserve. What were the key questions that were being looked at today and what are your major takeaways?

Amy Howe:

So the key questions -- I mean, as a really technical matter, the questions before the justices was simply whether to leave in place an order by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., that leaves Lisa Cook in office.

This case came to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. The Trump administration was seeking permission to fire Cook and asking the justices to put this order by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb on hold. And after nearly two hours of oral arguments today, the justices seemed inclined to leave Cook in office, to turn down the Trump administration's request to pause Cobb's order.

The real question is how they are going to do it. Are they going to just send the case back to the lower courts and let the litigation play out there? Or are they going to try to resolve some of the thorny issues that are in play, things like what does it mean for the president to fire someone for cause? Can courts review a president's determination that he has fired a governor of the Federal Board -- Federal Reserve Board for cause?

What kind of process is someone entitled to before she can be fired? And the justices really sort of weren't sure. Several of them seemed inclined to send the case back to the lower courts. Chief Justice John Roberts, on the other hand, seemed to suggest that the court maybe should go ahead and decide the case right now.

Ali Rogin:

Yes, it was interesting, David. Some of the conservative justices seemed to engage in some of those thorny questions that Amy was talking about.

Justice Kavanaugh raised concerns about what this attempted dismissal code means for the Fed's independence. He said that, if the president alone can determine whether somebody can be removed for cause and what that cause is, that that could -- quote -- ""weaken, if not shatter the independence of the Fed.""

Why is the independence of this body so important?

David Wessel, Brookings Institution:

So the argument is that politicians, if they set interest rates, will tend to sit them too low in order to get more growth now and at the cost of more inflation later.

And so the U.S. and other major capitalist democracies have decided it would be better to have an independent Central Bank that is insulated from that political pressure. The Fed has a mandate set by Congress, maximum employment and price stability. And Congress has said, you guys decide what's the best interest rate to achieve that goal.

Ali Rogin:

And we have heard from a number of bankers, economists had written briefs in favor of Lisa Cook today, saying why this would be such a bad idea.

Why is there so much concern now over the firing for cause of just this one person on the Board of Governors?

David Wessel:

If President Trump gets his way, he will be able to fire any Fed governor for anything he deems is cause. The administration argues that the courts can't even review that.

So, for instance, his attacks on Jay Powell, the Fed chair, over the building, the Fed's handling of the building, not its finest hour, by the way, could become perhaps a reason to fire him for cause. And if the president can get rid of all seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, he would have control.

In fact, one of the questions that lawyers were asked today was, well, if we let Trump do this, will his successor just do the same and get rid of all the Trump appointees?

Ali Rogin:

The Supreme Court, Amy, has had to weigh in on a number of these sort of existential questions this term. They have looked at different ways the president has tried to exert control. They heard a case just this month, last month, about Rebecca Slaughter, a member of the Federal Trade Commission whom Trump had dismissed.

How is the court grappling with Trump's efforts to reshape the federal government in this major way?

Amy Howe:

So up until the case of Lisa Cook, the Supreme Court has green-lit Trump's efforts to remove the heads of independent multimember agencies. And so most of that has happened on the court's emergency docket.

The Supreme Court has given the OK to the Trump administration to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, even though there are similar statutes that only allow the president to remove officials at those agencies for cause.

And then the Supreme Court heard oral arguments, as you said, in December, in the case of Rebecca Slaughter, a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission whom Trump fired. And they seemed inclined to rule in favor of the Trump administration.

So in one of the orders on the emergency docket, the Supreme Court rejected an argument that members of the NLRB and the MSPB had made that said, if you are allowed to -- if Trump is allowed to fire us, what happens to the Fed? Because the statutes are similar.

And the Supreme Court in that case said, essentially, the Fed is special, and don't worry about the Fed. And so the case of Lisa Cook today suggests that the Supreme Court does regard the Fed as special.

Ali Rogin:

Yes, we are now worrying about the Fed.

David, last question to you.

Today's arguments, of course, were part of a longstanding -- just the latest in the longstanding effort by President Trump to take on the Fed. We mentioned the investigation into Jerome Powell. It's hard not to look at these things all in concert together. Are they all of a piece, or should we be looking at them discretely?

David Wessel:

They are definitely all of a piece.

I mean, as Amy pointed out, the court is a hard time here to explain why the Fed is special. I can argue why the Fed is special, but I don't have to make a legal argument. Jerome Powell was in the courtroom today, and I think that was a reminder to the justices that this is not about one Fed governor who may or may not have made a mistake or cheated on her mortgage application.

This is about the very concept that people are appointed to the Federal Reserve Board for terms of up to 14 years, and they can only be removed for cause, and most of the justices seem to think that whatever she did on her mortgages wouldn't qualify.

But prosecutors have only filed a handful of criminal cases related to the protests since Ms. Good was killed.","Federal prosecutors issued subpoenas on Tuesday to at least five Democratic officials in Minnesota, ramping up the Justice Department’s investigation into their response to the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown in the state, according to two people familiar with the matter.

The subpoenas sought documents from Gov. Tim Walz, Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and Mayor Kaohly Her of St. Paul related to their policies on immigration enforcement efforts in the state. Similar subpoenas sought information from Keith Ellison, the state attorney general, and from Hennepin County, where Mary Moriarty, the county attorney, has said she has jurisdiction to investigate the fatal shooting this month of a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, by a federal immigration agent.

The subpoenas, all of which were formally served on the officials’ offices, represent a significant expansion of the inquiry into Minnesota leaders that was disclosed late Friday. The investigation was initially said to have focused on Mr. Frey and Mr. Walz, who have both criticized the crackdown. But it now appears that prosecutors will also scrutinize other public officials.

While the subpoenas did not cite a specific criminal statute, the inquiry as a whole was said to center on whether elected officials in Minnesota had conspired to impede the thousands of federal agents who have been in the state since last month looking for undocumented immigrants. But the investigation is likely to run up against stiff pushback for examining political speech and conduct that is traditionally protected by the First Amendment.

The shooting of Ms. Good, an unarmed mother of three, has led to sustained protests against federal agents in Minneapolis. In the immediate aftermath of Ms. Good’s death, Mr. Frey used an expletive to demand that agents leave the city. Mr. Walz has also sharply criticized the agents’ conduct, asking residents to monitor their efforts.

Justice Department leaders, in turn, have vowed to arrest anyone impeding the agents’ mission. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, recently accused Mr. Frey and Mr. Walz of “encouraging violence against law enforcement” and referred to their actions as “terrorism.” But there is no evidence that either man has incited violence — let alone engaged in acts of terrorism.

The investigation into the elected Democrats comes as the Justice Department has all but announced that it will not bring charges against Jonathan Ross, the agent who killed Ms. Good. Instead, the department has signaled that it intends to scrutinize possible connections between Ms. Good and her partner, Becca Good, and left-wing protesters in Minnesota.

That decision led to the resignation last week of six prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Minneapolis. Among those who quit was Joseph H. Thompson, the office’s second in command, who oversaw a sprawling fraud investigation that President Trump and his allies have repeatedly used to criticize Democratic leaders in the state.

Federal investigators have refused to cooperate with state and local officials like Mr. Ellison and Ms. Moriarty, who have the power to open their own inquiries into Ms. Good’s killing. But the additional subpoenas could further complicate those efforts.

In recent days, the Trump administration has started enlisting prosecutors and agents from other states to travel to Minnesota to assist in pursuing criminal cases against protesters they claim have impeded the activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Over the weekend, Attorney General Pam Bondi pressed U.S. attorneys in Midwestern states to provide personnel.

Ten federal prosecutors from Michigan have been assigned to work in Minnesota for the time being, according to people familiar with the matter. Additional prosecutors are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.

Administration officials have repeatedly said that ICE agents have been under sustained assault from protesters. But prosecutors have only filed a handful of criminal cases related to the protests since Ms. Good was killed.

The Justice Department needs additional personnel in part because so many senior prosecutors left the Minneapolis office rather than follow orders from the department’s leaders to conduct a criminal investigation into Ms. Good. The office already faced a significant staff shortage because many prosecutors had left last year as the Trump administration offered buyouts and encouraged prosecutors to quit.

To try to address the shortage, Justice Department leaders plan to draw staff from six states: Michigan, South Dakota, North Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Wisconsin, according to people familiar with the matter and internal department communications.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/dc-minnesota-tzqh/dc-minnesota-tzqh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:56:54.564217

According to Vincent, Montco Community Watch estimates ICE has detained at least 140 people in the county since the crackdown began.","A nationwide immigration crackdown has cast waves of fear, frustration and uncertainty throughout the Montgomery County seat.

More than 70 people gathered Tuesday evening for a vigil outside Norristown Municipal Hall to call attention to a surge in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the community.

“This community is under siege by ICE,” said Stephanie Vincent, a lead organizer with Montco Community Watch. “What people are seeing in Minnesota is not new — the violence, the kidnapping, the disrespect for due process is happening right here in our towns and in Norristown.”

The candlelight gathering coincided with a municipal council meeting. Organizers used the public comment section to demand transparency from the Norristown Police Department regarding its relationship with ICE.

“We see them all the time together,” said Denisse Agurto, executive director of Unides Para Servir Norristown.

Agurto began her public comment with a mask on — a mask she said ICE officers often wear when patrolling along Marshall Street.

Norristown does not honor ICE detainer requests unless accompanied by a “validly executed judicial warrant.” The municipality also discourages government departments, including the police, from sharing information with the federal agency.

However, Norristown police chief Michael Trail acknowledged that officers do have contact with ICE agents. Trail told WHYY News that his department is “trying to balance” its responsibilities, but he said his officers are not assisting ICE.

“When you’re seeing a Norristown police officer in the proximity of an ICE agent, it’s natural assume that we’re assisting, but lot of times we are called there for other ancillary reasons or quite frankly, I would like our officers there because I want our officers to know and I want federal law enforcement to know that we’re out here protecting our community,” Trail said.

Trail met with Agurto shortly after her public comment, and the two shared a dialogue outside of the council’s chambers.

Despite the blistering cold Tuesday night, the vigil drew members from various communities in and around Norristown.

“We are reminded that whereas it is not a sin or moral failing to not have worldly paperwork, it is a sin and moral failing to turn away our neighbor,” said Rev. Leslie Mamas, of Olivet-Schwenkfelder United Church of Christ in East Norriton.

According to Vincent, Montco Community Watch estimates ICE has detained at least 140 people in the county since the crackdown began.

“We’ve crossed into the territory where ICE has become the law enforcement arm of a fascist regime,” Vincent said. “And it’s time to start saying that out loud. It’s time to say that our public officials, our towns cannot work with this organization. It’s not acceptable, it’s not OK, and it’s about defending the Constitution.”

The Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good by ICE officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has only heightened tensions.

“We were always saying that something is going to happen — like somebody’s going to be killed,” Agurto said. “And now we are seeing this.”

The Department of Justice is not actively investigating the circumstances of Good’s death. Instead, the federal government has pushed prosecutors to look into Good’s widow, sparking resignations among some prosecutors. Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would open the door for the deployment of active-duty troops.

“I’ve been a registered Republican my whole adult life and what’s happening in this country is making me — I don’t even recognize it anymore,” said vigil attendee Fiona Palladino, of King of Prussia.

Palladino said she’s a nurse who works with a 911 agency. She reiterated testimony from some of the public speakers that people are reluctant to call 911 for medical attention.

“They’re afraid, and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to reassure people, ‘We’re not the cops. You’re safe with us. We’re not the cops,’” she said. “But that right there is going to discourage people from getting help, and there are going to be real injuries. There are going to be real deaths due to this kind of thing.”

Palladino called on people to “step up and be out here.” Lori Warren, of West Norriton, said she came out to support her fellow neighbors.

“I’m a white middle-aged woman, so I’m privileged, and I’m using my privilege to come out and to let our neighbors know that they’re not alone and that we want our police to protect them just like they would protect us,” Warren said.

Vincent said it’s a “pivotal moment” for police. She wondered aloud if ICE descends en masse on the Philadelphia area as it has in Minneapolis, how would local law enforcement respond?

“Are the police going to protect them?” she asked. “Are the police going to stop them?”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/norristown-ice-vigil-KC-012126-09.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 01:37:54.765203

Arthur,,,,,https://cis.org/Arthur/NYT-Tries-Measure-Trump-II-Deportations,"From FY 2014 until Trump II, however, most illegal entrants weren’t Mexican nationals, and importantly at certain times weren’t single adults (let alone males), either.
The good news for Trump II is that those pre-FY 2014 border demographics have returned, for now.
Under the George W. Bush and Obama administrations in FY 2009, ICE set its most recent record for interior removals, nearly 238,000 that fiscal year.
Interior removals tapered off thereafter, however, falling 72.6 percent from that record by FY 2016 (65,332).
230,000 Interior Removals With that background, the Times reports there have been 230,000 ICE interior removals since Trump returned, out of what it terms 540,000 “deportations”.","A recent article in the New York Times is headlined “How Many People Has Trump Deported So Far?” The stats offered by the “Gray Lady” look fairly accurate, but the story it’s attempting to tell — that Trump II is lagging prior administrations in “deporting” removable aliens from the United States — is suspect. That’s largely because of the facts the “newspaper of record” conveniently ignores — particularly about the correlation between “at large” arrests and “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

“What Is a Deportation?”

The Times asks the question “What is a deportation?”, which is fundamental to its analysis.

But then the article fails to answer that critical question, asserting: “Counting deportations is not as straightforward as it seems because there is not a specific legal definition.” Perhaps an outlet that holds itself in high esteem should check its own archives (colloquially the Times’ “morgue”).

The reason there’s no “specific legal definition” for “deportations” is because Congress formally retired it nearly 30 years ago (for legal reasons), swapping out both that term — which referred to the expatriation of aliens who had entered the United States — and “exclusions” (which referred to aliens stopped and turned around at the ports and borders) for “removals”.

“Removal” refers to the expulsion of aliens ordered removed by DHS under the “expedited removal” process in section 235(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as well as those ordered removed by immigration judges at the end of administrative “removal proceedings” process under section 240 of the INA.

To be fair, most — expert and casual observer alike — continue to use “deportations” to refer to removals, because it’s a term we all understand.

Vestiges of that retired term continue to haunt the INA, including when Congress delineated the grounds of removability for aliens who have been “admitted” to the United States (as defined in section 101(a)(13)(A) of the INA) in section 237 of the act, captioned “Deportable aliens”.

The real goal the Times is attempting to achieve is valid, which is measuring the number of removable aliens who have left the United States since Donald Trump returned, including: aliens removed under final removal orders, aliens turned around at the borders and the ports, crewmen with denied requests to land, and otherwise removable aliens who left on their own accord (so-called “self-deportations”).

The newspaper’s effort is complicated by the fact that various administrations have fudged their “deportation” totals for decades by lumping in “turn-arounds” at the borders and the ports (as well as crewmen) with more formal removals.

The Obama administration was likely the most egregious offender in that regard, which is why you should take characterizations of the 44th president as the “deporter in chief” with a grain of salt.

It was a title he gleefully accepted in a failed gambit to pass the amnesty he desperately desired, but at this point it’s so baked into the analysis it’s unfair to judge his successors by any other metric.

By the way, measured in this manner, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush would share the “deporter in chief” title for the 1.864 million removals and returns they oversaw in FY 2000, with Reagan a close finisher at 1.61 million in 1986. In contrast, Obama broke 850,000 just once, in FY 2010.

The Demographic Shift in Illegal Immigration

For most of his administration, Obama (and his predecessors) had a “deportation” advantage Biden and Trump didn’t: Prior to FY 2011, illegal migrants at the Southwest border were almost exclusively single adults — mostly male — from Mexico, and even up to FY 2014, the majority were.

When Border Patrol agents apprehend a single adult from Mexico at the Southwest border, they can generally process the alien and turn him back to Mexico in about eight hours. That’s a “deportation” under that continuing Obama-era calculus.

The problem is that about a quarter of those FY 2011 illegal migrants were “recidivists”, meaning they came back after they were turned around, and when they were apprehended again and returned once more, officially counted as a second deportation.

Given that the Southwest border recidivism rate was 30 percent or higher between FY 2005 (when DHS first attempted to capture that statistic) and FY 2009, you can understand how specious Obama’s record on “deportations” was.

From FY 2014 until Trump II, however, most illegal entrants weren’t Mexican nationals, and importantly at certain times weren’t single adults (let alone males), either.

In FY 2019, the high point for illegal immigration under Trump I, just 19.5 percent of the 851,500-plus Southwest border apprehensions involved Mexican nationals, and more than 64.5 percent involved either adult migrants entering illegally with children in “family units” (“FMUs”, 55.6 percent) or “unaccompanied alien children” (“UACs”, 8.9 percent) travelling alone.

Thanks to a combination of poorly reasoned court decisions and equally poorly considered laws, DHS had to release nearly all of those FMUs and UACs, and because most of the single adults were “other than Mexican” (OTMs), they couldn’t be quickly turned around, either.

Trump I responded to that OTM/FMU surge with the “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP), also known as “Remain in Mexico”, under which a small number of OTM FMUs and single adults were sent back across the border to await their asylum hearings, but that process didn’t produce “deportations” even under the lax Obama-era standards.

The good news for Trump II is that those pre-FY 2014 border demographics have returned, for now.

Of the 79,507 illegal migrants apprehended at the Southwest border between last February (the first full month of Trump II) and December, two-thirds (67 percent or 53,395) were Mexican nationals, 86 percent of whom were single adults.

Because, again, those Mexican nationals can be quickly returned, that flow boosts total “deportations” under the lax Obama-era “deportation” definition the Times prefers, but because Southwest border illegal entries have fallen by more than 90 percent under Trump II, it also detracts from the total.

The differences in border apprehension and return totals between the current administration and the last one are why the Times argues “the total number of deportations since Mr. Trump took office [is] 540,000 — fewer than in the last two years of the Biden administration, when border crossings were at record highs”, but the higher Biden numbers signal the weakness of his policies, not their strength.

More aliens attempted to enter illegally under Biden because they assumed (usually correctly) that they’d be able to remain. Fewer are coming now because they understand they likely won’t be allowed to stay, and lower attempted entries means more border security, or as Congress termed it, “operational control”.

“Interior Removals”

As I’ve explained in the past, the key metric for measuring the effectiveness of immigration enforcement efforts is ICE “deportations” of aliens within the United States (as opposed to at the border), formally known as “interior removals” (a term of art, even if it’s news to the Times). Here’s why that’s true.

Border enforcement is “reactive” because generally, DHS can’t control the number of migrants who come to the border illegally.

Biden was the exception to that rule, because by releasing nearly all (88.5 percent) of the illegal entrants who arrived at the borders and the ports, his administration spurred the largest illicit migrant surge in U.S. history, while (ironically) also boosting “deportations” of the rest under the Times’ flawed reasoning.

Interior enforcement, on the other hand, is proactive: DHS must identify, arrest, detain, and prosecute those aliens before it removes them.

Under the George W. Bush and Obama administrations in FY 2009, ICE set its most recent record for interior removals, nearly 238,000 that fiscal year. Interior removals tapered off thereafter, however, falling 72.6 percent from that record by FY 2016 (65,332).

That decline occurred when the Obama administration added a new wrinkle to interior removals, focusing its interior enforcement efforts at first (in March 2011) to a degree and then (in November 2014) almost exclusively on criminal aliens living in the United States.

That Obama “criminal alien” standard has come to define the purpose of “deportations” in the collective minds of many Americans and most in the media, which is why you see so many hit pieces now that deride ICE under Trump II for arresting “non-criminal” aliens in the interior.

“Deportation Is Crucial”

Trump supporters and many on the right usually respond to such attacks by noting most of those aliens are “criminals” because it’s a crime to enter the United States illegally (under section 275 of the INA) or highlighting the crimes “otherwise law-abiding aliens” must commit to remain here, like identity theft.

Those points are true and indisputable, but they miss three more important points.

First, it’s impossible to secure the border against a surge in illegal migrants, drugs, and other contraband if would-be migrants believe that if they can enter illegally and avoid the cops once they are here, they will be inoculated against “deportation”.

Second, the cognate to the (legitimate) focus on the due process rights of aliens in removal proceedings is the duty of the United States to remove aliens who have been accorded that due process and ordered removed.

Simply put, aliens have some level of protection under the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause, but so do Americans in the removal process, which is why ICE represents their interests in immigration courts.

Third, as Barbara Jordan explained:

Deportation is crucial. Credibility in immigration policy can be summed up in one sentence: Those who should get in, get in; those who should be kept out, are kept out; and those who should not be here will be required to leave. The top priorities for detention and removal, of course, are criminal aliens. But for the system to be credible, people actually have to be deported at the end of the process.

If the lead-up to the November 2024 elections demonstrated anything, it’s that Americans’ support for even legal immigration inevitably declines when they realize our immigration system lacks credibility and fails to serve our “national interest”.

Restoring credibility to our immigration system requires removals, regardless of whether those aliens are criminals or not. Obama may have minimized non-criminal removals, but there’s no reason ICE must continue to play that game.

230,000 Interior Removals

With that background, the Times reports there have been 230,000 ICE interior removals since Trump returned, out of what it terms 540,000 “deportations”.

Assuming that interior removal statistic is correct, the agency has fallen just slightly short of that (most recent) FY 2009 record of almost 238,000 interior removals, but then again: (1) ICE is far outperforming interior removals during the Biden years; and (2) is doing so in a much more challenging environment.

The Times concedes the first point but let me explain the second.

The Center defines “sanctuary jurisdictions” as:

cities, counties, and states [with] laws, ordinances, regulations, resolutions, policies, or other practices that obstruct immigration enforcement and shield criminals from ICE — either by refusing to or prohibiting agencies from complying with ICE detainers, imposing unreasonable conditions on detainer acceptance, denying ICE access to interview incarcerated aliens, or otherwise impeding communication or information exchanges between their personnel and federal immigration officers.

As I explained to Congress last May, while some jurisdictions implemented sanctuary policies decades ago, the movement really took off in response to DHS’s mid-2010s “Secure Communities” program. Basically, state and local support for ICE enforcement took a nosedive around 2014.

Which brings me to the following excerpt from the Times’ article:

In the past, ICE made most of its arrests in partnership with local jails and prisons, quietly taking into custody immigrants who had already been arrested by another law enforcement agency.

. . .

Arrests at jails and prisons went up over the past year, but the increase was far exceeded by the growth in what ICE calls “at-large” arrests, the apprehensions of immigrants on the streets, in courthouses, and at homes and businesses. These quadrupled to about 150,000 and made up a majority of immigration arrests in 32 states and Washington, D.C.

They were most common in states like California, Illinois and New York, where local governments have passed laws blocking local jails and prisons from transferring people to ICE custody.

The Times doesn’t use the word “sanctuary”, but “laws blocking local jails and prisons from transferring people to ICE custody” are the definition of such policies. Its omission of the term was deliberate.

In any event, that article includes a map of the states in which ICE has made “at-large” arrests under Trump II, concentrated almost exclusively in the Northeast (including New York and Massachusetts), the Northwest (Washington and Oregon), Illinois, and (curiously) Alaska.

Except for Georgia, at-large arrests are significantly lower south of Virginia and (aside from Oklahoma) in the Plains states and in the Southwest.

That at-large arrest map correlates with the Center’s sanctuary jurisdiction map, which explains why clashes between protestors and ICE officers are almost exclusively limited to a few areas.

As I recently explained, three states (Texas, Florida, and Tennessee) accounted for more than a third of all ICE arrests, because those states mandate cooperation by local officials with immigration authorities.

When ICE can simply pick up a criminal alien from a “secure location” like a jail or prison, officers don’t need to hit the streets looking for them.

When the agency is barred by sanctuary laws from arresting those aliens as soon as they are released from state and local custody, however, it must go into the community looking for them, and the pervasiveness of such laws explains a separate chart in the Times article showing a rise in “at-large” arrests under Trump II.

A Toxic Mix of Stupidity and Political Calculation

Two weeks after Trump returned, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison issued an opinion finding that counties in his state could not hold criminal aliens on ICE detainers.

That, of course, forced ICE officers into neighborhoods looking for those criminal aliens, and soon, officials in the Land of Ten Thousand Lakes began vilifying the agency’s enforcement efforts, with Gov. Tim Walz (D) referring to ICE as “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo” and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) claiming the agency’s “activities are largely built around terrorizing people”.

That was a month before Frey told ICE to “Get the f*** out of Minneapolis”, and the situation has since devolved into a toxic mix of stupidity and political calculation with Walz, Frey, and the rest egging on (likely) well-meaning but misinformed and occasionally violent protestors who attempt to interpose themselves between ICE officers and arrest targets.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/newyorktimes-social.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:52.795383

After rumors circulated social media over the weekend suggesting possible U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in and around Bellingham’s public schools, the district is confirming the posts were just that — rumors.

“There has been no ICE activity on Bellingham school properties,” Bellingham Public Schools spokesperson Dana Smith said in a statement to The Bellingham Herald.

Smith said two unrelated incidents — one involving police activity in the Columbia neighborhood on Friday and another involving a 10-minute “Hold” safety protocol at Shuksan Middle School to keep the halls clear to support students — may have created confusion.

“These two things seem to have combined into misinformation about ICE activity at or near our schools. The schools involved have been connecting directly with concerned families and answering their questions,” Smith told The Herald.

No ICE agents had visited Bellingham Public Schools as of Tuesday, Jan. 20, according to Smith. However, the district prepared and provided guidance last year for its school leadership and offices.

That guidance includes:

All visitors must abide by the district’s visitor policy and procedure 4200, which are designed to prevent disruption.

All visitors must report to a school’s main office or reception area.

No visitors may have access beyond a main office or reception area without permission of the school.

No visitors may disrupt educational proceedings of a school.

No visitor is entitled to information about or access to a student unless they have proper documentation showing that they are entitled to that information.

District office personnel will take the lead in all interactions with requests of immigration officers or other law enforcement.

Under a very limited set of circumstances, ICE agents may visit schools and request access to students. To enter a school past the main office or reception area, officials would need to present a judicial warrant, which is issued by a judge or court.

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, good morning.
MIKE BARNICLE: Leader Jeffries, the Department of Justice is not the same Department of Justice that existed 12 or 14 months ago.
LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, that definitely is one of the projects that I think we’re going to need to work on.
House Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York, thank you very much for your time this morning, sir.","Today, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries appeared on MS NOW’s Morning Joe, where he made clear that, one year into Donald Trump’s term, House Democrats will continue to hold the Trump administration accountable for the corruption and extremism they are unleashing on American communities and their failure to fulfill the promise of lowering the high cost of living.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Let’s bring in right now, House Majority—Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York. I’m sorry there was a little time lapse to next year, still Minority Leader for now but before we go to that, I want to say, first of all, Independent voters, a plurality, close to a majority, are now calling for the elimination of ICE. I don’t think a lot of mainstream Democrats on the Hill want to do that, but the polls are breaking that way. So, Minority Leader Jeffries, before we get to funding for DHS and their brutal tactics which, by the way, it sounded even like Donald Trump was suggesting that they made a mistake in the killing of Renee Good. I’m curious about the Epstein Transparency Act that you passed well over a month ago. The Department of Justice was required by law, in an almost unanimous House vote and Senate vote, required to release all the files. They’ve only released about 1% of those files, most of those heavily redacted. What can you do, what can Democrats do, to answer the pleas of even MAGA Republicans—

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: When are they coming?—

JOE SCARBOROUGH: Who want these files released and want the White House to stop hiding them?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, good morning. The Department of Justice has completely and totally failed to comply with the law under that statute that was passed and of course signed by Donald Trump, almost unanimously enacted by both the House and the Senate. The DOJ was required to turn over the Epstein files by December 19th. A month has now passed, more than five million documents have failed to be released and the Department of Justice has not provided any reason that justifies their obstruction. The American people deserve the transparency and accountability connected to the release of the Epstein files. And, in my view, to the extent that Republicans are actually interested in making sure that that transparency occurs, then the Department of Justice needs to either come up to Capitol Hill and explain why they’ve failed to comply with the law or be held in contempt of Congress.

WILLIE GEIST: Leader Jeffries, as you know, Republicans, the Justice Department in particular, are saying there’s so many files, there’s millions of files, it’s going to take us a while. Are you buying that explanation and, if not, what do you suspect?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, from the very beginning of this whole sordid saga, Trump administration officials have claimed that they want to release these files, that they plan to release these files, they’re now compelled to release these files by a law that was passed in the Congress, and yet they continue to obstruct. And so, clearly, I think the American people can reasonably conclude they’re hiding something. Right? Who are they protecting is the question that we need to get a real answer to because the American people simply deserve the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

JONATHAN LEMIRE: Leader Jeffries, let’s switch gears now and talk about the upcoming government funding bill, whether the government will perhaps even shut down as that deadline approaches. A thorny issue is funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and in particular ICE, in the wake of that fatal shooting in Minneapolis a couple of weeks ago. Talk to us about the divisions that you and your colleagues feel. What happens next?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, ICE is completely and totally out of control. Donald Trump promised with respect to immigration enforcement that the administration was going to target violent felons who are here in the country illegally. That’s something the American people support. The American people do not support the targeting, the arrest, the detention, the brutalization of American citizens, certainly do not find acceptable the killing of Renee Nicole Good and the targeting of law-abiding immigrant families and communities. And so, I think from our standpoint, and we’ll have a discussion in about an hour in our Caucus meeting about the path forward, but clearly there needs to be accountability mechanisms that is put into law so that ICE conducts itself like every other law enforcement agency in the United States of America. That’s not too much to ask. So some of the things that we believe are appropriate in this instance, are demanding be part of any final bill, are a warrant requirement. That’s common sense. ICE should not be able to storm houses of worship, hospitals and schools. That’s common sense. That relates to protocols that exist for every other law enforcement agency in the country. ICE should have a use-of-force standard. None currently exists. Of course, the notion that masked ICE agents are running around brutalizing American citizens, utilizing taxpayer dollars, completely and totally unacceptable. And so these are the types of things that we believe should be put into place to get ICE under control, consistent with the demands of the American people.

MIKE BARNICLE: Leader Jeffries, the Department of Justice is not the same Department of Justice that existed 12 or 14 months ago. Hundreds of prosecutors have left. The FBI has been stripped of a lot of skillful agents who left the Department of Justice. I realize you are in the minority, but what can be done to restore the integrity and the skill level of the Department of Justice?

LEADER JEFFRIES: Well, that definitely is one of the projects that I think we’re going to need to work on. From our standpoint, we’ve got two pillars that we need to proceed with as we move forward. One, of course, is affordability and making sure that we are driving down the high cost of living, fixing our broken healthcare system. Donald Trump promised that costs would go down on day one. Year one has passed. Costs haven’t gone down. They’ve gone up. But in addition to the affordability agenda that we’ll aggressively push, we need accountability. And Pam Bondi and the Department of Justice, they’ve weaponized this institution against political enemies. Highly qualified individuals have left, and they’re proceeding with impunity. And so from my standpoint, there have to be consequences for some of the outrageous things that have been done. Congress needs to function like a separate and co-equal branch of government as opposed to what my Republican colleagues have done, which is a reckless rubber stamp for Donald Trump’s extreme agenda. We’re going to continue to press the case, to elevate, to make the Department of Justice great again, but the reality is that work is not really going to happen in a meaningful fashion until Democrats take back control of the House of Representatives after the November midterm elections.

MIKA BRZEZINSKI: All right. House Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Hakeem Jeffries of New York, thank you very much for your time this morning, sir. We appreciate it.

The Trump administration has tried a number of different tactics, with varying degrees of success, including starting civil rights investigations and pressuring schools to sign agreements with the administration.","The Trump administration has abandoned one of its major efforts to restrict diversity and equity programs in schools and colleges.

The effort was a threat by the administration to withhold billions of dollars in education funding from states and schools that refused to sign a document attesting that they did not have diversity and equity programs. Education groups sued in federal court and won a favorable ruling in August, which the government then appealed.

But on Wednesday, the administration withdrew its appeal. The federal judge in Maryland who heard the case, Stephanie Gallagher, ruled against the Trump administration on multiple grounds. She found that the administration had not followed proper procedure in attempting to withhold the funding, and that the underlying policy threatened educators’ free speech in the classroom.

The case was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, the American Sociological Association and a school district in Eugene, Oregon. Randi Weingarten, president of the AFT, said the case was the most important of the 22 lawsuits that her union had filed, along with partner groups, against President Donald Trump in his second term, because of the precedent it would establish for limiting executive power.

“You cannot, by executive fiat, rewrite 60 years of educational opportunity,” Weingarten said in an interview, referring to the civil rights laws that protect students from racial discrimination in schools.

Though the lawsuit succeeded in staving off one threat to withhold funding, Weingarten acknowledged that the administration has “other ways of getting to the same result” of rolling back diversity and equity programs in education.

The organization hosted a press conference Wednesday morning in Downtown Orlando asking residents to speak out against the current administration. Republicans, though, are encouraging ICE to continue doing its job.

“The happiest place in the world has turned in to show me your papers city,” said on of the Democratic Party leaders.

Within the last week, the Orange County Democratic Party said there have been confirmed reports of ICE seeking warehouse space in Orlando. Democratic leaders said there have also been confirmed reports of up to 200 hotel rooms booked by ICE in and around Orange County.

Leaders gathered on Wednesday to speak out against those moves and to say ICE is making residents live in fear.

“A person was taken, we don’t know where they are, is that the country we want to build?” another Democratic leader voiced.

Governor Ron DeSantis said ICE is simply doing the job it’s asked to do. He said its partnership in Florida is the largest joint immigration enforcement operation in ICE’s history.

In the wake of those operations, democratic speakers said they want Central Floridians to be informed, prepared, and knowledgeable about their rights, and that these implications will extend far beyond just immigrants.

“The price will be at the grocery store, when we need a roof fixed after a hurricane,” another Democratic leader said.

DeSantis said he is proud of ICE’s work and said the mission will continue in the state.

In addition to the Governor, Channel 9 has reached out to multiple Republican leaders and the Orange County GOP.

Republican Representative Byron Donalds responded, saying, “What Democrats are doing to obstruct, impede, and sabotage ICE is treasonous. The American people granted President Trump a mandate to deport illegal aliens and Make America Safe Again. As Governor, any Florida official who blocks these lawful actions will be removed from office.”

We also received a lengthy statement from the Orange County GOP:

It should be of serious concern to all residents of Orange County when any elected official or community leader takes actions or supports efforts that hinder law enforcement. Recent statements and actions by local Democratic leadership appear to align with advocating for individuals who break the law rather than supporting those who uphold it.

The Republican Party of Orange County stands firmly with our law enforcement professionals and with victims of crime. We support fair, respectful treatment of those who protect our communities and the vigorous prosecution of those who violate our laws.

Central Florida, including Orange County, experiences a disproportionately high volume of human trafficking activity. Far too often, victims — including women and children — are trafficked across state lines or international borders by heartless criminals, and it is law enforcement that leads the rescue and recovery efforts.

Federal, state, and local agencies — including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — play a critical role in identifying and dismantling trafficking networks. These operations also require the support of facilities, transportation, and safe housing to ensure that survivors receive the care and resources they need.

If local Democrat leaders were genuinely concerned about the well-being of our tourism and hospitality economy, they would stand with law enforcement and support efforts to protect vulnerable individuals and public safety.

Our Governor and President are charged with enforcing the law. Florida is a state where justice is not negotiable — Orange County should be committed to upholding the rule of law and delivering justice to those who deserve it.

Don’t Minneapolis our Orlando.

In a statement, a Trump administration spokesperson appeared to signal that targeting Maine was a political response to the ongoing feud between the president and the state’s governor, Democrat Janet Mills.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” said spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

But rumours have swirled that Maine was singled out for its significant Somali American population in the cities of Portland and Lewiston. Estimates put the total number of Somali Americans in the state at about 3,000.

Trump has repeatedly denounced the Somali community over the past several months, comparing its members to “garbage” at a December cabinet meeting. As recently as Tuesday, he used his White House podium to call Somalis and Somali Americans “ a lot of very low IQ people”.

Racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric has been a trademark of Trump’s campaigns for public office, and he has repeatedly singled out specific groups – including Haitians and Mexicans – to falsely tie their immigrant identity to pervasive criminal activity.

Parallels with Minnesota

Trump’s focus on the Somali community comes after a handful of members were implicated in a fraud scandal in Minnesota, a midwestern state where immigration enforcement operations were launched in December.

Those efforts have been marked by violent clashes between federal agents and protesters, and one woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, was shot dead in her car after an interaction with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Fears that those tensions could spill into Maine dominated a Wednesday news conference with city officials in Portland.

Mayor Mark Dion told reporters that immigrant communities in the region felt “anxious and fearful” as ICE agents began their crackdown.

“They see this action as unpredictable and a threat to their families,” he explained.

He also questioned whether a heavy-handed operation was necessary to address immigration infractions in the area, and he called on ICE to adopt different tactics than it had in Minnesota.

“I want to underscore one important point: While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes,” Dion said.

“Federal immigration law is lawful. Its administration and enforcement is lawful,” he added. “What we’ve been concerned with, as a council, is the enforcement tactics that ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations.”

Nevertheless, Dion expressed optimism that ICE would adopt a more tailored approach to apprehending local suspects.

While the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, has seen nearly 2,000 immigration officers flood its streets, the mayor predicted that Maine would not see the same “massing of federal agents”.

“We’re seeing very individualised activity by ICE. A person here, a neighbourhood there,” he said. “Their conduct, at least as it is current in Maine, seems to be focused, which would indicate to me – and this is the speculation – that they’re functioning on the basis of an actual court warrant.”

That, he said, marked a departure from the “random, show-me-your-papers kind of experience” that residents had experienced in Minnesota.

Outrage at ICE operations

Still, while Dion advocated for a wait-and-see approach to the ICE operation, other city officials took a harder stance.

One Portland city councillor, Wesley Pelletier, described the unfolding raids as part of “an agenda of white nationalism and might makes right”.

“This is a war of terror that’s being waged on our city by the federal government,” Pelletier said. “We’ve seen people of all ages getting thrown on the ground and getting thrown into trucks.”

So far, Fox News quoted ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde as saying the agency had made 50 arrests so far as part of operation “Catch of the Day”. Hyde added that ICE had identified nearly 1,400 individuals to detain in Maine.

Wednesday’s statement from the Department of Homeland Security highlighted four arrests as examples, showing people from Sudan, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Angola.

It described the four individuals as “the worst of the worst” and accused them of crimes ranging from aggravated assault to endangering the welfare of a child, though it was unclear in one case if the accusation had resulted in a conviction.

“We are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,” McLaughlin said in the statement.

But Democratic officials in the state suggested that the Trump administration had refused to coordinate in the lead-up to “Catch of the Day”, heightening anxiety on the local level.

On January 14, nearly a week before the operation was launched, Governor Mills posted on social media that she had “attempted, unsuccessfully thus far, to confirm” the upcoming surge in federal immigration enforcement.

In a video statement, she said the state had reached out to local governments in Portland and Lewiston to prepare. She added that she too felt “angry” about the expected surge.

“Our goal, as always, will be to protect the safety and the rights of the people of Maine,” Mills said.

“To the federal government, I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused. Those tactics are not welcome here to the people of Maine.”

She also took a jab at the trend of federal agents using masks and other facial coverings to conceal their identities.

“Look, Maine knows what good law enforcement looks like because our law enforcement are held to high professional standards,” Mills said. “They are accountable to the law. And I’ll tell you this: They don’t wear a mask to shield their identities, and they don’t arrest people in order to fill a quota.”

A political rivalry

Mills and Trump have long been political adversaries, with their feud erupting in a public forum. In February last year, shortly after Trump returned to office for a second term, he hosted a White House gathering for governors, where he called out Mills personally.

“Is Maine here? The governor of Maine?” Trump said while outlining policies barring transgender athletes from sporting events. “Are you not going to comply with it?”

“I’m complying with state and federal law,” Mills responded. The tension escalated from there.

“You’d better comply because otherwise you’re not getting any, any federal funding,” Trump shot back.

“See you in court,” Mills replied.

“Good. I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that. That should be a really easy one. And enjoy your life after, governor, because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics,” he said.

The interaction made national news and cemented the frosty relationship between the two leaders, with Trump demanding an apology and slamming the Democratic governor for months afterwards.

His administration also took a series of escalating actions designed to target Mills, including launching an education probe in her state, suspending a marine research grant and freezing other federal funds to Maine.

In response to this week’s ICE deployment, Mills issued a short statement acknowledging the Trump administration’s latest efforts.

“Together, we will continue to place the safety and civil rights of Maine people above all else, and remain vigilant in our defense of due process and the rule of law,” she wrote.

Maine is set to hold its next gubernatorial race in 2026, as part of the year’s midterm election cycle.

Having served two terms as governor, Mills is not eligible for re-election and will instead be making a run for the US Senate, challenging Republican incumbent Susan Collins.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26021760239518-1769044359.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-22 00:36:52.131211

Homeland Security also argued that limiting federal officers’ ability to retaliate puts officers and the public in danger.","The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked an injunction Wednesday that prevented federal immigration officers from retaliating against demonstrators.

A Friday ruling by U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez had prevented the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement from detaining or tear gassing people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest, including observing Operation Metro Surge, which is the feds’ name for the incursion of over 3,000 immigration officers and agents in the Twin Cities.

The Wednesday decision granted Homeland Security its request for an administrative stay of Friday’s preliminary injunction. Ten of the 11 judges in the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted the stay, were appointed by Republican presidents, including four judges appointed by President Donald Trump.

The court decisions stem from a December lawsuit filed by six plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU. The six named plaintiffs were all observing ICE last year, either in cars or on foot, when they were threatened, pepper-sprayed or arrested by federal agents, according to the lawsuit.

The Trump administration argued in a motion filed on Tuesday that the lawsuit is based on five incidents in December that plaintiffs can “only speculate may recur,” and that plaintiffs can’t establish constitutional violations. Homeland Security said that the district court’s finding of a pattern of misconduct by ICE agents was “overblown.”

Federal immigration agents are facing backlash from local leaders, businesses and residents for their behavior as raids have ramped up in Minnesota.

The killing of 37-year-old Renee Good at the hands of federal agent Jonathan Ross has galvanized the opposition to the federal operation.

In the past few weeks, federal agents have shot a second person during an arrest; arrested U.S. citizens including a barely-clothed 56-year-old Hmong man who was misidentified by officers; and deployed tear gas and other chemical irritants against observers, protestors and bystanders, including at Roosevelt High School during dismissal hours after Good was killed.

Homeland Security also argued that limiting federal officers’ ability to retaliate puts officers and the public in danger. As an example, the government argued that tailing federal agents’ vehicles — an increasingly common tactic among community patrollers looking to disrupt ICE operations — is an “inherently dangerous activity.”

Menendez, in the preliminary injunction, had declared following ICE vehicles to be a legal and protected activity that does not justify a vehicle stop or arrest by agents.

The Reformer spoke to a protester, a U.S. citizen, who was detained for hours last week after following ICE vehicles and was never charged.

Susan Tincher, one of the named plaintiffs of the December lawsuit, drove to the scene of a reported ICE raid in north Minneapolis on Dec. 9 and exited her car. According to the lawsuit, she stood on the sidewalk six feet away from the nearest officer and asked the agents on the scene if they were ICE. The officers moved towards her, ordered her to “get back,” then pulled her to the ground. Officers handcuffed Tincher while she was face-down in the snow, according to video of the event reviewed by the Reformer.

The agents took Tincher to the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling; shackled her legs; cut off her wedding ring, bra and boot laces; and held her in a cell for five hours before releasing her.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_637-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:26.387556

For their part, Republicans on the committee were mostly quiet when it came to the T.S.A.’s collaboration with ICE.
They also asked Ms. McNeill about allegations that Somalis had smuggled cash through Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
Representative LaMonica McIver, Democrat of New Jersey, pressed Ms. McNeill whether the T.S.A.
had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents.","The acting director of the Transportation Security Administration on Wednesday defended her agency’s practice of sharing information about travelers suspected of having deportation orders with agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a House oversight hearing.

“It is not new policy to share information between the agencies of the Department of Homeland Security,” the acting T.S.A. director, Ha Nguyen McNeill, told lawmakers in a hearing before the Homeland Security Committee. She said her agents were “absolutely” allowing ICE agents access to passenger data to help with their deportation efforts.

The New York Times reported in December that the agency was collaborating with ICE to identify air travelers subject to deportation orders, allowing immigration agents to detain them at airports and quickly deport them.

The practice came under scrutiny after it led to the arrest of Any Lucía López Belloza, a college student detained by immigration authorities at Boston Logan International Airport on Nov. 20 as she prepared to fly home to Texas for Thanksgiving. She was deported to Honduras two days later, despite a court order preventing her removal. The Trump administration later acknowledged that it made a mistake by deporting her.

The Trump administration has deported hundreds of thousands of immigrants since President Trump returned to the White House a year ago, and the harsh methods of ICE agents carrying out the crackdown has incited protests across the nation.

The complaints about ICE tactics have intensified, especially from Democrats, after an immigration agent shot and killed an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in Minneapolis earlier this month. The Trump administration has defended the shooting, and conservatives, citing a video of the incident, have said the agent had reason to fear for his life. Democratic officials in Minnesota have used words like “propaganda” to describe the federal government’s account of the shooting.

During the hearing on Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration that the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, declined a request to testify and so was not there to face questioning.

“The urgency in this country right now is what’s going on with ICE,” said Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York. “Why are we having a hearing with Department of Homeland Security officials who know nothing about ICE?”

With no ICE official to put on the stand, the Democrats peppered Ms. McNeill with questions about her agency’s involvement in immigration operations.

For their part, Republicans on the committee were mostly quiet when it came to the T.S.A.’s collaboration with ICE. “There’s been a lot of talk about ICE, and, unfortunately, really outside the scope of this hearing,” said Representative Andy Ogles, Republican of Tennessee. “And for that, to our witnesses, I apologize.”

Republican committee members praised T.S.A. workers who worked without pay during last year’s government shutdown and challenged how airport security is currently funded in the United States.

They also asked Ms. McNeill about allegations that Somalis had smuggled cash through Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Representative LaMonica McIver, Democrat of New Jersey, pressed Ms. McNeill whether the T.S.A. had legal authority to share passenger data with ICE agents. Ms. McNeill could not cite a specific statute or policy granting her the authority.

“We are absolutely within our authorities to share information within the Department of Homeland Security to further the national security mission,” she said, before promising to get back to Ms. McIver. “I can get you the exact policy,” she said.

Representative Tim Kennedy, Democrat of New York, asked how many T.S.A. employees had been reassigned to immigration enforcement, but Ms. McNeill initially deflected the question.

When Mr. Kennedy pressed Ms. McNeill about news reports that air marshals from her agency were reassigned to deportation flights from commercial flights, Ms. McNeill said that providing flight security for deportation flights “was not a reassignment” and that it fell “within their mission.”

She rejected the notion that reassigning air marshals to deportation flights from commercial flights might mean a greater risk for ordinary passengers flying in the United States, saying that “providing in-flight security for deportation flights keeps our sky safe.”

The Department of Homeland Security has diverted thousands of federal agents from their normal duties to focus on arresting undocumented immigrants, undermining a wide range of law enforcement operations in response to mounting pressure from Mr. Trump.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/21/multimedia/21trump-news-tsa-ice-lbth/21trump-news-tsa-ice-lbth-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:36:40.934522

While “Abolish ICE” may be the only position emotionally consonant with justified outrage over its agents’ conduct, it’s not necessary at all if the goal is simply to radically change the immigration-enforcement status quo.
The national debate over lax immigration enforcement then played an unquestionably major role in Trump’s return to power in 2024.","For two overriding reasons, Democrats are intensively debating what to say and do about the future of ICE. First and most obviously, that agency is running wild in Minneapolis and other cities, pursuing a very deliberate policy of terrorizing immigrant communities and their allies in order to (a) encourage “self-deportation” and (b) titillate Donald Trump’s MAGA base. ICE has become the tip of a spear that seems aimed not only at mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, but at the military occupation of politically hostile territory by an increasingly authoritarian administration.

Second, an appropriations package that includes money for ICE (along with the rest of DHS, plus multiple other federal agencies) has become the flash point in another potential (if partial) government-shutdown cliff on January 30, which is when the stopgap-spending bill that ended last year’s total government shutdown expires. Many Democrats within and beyond Congress want to dramatize their opposition to what ICE is doing by voting against the new money, even though (as other Democrats argue) it won’t stop ICE for a moment thanks to the special slush fund for mass deportation created by last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

While nearly all Democrats oppose both current ICE tactics and Trump’s entire mass-deportation regime, the funding fight has exposed an increasingly large gulf between those who advocate abolishing ICE and those who seek to reform the agency. The latter camp isn’t necessarily a solid bloc; there’s language in the above-mentioned spending bill that authorizes body cameras and other measures for ICE accountability that some reformers consider inadequate. But without question, ICE abolition advocates have a lot of momentum among congressional Democrats and ICE resisters nationally (including, notably, Mayor Zohran Mamdani). One very recent poll from Economist-YouGov showed self-identified Democrats favoring the abolition of ICE by a margin of 77 percent to 19 percent (Americans generally were split right down the middle on the proposition). So is this the line in the sand the party generally should draw? Has Trump’s toxic immigration crackdown now made ICE abolition a mainstream position with little political downside?

While “Abolish ICE” may be the only position emotionally consonant with justified outrage over its agents’ conduct, it’s not necessary at all if the goal is simply to radically change the immigration-enforcement status quo. ICE has been around since 2003. Its agents weren’t masked until March 2025. ICE (along with the allied Border Patrol and Homeland Security Investigations agencies) wasn’t deployed to achieve mass deportation until a Trump executive order one year ago yesterday. The administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden didn’t publicly defend brutal tactics or accuse immigration-enforcement protesters of being “terrorists.” Columnist Will Bunch recently spoke out in opposition to Democratic efforts to reform ICE on grounds that “You can’t reform fascism.” Were the Obama and Biden administrations “fascist”?

More than a few progressives (and particularly advocates for undocumented immigrants) did indeed believe that enforcement of immigration laws generally, and deportation practices specifically, were too harsh during past Democratic administrations. In 2020, famously, most Democratic presidential candidates called for the decriminalization (or, in some cases, abolition of felony charges for immigration violations) of illegal border crossings. The national debate over lax immigration enforcement then played an unquestionably major role in Trump’s return to power in 2024. And as recently as September, a Washington Post–Ipsos survey showed only 29 percent of Americans trusted Democrats more than Republicans on immigration policy.

So despite widespread and steadily increasing public disapproval of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, Democrats aren’t on such solid ground that they can embrace some total abandonment of immigration enforcement without courting political peril. There’s no evidence that Americans actually want the “open borders” stance that Republicans have falsely accused Democrats of embracing in the past. Embracing it now makes little sense. The broadest and strongest position for Democrats right now is the abolition of both mass deportation and ICE terror tactics, alongside a new path to citizenship for noncriminal immigrants and fairer and more uniform enforcement of immigration laws without the sort of violence and cruelty perpetrated and celebrated by Trump, J.D. Vance, Kristi Noem, and Stephen Miller. Anyone who thinks such a position represents a surrender to MAGA needs to remember how and why these terrible people rose to power in the first place.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1fc/007/6707938cb73235ced6b571189472b9d18f-abolish-ice.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:31.449110

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is aiming the push at Somali immigrants living in the north-eastern state, according to reporting by the New York Times.

The initiative officially began on Tuesday. In comments provided to the Guardian, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent agency of ICE, said: “Some of the arrests of the worst of the worst from the first day of operations include criminal illegal aliens convicted of horrific crimes including aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child.” The government provided criminal histories related to four arrestees out of approximately 50 ICE said had been arrested so far, with no details on the backgrounds of the others.

The move follows similar efforts occurring in Minneapolis over recent weeks that have sparked demonstrations and prompted criticism of forceful methods used by ICE and border patrol officers, both on people pursued for deportation and on protesters and activists who warn communities when immigration enforcement activity is spotted nearby.

Thousands of enforcement officers have been mobilized to Minnesota. ICE has faced a storm of criticism, including from local officials, after the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month by an ICE officer, followed by the FBI excluding local prosecutors from the official investigation into the tragedy. The large Somali American community in Minnesota has been a particular and repeated target for Donald Trump.

Patricia Hyde, deputy assistant director of ICE, told Fox News on Tuesday that close to 50 people have been detained so far in Maine as part of what she described as an immigration enforcement surge.

Hyde also said ICE has compiled a list of 1,400 individuals in Maine it intends to target. ICE officers shown in TV footage on Fox News making arrests so far were masked and all had their faces blurred, while the faces of those being apprehended were not.

Many asylum seekers from a number of African nations who have entered the US have made Maine their home, adding to the Somali community that began forming there in the early 2000s when refugees settled in Lewiston. Maine is still largely white and has one of the oldest populations nationwide.

Meanwhile, many businesses have increasingly turned to immigrant workers to address labor shortages, as many native-born workers have retired or left the labor force.

The US attorney’s office in Maine had hinted at the coming operation in a statement issued Monday urging the public to demonstrate peacefully.

“In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,” said Andrew Benson, the US attorney in the state. “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

On Tuesday, the mayor of Lewiston, Carl Sheline, said in a statement that ICE agents had increased their presence in the state’s second-largest city. He urged calm and encouraged residents to “check in on one another”.

Last week, the Trump administration said it would end temporary protected status (TPS) for Somalis living in the US, giving hundreds of people two months to depart or face removal.

The administration had first signaled plans to revoke protections for Somali nationals in November, when Trump posted on his Truth Social account about Minnesota, which has a large Somali population, writing: “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from.

The 1776 Project Foundation, created by the 1776 Project PAC, targeted in its lawsuit a Los Angeles Unified School District policy that provides smaller class sizes and other benefits to schools with predominantly Hispanic, Black, Asian or other non-white students. It dates back to 1970 and 1976 court orders that required the district to desegregate its schools.

The group said the policy amounts to racial discrimination and violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

The lawsuit calls for a permanent injunction to prevent the school district from using race preferences in “operating, funding, advertising, or admitting students into school programs.”

A district spokesperson said they were unable to comment on the specifics of pending litigation.

“Los Angeles Unified remains firmly committed to ensuring all students have meaningful access to services and enriching educational opportunities,” the district said in a statement.

More than 600 schools in the district are classified as predominantly Hispanic, Black, Asian or other non-white, while less than 100 are not, the lawsuit said.

Students that attend a school under this designation receive extra points when applying to magnet schools, and they are required to have at least two parent-teacher conferences per year, according to the district's Student Integration Services website. These schools are also required to have student-teacher ratios of 25 to 1 or less, compared to other schools that are allowed to have classroom ratios of as high as 34 to 1, according to the lawsuit.

The 1776 Project Foundation's mission is to “create and disseminate policies that will promote academic achievement and revitalize our educational system for families and students across the nation,” according to its website. It does so primarily by putting money behind local school board candidates, pushing back against “progressive pedagogy” and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, its website said.

The group's members include a parent whose children are enrolled in a Los Angeles school that is not classified as predominantly Hispanic, Black, Asian or other non-white, according to the lawsuit. Because of the district's policy, those children were denied certain benefits such as admission to a magnet program, the lawsuit alleges.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement deputy assistant director Patricia Hyde told Fox News Tuesday that the agency has arrested nearly 50 people in Maine as part of an immigration enforcement surge.

Her remarks offered the first confirmation from the agency that it is intensifying operations in the state.

In a written statement Wednesday, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed that an immigration enforcement effort dubbed ""Operation Catch of the Day"" was underway in Maine, but did not provide specific numbers on how many people had been arrested and how many agents are involved.

The numbers cited by Fox would represent a major escalation. For comparison, last year ICE arrested an average of 24 people per month, according to the Deportation Data Project.

Hyde told Fox News her agency has a target list of 1,400 people in Maine. That would represent about 10% of all immigrants without permanent legal status in the state, according to figures from the Migration Policy Institute.

A growing number of videos purporting to show arrests have cropped up in the last two days, mostly in Lewiston and Greater Portland.

Local officials in both cities say they are not receiving communication from ICE or other federal agencies.

At a press conference Wednesday, Portland officials pushed back ICE's tactics.

Mayor Mark Dion said ICE's use of force in other cities around the country has put Portland on edge.

""While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes,"" he said.

City councilor Wes Pelletier rejected the need for an operation at all.

""No one asked the federal government to come here. This is one of the safest cities in the country,"" he said.

Other councilors say residents are forming support networks to deliver food and other basic needs to immigrant families too afraid to leave home.

Amid widespread fear of immigration enforcement, Portland Public Schools superintendent Ryan Scallon says attendance is down 15-20% at certain schools.

""ICE's terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare,"" Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said in a statement. ""These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long term damage to our state and to our country. Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.""

On Wednesday afternoon, ICE issued a press release saying it was targeting ""the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.""

It identified four detainees:

Dominic Ali, a Sudanese man convicted of false imprisonment, aggravated assault, assault, obstructing justice, and violation of a protective order.

Ambessa Berhe, an Ethiopian woman convicted of aggravated assault and cocaine possession.

Elmara Correia, an Angolan woman who had previously been arrested for endangering the welfare of a child.

Dany Lopez-Cortez, a Guatemalan man convicted of operating under the influence of alcohol.

""Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the release. “We have launched Operation Catch of the Day to target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in the state.

“All this litigation that … we’re hearing about here before the federal courts in Minnesota is about the power of the immigration judge to set a bond.
He said it’s becoming a struggle to get a federal judge to agree on a bond hearing.
He said the immigration process can be hard for families to navigate.
“What people think they understand about bonds from watching TV or the criminal justice system is so different than immigration,” Wilson said.","Demonstrators outside the Whipple Building say they are seeing unpredictable releases of immigration detainees as an attorney warns that the federal bond system has not recovered from last summer’s policy changes and ongoing litigation.

Protests at the federal building have continued for two weeks following the death of Renee Good, who was shot by an ICE agent. People gathering outside said they have watched detainees walk out of the facility or get dropped off at random locations across the Twin Cities in below-zero temperatures and without basic necessities.

Legal observer Rachel Gerdes said she saw several young people released Tuesday evening.

“Yesterday, I was here around like 5 p.m., they were just dropping kids that had been detained out in front of the Whipple Building here and leaving them to fend for themselves,” said Gerdes. “They didn’t even have winter coats. Some of them I don’t even know if they had their phone.”

Gerdes said she helped a 19-year-old woman who had no way to get home. “She ended up saying she needed a ride, cause she had to get home. My friend and I drove her home.”

Gerdes said she later helped the woman’s 17-year-old brother, who was released sometime later.

Immigration attorney David Wilson said these kinds of releases have become more common.

“What used to be kind of an orderly process for letting someone out of custody has turned into a little bit of a chaos process, a chaotic process where we’re trying to find people way late into the night and they get released without much warning at this point,” he said.

He said the process is even more complicated if a detained immigrant is transferred to an out-of-state facility.

“When people are taken out of state for their custody or detention, it’s not just that they get separated from their families. It’s really a challenge to get people back to Minnesota, in a orderly fashion, and because when they’re picked up, they may not have been wearing a winter jacket and ready for that trip,” Wilson said.

In July 2025, a Trump administration policy sought to eliminate bond for most undocumented immigrants. Federal courts blocked the policy, but Wilson and other advocates believe the system has not returned to normal.

“All this litigation that … we’re hearing about here before the federal courts in Minnesota is about the power of the immigration judge to set a bond. We’re just fighting for the opportunity to be heard,” he said.

He said it’s becoming a struggle to get a federal judge to agree on a bond hearing.

“You know you go to criminal court; you’re expecting you’re going to be able to pay a bond and be heard, not in immigration, not today. You have people have to fight for that opportunity.”

He said the immigration enforcement surge is also making it harder for judges to respond to requests.

“Right now, it’s taking about seven to 10 days to get a bond hearing, and so a person sits in custody for that long,” Wilson said.

He said in 2024, a bond hearing could be set within two to three days of detainment.

Bond amounts vary widely, but Wilson said they typically range from $1,500 to $7,000 and must be paid in full.

He said the process determines whether someone goes home or remains in custody. Some families and organizations raise funds to help immigrants.

“Often, bond is everything. It is definitely like a coliseum-type argument where all the arguments come out on the table at once,” Wilson said

Wilson said bond is only one part of the deportation process and determines whether someone fights their case from home or from detention. He said frequent transfers between facilities are also causing delays, with some detainees missing scheduled bond hearings because they are moved before a judge can review their case. He said people who are detained a second time may be required to pay a new bond, and the amount does not carry over from a previous case.

He said the immigration process can be hard for families to navigate.

“What people think they understand about bonds from watching TV or the criminal justice system is so different than immigration,” Wilson said. “The rules keep changing and becoming more difficult to comply with,” Wilson said. “Families are waiting and hoping, but the process is moving slower than ever.”

Wilson said eligibility for bond depends on a judge’s assessment of flight risk and danger, and certain criminal offenses, including some minor ones, can make a person ineligible. If someone wins their deportation case, the bond is refunded.

Wilson said if a person did not comply with the requirements of their case or lost their proceedings, the bond could be kept by the government.

The memo authorizes ICE officers to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections and upends years of advice given to immigrant communities.

The shift comes as the Trump administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide, deploying thousands of officers under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

For years, immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments have urged people not to open their doors to immigration agents unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge. That guidance is rooted in Supreme Court rulings that generally prohibit law enforcement from entering a home without judicial approval. The ICE directive directly undercuts that advice at a time when arrests are accelerating under the administration’s immigration crackdown.

The memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to a whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement the president’s immigration crackdown. New ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure.

It is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. The Associated Press witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of the home of a Liberian man, Garrison Gibson, with a deportation order from 2023 in Minneapolis on Jan. 11, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Documents reviewed by The AP revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge who authorized the raid on private property.

The change is almost certain to meet legal challenges and stiff criticism from advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments that have spent years successfully urging people not to open their doors unless ICE shows them a warrant signed by a judge.

The Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress, who shared it on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive documents. The AP verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.

The memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: “Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

The memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be.

Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an e-mailed statement to the AP that everyone the department serves with an administrative warrant has already had “full due process and a final order of removal.”

She said the officers issuing those warrants have also found probable cause for the person’s arrest. She said the Supreme Court and Congress have “recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” without elaborating. McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether ICE officers entered a person’s home since the memo was issued, relying solely on an administrative warrant and if so, how often.

Recent arrests shine a light on tactics

Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal organization that assists workers exposing wrongdoings, said in the whistleblower complaint obtained by The Associated Press that it represents two anonymous U.S. government officials “disclosing a secretive — and seemingly unconstitutional — policy directive.”

A wave of recent high-profile arrests, many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video, has placed a spotlight on immigration arrest tactics, including officers’ use of proper warrants.

Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by judges carry that authority.

All law enforcement operations — including those conducted by ICE and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures.

People can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant, with some limited exceptions.

Memo shown to ‘select’ officials

The memo says ICE officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using just a signed administrative warrant known as an I-205 if they have a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals or a district judge or magistrate judge.

The memo says officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence. They’re limited in the hours they can go into the home — after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

“Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent’s authority and intent to enter,” the memo reads.

The memo is addressed to all ICE personnel. But it has been shown only to “select DHS officials” who then shared it with some employees who were told to read it and return it, Whistleblower Aid wrote in the disclosure.

One of the two whistleblowers was allowed to view the memo only in the presence of a supervisor and then had to give it back. That person was not allowed to take notes. A whistleblower was able to access the document and lawfully disclose it to Congress, Whistleblower Aid said.

Although the memo was issued in May, David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, said it took time for its clients to find a “safe and legal path to disclose it to lawmakers and the American people.”

Memo says ICE officers are told to rely solely on administrative warrants

ICE has been rapidly hiring thousands of new deportation officers to carry out the president’s mass deportation agenda. They’re trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia.

During a visit there by The Associated Press in August, ICE officials said repeatedly that new officers were being trained to follow the Fourth Amendment.

But according to the whistleblowers’ account, newly hired ICE officers are being told they can rely solely on administrative warrants to enter homes to make arrests, even though that conflicts with written Homeland Security training materials.

Lindsay Nash, a law professor at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law in New York, said the memo “flies in the face” of what the Fourth Amendment protects against and what ICE itself has historically said are its authorities.

She said there’s an “enormous potential for overreach, for mistakes and we’ve seen that those can happen with very, very serious consequences.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/53e35be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1688+0+156/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F43%2Fe8%2Fbcd3b6f0df8b64cb7e8391258e4c%2Fecd7e2093e1048f484d277a5a60cf423,N,,2026-01-22 00:37:40.428165

Leaders in the state’s largest and most-diverse cities, Portland and Lewiston, continued to criticize the operation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as “terror and intimidation tactics” that threaten families. Many in those communities and elsewhere have documented with photos and videos the arrests and actions by ICE, often by masked agents.

Fox News reported that ICE had identified about 1,400 targets in Maine, and had made 50 arrests as of early Wednesday morning. The Department of Homeland Security later said in a statement the effort is targeting the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” citing people accused of committing crimes ranging from aggravated assault to operating under the influence of alcohol.

The department went on to criticize Gov. Janet Mills and “her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine” for standing in the way of their operations.

Mills, in a statement late Wednesday, didn’t back down.

“If the federal government has warrants, then it should show them,” she said. “But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors — none of which is welcome.”

Indeed, some residents have reported the detention of family members that have no criminal records.

A Westbrook mother said her 18-year-old son Jean-Pierre Obiang, an accounting student at the University of Southern Maine, was detained by ICE after a minor traffic incident outside the Westbrook Market Basket. Obiang and his mom, Sandrine Koumba, are asylum seekers from the central African county of Gabon, and have lived in Maine for three years. A background check of Obiang through the Maine State Bureau of Identification verified that he does not have a criminal record.

“You flee somewhere because you are being persecuted, and you arrive in a place where you say ‘Oh thank you God, I have arrived here; I am protected,'” Koumba said. “Then you realize that, actually, we are not safe.”

A Portland mom of four from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who also had no criminal record and a pending asylum application, was detained after agents followed her home from dropping one of her children off at Portland High School, the Maine Monitor reported.

A migrant worker in Lewiston who saw ICE agents approaching doors in their neighborhood said fears were high, with many neighbors staying home, locking their doors and ignoring knocks. In Portland’s Parkside neighborhood, residents blew whistles, honked car horns and called the statewide ICE activity hotline when six agents knocked on the door of a residential building, but did not detain anyone.

CITIES, SCHOOLS REACT

“They see this action as unpredictable and a threat to their families,” Dion said.

“Imagine you are a parent and you step out to put your kid on a school bus, and by the time you turn around you’re surrounded by ICE agents,” added Councilor Pious Ali. “Who is going to take care of that child?”

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline said the agency’s presence in Maine amounted to “terror and intimidation tactics.”

“These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long-term damage to our state and to our country,” he said in a statement. “Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.”

Westbrook Mayor David Morse, whose city also has a large number of immigrants, denounced the agency for an incident where he said an agent targeted a U.S. citizen who was peacefully observing an enforcement action, describing it as “outrageous behavior.”

Portland’s school district also announced that it will temporarily suspend off-campus lunches for high schoolers to minimize, “the chance of students being potentially caught up in enforcement actions,” and reported a decrease in student attendance Tuesday, while South Portland’s school board canceled a public forum Thursday because too many families were scared to attend, the board chair said.

Maine’s federal delegation had mixed reactions to “Operation Catch of the Day.”

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, criticized federal agencies for not sharing any details with members of Congress, while Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, said he supports ICE’s actions as long as the detention efforts focus on people “engaged in criminal activities.”

Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, said individuals in the country legally should not be detained, but also expressed support for some arrests.

“There are people in Maine and elsewhere who have entered this country illegally and who have engaged in criminal activity,” Collins said. “They could be subject to arrest and deportation pursuant to the laws of the United States, and people who are exercising the right to peacefully gather and protest their government should be careful not to interfere with law enforcement efforts while doing so.”

Federal officials have not said how long the operation in Maine will last.

Lawmakers at a legislative hearing sought more details from State Police about the cost of training officers to participate in the program, with one lawmaker saying she hoped there were no barriers preventing more departments from participating.

“We should be acting as aggressively as we possibly can to make sure everybody’s trained, everybody’s participating, everybody’s on the same page to execute the president’s agenda,” said Republican Sen. Missy Irvin, who co-chairs the legislative subcommittee overseeing State Police. Arkansas State Police entered an agreement last summer with federal immigration authorities, granting it limited immigration enforcement power through the 287(g) Task Force Model program.

The program is a “force multiplier” that allows state and local agencies to enforce limited immigration authority during routine duties, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement site.

Through the agreement, state police can contact ICE if it believes a person it comes into contact with during traffic stops, pursuits, investigations or other routine enforcement activity may be in the country illegally. ICE can then put an immigration detainer on that person.

Arkansas State Police entered into the agreement after a state law passed during last year’s legislative session required state police, the Department of Corrections and county sheriffs to do so.

Arkansas National Guard requests immigration enforcement authority

President Donald Trump has made deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally one of the cornerstones of his second term. His administration has sent thousands of immigration enforcement agents into major Democrat-run cities with a stated goal of arresting and deporting immigrants with criminal convictions.

However, those without criminal histories and U.S. citizens have found themselves caught up in the crackdown as well. Most recently, the shooting death of a woman in Minneapolis by an ICE agent sparked nationwide protests.

Neighboring Tennessee is moving to do more in the immigration crackdown as well. Republican lawmakers there recently unveiled plans for bills that would require public institutions such as public schools, vehicle registration offices and city governments to track and report immigration status.

Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar told legislators that since the 287(g) agreement was signed, all but a handful of state police troopers have completed the required 60-hour training.

Sen. Joshua Bryant, a Republican from Rogers, said that with the fiscal session approaching, he wanted to know if expenses related to the programs were being tracked for state police and the county jails that hold immigrants for Immigration and Customs Enforcement .

Hagar said he believed county jails were being reimbursed, but was unaware of how much they were being reimbursed. Troopers did the 60-hour training in between regular calls for service during their shifts, he said. ASP spokesperson Cindy Murphy said in an email that the 287(g) training was added to troopers’ regular training requirements, so they were not seeking reimbursement from the federal government for those costs.

“It’s not had an impact on our agency as far as operations are concerned,” Hagar told lawmakers.

Hagar said federal immigration resources in Arkansas were “very minimal,” and that most of those resources were taken up by picking up immigrants in local jails to take them to federal immigration detention.

Sen. Terry Rice, a Republican from Waldron, said that while he supported efforts to deport immigrants who have committed crimes, he was also concerned about the potential for state police to assist federal immigration authorities in detaining immigrants without criminal histories.

“Is there anything outside of your daily work that y’all are doing currently in coordination with federal agencies, Homeland Security, ICE, as far as going out and just seeking anything more than people with criminal charges?” he asked.

The agency was not participating in any operations like the one Rice described, Hagar said.

He said troopers have been told there is a difference between an immigrant who was brought here as a child and who doesn’t have a criminal history, and an immigrant who is arrested for a crime.

“We’ve explained to them that we expect them to use good judgment and common sense discretion that they have under the law,” Hagar said. “And you know, we trust that they’re going to take that responsibility seriously.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47649/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_6442-1024x7681769039414.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=YHdcH_oM,N,,2026-01-22 00:36:58.057216

6:20 p.m.: ICE agents detain 18-year-old USM student after minor car accident

ICE agents detained a 18-year-old student at the University of Southern Maine after a minor car crash Tuesday morning.

Jean-Pierre Obiang was on his way to USM, where he is studying accounting, when he called his mother, Sandrine Koumba, from the Westbrook Market Basket asking for proof of their car insurance, Koumba said in an interview Wednesday. The call was cut off after 36 seconds. Koumba was able to speak briefly with her son after multiple attempts to call him back, and he told her he was being detained by ICE agents.

Tiara Sandborn, the wife of the driver of the other car involved in the crash, said Obiang and her husband, Shawn Chastain, exchanged contact information and were about to drive away when three ICE officers showed up, saying they ran Obiang’s license plates and he was a person of interest, Sandborn said. Chastain tried to tell the agents that Obiang hadn’t done anything wrong, but they pushed him into his car.

Koumba said the car was registered in her name, not her son’s, and that he has no criminal history. A criminal background check on Obiang in Maine was not immediately returned Wednesday night.

“He had a license. He’s enrolled in school here. He was not engaged in any type of criminal behavior,” Sandborn said. “He had a minor accident that occurred that subjected him to be vulnerable and then basically kidnapped off the streets.”

Koumba and her family are asylum-seekers from Gabon, a nation on the West African coast that sits right on the equator. They have been living in Westbrook for three years.

Obiang was allowed one phone call and told his mother he had been moved to Burlington, Massachusetts. He was told he’d be moved to another facility the next day, but did not know where.

5:45 p.m.: Maine woman interfered with local law enforcement assuming they were ICE, police say

A Maine woman interfered with Brewer Police activity, thinking they were U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, police say.

Mary Conmee, 63, of Orrington, has been served a court summons for disorderly conduct and obstructing government administration, the Brewer Police Department said in a social media post on Wednesday.

Officers were investigating a threat against Brewer schools Wednesday morning and staged near a Brewer residence to attempt to contact a person of interest. During the operation, Conmee “deliberately drove to the scene and interfered with police activity by repeatedly sounding an air horn, refusing lawful orders to leave, and yelling at expletives at officers,” the post stated.

“The woman stated that she ‘didn’t want ICE’ in her neighborhood,” the department’s notice said. “Her actions interfered with legitimate law enforcement operations and created a real risk to the investigating officers.”

Police later determined the person of interest was not involved in the school threat, the department said. The threat stemmed from similar “swatting” incidents at other Maine schools on Wednesday, police say, and there was no credible threat to Brewer schools.

5:30 p.m.: Maine State Police won’t work with feds on immigration enforcement

Maine State Police are already following the policies outlined in a new law limiting the ability of local law enforcement to collaborate with federal immigration authorities — even though the law is not scheduled to take effect until this summer.

Gov. Janet Mills announced last month she would allow LD 1971, one of the most controversial bills of last year’s legislative session, to become law without her signature. The measure will prohibit state, county and local law enforcement officers from investigating, detaining, arresting or searching a person solely for immigration enforcement purposes.

LD 1971 is not scheduled to take effect until 90 days after the current legislative session ends, meaning its effective date is expected to come in mid-July. However, Maine Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck has already issued a directive to his agency implementing the underlying policies of the law, a spokesperson for the department said Wednesday.

“Directives are a regular part of the first responder world, and this one was made internally by the Commissioner and was not prompted by any specific event or federal activity,” spokesperson Shannon Moss said in an email.

Officers will still be able to work with federal agents on criminal investigations and task forces, so long as the primary purpose is not immigration enforcement.

However, the law would not allow local officers to be placed under the supervision of federal authorities for the purpose of working on immigration enforcement, or allow police to use federal immigration officers as interpreters. Local police also won’t be allowed to transfer a person to immigration authorities without a court order or criminal warrant.

5:20 p.m.: Portland officials decry ICE tactics as enforcement effort enters second day

City officials in Maine’s largest city questioned the need for increased immigration enforcement during a Wednesday press conference as they attempted to reassure a fearful public.

Mayor Mark Dion and members of the City Council said they continue to hear from frightened and traumatized community members as reports of people being detained in public places mounted this week in Portland and neighboring cities.

“They see this action as unpredictable and a threat to their families,” Dion said about constituents and members of the immigrant community in Portland.

He said officials are doing everything they can to direct resources to the affected communities, along with reiterating their rights and responsibilities if approached by federal immigration officers.

Several officials urged residents to observe and record enforcement actions without interfering.

“The best thing you can do is be the best possible witness,” Dion said, reiterating his statement last week challenging “the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes.”

4:40 p.m.: Susan Collins issues statement on increased ICE arrests in Maine

U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, the lone Republican in Maine’s delegation, issued a statement Wednesday afternoon on the initial set of ICE arrests in the state.

“Immigrants have long been an important part of our state and they continue to make valuable contributions to our communities. People who are in this country legally should not be targets of ICE investigations. They should be able to continue to go to work, school, and other public places and carry on with their normal lives. If for some reason an individual who is here legally is improperly detained, they should seek assistance through advocacy networks and the legal system,” she said in the statement.

“There are people in Maine and elsewhere who have entered this country illegally and who have engaged in criminal activity. They could be subject to arrest and deportation pursuant to the laws of the United States, and people who are exercising the right to peacefully gather and protest their government should be careful not to interfere with law enforcement efforts while doing so.

“I have advocated for providing body cameras and de-escalation training for ICE personnel. At this time of heightened tensions, these steps could help improve trust, accountability, and safety. Our proposed funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security includes $20 million for body cameras and $2 million for de-escalation training, which could help protect both ICE agents and the general public. I hope that Congress will adopt these measures quickly.”

Last week, Collins said she supported the deportation of criminals but did not “see the rationale for a large number of ICE agents to come” to Maine.

4:35 p.m.: Court orders ICE to give reason for detaining Portland asylum seeker

A Portland resident from Angola who has filed for asylum is asking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to explain why he was detained during a routine check-in Tuesday at the field office in Scarborough.

A federal judge on Wednesday ordered ICE to provide a cause for the detainment of Yanick Joao Carneiro by noon the following day, court records show.

The decision from U.S. District Judge Stacey Neumann came a day after Carneiro and his attorney filed a petition for a judge to consider whether he is being jailed unlawfully. Neumann also temporarily ordered that Carneiro not be transferred out of Maine “to provide the Court with a fair opportunity to review the merits of the petition and rule on any contested issues of jurisdiction.”

According to the petition, Carneiro entered the country from Angola in April 2023 and is not a U.S. citizen. The Department of Homeland Security then detained him according to the petition, but he was subsequently released. Carneiro applied for asylum, according to the order, and has a hearing on the matter scheduled for November 2027 in Massachusetts.

2:55 p.m.: Jared Golden says ICE enforcement is legitimate, as long as it targets criminal activity

U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, said Wednesday he supports Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that ramped up in his hometown of Lewiston and in the Portland area this week as long as the detention efforts focus on people “engaged in criminal activities.”

Golden issued a brief statement Wednesday afternoon after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security confirmed ICE agents are focusing on Maine under “Operation Catch of the Day,” which launched Tuesday.

“So long as this remains a targeted law enforcement operation focused on individuals who have engaged in criminal activities, then I believe it legitimately serves the public interest,” Golden said in a statement.

2:50 p.m.: Owner of East Ender restaurant says he’s trying to make staff feel safe

Karl Deuben, who owns East Ender on Middle Street in Portland, said he has sent a message to his staff about ICE’s presence in Maine, posted signs delineating the restaurant’s public and private spaces, reposted information from the ACLU, clarified the definition of a warrant, and reminded staff to call him immediately if ICE officers enter the building.

“The most important thing I mentioned to our staff is that interacting with ICE outside the business is different than inside the business,” he said. “They do have a legal right to be on premise and so we need to remember that.”

“The last thing I want is for there to be a specific type of adversarial energy that causes our staff or the public to be in any type of unforeseen danger,” Deuben said. “The goal is to de-escalate as opposed to escalate.”

Deuben compared the current situation to COVID, when he strove to give his staff accurate information.

Of a potential visit from ICE agents, he said, “my goal is if they come in, they’re in and they’re out. “

1:55 p.m.: Attendance down in Portland schools as ICE enforcement ramps up

Attendance was down in Portland Public Schools Tuesday as immigration enforcement activities increased in the city and across the state this week.

The district’s overall attendance rate was down to 84.4% on Jan. 20, compared to 89.4% last Friday, a district spokesperson said, although she noted that the reasons for absences are not always clear from the data.

Portland is home to the state’s largest and most diverse school district, where nearly 30% of students are English language learners. The district already saw impacts on attendance early last week, when rumors of ICE’s arrival in Maine began to circulate.

1:50 p.m.: Homeland Security says heightened enforcement targeting ‘criminal illegal aliens’

Officials from the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently enacted “Operation Catch of the Day,” a heightened immigration enforcement effort across Maine.

The federal agency said the operation is “targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” according to an emailed statement from the Department of Homeland Security.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Federal officials would not immediately confirm how many people had been arrested by ICE agents so far, though they highlighted four people arrested in Maine Tuesday who are also accused of crimes such as aggravated assault and false imprisonment.

Fox News, during an interview with Department of Homeland Security Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde, said nearly 50 people had been arrested in Maine as part of ICE enforcement efforts.

1:35 p.m.: Portland schools pause off-campus lunches for students

Portland Public Schools is pausing its off-campus lunch option starting Wednesday to minimize “the chance of students being potentially caught up in enforcement actions as they move around the city on their own to buy lunch,” the superintendent said in a Tuesday letter.

All of the district’s high schools will switch from an “open campus” lunch, allowing students to buy lunch off-campus, to a “closed campus,” beginning Jan. 21 and continuing indefinitely, Superintendent Ryan Scallon announced. The schools will stock extra school lunches, but also encourage students to pack their own.

He said for the time being, off-site educational programming, field trips, recess and extracurricular activities will continue as usual.

“We continue to expect that our schools will not be the focus of immigration enforcement, but if there is action that impacts a school, we will communicate with families and staff as soon as possible,” Scallon wrote.

ICE arrests ramped up in Maine’s largest city Wednesday; a mother of four was detained Wednesday morning after dropping one of her children off at Portland High School, the Maine Monitor reported.

1:30 p.m.: Pingree says federal agencies directed not to speak to members of Congress

Gabrielle Mannino, spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, said federal agencies have been under a directive not to speak to congressional offices since President Trump took office.

“Since early December, the USCIS asylum office with jurisdiction over Maine has forwarded all of our constituent and policy inquiries to USCIS Headquarters for response, which we have yet to receive answers to,” Mannino said.

“It’s interesting that (ICE) let the Fox news crew ride along with them, but they won’t talk to us. It’s been like this for the past year, not just with (current activities in Maine) … So, we’re kind of in the dark just like everyone else.”

Mannino said the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum office has not provided substantive responses to inquiries from Pingree’s office since the Trump administration issued the January 2025 asylum pause and country-specific adjudication bans.

“ICE’s Office of Congressional Relations continues to provide empty responses and will not provide any information to our office about a constituent’s location, well-being, or reason for arrest without a specific privacy waiver signed by the detained individual,” Mannino said.

“When we pointed out that access to detainees is often challenging and people are advised not to sign anything in detention, our office was told that we should consider collecting these privacy waivers proactively.”

1:20 p.m.: Portland’s Parkside residents alert neighbors to ICE’s presence

When residents of Portland’s Parkside neighborhood saw six ICE agents knocking at the door of a multi-unit residential building on Grant Street, they made some noise.

Citizens threw on jackets and ran to the sidewalk to blow whistles, alerting others that ICE was in the area. Other residents began honking their car horns, drawing more people out of their homes.

The agents left the building at 134 Grant when they did not get a response at the door. They did not detain anyone, and left in a black sedan, followed by several cars honking at them.

Advertisement

After the agents left the scene, a dozen people congregated at the corner of Grant and Mellen Street to talk about the encounter and other ICE operations in the area.

Wylliam Wold, who lives in the neighborhood, called the ICE activity hotline, which is coordinated by the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition, to share the number of vehicles, the location and the uniforms the agents were wearing.

“I’ve been seeing flyers, talking with my community. I knew there was an ICE hotline and there’s an acronym, SALUTE, to remember what details to be giving when you do call it,” said Wold, 32.

“So that was just kind of my only thought: Here there’s nothing else I can do but call the hotline, share information.”

12:40 p.m.: Portland restaurant owner says her staff is anxious about ICE enforcement

Pastry Chef Ilma Lopez, who co-owns the Ugly Duckling and Chaval in Portland’s West End with her husband, said she has trained her staff how to handle any ICE presence at either restaurant.

“You can tell them, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m not allowed to talk to you. Let me just call our manager or let me just call our owner.’ You call me and I’ll take care of it.”

Lopez, who grew up in Venezuela, became an American citizen about a decade ago. “I’m 100% Latina and I’m proud of it,” she said. “I came to the States because in my country, it was really hard to make a living and we didn’t have freedom of speech. So 22 years ago, I came here and in a million years did it ever ever even cross my mind that we will be in this situation in America?”

Lopez said most of her restaurant staff come from North America, and all work in the U.S. legally. “We have done everything that the law asks us. I’ve been dealing with immigration lawyers for years. I follow every single step.”

She said the staff, nevertheless, is anxious. “Some people are anxious because they’re angry and upset. Some people are anxious because they don’t know what’s going to happen to them or to their friends. It’s a lot of question marks.”

11:25 a.m.: Gorham state representative says ICE officers are violating due process

Rep. Ellie Sato, D-Gorham, said the surge in immigration enforcement is harming Mainers who are skipping school, work and health appointments out of “fear of being disappeared.”

In a written statement, Sato, a member of the Legislature’s Judicial Committee, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are violating Mainers’ constitutional rights.

“What we are seeing on our newsfeeds everyday is a lack of due process,” Sato said. “It’s critical for everyone to know their rights, and how to respond when raids or arrests happen, both as bystanders, and as friends and family.”

Sato is sponsoring an emergency bill that would bar immigration enforcement officers from entering nonpublic areas within schools, public libraries, health care facilities and other locations without a judicial warrant signed by a judge.

11 a.m.: Lewiston resident reports ICE presence on Pierce Street

A migrant worker living on Pierce Street in Lewiston said ICE officers were present in their neighborhood Wednesday, with agents knocking on doors at nearby buildings Tuesday and again Wednesday morning.

The person, who asked not to be named because of safety concerns and declined to share their country of origin, said they saw a neighbor being questioned by agents.

“(Agents) were walking around here (Tuesday), and they caught him and interrogated him, but they didn’t take him away,” the resident said. “They didn’t take anyone.”

The resident said fears of ICE in their neighborhood and throughout the city are high, with many neighbors staying home, locking their doors and ignoring knocks.

“Even when they think you are here, you leave them alone,” they said. “Why are they here? We’re here to work, and we don’t hurt anyone.”

9:15 a.m.: Portland’s parks department says it can’t restrict federal officers from public spaces

Portland city officials say they can’t restrict federal law enforcement from public spaces like city-operated parking garages, City Hall, Monument Square and Payson Park, according to an email from the parks department.

But when recreation programs are in session, officials say law enforcement officers cannot enter the space unless they’re invited or have a warrant.

“Many recreation programs, such as group swim lessons and Junior Celtics Basketball, take place in spaces that are reserved exclusively for pre-registered participants. During these programs, only enrolled participants and their caregivers are permitted in the program area,” according to an email sent by the parks department Tuesday morning.

City staff will inform anyone who tries to enter a recreation program area that space is limited to registered participants and caregivers, according to the email.

9:10 a.m.: South Portland school board cancels Thursday forum because of families’ fears

The South Portland board of education cancelled a public forum on Thursday to hear community members’ input about the upcoming budget because too many families with children in the schools were afraid to go out and attend, according to Board Chair Rosemarie De Angelis.

The school system has issued policies addressing what to do if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents show up on school grounds. The policy directs staff members to keep students away from immigration officers and direct agents towards the main office if they enter school property, according to a copy of the policy obtained by a public records request.

9 a.m.: DHS begins ‘Operation Catch of the Day’ in Maine, reports more than 1,000 targets

In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde said officers had identified more than 1,000 targets in Maine.

The network, which boasted “exclusive access,” reported nearly 50 arrests in Maine as enforcement picked up.

Officials have dubbed the surge “Operation Catch of the Day,” the network reported.

Hyde lamented a lack of cooperation by — and open criticism from — local leaders. City and state officials have warned of the impending surge for days.

“They ban their law enforcement from partnering or even communicating with ICE,” Hyde said on Fox. “And when law enforcement doesn’t communicate with law enforcement, that puts our communities in danger.”

Ahmed said Buitrago Ortiz came to the U.S. with her family.","WASHINGTON — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials placed an asylum seeker who is eight months pregnant on a deportation flight Wednesday afternoon, even though she was in medical distress, her attorneys told States Newsroom.

ICE officials and the Department of Homeland Security responded to States Newsroom's requests for comment, but did not answer questions about the specific case.

Zharick Daniela Buitrago Ortiz, a 21-year-old national of Colombia, has a pending asylum case, said one of her attorneys, Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. Buitrago Ortiz was also represented by the Robert & Ethel Kennedy Human Rights Center.

As an asylum seeker, she was going through the credible fear process, a key step to establish an immigrant’s claim for asylum if they can show a fear of persecution or torture in their home country. Asylum seekers are typically allowed to live in the United States while their case proceeds.

Buitrago Ortiz is between 32 and 33 weeks pregnant and was deported from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Airport officials did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

Ahmed said flying late in pregnancy can have serious risks.

Buitrago Ortiz earlier had been detained in a center in Louisiana. She was placed by ICE on a flight from there to Atlanta prior to her removal to Colombia, her attorneys said.

As she waited for the flight to Colombia, Buitrago Ortiz experienced intense, shooting pain in her back and abdomen, according to her attorneys. They said they were also concerned about the risk to her health and that of her unborn child if she was placed on the flight, which is roughly five hours nonstop.

ICE generally has a policy to not detain immigrants who are pregnant unless there are exceptional circumstances. Democrats in Congress have raised concerns about reports of ICE detainment of pregnant immigrants, and urged ICE acting Director Todd Lyons to order the release of any immigrants who were pregnant from ICE detention facilities.

Travel during pregnancy can be risky past 28 weeks and can increase the chances of going into labor, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Ahmed said as recently as Jan. 18, there had been no indication that Buitrago Ortiz would be removed from the United States.

Ahmed said Buitrago Ortiz came to the U.S. with her family. Her mother received a favorable credible fear interview, meaning an immigration official believed there was a possibility of harm if she returned to her home country.

The family arrived in El Paso, Texas, in early November, according to Buitrago Ortiz’s mother, who asked not to be named for fear of harming her own asylum case.

Additionally, Ahmed said the father of Buitrago Ortiz’s child was murdered earlier this month in Colombia.

“It’s important that we understand that there is a woman in medical distress,” Ahmed said. “The clock is ticking.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/atlantaairport2026.jpg?h=81485932&itok=baPcqhht,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:50.607891

Department of Homeland Security officials announced the latest enforcement operation Wednesday. Officials say they will be targeting what the administration considers “the worst of the worst.”

The agency said that the operation launched officially Tuesday and that 50 migrants who are allegedly in the United States illegally have been arrested.

“Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a released statement.

The surge of ICE officers comes two weeks after clashes between federal immigration agents and protesters began in Minneapolis in the wake of the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, issued a statement last week on social media, saying her administration had heard rumors of a looming immigration enforcement crackdown. Mills said her office had been unsuccessful in confirming whether an operation was pending.

Mills said she has directed the Maine State Police to work with local law enforcement as necessary as well as with city officials in Portland and Lewiston and the state attorney general.

“Our goal as always will be to protect the safety and the rights of the people of Maine,” Mills said in a video posted to her Facebook account.

“To the federal government, I say this: If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused — those tactics are not welcome here,” Mills said.

She added: “Maine will not be intimidated and we will not betray the values that make us who we are.”

ICE officers were dispatched to Minnesota in early December amid allegations of widespread fraud within the Somali population. DHS officials announced that 3,000 arrests of migrants in the country illegally have been made since that operation began.

DHS officials said Wednesday that among the 50 arrests made since Tuesday are migrants who have previously been convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child.

Like in Minnesota, federal officials have alleged widespread fraud involving a Somali-led healthcare contractor that allegedly defrauded the state’s Medicaid system out of millions of dollars.

In a statement issued on Tuesday, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maine Andrew Benson warned residents against interfering with the work of federal agents and officers.

“In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,” Benson said. “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property, or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

He added, “Finally, it is incumbent upon anyone with a public voice—whether that be an elected official, commentator or engaged citizen—to similarly urge peaceful protest and engagement. Divisive, bombastic public statements only inflame the situation and make violence more likely.”

Maine is the latest Democratic-led area to be targeted by federal officials.

If President Trump does decide to invoke the Insurrection Act, he will be met with resistance in various forms, including litigation.","Since January 7, protests have broken out across Minnesota in response to the current administration’s abusive immigration policies and secret police tactics, which resulted in the murder of Renee Good, an American citizen and Minneapolis resident, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Instead of showing presidential empathy and leadership, President Trump has stoked the fire by threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act for the first time in more than three decades.

He’s made this threat before but seems more focused on it than ever. Here’s what you need to know.

The Insurrection Act — provisions of federal law that date back to 1792 — allows the president to use the military as a domestic police force in certain emergencies such as an “insurrection, “rebellion,” or “invasion.” Historically, the Insurrection Act is used rarely and in extreme emergencies when civilian police cannot or will not enforce the law. The Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel has described invoking the Insurrection Act against the objection of the state’s governor as available only when “state and local law enforcement have completely broken down.” Most legal experts believe the Insurrection Act’s authorities are limited to these circumstances. The last time it was invoked was in 1992 when the governor of California and mayor of Los Angeles requested support from the National Guard to restore order after people rioted in response to police officers beating Rodney King. The riots caused over 60 deaths, 2,000 injuries, 4,000 fires, and $1 billion in property damage. And the last time the Insurrection Act was invoked over the objection of a state’s governor was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent the U.S. armed forces to Alabama to protect protestors marching in support of Black voting rights. In what is now known as Bloody Sunday, they had previously been attacked by Alabama state troopers at the Edmund Pettus Bridge during their pilgrimage from Selma to Montgomery.

It would be unlawful for the president to invoke the Insurrection Act to quash pro-immigrant protests. There is no insurrection, rebellion, invasion, or other emergency in Minneapolis that would justify invoking the Insurrection Act. Instead, protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful and state and local law enforcement in Minnesota have been capably handling the limited acts of violence among the protesters. The violence and disorder captured in social media posts have come almost entirely from federal agents, who currently outnumber the 10 largest regional police forces combined. Unlike in the case of the Rodney King riots, the governor of Minnesota and the mayor of Minneapolis have not sought outside support for the protests taking place today, which are mild in comparison.

Deploying the military to conduct domestic policing outside of the Insurrection Act (or another authority) is a crime. The military is trained for fighting wars against enemy combatants, not policing civilians. However, authoritarians throughout history have often used the military to dismantle democratic systems and seize power. That’s why Congress, under the Posse Comitatus Act, made it a crime to use the military for civilian law enforcement purposes without constitutional or congressional authorization. The ability to invoke the Insurrection Act is one of the exceptions. So, if the president were to intentionally try to invoke the Insurrection Act without justification so that he could use the military to control and police civilians, he would be committing a crime.

Invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy the military on U.S. soil is not the same as declaring “martial law.” Even if the president were to succeed in convincing courts of his flimsy argument that the Insurrection Act would apply to the situation in Minneapolis, he would not be declaring “martial law.” While “martial law” does not have a clear legal definition, it’s much closer to what you probably assume it is: the military entirely taking over the functions of local, civilian government. With martial law, we’re not just talking military police: we’re also talking military courts, military government administrators, and the military issuing orders to civilians rather than taking orders from civilian government officials under the law. Martial law also often comes with legally ambiguous civil rights violations, such as suspending habeas corpus, a constitutional right that guarantees any detained individual a hearing before a judge, and due process; censoring media, public figures, and individuals; and setting curfews. The Insurrection Act, by contrast, only allows the military to assist civilian law enforcement by enforcing existing law and engaging in traditional police activities like making lawful arrests, responding to acts of violence, or maintaining order during riots. The Insurrection Act cannot and does not override constitutional protections, such as your First Amendment right to freedom of speech and assembly, or your Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches or seizures.

President Trump has used other dubious authorities to deploy the military in American cities, but a more worrisome and potentially broader invocation of the Insurrection Act may be coming. The president has claimed inherent constitutional authority to use the military domestically to protect federal buildings and agents, which continues to be litigated. He also tried to unlawfully use state National Guard forces in California, Oregon, and Illinois for the federal government under a different federal law, which the Supreme Court rejected. Because courts have restricted the president’s attempts to deploy the military in American cities using other presidential loopholes, President Trump may decide to finally invoke the Insurrection Act to advance his personal goal of using the military for political ends.

Janet Mills, alleging that the governor “and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens.”

Mills’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although the Democrat said last week her administration was “taking proactive steps to prepare” for a possible surge in federal law enforcement agents.

Portland City Councilor Pious Ali said most of the people arrested by ICE on Tuesday were from Maine’s greater Portland area, including South Portland, Westbrook and Lewiston.

Local officials in the state have cautioned that the presence of federal officials in Maine could lead to heightened tensions, with Portland Mayor Mark Dion warning last week that “Our community is anxious and fearful regarding the understanding that ICE is planning to send agents to Portland and Lewiston next week.”

“There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents,” Dion said in a statement. “Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods. While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes.

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline also warned that the operation “may cause anxiety, fear or uncertainty for some in our community,” noting an increased presence of ICE agents in his city.

“ICE’s terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare,” he said in a Wednesday statement. “These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long term damage to our state and to our country.”

ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News in Scarborough, Maine, on Tuesday that the operation was targeting approximately 1,400 individuals— including immigrants from Senegal, Somalia, Honduras, Guatemala and the Congo — and that authorities arrested more than 50 people during its first day.

The operation comes as ICE has deployed several thousand agents to Minnesota as part of an ongoing crackdown also tied — but not limited — to Somali Americans.

Local and state officials have repeatedly clashed with the White House over ICE’s presence in that state, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announcing Tuesday that he had been served a subpoena as part of a federal investigation into the Democrat. Vice President JD Vance is also set to visit Minneapolis on Thursday as protests continue across the city against the administration’s immigration crackdown.

ICE’s nationwide crackdown has at times turned violent in other states, including Oregon, where Border Patrol agents shot two people that DHS alleged were suspected associates of the gang Tren de Aragua earlier this month. Last week, a federal agent shot and injured another man who DHS accused of attempting to “resist and violently assault the officer” during a “targeted traffic stop.”

And on Wednesday, DHS said an agent had fired “defensive shots” against the target of an operation in Compton, California, but that the person — who was ultimately apprehended — “was not hit and attempted to flee on foot.”

Ali, a Ghanaian American who has served on Portland, Maine’s, city council, since 2016, said he feared the crackdown could harm local businesses and schools.

“This is just pure intimidation and fearmongering being unleashed in our community, and it’s going to impact not just the ones that they are looking for, but everyone else who is an immigrant, even those who are naturalized,” he told POLITICO on Wednesday.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ff4%2F40%2F5db70035461187e274a4420069e3%2Faptopix-immigration-enforcement-maine-39518.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 17:57:46.285842

The department said in a press release that it kicked off “Operation Catch of the Day” on Tuesday, targeting criminal offenders. More than 100 agents arrived in the frigid Northeast state this week, one current immigration official and one former official said on condition of anonymity. The former official said the operation would focus on refugees.

Maine’s political leadership and immigrant communities have been bracing for the arrival of more immigration agents. Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, said last week that the Trump administration’s aggressive enforcement tactics were “not welcome.”

Trump, a Republican, has surged immigration agents to Democratic-led cities and states since mid-2025, with some 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks. Trump has called the intense enforcement operations necessary to combat criminality, although many suspected immigration offenders arrested have no criminal charges or convictions.

Trump has been critical of Somali immigrants after some Somali Americans were implicated in a fraud scheme in Minnesota, calling them “garbage” and saying they should leave the U.S.

Trump takes election-year crackdown to Maine

Mills, in her second term as Maine’s governor, is running for a U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Susan Collins, a moderate trying to fend off Democratic challengers in November’s midterm elections that will decide control of Congress. Trump’s immigration policies are expected to be a prominent issue in Maine and other states.

Public support for Trump’s approach to immigration has dwindled in recent months as federal agents have swept through residential neighborhoods, tossing tear gas and clashing with protesters, Reuters/Ipsos polls show.

Tensions boiled over this month when a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis fatally shot Renee Good, U.S. citizen and mother of three.

Carl Sheline, mayor of Lewiston, Maine, said on Tuesday that the city had seen an increase in ICE agents in the 39,000-person city. Lewiston, the second-largest city in Maine, is home to Somali immigrants and other refugees, communities that have been there for decades.

Sheline said in an email that ICE’s “terror and intimidation tactics” showed “a complete lack of humanity.”

“Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home,” he said.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine’s governor, calling her one of the state’s “sanctuary politicians” trying to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said the incident was reported around 7:25 a.m. on the 2400 block of 126th Street in the unincorporated community of Willowbrook, which is located just north of Compton. Deputies with the LASD were not involved, but were called to secure the perimeter of the scene.

According to a DHS spokesperson, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Compton at 7:05 a.m. when the suspect made a ""dangerous attempt to evade arrest.""

The DHS claims the man, later identified as an El Salvadoran national, William Eduardo Moran Carballo, ""weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement."" At that point, an agent opened fire, the spokesperson said.

Carballo was not hit by any fired rounds and attempted to flee the scene on foot, according to the DHS. He was later apprehended and taken into custody.

At least one CBP officer was injured during the incident, although the extent and circumstances of the injury were not immediately made clear.

DHS claimed that Carballo was previously involved in a ""human smuggling operation,"" with two prior arrests for allegedly ""inflicting corporal injury"" on a spouse or cohabitant. He was removed from the U.S. by an immigration judge in 2019, DHS says.

Footage from the scene showed a silver BMW with a black hood that had sustained major damage to the front of the vehicle. The windshield was broken in multiple spots and the airbags had deployed, with a major law-enforcement presence in the area, including officers with CBP.

When asked for a statement, the office of Governor Gavin Newsom pushed back on DHS claims that ""sanctuary politicians, including Governor Newsom"" have instructed targets of immigration operations to evade arrest.

""The governor has never 'encouraged' defiance of lawful orders,"" the statement said. ""California law is clear — federal agents can conduct federal enforcement with their own resources.

The memo authorizes ICE officers to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections and upends years of advice given to immigrant communities.

The shift comes as the Trump administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide, deploying thousands of officers under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

For years, immigrant advocates, legal aid groups and local governments have urged people not to open their doors to immigration agents unless they are shown a warrant signed by a judge. That guidance is rooted in Supreme Court rulings that generally prohibit law enforcement from entering a home without judicial approval. The ICE directive directly undercuts that advice at a time when arrests are accelerating under the administration’s immigration crackdown.

The memo itself has not been widely shared within the agency, according to a whistleblower complaint, but its contents have been used to train new ICE officers who are being deployed into cities and towns to implement the president’s immigration crackdown. New ICE hires and those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo, according to the whistleblower disclosure.

It is unclear how broadly the directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. The Associated Press witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of the home of a Liberian man in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

The change is almost certain to meet legal challenges and stiff criticism from advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments that have spent years successfully urging people not to open their doors unless ICE shows them a warrant signed by a judge.

The Associated Press obtained the memo and whistleblower complaint from an official in Congress, who shared it on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive documents. The AP verified the authenticity of the accounts in the complaint.

The memo, signed by the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, and dated May 12, 2025, says: “Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.""

The memo does not detail how that determination was made nor what its legal repercussions might be.

When asked about the memo, Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an emailed statement to the AP that everyone the department serves with an administrative warrant has already had “full due process and a final order of removal.”

She said the officers issuing those warrants have also found probable cause for the person’s arrest. She said the Supreme Court and Congress have “recognized the propriety of administrative warrants in cases of immigration enforcement,” without elaborating. McLaughlin did not respond to questions about whether ICE officers entered a person’s home since the memo was issued relying solely on an administrative warrant and if so, how often.

Whistleblower Aid, a non-profit legal organization that assists workers exposing wrongdoings, said in the whistleblower complaint obtained by The Associated Press that it represents two anonymous U.S. government officials “disclosing a secretive - and seemingly unconstitutional - policy directive.”

A wave of recent high-profile arrests, many unfolding at private homes and businesses and captured on video, has shined a spotlight on immigration arrest tactics, including officers’ use of proper warrants.

Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants, internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific individual but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other non-public spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by judges carry that authority.

All law enforcement operations — including those conducted by ICE and Customs and Border Protection — are governed by the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, which protects all people in the country from unreasonable searches and seizures.

People can legally refuse federal immigration agents entry into private property if the agents only have an administrative warrant, with some limited exceptions.

Federal agents this month rammed the door of the Minneapolis home of a Liberian man with a deportation order from 2023, who was then arrested. Documents reviewed by The AP revealed that the agents only had an administrative warrant — meaning there was no judge who authorized the raid on private property.

The memo says ICE officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using just a signed administrative warrant known as an I-205 if they have a final order of removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals or a district judge or magistrate judge.

The memo says officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence. They’re limited in the hours they can go into the home — after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

“Should the alien refuse admittance, ICE officers and agents should use only a necessary and reasonable amount of force to enter the alien’s residence, following proper notification of the officer or agent’s authority and intent to enter,” the memo reads.

The memo is addressed to all ICE personnel. But it has been shown only to “select DHS officials” who then shared it with some employees who were told to read it and return it, Whistleblower Aid wrote in the disclosure.

One of the two whistleblowers was allowed to view the memo only in the presence of a supervisor and then had to give it back. That person was not allowed to take notes. A whistleblower was able to access the document and lawfully disclose to Congress, Whistleblower Aid said.

Although the memo was issued in May, David Kligerman, senior vice president and special counsel at Whistleblower Aid, said it took time for its clients to find a “safe and legal path to disclose it to lawmakers and the American people.”

ICE has been rapidly hiring thousands of new deportation officers to carry out the president’s mass deportation agenda. They’re trained at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia.

During a visit there by The Associated Press in August, ICE officials said repeatedly that new officers were being trained to follow the Fourth Amendment.

But according to the whistleblowers’ account, newly hired ICE officers are being told they can rely solely on administrative warrants to enter homes to make arrests even though that conflicts with written Homeland Security training materials.

ICE officers often wait for hours for the person they’re hoping to arrest to come outside so they can make the arrest on the sidewalk or at the person's work — public places where they are allowed to operate without the risk of infringing on the person’s Fourth Amendment rights.

Whistleblower Aid called the new policy a “complete break from the law” and said it undercuts the “Fourth Amendment and the rights it protects.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7933ecac-3da1-4fa5-8c5b-ef6eddf9b82f/wirestory_00d0ab0338e82341fd91b160758aeb2d_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:34.986990

""Governor Mills and her fellow sanctuary politicians in Maine have made it abundantly clear that they would rather stand with criminal illegal aliens than protect law-abiding American citizens,"" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary, said in a statement.

McLaughlin claims ICE agents arrested people convicted of aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child. NEWS CENTER Maine has not yet been able to independently confirm this, or if the people convicted served time for their crimes.

Governor Janet Mills responded in a statement, saying, “I recognize that many people across Maine are fearful in the wake of ICE’s announcement that it has launched an operation in Maine, and my Administration remains in close contact with municipal officials, including in Lewiston and Portland, as well as with organizations across Maine, to monitor ICE activity and ensure the safety and civil rights of people across Maine are protected. If the Federal government has warrants, then it should show them. But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the Federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors – none of which is welcome.”

ICE Deputy Assistant Director Patricia Hyde told Fox News the operation has resulted in about 50 arrests so far. Hyde said the agency is targeting about 1,400 individuals in Maine.

Hyde also criticized Maine’s law enforcement ban on collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying it has hindered operations.

She told Fox News “agitators” in the state impeded enforcement actions, but added that the agency will continue until it has arrested all its targets.

DHS did not immediately provide additional details on the specific locations of arrests or the identities of those targeted.

Westbrook Mayor David Morse said in a social media post that ICE has been actively conducting operations and detaining people in Westbrook on Tuesday and Wednesday.

""At least one peaceful US citizen observer from Westbrook was targeted for intimidation by a masked federal law enforcement officer this morning,"" Morse said. ""This is outrageous behavior from a federal authority, and I stand by our citizens’ rights to peacefully observe and/or protest.""

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline also released a statement Wednesday, saying Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home.

""ICE's terror and intimidation tactics reflect a complete lack of humanity and concern for basic human welfare. These masked men with no regard for the rule of law are causing long-term damage to our state and to our country,"" Sheline said. ""Lewiston stands for the dignity of all the people who call Maine home. We will never stop caring for our neighbors.""

Reports of increased ICE activity spread across southern Maine on Tuesday, prompting brief school lockouts and rising anxiety among immigrant communities.

Two Portland schools—Deering High School and Lincoln Middle School—briefly locked their doors around 9 a.m. after reports of ICE agents possibly on nearby Brighton Avenue. No threat was found, and the lockouts were quickly lifted, district officials said.

""This is an understandably tense time in our community, as reports and rumors of immigration enforcement actions grow,"" a statement from Portland Public Schools said. ""The Portland Public Schools will continue to follow our protocols for keeping students and staff safe, while also staying focused on our core work of teaching and learning. We will continue to provide updates directly to our PPS community as we have information to share.""

Elsewhere, Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis urged tribal members to carry tribal identification amid reports of federal detentions of Native Americans in other states. He said no ICE activity had been reported on tribal lands in Maine but cautioned members to stay informed.

""We know that many of you have heard reports of ICE interactions involving individuals who are, by law and by birthright, citizens of Tribal Nations,"" Francis said in a statement. ""News and social media reports indicate that ICE has detained several Native Americans throughout the country and have conducted raids on facilities located on Tribal lands. The Tribal government has verified that some of these reports are true, and some are false.""

Maine Republicans have criticized Gov. Janet Mills and Secretary of State Shenna Bellows for their response to reports of heightened ICE activity.

After a request from Homeland Security, Bellows announced she would pause issuing new undercover Maine license plates to federal agencies, saying she wanted assurances the plates would not be used “for lawless purposes.”

On Wednesday, Bellows issued a statement in response to the ""Operation Catch of the Day"" launch.

“What ICE is doing right now in Maine is unconscionable. Maine is consistently ranked as one of the safest states in the country. It’s because Mainers are strong – we look out for our neighbors and we take care of one another. There can be no pretense that ICE is here to keep us safe; they are here to stoke fears, play political games, and try to destroy the Maine spirit. Our immigrant neighbors make our communities stronger, and they are a critical part of what makes Maine the best place to live.”

“When it comes to protecting new Mainers, I’ll do everything in my power to hold the Trump administration accountable and protect our state.”

What Employers Need to Know The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear argument in Richards leaves a variance in class certification standards across jurisdictions.
Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.","On January 12, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to address a deepening circuit split about the process for certifying collective class actions under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”). As a result, uncertainty persists for employers and employees alike, with federal courts adopting a range of standards.

Historical Class Certification Standard

Both Rule 23 class actions and FLSA section 216(b) collective actions allow employees to bring suit on behalf of others who are “similarly situated.” Section 216(b) mandates employee-plaintiffs opt-in to the lawsuit, which requires courts to approve and oversee the circulation of class notice to potential plaintiffs. The same process applies to ADEA class actions. In Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sperling (1989), the U.S. Supreme Court authorized the sending of notice of a FLSA collective action to potential opt-in plaintiffs so long as that notice is neutral, timely and accurate. Following the Supreme Court’s holding in Hoffman-La Roche, most federal courts adopted a plaintiff-friendly, two-step analysis articulated in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. Under the Lusardi approach, plaintiffs who demonstrate that employees are “similarly situated” based on a “modest factual showing” achieve conditional certification.

Conditional certification permits district courts to oversee the circulation of notice to potential class action members. Courts then consider final certification or decertification at a later point in the case. Practically, this lenient standard has increased class sizes and created pressure for employers to settle early, before incurring the time and expense associated with the seemingly perfunctory “conditional” certification process and, thereafter, the final, evidence-based class certification decision.

Seventh Circuit’s Approach

In August, the Seventh Circuit, in Richards v. Eli Lilly & Company, departed from the two-step Lusardi analysis. There, the Seventh Circuit held that district courts must consider evidence from both sides concerning whether workers are similarly situated enough to proceed together. Under the Seventh Circuit’s approach in Richards, a plaintiff must first make a threshold showing that there is a material factual dispute as to whether the proposed collective is similarly situated. Thereafter, employer/defendants may submit rebuttal evidence. Once the court determines a material dispute exists, the decision to issue notice rests on its assessment of the factual dispute before it. Overall, this standard requires more evidence than Lusardi, which can reduce the pressure employers feel to settle that has traditionally accompanied conditional certification.

Fifth and Sixth Circuit Approach

Like the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have moved away from the traditional Lusardi standard.

In the Fifth Circuit (Swales v. KLLM Transport Services LLC), plaintiffs must meet a more demanding one-step test, showing it is “more likely than not” that employees are similarly situated. When crafting this standard in Swales, the Fifth Circuit noted the more lenient Lusardi approach resulted in broad circulation of conditional class notice to plaintiffs who were not truly similarly situated. This was frequently used as leverage against employers to compel them to settle. Similar to the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth Circuit now requires lower courts to vet plaintiffs at the outset of litigation and consider all available evidence before authorizing class notices. This standard is far more favorable to employer/defendants.

In the Sixth Circuit (Clark v. A&L Homecare and Training Center, LLC), plaintiffs must demonstrate a “strong likelihood” that the proposed group is similarly situated. The Sixth Circuit rejected the “more likely than not” standard as too high of a bar for plaintiffs, but found the Lusardi approach too lenient. Thus, in the Sixth Circuit, a plaintiff must make a showing that goes beyond creating a genuine issue of fact, but it need not rise to the level of “more likely than not” or a “preponderance”. Accordingly, the standard of proof in the Sixth Circuit falls between Lusardi and Swales.

The Supreme Court Denies Certiorari in Richards

In Richards, Eli Lilly submitted a petition for certiorari—which was joined by several amici—arguing that it was critical the Supreme Court resolve the growing circuit split in class certification standards. Last week, however, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Richards will now head back to the district court, which will likely apply the new Seventh Circuit standard to determine class certification.

What Employers Need to Know

The Supreme Court’s refusal to hear argument in Richards leaves a variance in class certification standards across jurisdictions. While most federal courts continue to apply the Lusardi approach—a relatively low bar for plaintiffs to obtain condition certification—recent decisions in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits have created stricter, more employer-friendly standards. These varying criteria will almost certainly have the strategic effect of encouraging collective action plaintiffs to file suit—if jurisdictionally possible—in circuits other than the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh. Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.

Area, Officials Say","Jill Cowan, Orlando Mayorquín, Johnny Diaz, www.nytimes.com, jill-cowan, orlando-mayorquin, johnny-diaz",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/los-angeles-shooting-ice.html,"A federal agent fired his weapon during an immigration enforcement operation in the Los Angeles area on Wednesday morning, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Federal agents in tactical gear and carrying long rifles were at the scene, as were sheriff’s deputies.
Holly Mitchell, who represents the area on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said in an interview that she had been briefed on the episode by officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department on Wednesday.
She said she drove there to check on her parents, who live in the area, and to protest the federal agents.
She waved a large Mexican flag she said she had used at a previous “No Kings” protest in Los Angeles.","A federal agent fired his weapon during an immigration enforcement operation in the Los Angeles area on Wednesday morning, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

The agency said in an emailed statement that its agents were conducting an operation around 7 a.m. to arrest a man who they said had been “involved in a human smuggling operation.”

The department said that the man, Eduardo Moran Carballo, of El Salvador, had attempted “to evade arrest” and then “rammed law enforcement” with his vehicle. The agency said a federal agent had “fired defensive shots” and feared for his safety. It did not specify which Department of Homeland Security agency the officer worked for.

Mr. Carballo was not hit or injured in the shooting, the department said. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer was injured, according to the Homeland Security Department, which did not elaborate on the nature of his injuries or state his condition. Agents took Mr. Carballo into custody.

The department said the operation took place in Compton, Calif., south of Los Angeles, but a local official said it happened in Willowbrook, an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County.

“This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming,” the department said, adding that Mr. Carballo had two prior arrests on accusations of “inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.”

Hours after the incident, the wreckage of a gray BMW sports car that crashed was on the street near a curb, its airbags deployed and both doors open. Federal agents in tactical gear and carrying long rifles were at the scene, as were sheriff’s deputies. Helicopters hovered overhead as protesters, shouting obscenities at the masked federal agents, began to arrive.

The Trump administration’s national immigration crackdown first ramped up in Southern California — and particularly in many of the heavily Latino suburbs of Los Angeles County — last summer.

Holly Mitchell, who represents the area on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, said in an interview that she had been briefed on the episode by officials with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department on Wednesday.

Ms. Mitchell said that a Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement task force action led to a “vehicle pursuit,” which ended at around 7:30 a.m. in Willowbrook. She said she was told that one round was fired, and that no one was hit. The Sheriff’s Department helped to secure the scene, she said, but emphasized that county law enforcement officers were not involved in the immigration enforcement action.

Ms. Mitchell, whose vast district includes many neighborhoods where working-class Latino families have lived for generations, said that the episode on Wednesday appeared to have been carried out with “the same kind of recklessness and lack of regard for basic human rights and true public safety” that she has seen from federal agents for months.

The car chase on Wednesday, she said, took place during the morning rush hour, just as families were taking children to school. She added that the use of lethal force by agents, both in Los Angeles and in other cities, is troubling.

“Fortunately no one was killed,” she said. “It was by sheer luck — I assume they didn’t intend to miss when they fired their firearm, so we were blessed today.”

Ms. Mitchell urged constituents to continue to document any activity they see, if they can do so safely. She echoed officials in Minnesota who have said that such documentation of interactions between federal agents and members of the public could be important evidence in future court cases over the federal government’s tactics.

Rosa Enriquez, 39, who lives in nearby South Gate, was among dozens of people who gathered at the scene. She said she drove there to check on her parents, who live in the area, and to protest the federal agents. She waved a large Mexican flag she said she had used at a previous “No Kings” protest in Los Angeles.

“We’re in Compton,” she said. “We’re so used to living life being cautious, being careful, and this is what we fear the most.”

Mendoza, 17, ""was taken by ICE without warning, leaving his family shocked and terrified,"" the organizers of the fundraiser wrote.","While the federal Department of Homeland Security continues to withhold the identity of most of the 11 people arrested by ICE agents in Morristown on Jan. 11, the community has rallied to support at least two of them in a big way.

Online fundraisers have identified two of the residents arrested that Sunday morning along Speedwell Avenue —including a Morristown High School senior. Donors have raised $120,000 for their legal defense as they face deportation.

Adonay Mancia Rodriguez went to pick up a takeout food delivery at the front door of his apartment building when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested him, leaving his 6-year-old daughter alone, a family friend said. The Honduran national came to the U.S. in 2013 and works in town as a chef, according to Cathleen Murphy, a Morristown teacher and neighbor of Mancia Rodriguez's family.

He remains in custody at the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility, ICE records show.

""He came here as a refugee when he was 17 years old,"" said Murphy, who said she was ""acting as [the family's] advocate during this time.""

""He never received a follow-up mailing for his immigration process,"" she said. ""He has a case to get his green card and everything. He just didn't receive the mailing to go to court. So he never followed up with the process and then that's what led to the deportation order, we guess.""

When he told the ICE officials his daughter was upstairs, ""They said, 'We're not here for your daughter. We're here for you,'"" Murphy added. ""They did not send anybody to check on her or coordinate with local police or anything. They just took him to the car.""

The girl was in the apartment upstairs for about an hour until she realized something was wrong, Murphy said.

6-year-old left alone

""So she gathered up her things, her coat, her shoes and her tablet, and she went out on the street,"" she said. ""She waited for a woman who came walking up the street and she said, 'I don't know where my dad is.' The woman was able to use the tablet to contact the family. Her mother was working at Walmart at the time.""

""The little girl is absolutely traumatized,"" Murphy said.

Mancia Rodriguez's family has been allowed to visit him in detention, and an attorney is working on the case.

""We're waiting to hear this week if the judge will accept the motion to reopen his case to become a citizen. or a resident,"" Murphy said.

In a Jan. 15 response to emailed questions, three days after the raid, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed the arrests of 11 ""illegal aliens, several with felony offenses"" in the Morristown operation.

Others ""took advantage of the Biden administration’s open border crisis,"" Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS assistant secretary, said in the email.

The message did not identify the detainees nor provide details about the alleged offenses.

Online fundraisers

Murphy has cosponsored an online fundraiser for her neighbor's legal defense along with a family cousin of Mancia Rodriguez, Rosa Portillo. It had exceeded $26,000 as of late on Jan. 20.

""He first came to the country as a refugee and has been living and working in Morristown for over a decade,"" Portillo wrote.

""He is a hard worker with no criminal record whatsoever who is just trying to provide for his family. He has a huge family here that is devastated, but most of all is his daughter, who is inconsolable. They are very close and all she wants is to have him back.""

Another fundraiser has collected more than $94,000 for the legal defense of Juan David Mendoza, a Morristown High School senior who was among the detainees. Mendoza, 17, ""was taken by ICE without warning, leaving his family shocked and terrified,"" the organizers of the fundraiser wrote.

Organizers have yet to respond to messages from the Daily Record, but according to an update on the fundraising page, a district judge ordered the teen's release on Jan. 15 and he is currently represented by legal counsel. Efforts to reach the family were unsuccessful.

In a follow-up email from DHS on Jan. 20, McLaughlin said Mendoza was ""an illegal alien from Honduras"" who had entered the U.S. in 2024. ""He is an adult,"" McLaughlin added.

""All individuals are currently detained, and either in removal proceedings or in the process of being removed from the United States in accordance with U.S. immigration law,"" she said.

While New York City has robust legal aid networks, the BUILD Act would help develop rural and upstate regions where immigration services are scarcer.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Advocates and Democratic elected officials rallied at the Million Dollar Staircase on Wednesday, demanding Governor Kathy Hochul and the legislature pass bills that shield immigrant from federal enforcement. They want the state to refuse cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to offer legal aid to New Yorkers who are detained.

“We are here at a pivotal moment, a moment in time where our state and our country is at a crossroads,” said Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition. “Do we want to continue being a democracy, or do we want to allow a fascist, authoritarian dictator to take us in a different direction?”

The coalition wants the governor to include $175 million in her Fiscal Year 2027 executive budget to pay for the legal services of immigrants facing deportation. That’s because, unlike in criminal court, people in civil immigration court aren’t guaranteed a lawyer.

That’s why lawmakers at the rally pushed for the Access to Representation Act. That bill, S141/A270, would establish the right to legal counsel for those making less than 200% of the federal poverty line—about $31,000 for a single person, $42,000 for a couple, and $64,000 for a family of four—when they’re involved in removal proceedings.

Proponents cited a statistic that immigrants with lawyers are up to two-and-a-half times likelier to win their cases. “Immigration court has as much due process as traffic court, it has been said, but with outcomes as grave as the death penalty,” said Catharine Grainge from the Jericho Road Community Health Center in Buffalo.

Grainge, an attorney, recounted a frantic 72-hour window where she drafted a 300-page motion to save a client from immediate deportation, a technical feat that probably would be impossible for unrepresented immigrants.

Proponents cited a New York City Comptroller report estimating that universal legal representation would put $8.4 billion in savings and revenue in the government’s coffers.

The coalition also rallied for the Building Up Immigrant Legal Defense Act. The BUILD Act, S4538/A2689, would create a grant program to recruit and train lawyers, social workers, and community navigators to handle increasing immigration caseloads.

The BUILD Act would fund infrastructure in legal deserts, rural and remote regions where immigration services are historically scarce compared to the state average. While New York City has robust legal aid networks, the BUILD Act would help develop rural and upstate regions where immigration services are scarcer. The legislation is supposed to give attorneys more time to work on complex litigation.

Ralliers also promoted the New York for All Act, S2235A/A3506A, prohibiting state and local officers—including police and probation officers—from using tax dollars or resources to help immigration agents.

Supporters say ICE increasingly uses local police as deportation agents, eroding public trust by making New Yorkers afraid to report crimes, call for emergency services, or go to school. “We are not going to let you come into our communities to terrorize our neighborhoods, to divide our families, and to devastate our economies,” said State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, a Democrat from southern Brooklyn.

The coalition offered more statistics. Between January and July of 2025, they said, ICE detained almost 5,000 New Yorkers—more than in all of 2024 combined. As of August, almost 340,000 cases were pending in the state’s immigration courts. Assemblymember Catalina Cruz, a Democrat from Queens, described ICE detentions as kidnapping. She cited reports of 36 people dying in ICE custody in 2025.

They also highlighted the economic impacts of immigrants, who paid $31.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2023, while foreign-born residents account for more than a quarter of the workforce and include 190,800 entrepreneurs. “We’ve relied on that money that the immigrants bring every year to make our budget balanced,” Cruz said. “We need to make sure that we are not giving breadcrumbs to immigrants, because it’s frankly insulting.”

While anti-immigration voices maintain that cooperation with federal authorities is necessary to remove criminals and protect public safety, those at the rally disputed that connection between immigration and crime. Assemblymember Karines Reyes, a Democrat from the Bronx, said federal agents target law-abiding residents because they ran out of criminals on day one.

The governor and state legislature are supposed to finalize the state budget by the April 1 deadline, but the state has consistently missed that deadline in recent years.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2026/01/Immigration-rally-January-21-2026.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-21 17:00:07.440394

Named for Democratic politician William S. Holman, the rule has been instated and rescinded over the decades.
That same year, some Republicans considered using the rule to derail a now-abandoned special counsel investigation into Donald Trump, though the maneuver was never deployed.
“The amendment before you is simple, and it’s narrow,” Veasey said at the hearing.
“It sends a clear message that we are not going to fund this man’s salary, and that Congress will not fund hate.","As a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill works its way through Congress, Congressman Marc Veasey, a Democrat who represents part of Dallas, introduced an amendment in committee Wednesday aimed to reduce the salary of James Rodden, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) assistant chief counsel who acts as a prosecutor for ICE in immigration court in Dallas, to $1.

In February of last year, the Texas Observer reported that Rodden operates a white supremacist X account named GlomarResponder, based on an overwhelming number of biographical details that the Observer matched through publicly available documents, other social media activity, and courtroom observation. Three members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including Veasey, wrote letters to ICE and DHS demanding information and investigation. In response, ICE sent a letter to Veasey stating it would address the matter and that such internal investigations can take up to 120 days, but it has otherwise not provided any information.

Veasey’s amendment came a week after the Observer reported that Rodden, who was apparently pulled from federal immigration court schedules following the Observer’s reporting last February, had returned to immigration court in Dallas.

“[Rodden’s] statements are disgusting, and they are dangerous, and regardless of if you are a Democrat or a Republican, they should be disqualifying for anyone entrusted with power in the United States government,” Veasey said during Wednesday’s House Rules Committee hearing. “If Congress does nothing, if the committee does nothing, then we’re sending the message that this type of behavior is tolerable, that accountability is optional, and that white supremacy can continue to be subsidized with taxpayer dollars.”

The GlomarResponder account has over 17,000 followers and has routinely posted hateful statements. In addition to posting that “America is a White nation,” that “‘Migrants’ are all criminals,” and that “All blacks are foreign to my people,” plus apparent praise of Adolf Hitler, the account has also made posts that evoke anti-immigrant violence: “Nobody is proposing feeding migrants into tree shredders,” the account posted in March 2024. “Yet. Give it a few more weeks at this level of invasion, and that will be the moderate position.”

Veasey’s amendment seeking to reduce Rodden’s salary relied upon the Holman Rule, which allows members of the U.S. House to amend appropriations legislation to cut specific programs or reduce the salary of specific federal employees. Named for Democratic politician William S. Holman, the rule has been instated and rescinded over the decades. It was most recently reinstated in 2023 when Republicans retook the majority. That same year, some Republicans considered using the rule to derail a now-abandoned special counsel investigation into Donald Trump, though the maneuver was never deployed.

“The amendment before you is simple, and it’s narrow,” Veasey said at the hearing. “It sends a clear message that we are not going to fund this man’s salary, and that Congress will not fund hate. We can stand by Nazi sympathizers and Hitler supporters, or we can do the right thing and honor the sacrifices of the men and women who died to stop the hateful spread of Nazism.”

They were not, and now they need not be anywhere near these plaintiffs’ baseless claims.” – Christina Jump, Jump Start Legal Justice Center","MLFA celebrates the dismissal of the lawsuit against American Muslims for Palestine (“AMP”) and its leaders, Dr. Osama Abuirshaid and Dr. Hatem Bazian, in the Central District of California on January 20, 2026. The lawsuit was one of many in which MLFA helps to defend AMP and its leaders against baseless claims. Judge Mark Scarsi agreed with AMP that “there are no factual allegations raising an inference that AMP was involved” in any conspiracy to harm Plaintiffs. Despite inflammatory allegations unrelated to the claims, AMP and its leaders continue to see the truth prevail.

MLFA is grateful to Ms. Christina Jump, who began her work on this lawsuit as the Civil Litigation Department Head in MLFA’s Legal Division, and continues to serve as lead counsel for AMP after entering private practice with Jump Start Legal Justice Center. MLFA remains dedicated to helping to represent AMP, with Staff Attorneys Samira Elhosary and Ali Boyd supporting Ms. Jump for the duration of this case. Thanks also go to AMP’s local counsel, Max Schoening of Qureshi Law, for all his help.

“We’re so excited to see AMP vindicated, yet again, from these baseless attacks. Though the lawsuits continue to get creative, we continue to rise to the occasion to protect AMP and allow it to continue its important work educating the US public about the just cause of Palestine.”

– Samira Elhosary, Civil Litigation Staff Attorney:

“I remain honored to lead litigation for AMP, both during my time at MLFA and now as Jump Start Legal Justice Center. Each time we have the opportunity for facts to rise over fear, the federal courts recognize the failures of the lawsuits against AMP. AMP and its officials work hard, and work honestly, and even the plaintiffs couldn’t point to a single fact where AMP committed a violation — as the Judge rightly observed that “there are no allegations that anyone from AMP was anywhere near” the events the plaintiffs claim caused them harm. They were not, and now they need not be anywhere near these plaintiffs’ baseless claims.”

And uh uh I also wanna add this.
""Portland Mayor Mark Dion and members of the Portland City Council spoke Wednesday afternoon about the presence of ICE in Maine.
Portland Mayor Mark Dion and members of the Portland City Council spoke Wednesday afternoon about the presence of ICE in Maine.","Uh, but this is an opportunity. Uh, for us, for us. To answer any questions and concerns you might want to express, now that ICE has engaged in their enforcement action, not only in the city of Portland, but it appears in the metro as well. So I want to respond to the fact that. Our communities feel anxious and fearful. They see this action as unpredictable and *** threat to their families. Collectively and individually, we've done everything we can to assure them and that. We believe in their right to be safe. And we've tried to direct resources their way to support their capacity to stay here in Portland. From hybrid education schools offering food sustenance. And just getting the rights and responsibilities out to all key parties so they know what to do should they engage *** federal officer. I want to underscore one important point. While we respect the law. We challenge the need for *** paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. Federal immigration law is lawful. Its administration and enforcement is lawful. While we may dispute the basis for those laws as individual citizens. The fact remains it is federal law. What we've been concerned with as *** council is the enforcement tactics. That ICE has undertaken in other communities, which to our mind appear to threaten and intimidate populations. If they change the way they do their business, then we can focus on doing our responsibility as citizens and changing policy through our elected officials. So this council doesn't stand apart from our immigrant communities, but we stand with them. As *** reminder. The Portland Police Department does not involve itself in the enforcement. Of civil Administrative violations under federal immigration statute. As police officers, if there is *** call. For support Having to do with imminent threat to life. or serious bodily injury, no matter who the agency or individual is, we will respond as we would to any one of you calling 911. That is our duty in terms of public safety. I'll interrupt for *** moment. Councilor Fornier, you can join us up here. Thank. So we, we've received *** lot of information from the public that, uh, enforcement contacts have occurred in the community, um, and that has come in the form of text or phone calls or shared videos, so we know they're there. um, I will remind the public, allow officers to do their work, do not obstruct. Uh, the best thing you can do is to be the best possible witness should the facts that come before you are needed by any future, uh, investigation or judicial inquiry. All right. If officers are acting with warrant, they are within the law. And this is not the place or the time to challenge that. I want everyone safe. Interrupting law enforcement action is *** risk conduct. It may feel appropriate in the moment, but it could lead to outcomes neither party wished upon each other when they began the transaction. So I want to make that clear. I also respect the right to dissent, to protest, to express your misgivings or rejection of current government policy. If all of you decide to do that, our police department has demonstrated an exemplary history in in. Protecting That expression Of constitutional right and we will continue to do so. Before I came out here, someone came in and said, if we did *** protest, we would be safe. And I assured him that the Portland Police Department would do its job, as it always has, impartially, professionally. The other concern we had about ICE arriving, and I put it this way, as *** former member of law enforcement. What Mayor Shalene and I expect is that federal agencies and their agents will conduct themselves in *** professional manner, respect the rule of law. And treat our citizens without the use of provocation. Exercise the restraint. That's necessary. These are standards that are not alien to anyone who carries *** badge. It's the standard we expect of our municipal police officers, and I hope and pray it's *** standard that the director of ICE would exercise against their agents. So With that, I'll open it up for questions. Mayor. Yes, are you aware that there are *** number of businesses in town that have put signs in their windows, uh, saying that ICE is not welcome? You. Want to talk about it. I want, I, I wanna allow, uh, Councilor. fellows here to address that because one of the businesses is in his district. Introduce yourself. Full name, spelling. Uh, I'm West Pelletier, W E S P E L L E T I E R. I'm the city councilor in District 2, which is that way. Um, I want to be really clear, this is *** war of terror that's being waged on our city by the federal government, um. We've seen, um, people of all ages getting thrown on the ground and getting thrown into trucks. Um, and in response, people in Portland, business owners, um, Teachers, uh, college kids have formed *** network, um. To make sure that we have early warnings. And that we are able to get there in time to at the very least get *** name before someone disappears. Um, We have people delivering groceries to mothers that need diapers, but they're too afraid to leave because they know correctly that as soon as they leave, there's going to be 4 guys in the unmarked car outside their driveway that will throw them to the ground and take them, nobody really knows where. Um, While every single abduction that's happened. Is *** wound to Portland. Um, it's been very clear that Every single one has underlined just how important immigrants are to our community. They're the backbone of our economy, um. They are the kids that are getting on school buses. They are the families that go out to eat and, and make life what it is. And No one asked the federal government to come here. This is one of the safest cities in the country. But because of, uh, you know, an agenda of white nationalism and, um, might makes right. Uh, we now have *** war on our streets. So, you know, what I would ask, I don't expect much from Senator Collins, from the administration, um, but I'd ask that the Democrats who are supposed to have our backs, grow *** little bit of *** spine. And do what *** random mother in any of our neighborhoods is willing to do and take action to abolish ICE. Uh, thanks. I can also answer questions. Do you have any sense, Mayor, of how many arrests have taken place in the last couple of days in the greater Portland area? I don't. I mean, If it was just based on videos I received, it'd be less than 6. I know ICE has, uh, declared there's been 50 in Maine. So it's an open question. And are you getting any communication from ISDHS anyone in the federal government on this? No, I mean, but that's *** consequence. Uh, in the years preceding this council being seated, our predecessors passed an ordinance that limits, uh, the cooperation of the foreign police as it applies to the enforcement immigration statutes from the federal level, so. If we're not cooperating, I think it's reasonable to anticipate they're not calling. And we're not calling them either because we're clear about what our mission is, is to protect the overall public safety, and they have *** very discreet narrow responsibility to enforce immigration law. What have you heard from the crowd? What is happening? How aggressive are they? What is the worst? I, I, I think I've heard narratives, um, from the ground that suggest real anxiety and fear just with their presence. Councillor Ellie. I'll turn to Councilor Ali. He's the mayor pro tem, and, uh, he does engage many of our diverse communities in the city for his opinion. Uh, thank you, Mayor. I Come again. Uh my name is Pius, P I O U S and my last name is Ali. And uh uh what I would say is that uh people on the ground are organized. I think one of my colleagues have said that earlier, uh people are afraid, they are scared, people's anxiety has have gone up because they don't know what to expect. Imagine you are *** parent and you step out to put your kid in *** school bus. By the time, by the time you turn around, you are surrounded by uh uh uh ICE agents and they are ready to take you with them. Who is going to take your child when they come back from school? So, because we don't want that to happen in our community, there have been *** lot of community groups coming together. We have created different channels where anything that somebody need, whether it is food or if they want their kids to be put in the school bus on their behalf, there are people on the ground that are going to do that. And uh uh I also wanna add this. I think if the federal government is looking for anyone in this country, so far as the person engaged the system. The federal government knows how to get that person. Without intimidation. Without unleashing terror on our streets. And I would say that we are here and we are willing to support our community as much as we can within the boundaries of the laws. And we are not going to be intimidated. By what is happening on the streets. Thank you. The Somali community in Minnesota has been *** focus of the ice enforcement happening there. Is that also true and important? Well, I don't know. But based on uh photos that were published uh by ICE, it seems the case that it's people of color, not necessarily from Somalia, and I'll discuss that in *** moment. Any other questions? What happens if ICE doesn't comply with the rules like you said they. Did you respond? Obviously this is something that we saw in Minneapolis where they're withholding investigative materials. Well, you can't decide how you're going to cross the bridge till you get there. Right, I, I, I think that's important. I don't like to, to speculate on what's gonna happen. As *** lawyer and as lawyers would agree, *** cause of action has to be established by conduct and speaking of conduct, I think Minneapolis was characterized by *** notable massing of federal agents entering *** neighborhood and I think the narrative of invasion arose from that. The perspective What I'm hearing from and I think and I talked with mayors today in other parts of the state we're seeing very individualized activity by ICE, *** person here, *** neighborhood there, um, their conduct at least. As it's current in Maine seems to be focused, which would indicate to me, and this is the speculation, is that they're functioning on the basis of an actual court warrant. So therefore they've identified *** party they have an address, they know who they're looking for specifically as opposed to this random show me your papers kind of experience. So by doing so, I don't think we're gonna see groupings of agents just patrolling the neighborhood. I think we're gonna get individualized reports from families like I, I received one. Uh, from *** mother saying that her son was arrested at *** grocer, uh, as he came out of work, and I've heard *** rumor that *** hospital saw some of their staff removed, um, but it seems like it's more specific. If that's the case, it appears that ICE may have evolved the way in which they want to engage the community for purposes of enforcement. And I, and I appreciate the US attorney's comments that he was paying attention to the situation and, uh, wanted for peaceful transactions by all parties. So we'll see. At the end of the day, we'll see. That's why it's important to document with your witness in the future there may be. Individuals, attorneys, or judicial processes that will need your information. Anything else? Go ahead. Do you have any message for business owners who are not just posting signs, but you know, are very fearful about, you know, carrying on doing new businesses, any reassurances the city can provide that they will be safe and can continue to do commerce? Well, we want them to do commerce. I mean, one of the meetings I participated with, uh, Representatives from the immigrant community, immigrant businesses in the chamber was to set up *** communications channel. We provided them with resources so they'd be clear about their rights and what steps they could take to protect, um. Their employees But it's hard because it's individualized if they're coming for one specific person that's gonna have *** different outcome on the business as opposed to saying you appear to have hired *** number of individuals who may have come from another country we're gonna line them up outside and check their papers. I don't think we're there, to be fair. I think we're in the individualized piece and just to reinforce about the signs in the window. I mean, last I checked, that is the First Amendment. All right. It may not have been perfectly expressed. It may have not taken the tone or language that some could appreciate, but I think. I can't speak to the operation of the mind of the owner of that business, but I think her intent was to. Display her rejection of adverse ICE activity, especially at her place of business. So and when we did talk at the chamber, we also talked about business continuity, what happens if the person doesn't come back quickly from from the detention and what the uh business could do. So we have been talking to *** lot of people on this issue. Yes, what message do you have to the federal government and the president at this time? I don't know if I'm gonna communicate to the president. I, I'm gonna communicate to the US attorney. Because he's made, we're made. And I think he has sent *** message that he has *** similar expectation that we do about how the federal government. Will behave as they conduct their lawful duties. I think if the president is to receive *** message, let him receive it from our senators and our congresspersons. That's their responsibility. That's their role, and I hope that that would have more impact than the Portland City council alone because I think our position is quite clear. In terms of Information I, I sent out. Who they arrested, right? Did you all get that with some mug shots? All right, let me do some homework with you. I was not afflicted with the idea of becoming *** lawyer, but I spent 32 years in law enforcement. So I actually read this. And I went to the photos. The first individual. It says um Mr. Ali is *** criminal illegal alien from Sudan convicted for false imprisonment, aggravated assault, assault, obstructing justice. And the violation of protection order. I think that's meant to frighten you. I think that's meant to infer that this criminal person was free in our com on our community, but you missed the word convicted. He's been convicted. He's been through the process. If so, has he served *** sentence? Is he considered now *** free person as far as the criminal justice? System is concerned. And that's one of the elite arrests now he might be in violation of *** civil infraction under the immigration code. That's your job to find out the next one. Ambassador Burney, *** criminal illegal alien. From Ethiopia convicted for aggravated assault and cocaine possession. Like convicted, what's the actual termination of that case? What's its posture? Did he become illegal as *** consequence of the conviction or did he enter this country lawfully, as many have, and that's always lost in the narrative. Elmara Correa, *** criminal illegal alien from Angola, previously arrested. For endangering, endangering the welfare of *** child. Was she found not guilty? Or are we just going to be satisfied that she was arrested? This is *** problem for the 4th estate. We are not members of your estate. That's your work. And last but not least. Because it appears that the assistant director. was indicting communities. Danny Lopez-Cortez, *** criminal illegal alien from Guatemala, convicted. For OUI. Right? Those were her 5 top picks to show you the state of crime and justice in in Maine. Oh I. It If we're going to talk about this issue, let's talk about facts. If we're gonna provide guidance, let us be calm, let us be leaders. If ICE has an issue with criminal aliens, let them actually be criminals. Right? And we can come to terms. Bye. I don't know. You're the judge of that. With the I didn't plan on taking the podium this long. From California. Thank you. I remember first name, last name, um, April Fournier, *** P R I L F O U R N I E R. Um, I'm one of our city's at-large councilors, um, and I apologize for my casual state of dress as I was out today in the community doing observing like we've asked so many of our community members to do, um, because one of the things that I know as an indigenous person, Um, as I have *** lot of friends and relatives in the Minnesota and Minneapolis area. And so what they have seen is detention of our very own indigenous community members. And so when we were notified that we would have ICE operations here in Portland, one of the most important things to me was to be out in the. Community with our neighbors with our relatives um watching and observing and really trying to reinforce with everyone because this is not day to day business for us is to to observe to show up for your community um to make sure that everyone understands that really immigrants are what make Portland just such an incredible place to be. And what we're not only going to see the social impact and what we all feel when these operations are happening in our neighborhoods, in front of our schools, in front of our grocery stores, is we're also going to see an economic impact. These are now families that will have potentially the primary breadwinner in their household have, has been disappeared. So how are they going to make rent? So we have the potential for. Increase of evictions. We're seeing impacts to our schools for all of these members who are teachers, who are students who are working in the cafeteria or working, um, as bus drivers. If they're not available, our schools are now short-handed. We're seeing that, you know, with businesses around the city, if these people are being disappeared, there's also *** gap. And so these are just such critical members of our community. Um, if we saw that this immigration enforcement was consistent, was following the law, uh, with this administration, I don't think any of us would have the level of anxiety that we're having right now. And so, um, again, I apologize that I am *** little casual today, but it's because I believe if you're going to be of the community, you need to be out in the community, um, and having eyes on. And so, as, uh, Councillor Ali mentioned, there are networks that have been set up for communities to stay in communication with each other to make sure they're checking out. Up on each other, observing, recording so that we have this information to be able to provide back to any of the legal entities if we do see that operations are not being carried out as they're supposed to be according to law. Um, but I'm so proud here to stand with this council and with our mayor and with all of our city staff and our school staff, um, and our school administration to continue to keep Portland operating and being the place that we know that it is, despite what's happening right in this moment. Thank you. I'd also call Councilor Sarah McNevitch, who represents probably the most diverse district in the city. Thank you, Mayor. Uh, that's, uh, Sarah McNevitch, District one, S *** R *** H M I C H N I E W I C Z. Um, as the mayor said, this is the most diverse district in the city and the state. Um, we have *** large immigrant population that continues to grow and thrive and bring value and vitality and economic benefit and, um, and Life to the city. Um, it's our responsibility to stand up for the communities that make our city what it is. Um, we have *** tremendous opportunity here to look out for them, um, to stand up, to record, to monitor what's going on lawfully, legally, um, As my colleagues have alluded to, uh, it's, it's, there are legitimate reasons for immigration enforcement. Um, it's the methods that are being employed and the broadcast approach that is so objectionable to so many. Um, there's, there's no legitimate purpose that's being pursued that cannot be achieved through due process. And I think that's the sticking point for *** lot of us. Um, I would encourage everyone to pay attention to what's going on around you, to look out for your neighbors, to know your rights, to know your responsibilities, and to know your resources, to know where to turn, uh, when you want to either report something or to share information or to assist other people, whether they be, you know, walking to school or just looking to have groceries to survive day to day in their homes. Um, That's, that's our strongest asset in Portland is our sense of community and our sense of pride. And our sense of knowing what is right. And that's what this council stands for. That's what I stand for. That's what the mayor stands for. And I know that's what the vast majority of our citizens stand for and what we will continue to support and continue to act on no matter what comes forward in the coming days. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor. Last but not least. Councilor Phillips. Uh, thank you, Mr. Mayor. Regina Phillips, R E G I N *** P H I L L I P S I represent district three. You know, as I sit here with my colleagues, uh, there isn't anything new that I can say to you other than, um, with this, you know, I don't know if there's warrants out there or, you know, whatever. All I know is what I hear is, is that some folks, um, are just being detained just because, right? We're very similar to Minnesota. They're just being detained because they are. My concern is with the children that are being left behind. We have, we have families that are, people, um, men and women, uh, um, mothers and fathers that are literally being dragged away from their children is what I hear. And, You know, if you have *** child, um, that is either in the grocery store or at home with *** parent, they don't know how to use *** cell phone. They don't know how to get in touch with their other parent. They don't know how to get in touch with *** relative. And as we know, ICE is not coordinating with anybody. They're not coordinating with our police department. They're not coordinating with the Department of Health and Human Services to make sure these children are safe. um, and so we have to mobilize because there are kids out there that are literally being dragged away from their parents. And that's the most concerning to me is what is actually happening to those children with their parents are being taken away literally at the gas station or the grocery store or at schools because they just don't have the means. And the ability to reach out to their relatives and say, hey, I'm stuck. I'm here by myself. And then where do they go? Where do they go? Because we know our foster care system is completely and utterly is overwhelmed. And so that's the concerning thing if you have *** warrant. If you want to detain somebody, like the mayor says, there's probably not much we can do about that, but do it in *** manner where children are not left by themselves. That's just cruel. Thank you, Councilor Superintendent. Chair. No, no, both of you. Listen, um One part that can be left behind is When *** city is going through this type of journey. And you, you heard it at the beginning of the conversations with Councilor Phillips. It's just not about what's occurring to the adults. The kids are there and the kids suffer along with us or celebrate along with us or made anxious because they don't understand what adults are actually trying to do. So one of the first persons that called me the morning that we knew ICE was in the city was Superintendent Scola. So, we protect our constituents, they protect our families, and the most important thing that we all agree on, our kids. So I'd I'd like to defer the podium to the chair, Sarah Lentz, and, uh, I'll stand with the councilor. So if you have any questions that are geared to families in the schools, they're here to respond to that, Madam Chair. Thank you. I'm Sarah Lentz, uh, S *** R *** H. Last name L E N T Z, and I'm chair of the board here in Portland. Um, I told, uh, *** reporter this morning *** story about my own child, who, when I picked him up from school, said to me, first off, he said, today my teacher told me there was ice on the playground and we needed to be careful. And I thought that there were people there to get me and my friends. That level of worry and anxiety is what all of our children are carrying as they go into the classroom. And we know that learning doesn't happen when kids are hungry, when they are scared, and when they don't feel safe. And what is happening in our community right now is making our community not feel safe. And that is not OK. As so many counselors have said today, there are other ways to do this. There are other ways that don't impact our kids and their families in the ways that they are feeling impacted right now. And I just want to say thank you to all of the community members, the individuals, and the organizations that are literally working around the clock right now to make sure that our kids have food in their house, that they can get to work or to the bus stop. That they can be connected to legal services and other resources that they need because they are fearful of coming out of their house. These are the impacts that we're seeing on *** daily basis. Our attendance rates are way down. Kids are not coming to school and their families are holding in their houses. So that's where we are. And that's where we're going to stay and we're going to hold the line and do whatever we can as educators and community members to make sure that our schools are safe and predictable spaces for everyone that are there. Yeah, at this point, are you aware of any students, staff, or family members of students who've been detained by ICE in the last few days? I can confirm that there have been people detained, but that's as much as I'm going to share. Can you give us the number? How, how much is attendance now and uh how? What, what percentage of the of the student population is uh minorities or immigrants? Yeah, so I'm happy to give *** little bit of background and then I'll ask the superintendent to give, um, uh, specific numbers on attendance. But in the Portland Public schools, we have 53% or 52% students of color in our district. About *** third of our students are multilingual learners. Um, and we also have about 500 students who are currently housing insecure. Um, so those are just some of the statistics of our, of our students, uh, right now, but I'm happy to turn it over to the superintendent who can talk more about attendance. Uh, good afternoon. Ryan Scallon, R Y *** N S C *** L L O N. Um, attendance varies significantly, um, as the impact is not even across our school community. So as Chair Lentz just shared, we are about 52, 53%, uh, students of color. Um, and we see *** range of attendance impacts. Um, our overall attendance is down more than 5% points, but we have some schools where the attendance drop is closer to 15 to 20%, uh, down. And so there's ***, there's *** wide range of how it's been impacting. Are there any measures being taken to make remote learning available? Any plans in the works to have entire schools go remote if need be? So, we know from the research coming out of COVID, as well as what we see happening in schools, that the safest, best place for students to learn for social reasons, for physical reasons, for academic reasons are in person. So as much as possible, we are planning to maintain in-person learning. The last two days I've been in our schools and I've seen that they continue to make sure that it's *** safe, welcoming place for all of our students. And so as much as possible, we want that to be. It would also not be prudent if we weren't planning for the range of contingencies. And so leadership in our district, including our school leaders, uh, have engaged and have done some planning around the potential for, uh, an online piece, but at this point, our intent is to remain in person. So I haven't heard anything about this, but just want to confirm with you, have you had any, um, any confirmed sightings of ICE agents on or near Cortland public school campuses? So, we have not had any sightings or reports of agents, um, on our, uh, property around schools. Uh, obviously, there is *** lot of information going on around, um, ICE action, and obviously, we are *** small city and with schools throughout the city. And so there's nothing that is in the immediate vicinity, but certainly in the neighborhood. If there's nothing else, we can all say goodnight.

""A war of terror that is being waged on our city."" Portland's mayor, city leaders address ICE activity in Maine

The comments come as Operation Catch of the Day is underway in the state

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched ""operation catch of the day"" in Maine on Tuesday, calling it an immigration enforcement effort across the state targeting the ""worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""Portland Mayor Mark Dion and members of the Portland City Council spoke Wednesday afternoon about the presence of ICE in Maine. Watch the entire press conference in the media player above.Dion said immigration law is lawful, but he has concerns about the tactics used by ICE.""This council doesn't stand apart from our immigrant communities, but rather, we stand with them,"" Dion said.Dion said people need to respect law enforcement, but encouraged them to be the best possible witness and document what they see. ""I want everyone safe.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched ""operation catch of the day"" in Maine on Tuesday, calling it an immigration enforcement effort across the state targeting the ""worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""

Portland Mayor Mark Dion and members of the Portland City Council spoke Wednesday afternoon about the presence of ICE in Maine.

Dion said immigration law is lawful, but he has concerns about the tactics used by ICE.

""This council doesn't stand apart from our immigrant communities, but rather, we stand with them,"" Dion said.

Dion said people need to respect law enforcement, but encouraged them to be the best possible witness and document what they see. ""I want everyone safe. Interrupting law enforcement is a risk... that could lead to outcomes no one wants,"" he said.

Dion said he did not know an exact number of arrests that had happened in Portland as part of the operation.

""This is a war of terror that is being waged on our city by the federal government,"" said Councilor Wes Pelletier. He said immigrants in the city are scared to go out, fearing that they will be arrested. He called the actions by federal agents ""abductions"" and said there was a now a war on the streets.

Councilor April Fournier said there were both social and economic impacts to the operations in Portland.

Councilor Sarah Michniewicz, who represents the most diverse district in the city and the state, said it was their responsibility to stand up for the communities that make their city what it is.

She said there are legitimate reasons for immigration enforcement, but there were concerns about the way it was being carried out.

DHS said some of the charges those arrested this week in Maine are facing include aggravated assault, false imprisonment, and endangering the welfare of a child.

Dion told Maine's Total Coverage on Tuesday that his office has been getting numerous calls and videos about ICE activity in the city.

I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency,"" DeLauro said, while also stressing that the bill ""is more than just ICE.""
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said that it ""puts no meaningful constraints on the growing lawlessness of ICE, and increases funding for detention over the last appropriations bill passed in 2024.""
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of several Democrats expected to run for president in 2028, also spoke out against the bill, telling NBC News that ""it is a surrender to Trump's lawlessness.
Some critics of recent immigration actions have suggested that any Democrat who still supports funding ICE should be primaried.","As congressional negotiators on Tuesday released a proposed spending bill for the US Department of Homeland Security, with the January 30 funding deadline rapidly approaching, critics of President Donald Trump's deadly immigration operations renewed calls for Democrats to oppose any new money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""You can't count on Dem leadership to do much, but you can for sure trust these warriors for democracy to hustle like hell to pass a bipartisan deal to fully fund the Gestapo currently attacking our cities, rather than using this one moment of leverage to try to stop them. Bravo!"" quipped progressive organizer Aaron Regunberg on social media.

Since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month, congressional Democrats have faced mounting pressure to significantly rein in DHS and its agencies, including ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). While some progressive lawmakers have embraced such calls, neither Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) nor House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has shown serious interest in using the appropriations process to that end.

Both Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) tried to frame the DHS bill released on Tuesday as taking ""several steps in the right direction,"" in the words of DeLauro, who also acknowledged that ""it does not include broader reforms Democrats proposed.""

""I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues may be dissatisfied with any bill that funds ICE. I share their frustration with the out-of-control agency,"" DeLauro said, while also stressing that the bill ""is more than just ICE."" She specifically pointed to funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, and the US Coast Guard.

As a bill summary from Murray's office states, the legislation funds those and ""other critical programs Americans count on"" while cutting ""funding for CBP by $1.3 billion relative to fiscal year 2025, providing $18.3 billion in total.""

It also ""flat-funds ICE at $10 billion, preventing any growth to ICE's annual budget, and it cuts ICE's enforcement and removal budget,"" the document details. ""The bill provides $949 million (-15%) less in funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations than House Republicans' and $708 million (-11%) less than Senate Republicans’ proposed bills—and $114 million less than the fiscal year 2025 level.""

Taking aim at the DHS secretary, Murray said in a statement that ""what we have seen from Kristi Noem's Department of Homeland Security is frankly sick and un-American. ICE is out-of-control, terrorizing people, including American citizens, and actively making our communities less safe.""

Sometimes, when members of Congress can't strike a deal before a funding deadline, they'll pass a continuing resolution that provides short-term funding to prevent a federal government shutdown and keep up negotiations. However, Murray suggested in a Tuesday statement that a CR is not a viable option because of the $75 billion for ICE included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed last July.

""ICE must be reined in, and unfortunately, neither a CR nor a shutdown would do anything to restrain it, because, thanks to Republicans, ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap whether or not we pass a funding bill,"" Murray said. ""The suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality: Under a CR and in a shutdown, this administration can do everything they are already doing—but without any of the critical guardrails and constraints imposed by a full-year funding bill.""

Murray also nodded to Republican control of Congress that the November midterms, arguing that ""the hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need... ""If you believe that we should be putting more of our taxpayer dollars towards healthcare and that our immigration enforcement should be focused on actual criminals instead of tear-gassing American children, then we need to speak up again and again—and we must take our fight to the ballot box.""

Other Democrats in Congress swiftly rejected the proposal. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said that it ""puts no meaningful constraints on the growing lawlessness of ICE, and increases funding for detention over the last appropriations bill passed in 2024.""

""I understand Democrats in these negotiations had a hard job—no new budget for DHS is going to cure all the rampant illegality happening within the department. But this bill doesn't put CBP agents back at the border where they belong and doesn't put checks on ICE’s out-of-control arrest and enforcement operations,"" he explained. ""Democrats have no obligation to support a bill that not only funds the dystopian scenes we are seeing in Minneapolis but will allow DHS to replicate that playbook of brutality in cities all over this country.""

The leadership of the nearly 100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus last week vowed to ""oppose all funding"" for US immigration enforcement in any upcoming appropriations bills without substantial reforms. CPC Chair Emerita Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) made her personal opposition to Tuesday's proposal clear, declaring that ""it simply does not meet the moment we face in this country with the lawlessness"" of ICE and CBP agents.

""We have seen ICE and DHS descending on cities across this country, racially profiling, and rounding up immigrants and US citizens alike—many of whom have committed no crimes,"" said Jayapal, an immigrant herself. ""We have watched in horror as they have dragged people out into the snow and as they have shot and killed US citizens. As they foment this terror and chaos on our streets, 37 people have died in ICE custody since Trump came back to office.""

""Meanwhile, across the country, over 70,000 people are being incarcerated in immigration jails run by private, for-profit prison contractors and being denied due process and bond hearings in Trump's mass detention effort that dozens of judges have said is not lawful,"" she stressed. ""All of this is dangerous—not just for immigrants but for every single American worried about the erosion of Constitutional rights.""

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), one of several Democrats expected to run for president in 2028, also spoke out against the bill, telling NBC News that ""it is a surrender to Trump's lawlessness. I will be a strong no and help lead the opposition to it.""

The progressive group Indivisible has urged voters across the country ""to light a fire under Democrats to demand they use their leverage on the DHS appropriations bill to rein in ICE and deny the Trump regime one penny more for its mass deportation machine.""

""While most Republicans continue to rubber-stamp Trump's atrocities, some are becoming bolder in criticizing ICE's lawlessness and pattern of shredding constitutional protections,"" notes the group's webpage on reining in ICE. ""The louder we are and the more we organize our communities to take action, the harder it will be for Republicans to continue backing Trump's terror campaign.""

""Democrats need to stop whining about the limits of minority power and start fighting as hard as their constituents are to stop this regime’s mounting atrocities,"" the Indivisible page adds. ""We're not accepting excuses, and we will hold every member of Congress accountable who chooses complicity and cowardice over courage.""

Some critics of recent immigration actions have suggested that any Democrat who still supports funding ICE should be primaried. Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch made that case Tuesday, writing that ""the lack of appetite for utterly dismantling the DHS regime—despite its culture of violence and disrespect for law-abiding refugees—reminds too many voters of the cowardice that branded the Dems as losers in the first place.""

""Dismantling the ICE regime needs to be the floor, not the ceiling"" he added, ""and any Democrat in Congress who doesn't get with the program can—and should—be replaced in the primaries to avoided another debacle with alienated or apathetic voters in November.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62907540&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2026-01-21 18:58:42.987639

No one was struck by gunfire in the shooting, reported at about 7:30 a.m. in the 2400 block of 126th Street, but federal authorities said a Customs and Border Patrol officer was injured. Details about the injury were not immediately available.

The Los Aneles County sheriff's Department said federal agents were conducting an operation in the area when there was a brief pursuit that ended in a crash. Video from NewsChopper4 showed a BMW with front-end damage and what appeared to be deployed air bags.

Shots were fired by a federal agent as officers were attempting to detain the target of the operation, authorities said.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said DHS officers were conducting the targeted operation early Wednesday in nearby Compton to ""arrest a violent criminal illegal alien from El Salvador."" The agency said William Eduardo Moran Carballo was part of a human smuggling operation and has two prior arrests for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant.

An immigration judge issued a final order of removal from the United States in 2019, the DHS said. NBC4 Investigates is attempting to obtain more information about Carballo's criminal record.

""In a dangerous attempt to evade arrest, this criminal illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and rammed law enforcement,"" the DHS spokesperson said. ""Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots. The criminal illegal alien was not hit and attempted to flee on foot. He was successfully apprehended by law enforcement. The illegal alien was not injured, but a CBP officer was injured.

""These dangerous attempts to evade arrest have surged since sanctuary politicians, including Governor Newsom, have encouraged illegal aliens to evade arrest and provided guides advising illegal aliens how to recognize ICE, block entry, and defy arrest. Our officers are now facing a 3,200% increase in vehicle attacks. This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming.""

The move by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a win to the Trump administration, which had vowed to appeal the lower court's order that restrained federal agents.

In her order last week, U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez said agents appeared to have engaged in ""chilling conduct"" and ""intimidation tactics."" She noted actions such as the ""drawing and pointing of weapons,"" the ""use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions"" and ""actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers.""

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking on CBS News' ""Face the Nation,"" called Menendez's order ""a little ridiculous"" and said it didn't ""change anything for how we're operating on the ground.""

The appeals court decision comes as legal battles escalate between the Trump administration and local and state officials in Minnesota following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent Jonathan Ross.

The Department of Justice on Jan. 20 delivered subpoenas to the offices of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, among other Democratic officials, related to allegations that they impeded the work of federal agents. Walz and Frey called the move ""a partisan distraction"" and effort to ""intimidate local leaders.""

Meanwhile, Menendez is weighing whether to halt immigration operations after the state, Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit accusing the federal government of violating state rights.

JD Vance to visit Minneapolis amid protests, ICE raids

Vice President JD Vance will visit Minneapolis on Thursday, Jan. 22, a person familiar with his plans said Jan. 20.

Vance will hold a roundtable with community members and deliver remarks in the city where the Trump administration is fighting to continue its immigration operations.

Vance as been among the most ardent supporters of the agent who shot and killed Renee Good. He called the shooting ""a tragedy of her own making"" and alleged she was part of vast left-wing extremist network.

Statewide 'ICE out of Minneapolis' protest planned for Friday

Organizers in Minneapolis asked people to not go to work, skip school and refrain from buying anything as part of a protest against the ongoing immigration operations in the state.

""Faith leaders, business owners, workers, and concerned Minnesotans have called for a statewide day of public mourning and pause through 'No Work, No School and No Shopping' and a massive, peaceful march in downtown Minneapolis that afternoon,"" said a news release about the demonstration scheduled for Friday, Jan. 23.

In recent weeks, schools across the state have held walk-outs as protesters on the street have clashed with federal agents and recorded immigration enforcement operations.

Off-duty cops targeted by immigration agents in Minnesota: officials

Immigration agents have stopped off-duty officers in Minnesota ""solely because of the color of their skin,"" a group of local police chiefs alleged on Jan. 21.

Brooklyn Park Police Department Chief Mark Bruley described an incident in which ICE agents blocked in an off-duty officer and demanded proof of citizenship. Bruley said agents knocked the officer's phone out of her hand when she tried to record the interaction and that the federal agents ""had their guns drawn.""

""I wish I could tell you this was an isolated incident,"" Bruley said, flanked by other heads of local law enforcement agencies. ""If it is happening to our officers, it pains me to think of how many of our community members are falling victim to this every day. It has to stop.""

In a statement to USA TODAY, the Department of Homeland Security said, ""DHS is able to find no record of ICE or Border Patrol stopping and questioning a police officer. Without a name, we cannot verify these claims. We will continue to look into these claims.""

Feds investigate protest at St. Paul church

The Department of Justice opened a probe into a protest that interrupted a Sunday service at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.

A group of protestors entered Cities Church on Jan. 18, alleging that Pastor David Easterwood serves as the ICE St. Paul Field Office acting director. Videos show dozens of protesters changing ""Renee Good,"" and ""don't shoot,"" as some verbally confronting churchgoers.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the DOJ is investigating the protest as a potential violation of the FACE Act, a federal law that prohibits the use of force, threats or physical obstruction to block people from reproductive health care or access to religious worship under the First Amendment's right of religious freedom.

St. Paul Police Department Public Information Officer Nikki Muehlhausen told USA TODAY the department is actively investigating the protest as disorderly conduct. In a statement, Walz's office said the governor ""in no way supports interrupting a place of worship.""

What do we know so far about DOJ subpoenas

The subpoenas delivered by the FBI on Jan. 20 seek records and testimony related to an investigation into Democratic officials accused of impeding federal law enforcement, officials said.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the subpoenas – sent to Walz, Frey and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison – will help build a case against the officials.

""When you have subpoenas out, it is not rocket science. Investigations are done by acquiring records, investigations are then furthered by putting witnesses in the grand jury and making a presentment for a case with our partners at the Department of Justice,"" Kash said in an interview on Fox News' ""Hannity.""

Those subpoenaed all criticized the investigation, calling it political theater. Ellison noted on X that the subpoenas came within days of him suing the Trump administration for the federal intervention in Minnesota.

""Trump is weaponizing the justice system against any leader who dares to stand up to him,"" Ellison said.

State and local officials are opposed to Trump's mass deportations.","Vice President Vance is heading to Minnesota on Thursday, and he's not planning any peace offerings to Twin Cities officials and protesters opposed to the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.

Why it matters: Vance's planned events and speech underscore how the administration isn't backing down from its controversial raids and stops that resulted in the fatal shooting of protester Renee Good and damaged President Trump's poll numbers.

""JD took Minnesota on as an issue where he's going to lead. He wants a strong response,"" an adviser said. ""He doesn't want to back down. Neither does the president.""

Zoom in: Vance plans to hold a roundtable with community leaders, give an exclusive interview to the conservative outlet Newsmax and then conduct a news conference where he'll be flanked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Vance ""will point out how Minneapolis' sanctuary city policies have degraded public safety and endangered ICE officers. He will also celebrate the essential work ICE agents have done to take dangerous, criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,"" a White House official said.

Vance also is expected to emphasize the creation of a new Justice Department assistant attorney general position to oversee prosecuting large-scale fraud and abuse of taxpayer-funded programs.

Zoom out: The ostensible theme of Vance's visit is to emphasize the administration's ""unwavering support"" for ICE, but Trump advisers inside and outside the White House hope to continue shifting focus away from the unpopular enforcement actions and more toward prosecuting fraud.

For six years, the Minneapolis and St. Paul have been gripped by sprawling fraud cases, many surrounding the Somalian community.

Federal prosecutors and nonpartisan watchdogs warned for years that ""inadequate"" state oversight left several programs vulnerable to ""industrial scale"" waste and abuse.

After recent reports about fraud in his state, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz decided not to seek reelection.

Meanwhile, a grand jury investigating whether state officials have unlawfully interfered with ICE sent subpoenas Tuesday to the offices of Walz, Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her and officials in Ramsey and Hennepin counties.

DOJ is also investigating the anti-ICE protestors who stormed a church while it was in service over the weekend.

DOJ blocked local police from investigating the ICE agent who shot Good but is investigating her widow, which prompted the protest resignations of six federal prosecutors who'd been handling the fraud cases.

Minnesota is ground zero for aggressive ICE law enforcement, replete with masked agents stopping people, asking for proof of citizenship and raiding homes.

""The mayor has been pursuing all channels with the goal of reducing tensions and violence in his community,"" a spokesman for Frey said.

Behind the scenes: Despite the escalations publicly, Trump's team has been in private communication with officials in Walz's government and major state-based businesses.

On Jan. 8, the day after Good was killed, Vance held a White House press briefing, defended the shooting as justified, tried to shame the news media for its coverage, announced a task force to investigate Somalian immigrant fraud and called on Walz to resign.

Vance and Walz have had a hostile relationship since 2024: They faced off at the vice presidential debate in 2024, when Walz was then-Vice President Harris' running mate.

Friction point: So far, the two sides can't find common ground because of their differences on immigration enforcement.

Trump administration officials want local police to help accompany them on immigration raids, which the federal government says are targeted.

State and local officials are opposed to Trump's mass deportations. They've decried ICE's tactics since the surge, pointing to reports of racial profiling and lawful residents being detained by federal agents.

“Wake up. Pay attention to what’s happening before it’s too late,” one man at the protest said.

ICE officials told NBC News in November that the warehouses would ""increase efficiency” in deportations and described them as “mega detention centers.”

Among protesters holding up signs and drivers honking in support, Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. April McClain Delaney joined.

When asked if officials knew any details about the plans for the warehouse, Van Hollen said they don't know anything yet.

""We’re asking ICE for answers,"" Van Hollen said. ""In fact, just today, Senator Alsobrooks and Congresswoman Delaney and I sent the Secretary of Homeland Security a letter asking her about what their plans are [and] what are they planning here?""

When one man at the protest heard about the proposed warehouses for the first time, he said he ""threw up"" and the news made him feel nauseous.

One woman at the protest said she can't ""even stand the thought of having it in our county.""

By continuing to weaponize crime and immigration, Trump is betting that fanning the flames of a culture war will protect him in the long run.","On January 7 in Minneapolis, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross fired his gun four times into Renee Nicole Good’s car, killing the 37-year-old mother and United States citizen after she stopped to support her immigrant neighbors—who, since early December, have been in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump’s extreme deportation agenda. As with the murder of George Floyd, also in Minneapolis, video evidence has fueled nationwide outrage over Good’s killing, with more than eight in 10 U.S. voters reportedly having seen the footage.

The administration has thrown its full weight behind ICE, with Trump calling Good “very violent” and “very radical” and Vice President J.D. Vance calling her “brainwashed and a victim of left-wing ideology.” However, a majority of people in the United States disagree—and increasingly disapprove of Trump’s approach to immigration. In a poll released a week after Good’s killing, 53 percent think the shooting was not justified, and only 35 percent said it was.

In just its first year, the second Trump administration has provoked numerous explosive crises. It remains to be seen whether this tragedy will be more tinder for the pile—or the spark that ignites it all.

The latest tragedy in ICE’s long history of violence is speeding up crises already in motion.

Over the past year, ICE’s enforcement operations have been given the political green light to operate with no accountability. Since Trump returned to office, immigration agents have opened fire at least 17 times, killing four people and injuring another eight—though clear data is hard to come by. Video evidence from another shooting in Minneapolis, of Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, also disputes ICE’s narrative of violent resistance.

For those in ICE custody, 2025 was the deadliest year in more than two decades, with 32 reported deaths—followed by at least four so far in just the first few weeks of 2026—and widespread allegations of torture. The recent death of Geraldo Lunas Campos at a Texas detention facility may be ruled a homicide, as a fellow detainee witnessed guards choking him. By repeatedly lying about these incidents, the administration’s already-minimal credibility continues to plummet—even among its own agents.

In response to ICE’s invasion, mass protests have erupted in Minneapolis and across the country, with a predictably violent reaction from federal agents. There were more than 1,000 events recently as part of the ICE Out For Good Weekend of Action. In response, federal agents—with Trump’s rubber stamp—have battered protesters and community monitoring groups, shooting less-lethal rounds at point-blank range, dragging a woman out of her car, and deploying tear gas from convoys (hospitalizing at least one infant). Last Friday, a district court judge ruled that federal agents in Operation Metro Surge may not use pepper spray or nonlethal projectiles against peaceful protesters, or stop vehicles without cause—a decision the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has appealed. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has placed the state’s National Guard on standby “to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies,” according to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.

For his part, Trump once again threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act. He quickly walked it back but added, “If I needed it, I’d use it.” To bolster the threat, the Pentagon has made 1,500 U.S. Army troops ready for possible deployment to Minnesota. The 1807 law grants presidents broad authority to deploy federal troops for law enforcement purposes. Trump made the same threat during the 2020 protests after George Floyd’s murder and last year in response to protests against aggressive immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago. The Supreme Court’s recent decision limiting Trump’s ability to send the National Guard to Chicago may have also pushed Trump toward the Insurrection Act as a workaround to the Posse Comitatus Act, another law from the 1800s that generally prohibits the military from performing civilian law enforcement. Experts have been skeptical about the constitutionality of such deployments, but legal challenges take time; once boots are on the ground, the damage may already be done.

Channeling outrage and growing demands for accountability, states and localities (and people in the streets) are taking action to rein in ICE.

ICE was created after September 11, 2001, with few mechanisms for accountability, which have only been further weakened in the past year. By the end of 2025, the average number of people in immigration detention daily was 78 percent higher than the year prior. The Trump administration has systematically dismantled the federal watchdog responsible for civil rights violations at DHS and imposed new restrictions on congressional inspections of immigration detention facilities. Meanwhile, Stephen Miller, the key architect of Trump’s cruel immigration agenda, assured ICE agents back in October—including questionable recruits with insufficient training—that they have “federal immunity.”

As the January 30 federal budget deadline looms and Congress prepares to fund DHS beyond its $170 billion windfall from last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, some congressional Democrats are pushing for more accountability for ICE. Funding for DHS was absent from the House’s most recent spending package, with Democrats pushing for guardrails. Democrats from across the political spectrum are threatening to withhold votes unless the funding package includes basic accountability measures, such as mandatory identification, limiting Customs and Border Protection’s enforcement actions to the border, and mandating judicial warrants to arrest suspects in immigration cases. Congressional Democrats have also introduced a litany of bills to support ICE accountability, like the Federal Law Enforcement Standards and Accountability (FLESA) Act, the Qualified Immunity Abolition Act of 2026, the PUBLIC SAFETY Act, the Stop Body Camera Paywalls Act, and the Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act—as well as articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. While these bills face long odds, they reflect mounting pressure on lawmakers to respond to public outrage over ICE violence.

A small number of Republicans have also signaled openness to minor restrictions, but ones largely focused on optics rather than structural reform. Party leadership remains committed to expanding ICE’s operational freedom, not constraining it. Failing to attach conditions to DHS funding would signal that many lawmakers are willing to legitimize ICE’s escalating use of force despite yet another episode of avoidable ICE violence.

With meaningful oversight—let alone accountability—from Congress unlikely, states and localities are moving to rein in ICE abuses. Along with the Minneapolis protesters’ lawsuit, Minnesota (along with the Twin Cities) and Illinois both filed federal lawsuits seeking injunctions to stop enforcement operations. Meanwhile, Los Angeles County moved to become the latest to institute “ICE-free zones,” which prohibit ICE from operating on county-owned property. New Jersey lawmakers also passed a package of bills to expand protections for immigrants, but outgoing Governor Phil Murphy vetoed it on his last day in office.

With the Trump administration unwilling to do so itself, the question remains whether states can hold immigration agents criminally or civilly accountable. Criminal prosecution faces steep barriers: state and local officials need access to evidence, yet the Department of Justice (DOJ) is both refusing to investigate Good’s killing and also actively blocking access to evidence—forcing Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty to plead for information from the public. Even if Ross is prosecuted, significant legal and evidentiary hurdles will likely constrain charging decisions and the likelihood of conviction.

Civil liability is also available but limited. Good’s family will likely pursue money damages from the federal government through the Federal Tort Claims Act or from Ross as an individual through a so-called “Bivens suit.” But both paths are narrow; federal tort claims are time-consuming and replete with procedural requirements, and the Supreme Court has made it harder in recent years to file Bivens suits against federal agents who violate the Constitution.

In December, Illinois passed a law allowing residents to sue immigration agents in state court for state or federal civil rights violations. Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration quickly sued Illinois—and it remains unclear whether such laws violate the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause. Regardless, states like New York and California are also moving ahead with such laws, with New York Governor Kathy Hochul prominently endorsing the legislation in her most recent State of the State address. And in the meantime, states like California, Illinois, and New York are continuing efforts to document ICE misconduct, whether for transparency alone, future litigation, or eventual prosecution.

Instead of responding to public concern, the Trump administration is closing ranks and escalating.

In a press conference hours after Jonathan Ross killed Renee Good, Secretary Noem suggested that Good was at fault for her own death, claiming she was engaged in “domestic terrorism.” While Trump has finally softened his tone, calling her death a tragedy, he initially said that Good was at fault for trying to “run over” the officer. A week later, the White House issued a press release claiming that mass deportations are responsible for lower housing costs, higher wages, and less crime. The administration’s staunch refusal to acknowledge any wrongdoing by Ross or that ICE’s tactics have grown too extreme is fueling outrage from all corners—even from Tucker Carlson, who faulted Republicans for not acknowledging the tragedy of Good’s death. Trump could have easily lowered tensions by calling the killing an isolated incident and allowing a formal independent investigation to proceed. Instead, the administration is doubling down despite bleeding public support.

The administration is defending its immigration officers in two distinct ways. First, it insists that Ross was acting in self-defense. To prop up that narrative, officials have pushed out a series of stories claiming that Ross was injured during the incident, that he was dragged by a car in June, and that he is a war veteran with extensive military training. At the same time, the administration is also attempting to smear Good as a “domestic terrorist.” The DOJ abandoned its investigation of Ross to instead investigate Good’s wife over her work with a local ICE Watch group, leading six veteran DOJ prosecutors to quit in protest. Second, the administration is asserting that ICE officers have “absolute immunity”—with DHS itself tweeting at immigration officers and urging “decisive action should you be faced with an imminent threat.”

The president is also knowingly escalating the situation. Rather than attempt to calm tensions, Trump sent another 1,000 immigration officers to Minnesota, bringing the total to roughly 3,000. The administration is also ramping up a broader fight with the state, attempting to freeze funding for food stamps and sanctuary cities broadly. The DOJ is also reportedly investigating Minnesota officials, including Attorney General Keith Ellison, Governor Walz, and Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey. Over all of this looms Trump’s threat to invoke the Insurrection Act and the 1,500 Army troops on standby.

By continuing to weaponize crime and immigration, Trump is betting that fanning the flames of a culture war will protect him in the long run. In the wake of Good’s killing, his approval rating on immigration hit a new low of 38 percent. The administration knows that the polling around ICE and immigration looks bad, but it may be taking solace in the fact that 77 percent of Republicans say Good’s shooting was justified. While igniting fear about crime and disorder is an age-old playbook that Trump has exploited for decades, early signs suggest that it may not work this time. Trump and Republicans will need independent voters in the midterms, but 59 percent believe the shooting was unjustified.

Whether Congress, the courts, or the states are willing to act on that public sentiment remains uncertain. But ICE’s tactics are eroding what little is left of the agency’s political and moral legitimacy.

Sean Duffy announced the agency would withhold federal transportation funding from state and local governments that did not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
By attempting to condition transportation spending on cooperation with immigration enforcement, the USDOT was effectively attempting to rewrite federal laws passed by Congress, the states argued.
“It’s too bad that it took legal action to get the administration to simply comply with the law.” Milwaukee County uses federal transportation funds to maintain roadways and bridges.

In April, USDOT Sec. Sean Duffy announced the agency would withhold federal transportation funding from state and local governments that did not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

In May, Wisconsin and 21 other states sued the federal agency, arguing transportation and immigration enforcement are unrelated and the Trump administration was attempting to “unlawfully usurp” congressional authority over spending. By attempting to condition transportation spending on cooperation with immigration enforcement, the USDOT was effectively attempting to rewrite federal laws passed by Congress, the states argued.

Congress provides more than $100 billion annually for state and local governments to maintain transportation infrastructure. Of that, approximately $1 billion goes to Wisconsin each year.

In November, U.S. District Judge John McConnell ruled that the USDOT was violating the Constitution, writing, “Defendants have blatantly overstepped their statutory authority, violated the APA, and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions. The Constitution demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior.”

Initially, the USDOT appealed the ruling, but last week the agency dropped its appeal, allowing McConnell’s order to stand. It is now barred by the court order from withholding funding from state or local governments for failing to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

“I’m glad that the Trump administration is seeking to put an end to its defense of this lawlessness,” Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement. “It’s too bad that it took legal action to get the administration to simply comply with the law.”

Milwaukee County uses federal transportation funds to maintain roadways and bridges. The Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) similarly uses federal transportation grants to fund new bus purchases and maintain transit infrastructure. The county was recently awarded a $25 million grant by USDOT for road safety projects.

“It’s good news that the Trump administration will not be able to restrict local control through unnecessary conditions on USDOT grants. Milwaukee County has always followed all requirements on how state and federal grant funding is allocated and used throughout the community,” Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said in a statement to Urban Milwaukee. “My administration plans to continue this track record as we keep working to invest in public transit, safer streets, and transportation infrastructure and services to enhance the quality of life for working families across Milwaukee County.”

DEI programs also targeted

When Duffy and the USDOT tried to tie immigration to transportation funding, the agency also included language threatening to pull funding from governments with diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs that violate federal anti-discrimination laws. In the April letter transportation agencies, Duffy said their personnel policies cannot “discriminate based on prohibited categories.”",https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0613-1024x768.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 17:58:40.015873

Honduras has emerged as a key transit country for migrants, with thousands of people entering irregularly from Nicaragua on their journey northward.

A United Methodist clinic in Danlí embodies a faith-based response, offering medical care, dignity and accompaniment to migrants in extreme vulnerability.

The clinic is housed in a government-run migrant assistance center.

A Haitian mother of three said the health clinic and migration center have given her family “peace and hope” on their journey to find a better life.

For Marie Joseph and her family, a migrant assistance center and United Methodist clinic in Danlí provided a respite on a long and arduous journey.

“We arrived very tired,” said Joseph, 32, who asked that her real name not be used in this story. “We were scared and didn’t know what to expect. But here we were welcomed warmly. We were given food and a safe place to stay with my three children for two days.

“They also cared for us at the UMCOR clinic, where we were examined and helped with what we needed,” she said, referring to the health clinic, which is supported by the United Methodist Committee on Relief and the United Methodist Board of Global Ministries’ Global Health program. “It was a great relief because we were so exhausted from the journey.”

Joseph is making her way to the United States with her three children, fleeing the violence in her home country of Haiti, where gangs control large areas. She wants to reunite with family members in the U.S.

“I feel very grateful to everyone here at the clinic and the center,” she said. “When you flee violence and poverty, you don’t know whom to turn to for help. Here we were treated with respect and care, and that gives us hope to continue our journey. My children were able to rest and recover.”

Housed at the government-run Irregular Migrant Assistance Center or CAMI (Centro de Atención al Migrante Irregulares) in Danlí, the church-supported clinic provides free health care to migrants exhausted after crossing Nicaragua or eastern Honduras. The clinic was established by the United Methodist Mission in Honduras, led by Global Ministries and Bishop Rubén Saenz, the mission’s episcopal leader.

CAMI has become a connection point for those continuing on to Guatemala and Mexico. The health clinic offers rapid medical assessments, general care, basic medications and referrals to hospitals when needed, helping migrants continue their journey.

The center’s staff provide guidance to migrants on routes to follow and appropriate behaviors to avoid legal problems upon arriving in Honduras. Migrants are also granted a five-day temporary permit to complete their paperwork before continuing on to Guatemala.

Care guided by Social Principles

Wilmer Vasquez, coordinator of the United Methodist clinic, explained the procedures they have implemented, which allow each patient to receive an individual examination that includes diagnosis, treatment and a physical assessment.

“In situations requiring more specialized care, the patient is removed from the line and treated more thoroughly in the consultation room,” Vasquez said. “This ensures that the mass-care process, which requires a certain speed, is not disrupted by the detailed attention needed for more complex cases.”

Dr. Aurora Martínez, a member of the professional team at the clinic, described the most common ailments they encounter. “We frequently see cases of gastroenteritis, dehydration and various viral infections, which are typical given the hygiene and environmental conditions migrants face along their journey to reach this point.

“Additionally, when local hospitals are overwhelmed, we are called upon to screen patients here, helping prevent overloading the ambulatory population,” she added. This reflects the level of trust the United Methodist clinic has earned with regional health authorities and has brought recognition and gratitude from those who oversee CAMI.

One of the most effective procedures implemented by the United Methodist clinic has been the distribution of medical kits to the groups that regularly arrive at the center. Dr. Silvia Reyes coordinates this process and explained to UM News how the service works.

“The kits we distribute to migrant families consist of a medical package that includes pain relievers, fever medication, antihistamines and anti-inflammatories,” Reyes said. “They also include medicines for vomiting, nausea and stomach discomfort, which are the most common issues migrant families face on their journey.”

Vasquez emphasized that the work is guided by The United Methodist Church’s Social Principles relating to human dignity, care for migrants and health. “Our service philosophy is reflected in maintaining a steady, safe flow of patients without compromising the quality of care,” he said.

For Vasquez, these Social Principles form the theological and ethical foundation of the work carried out by the United Methodist clinic in Danlí. By affirming that every person, regardless of migration status, possesses sacred value and the right to dignified medical care, these principles support a ministry that integrates faith and justice.

New migration corridors

Although some recent data shows a decline in the immigrant population in the United States, migration has not stopped. The Pew Research Center reported that after reaching a record 53.3 million immigrants in January 2025, the number fell to 51.9 million in June — the first decline since the 1960s. Despite this decrease, migration flows to the United States remain steady and diverse. In recent years, regional transit dynamics have shifted, and new routes have emerged as significant migration corridors across the continent.

Official figures from Honduras’ National Institute of Migration indicate that 369,258 irregular — or unauthorized — migrants entered the country in 2024, with 97.2% crossing through unofficial points along the border with Nicaragua. These figures confirm that the vast majority of migrants used Nicaraguan territory as a transit route in their attempt to journey north.

“The center serves four to six buses daily full of migrants, the majority of whom are Haitians and Cubans, with occasional arrivals from Pakistan, China, Ecuador and Uzbekistan,” said Gustavo Ferrufino, officer at the Migrant Rights Office of the National Institute of Immigration in Honduras.

Ferrufino notes that in early 2025, migrant arrivals had decreased significantly due to changes in U.S. immigration policy under the new administration and the closure of the U.S.-Mexico border. However, transit has been increasing since the second half of last year.

“It may be related to changes in U.S. policy that have temporarily opened pathways or provided legalization for migrants,” he said. “We’ve heard from people passing through that they receive information from missions and diplomatic agencies in their home countries about new admission procedures, while others simply follow new entry routes at the border. They just try and stay in Mexico while waiting for their opportunity to cross.”

Leaving violence for a new life

At the migrant assistance center in Honduras, Marie Joseph shared her journey toward the United States. She lived five years in the Dominican Republic and is now fleeing both the violence in Haiti and the economic and social hardships she faced in the Dominican Republic.

“I am from Haiti. Life there was very difficult; there was violence, and we couldn’t live in peace,” she said. “That’s why we went to the Dominican Republic. I lived there for five years and learned Spanish so I could communicate, but the situation was also hard: unstable work, housing problems, and I felt I couldn’t give my children a secure future. So we decided to try to reach the United States to be with some of our family already living there.”

She described her journey as a long and dangerous one.

“We didn’t come directly from Haiti,” she said. “Many migrants like us first live in or pass through other Latin American countries. In our case, we went from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then began our journey north. Some migrants travel from countries like Brazil, Chile or Mexico; others take charter flights to countries such as Nicaragua, which has more flexible requirements, and from there cross Central America toward Mexico and the United States.”

Joseph and her family arrived in Honduras from Nicaragua. For them, Honduras is not a final destination but a transit country, where they seek support and rest before continuing their journey.

According to staff members at CAMI and the clinic, many migrants become stranded in Honduras without resources or documentation and rely on the humanitarian support provided.

“I want to sincerely thank everyone who helps us,” Joseph told some of the center’s staff. “Violence and poverty shouldn’t prevent children from having a future. Thanks to you, we have been able to continue our journey with a little more peace and hope.

“It’s a difficult path, but knowing there are places that support migrants gives us strength. I want my children to have a safer life and opportunities to study and grow without fear.

Those concerns have been sharpened by the January 7 killing of Renee Nicole Good, a queer 37-year-old Minneapolis mother and U.S. citizen who was fatally shot during a federal immigration enforcement operation.

Transgender people targeted early in Trump’s second term

Human rights leaders said the administration’s authoritarian trajectory has extended well beyond immigration enforcement to include the early and deliberate targeting of transgender people, an approach they described as both symbolic and strategic.

Jessica Stern, co-founder and co-president of the Alliance for Diplomacy and Justice, said attacks on transgender people have not been incidental but central to the administration’s political strategy from the outset. Stern previously served as the Special Envoy to Advance the Human Rights of LGBTQI+ Persons under President Joe Biden.

“The weaponization of trans people’s lives has been baked into the very fabric of his political identity,” Stern said, pointing to Trump’s campaign spending aimed at stoking fear around transgender rights and his decision to sign an executive order targeting what his administration calls “gender ideology” on his first day back in office.

Trump issued an executive order on his first day back in office establishing that the U.S. government does not recognize transgender or nonbinary identities, and instead recognizes people only by their sex assigned at birth.

Stern said that timing mattered. In authoritarian systems, governments often begin by singling out a small, stigmatized population to test public tolerance for rights rollbacks and to normalize the idea that certain people can be excluded from legal and social protections.

By focusing so heavily on transgender people, particularly trans youth, service members, and those seeking medical care, the administration sent what Stern described as a broader signal: that communities already vulnerable to discrimination could be treated as political adversaries rather than rights-bearing individuals, even as institutions designed to protect civil rights are weakened or dismantled.

Amnesty: U.S. mirrors global patterns of democratic backsliding

Amanda Klasing, an Amnesty International USA official who moderated the briefing, said the scope and speed of the administration’s actions set Trump’s second term apart.

“We can say categorically that President Trump’s second term has been a human rights disaster at home and abroad,” Klasing said, citing executive actions that have shrunk civic space and undermined legal safeguards.

The organization warned that the United States now fits a familiar global pattern: governments consolidate power, discredit critics, punish protests, and weaken courts and oversight bodies until accountability becomes difficult to restore.

Immigration enforcement and civil liberties under strain

Immigration enforcement has emerged as a central proving ground for the tactics Amnesty warns are reshaping U.S. civil liberties.

At the press conference, Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, described the expansion of third-country deportations and aggressive enforcement actions as among the administration’s most severe abuses.

“In 2025, the United States is conducting enforced disappearances,” Widdersheim said, citing the transfer of migrants to detention facilities abroad despite documented risks of torture.

Andry Hernandez Romero, a gay Venezuelan asylum seeker who worked as a makeup artist and hair stylist, was sent along with more than 200 other men to CECOT, a torture prison in El Salvador, because the Trump administration declared him to be a member of a gang. Romero has no criminal record and denies being part of any gang. He was eventually freed from confinement and described physical and sexual abuse in an interview with The Advocate last fall.

Uzra Zeya, president and CEO of Human Rights First, said the immigration crackdown has driven record detention levels and deaths in custody while spilling into broader assaults on constitutional protections.

“The authoritarian playbook that I spent decades fighting overseas has come home to our shores,” Zeya said.

Good’s killing has intensified scrutiny of those tactics. She was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross during a federal enforcement operation in Minneapolis. Federal officials described the shooting as self-defense, while witnesses, family members, and civil rights advocates have disputed that account and called for greater transparency and accountability. Video of the shooting, from several angles, calls into question the government’s assertions that Good targeted the agent. Protests following her death have linked the incident to concerns about the militarization of immigration enforcement and its spillover into routine civilian life.

“We have seen where this road leads when dissent is punished, oversight is dismantled, and people can be disappeared or expelled beyond the reach of the law,” Amnesty wrote in its report. “But we also know something else: the slide is not inevitable. There is still time to stop it.”

But Smiley said the fear of federal retribution is outweighed by the need to let Providence residents know the city has their backs.","City property — including parking lots, public schools, parks and municipal buildings — is off limits to federal immigration officers conducting enforcement operations, under an executive order signed by Providence Mayor Brett Smiley Tuesday.

Smiley told reporters gathered at City Hall that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in other blue cities made the order necessary to protect the community. He said he was unaware of any ICE actions on city property since the second Trump administration took over one year ago. However, immigration officers entered the state-owned Garrahy Judicial Complex on Dorrance Street on Jan. 15, bypassing security and prompting outrage from state leaders.

“We’re taking clear action to affirm Providence’s values,” Smiley said before signing his first executive order of the year with a black pen. “We do not want — and will not allow — Providence’s public property to be used to execute what we see as unlawful immigration enforcement.”

Smiley held up a copy of a red sign city employees will post noting the use of city property as a federal immigration enforcement staging site is now prohibited. In the event ICE officers are seen on any city-owned property without a judicial warrant, Smiley said Providence police will be required to vacate the federal agents from it.

“If Immigration and Customs Enforcement presents a valid judicial warrant, we will honor it,” the mayor said. “We honor it today, but the reality is that’s not what’s happening in most instances.”

Private property owners are welcome to go to the city’s website and download and print out the signs to identify “non-public areas of their property” where ICE activity is prohibited, according to Smiley’s executive order. Property owners can use signs “at their own discretion and assume any legal risk associated therewith.”

Smiley said he has been encouraging the state’s judicial branch to enact a similar policy and also expand the use of virtual court hearings in Providence to discourage additional ICE visits.

The Jan. 15 incident at the Garrahy Courthouse was the second time in three months that ICE officers entered a state courthouse. ICE officers briefly detained a teenage judicial intern outside of the Licht Judicial Complex in Providence on Nov. 20, sparking condemnation from state and local officials, including Gov. Dan McKee and Chief Justice Paul Suttell.

ICE did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Jan. 15 incident.

The Providence Journal reported “several” masked immigration officers ran through the first floor of the Garrahy Courthouse in pursuit of two young men though apparently did not take anyone into custody.

“Allowing these barely-trained and reckless federal agents to blunder through our state, disrupting the justice system and harassing children and judges, diminishes the safety of our citizens and undermines the efforts of real law enforcement officers,” Lt. Gov Sabina Matos said in a Jan. 16 statement. “I am glad that this incident appears to have ended without harm to anyone, but we have all seen how this behavior leads to tragedy. ICE needs to be reined in and subject to the same laws that govern us all.”

The Judiciary enacted rules for virtual court hearings in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and recently posted its revised policy for requesting such a hearing using an online form. A judicial officer makes the final determination on whether the hearing must be held in person or not.

“As has been the case since the Judiciary developed remote hearing access capabilities, members of the public may request that a pending hearing be conducted remotely,” Judiciary spokesperson Lexi Kriss said in a recent email to Rhode Island Current. “These requests are to be submitted to and considered by the judicial officer presiding over the matter.”

Smiley’s order follows a move by city officials in November to amend Providence’s Community-Police Relations Act to deter local police from interacting with federal immigration officers.

Smiley acknowledged his order may put Providence further in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. The president on Jan. 14 threatened to halt federal funding to so-called “sanctuary” cities and states starting Feb. 1 if they don’t honor his mass deportation policies.

But Smiley said the fear of federal retribution is outweighed by the need to let Providence residents know the city has their backs.

The decision comes weeks after a similar operation in Minnesota incited protests and raised questions about the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Thousands of officers and agents from the Department of Homeland Security were deployed there, and ICE’s actions have come under significant scrutiny in the wake of the shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis this month by an ICE officer.

A number of asylum seekers from African countries ​who arrived in the United States during the Biden administration have settled in Maine​, joining a Somali population that started arriving there in the early 2000s​, when refugees from the country began settling in Lewiston. Yet Maine remains an overwhelmingly white state, with one of the oldest populations in the country. Some employers have begun looking to immigrants to fill labor gaps, as native-born employees have either left the work force or retired.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Maine telegraphed the upcoming operation in a statement on Monday advising people to protest peacefully.

“In the coming days, if Maine citizens seek to exercise their rights to assemble and protest, it is vital that these protests remain peaceful,” said Andrew Benson, the U.S. attorney in the state. “Anyone who forcibly assaults or impedes a federal law enforcement officer, willfully destroys government property or unlawfully obstructs federal law enforcement activity commits a federal crime and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

On Wednesday, Fox News reported that an ICE official took the network on a ride-along in Maine, describing the operation as targeting people with criminal histories.

“We have approximately 1,400 targets here in Maine,” Patricia Hyde, the ICE deputy assistant director, told Fox News.

A D.H.S. spokesperson said the department did not comment on law enforcement operations.

The Trump administration has put pressure on ICE to ramp up arrests throughout the past year. At one point, White House officials proposed a goal of 3,000 arrests a day — a figure the agency has yet to hit. Despite that, ICE officials have ramped up enforcement across the United States.

Maine's governor opposes Trump's aggressive tactics

Support for Trump's immigration approach declines amid clashes

Jan 21 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has started an immigration enforcement operation in Maine, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday, targeting a state that is home to several refugee communities, including Somalis.

The department said in a press release that it kicked off ""Operation Catch of the Day"" on Tuesday, targeting criminal offenders. More than 100 agents arrived in the frigid Northeast state this week, one current immigration official and one former official said on condition of anonymity. The former official said the operation would focus on refugees.

Maine's political leadership and immigrant communities have been bracing for the arrival of more immigration agents. Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, said last week that the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement tactics were ""not welcome.""

President Donald Trump, a Republican, has surged immigration agents to Democratic-led cities and states since mid-2025, with some 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks. Trump says the intense enforcement operations are necessary to combat criminality, although many suspected immigration offenders arrested have no criminal charges or convictions.

Trump has been critical of Somali immigrants after some Somali Americans were implicated in a fraud scheme in Minnesota, calling them ""garbage"" and saying they should leave the U.S.

TRUMP TAKES ELECTION-YEAR CRACKDOWN TO MAINE

Public support for Trump's approach to immigration has dwindled in recent months as federal agents have swept through residential neighborhoods, tossing tear gas and clashing with protesters, Reuters/Ipsos polls show.

Tensions boiled over earlier this month when a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolisfatally shot Renee Good, U.S. citizen and mother of three.

Carl Sheline, mayor of Lewiston, Maine, said on Tuesday that the city had seen an increase in ICE agents in the 39,000-person city. Lewiston, the second-largest city in Maine, is home to Somali immigrants and other refugees, communities that have been there for decades.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin criticized Maine's governor, calling her one of the state's ""sanctuary politicians"" trying to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

""We are no longer allowing criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens,"" McLaughlin said in a statement.

The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Maine will feature several competitive political races in November's midterm elections that will decide control of the U.S. Congress, and immigration is expected to be an issue.

Oppose the FY2026 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill

Congress’s fiscal year 2026 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill is poised to further increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) already bloated budget, allowing ICE to continue expanding its detention capacity at a time when people are dying in the system at a record pace.

The current negotiated funding bill would provide billions of new tax dollars to private contractors already profiting from the windfall of funds the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) received last summer, when Congress passed President Trump’s reconciliation bill defunding Americans’ access to healthcare and food security, affordable housing, education, and other critical services in order to increase profits for prisons, militarized immigration policing, and surveillance companies. Over the last year, U.S. communities have seen the danger of aggressive immigration policing, including the violent arrest and detention of longtime residents, children, and U.S. citizens. Giving DHS even more money to abduct and hurt our neighbors will lead to irreversible harm.

Congress already handed DHS a windfall of $170 billion dollars to supersize its deportation force and detention apparatus. Thanks to this blank check, ICE says it already has enough money to detain over 100,000 people at a time and contract 80,000 new beds. 2025 was the deadliest year ever for people in ICE detention, and six people have died in ICE detention just this month. Local investigators are looking at at least one death as a “likely homicide” at the hands of detention guards. ICE and Border Patrol agents continue to terrorize our communities, leading to violence. Renee Nicole Good’s death is a stark warning of what might still be to come. The negotiated bill provides no guardrails to prevent federal agents from abducting and deporting people at historic levels.

We urge Congress to oppose any additional funds for ICE and Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) Border Patrol, and to use this bill to rein in the Trump administration’s reckless abuse and assault on our communities under the guise of immigration enforcement.

Jesse Franzblau, associate policy director, National Immigrant Justice Center, said: “Congress should not provide another dime for the Trump administration’s violent assault on our communities across the country. We know that the deadly arrest and detention operations will only escalate as long as ICE and Border Patrol have a blank check to operate. Congress must stop taxpayer funds from going to the private contractors profiting from the deadly system, assert its authority by demanding real accountability, cutting funds for immigration prison camps and deportations, and investing in communities.”

Marisol Hernandez, senior advocacy manager, Detention Watch Network, said: “ICE kills — full stop. Decades of evidence illustrate that no one is safe in ICE custody. With a record number of people in detention and record number of deaths in ICE custody, including six deaths just this month, Trump’s cruel mass detention and deportation agenda is being executed at the expense of Americans receiving lifesaving healthcare and millions of kids having school lunches. We demand that Congress stop funding ICE, an abusive agency to its core. Now more than ever, we need real leaders who aren’t afraid to unite against Trump and advocate for the rights and dignity of everyone, including immigrants.”

Jamie Beran, CEO, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, said:“Congress cannot reward ICE for the horrific daily assaults, the murder of Renee Good, the shooting of Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, and the deaths in custody with yet more money. More Americans are waking up to the reality that ICE does vastly more harm than good and it is time our elected officials join their constituents in that reality. As American Jews, we have seen before what happens when a government scapegoats and targets immigrants. We have seen the violence that results when government officials use the false, antisemitic and racist Great Replacement conspiracy theory to justify harassing, deporting, detaining, kidnaping, or targeting anyone who disagrees with them. Congress must intervene and stop the flood of funding to the agencies terrorizing our communities.”

Kate Voigt, senior policy counsel, American Civil Liberties Union, said: “In less than one month, six people died in ICE detention facilities while federal immigration agents have recklessly arrested and even killed members of our communities in the name of immigration enforcement – and these daily horrors are being funded with our taxpayer dollars. Our message to Congress is clear: rein in ICE.”

Amy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights, Amnesty International USA, said: “As ICE is terrorizing communities with brute force and warrantless arrests, and the Trump administration is expanding the cruel and deadly immigrant detention system with a total lack of accountability, it is shameful that Congress is playing business as usual and considering giving millions more taxpayer dollars to an agency with a documented track record of human rights abuses. Congress has an obligation to not fund human rights violations and should instead be cutting funds to ICE and creating guardrails against the agency’s lawless behavior. This bill is not the answer, Congress must vote no.”

Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel, National Immigration Law Center (NILC), said:“After a year of lawless violence and intimidation at the hands of ICE and CBP, communities from coast to coast continue to show up for one another.

The local protest was also fueled by recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in York County.

Protesters across York County gathered on town squares and at busy street corners on the same day that 100 immigration enforcement vehicles were spotted in York City.

The precise actions being taken by U.S. Immigration and Customes Enforcement agents remained unclear Tuesday afternoon, as a spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Several unconfirmed reports of ICE actions emerged on social media, including one just across the county line in New Cumberland.

In all, nine ""Free America Walkout"" events were staged across the county on Tuesday, including in the town squares in Dover, Hanover, Red Lion and York. Several hundred were held nationwide on the anniversary of President Donald Trump's second inauguration. The movement called on people to withhold their labor to object to what organizers described as the ""escalating fascist threat.""

""This is not America. This is the greatest country on Earth, and we've turned to hell under Trump,"" said Marcy Glatfelter, of Hellam Township, as she stationed herself on Continental Square in York City.

Immigration raids, anti-LGBT rhetoric and attacks and mass surveillance were among the walkouts' focuses. Locally, protesters donned signs with messages such as ""Make America Trumpless again"" and ""Hands off our democracy.""

The Women's March, a feminist-led movement against oppression, mobilized walkouts in all 50 states and internationally. By interrupting the usual daily routine to publicly assemble, protesters at more than 800 demonstrations hoped to defend their freedoms and use collective outrage to spark action.

Anger only grew inside Glatfelter in the hours leading up to the protest. She brought multiple signs condemning the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

""They're rounding up York people today, right now,"" she said.

Less than four hours earlier, The York Dispatch captured video of more than a dozen black and gray law enforcement vehicles leaving the federal ICE facility along Clugston Road at a high rate of speed. Earlier in the morning, as many as 100 vehicles were reportedly staging there.

Glatfelter said that seeing the ramp-up in activity fired her up and made her feel scared for anyone those presumed-to-be ICE agents may encounter.

""They have no authority to pull people over, and they're pulling them over asking for papers,"" said Glatfelter. ""What is this, Berlin 1939?""

Later on Tuesday night, people spoke about ICE's presence during public comment at the York City Council's meeting. They expressed concern over the agency's increasing presence, and asked what the city is doing to protect its undocumented community and others who may be subject to profiling due to their skin color.

""I have seen the fear that it causes firsthand. There are people in our community afraid to leave their houses, afraid when they're going to work, afraid when they're picking their children up,"" said Alyssa Jackson, who works in York City.

Jackson told the council she felt a responsibility to her community to attend the meeting and ask questions.

Likewise, resident Jackeline Alvarez urged the council to swiftly address ICE's presence while upholding transparency, accountability and the safety of everyone in the city.

""How does the city make sure local police aren't participating in excessive force and that no one is targeted based on race, ethnicity, or national origin? How can residents safely report incidents if they occur? Will anyone answer?"" asked Alvarez.

She said the city needs to ensure that local resources aren't directed to federal ICE efforts, emphasizing that, in her view, the agency uses unnecessary force and violates rights.

After the meeting, Alvarez told The York Dispatch that she is extremely concerned about the 287(g) agreement West York borough entered into with ICE and wants to see the York City Council do something to reassure vulnerable populations that the city's police won't sign on to the partnership program.

""My concern — everyone's concern, really — is, who will be there for us if ICE racially profiles people here?"" Alvarez said.

Presently, York City does not cooperate with ICE in non-criminal matters. But efforts to legislate protections through a codified ordinance, dubbed the ""Trust Act,"" failed a year ago when then-Mayor Michael Helfrich vetoed the council's narrowly approved vote.

The ordinance would have enshrined protections for immigrants and refugees in the city, promising that police and other city employees would not ask anyone for their immigration status. Helfrich cited the financial burden — he estimated it at $2 million or more — the city would endure if the Trump administration moved to withhold funding from municipalities it deemed so-called ""sanctuary cities.""

Jackson told The York Dispatch that she was unaware about the Trust Act efforts but that she would be happy to see something like that enacted. She said she intends to keep speaking out until something changes.

""Obviously, everybody can see now that everything looks very scary,"" Jackson said.

At the demonstration, Katie Landis, of Red Lion, held up a sign reading, ""Do not comply in advance,"" an anti-fascist principle that she said is more important now than ever.

""I've been worried since the moment Trump got elected over 10 years ago,"" Landis said. ""All of the worries that I've had, I've been slowly watching come to fruition. The situation with ICE in Minnesota feels like a tipping point.""

Renee Nicole Good, a Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen, was killed by an ICE agent earlier this month. She wasn’t herself a target of ICE officers. The incident ""terrified"" Landis, who was already concerned for the safety of immigrants and people of color in her community.

Following what happened in Minneapolis, Alvarez also expressed worry after the council meeting that law enforcement and onlookers could escalate peaceful protests locally. She asked the council to respond with a course of action within the next few weeks.

ICE's increasingly violent conduct under the second Trump administration alarmed Porter Hedge, of Spring Garden Township, and pushed him to participate in the York City walkout. He said ICE has strayed from decades-long protocols, no longer following immigration law and enforcement practices but rather exerting a ""disturbing"" abuse of power.

""They seem to be an untrained group of people hired for their capacity for violence,"" Hedge said. ""I fear for the people who have become targets of an undisciplined method of law enforcement.""

Protesting and causing disruption can slow the spread of fascism, if not stop it altogether, Landis said. She said most people blindly comply with the authority's rules, and that those who have the privilege to dissent should do so.

""All of our family members, all of our ancestors, came here to stolen land,"" said Eve Adler, of Springettsbury Township.

Adler said people don't understand what's really happening to immigrants in this country, so showing up and speaking out is crucial.

""I feel like (ICE) is just people who do not have the right to detain innocent people, and injure and murder innocent people, such as Renee, and all of the protestors of innocent immigrants who have come to make our communities a better place,"" Adler said.

Similar sentiments are why others, such as Hedge, want to attract attention from people across the country. He said he thinks it's necessary to avoid what he referred to as ""an un-American downfall.""

""It's gonna get personal very quickly for a lot of people,"" said Landis. ""I just wish more people would look at it, because if we don't look at it, how do we stop it? How do we fight against it?""

But not everyone protesting believed their individual or even collective presence would convince onlookers who might support ICE to see things differently. While most people driving by either honked in support of the protestors or made no acknowledgment at all, a few hecklers yelled profanities and praised Trump.

The invective didn't trouble Glatfelter, who encouraged people to take action — both in the form of protest and in communications with elected officials.

""If you care about your neighbors, call your congressman, call the Senate, call the White House. Write letters,"" she said.","https://www.yorkdispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/20/PPYD/88272609007-img-3773.jpeg?crop=3864,2178,x0,y404&width=3200&height=1804&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 15:58:19.646997

A federal complaint and affidavit filed in court by an F.B.I. agent differed in some details from the description provided by the Department of Homeland Security after the shooting last Wednesday. Two men, Alfredo A. Aljorna and Julio C. Sosa-Celis, who are Venezuelan nationals, were accused in the court records of assaulting the agent with a broom before the agent opened fire, striking Mr. Sosa-Celis.

Both men appeared on Wednesday in Federal District Court in St. Paul, where a judge found probable cause for the case to proceed. Neither man entered a plea or spoke about the incident.

The shooting happened a week after another immigration agent shot and killed Renee Good, a U.S. citizen, on a residential street in a different part of Minneapolis. Both shootings touched off protests in the city, which the Trump administration has flooded with immigration agents in recent weeks.

The newly unsealed court records provided the government’s fullest account yet of the second shooting, which an F.B.I. agent said happened after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on a temporary assignment in the state ran a license plate on a Ford Focus and found that its Minnesota tag was registered to someone in the country illegally.

The two ICE agents believed that the driver, Mr. Aljorna, was the person who owned the vehicle, the F.B.I. agent wrote, but that turned out not to be the case. The affidavit said that the ICE agents, driving an unmarked vehicle, turned on their lights and siren to pull over the Ford. The F.B.I. agent said that Mr. Aljorna instead sped off and “recklessly zig-zagged through traffic” in a chase that lasted between 15 and 20 minutes.

The affidavit noted that the ICE agents “were not familiar with the area,” and said that they eventually lost track of Mr. Aljorna until discovering that he had crashed into a light pole. The agents said they then saw Mr. Aljorna run toward a nearby apartment building, and that one of the ICE agents chased after him. Another person, identified in the affidavit as Mr. Sosa-Celis, was standing on the porch and urged Mr. Aljorna to run faster, officials said.

The F.B.I. agent wrote that Mr. Aljorna eventually fell, and an agent caught up to him. The two then fought on the ground, the affidavit said, before Mr. Sosa-Celis grabbed a broomstick and started hitting the agent in the face. The affidavit said that the agent thought he saw another man, who was not named, approach holding a snow shovel, and that the agent was also struck with the shovel.

Mr. Aljorna eventually freed himself from the agent, the affidavit said, and grabbed the broom. The ICE agent, the affidavit said, was “exhausted, alone, on the ground and in fear.” The agent sustained a gash on his hand while deflecting a blow, the F.B.I. agent wrote.

The ICE agent drew his pistol and fired one round, the affidavit said, and was initially unsure if anyone had been hit. The two men had started to run toward the apartment building “simultaneously” when the agent fired, the affidavit said.

The two men went inside the building. After more law enforcement officers arrived, the affidavit said, they used tear gas and the men surrendered. Mr. Sosa-Celis was found to have “a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to his upper right thigh,” according to the affidavit.

Katherian Roe, the federal defender in Minnesota, who is listed in court records as the lawyer for both men, indicated in an email that she is often initially listed as the lawyer of record in cases that will later be assigned to another lawyer. She did not comment on the circumstances of this case.

The account of the incident relayed by the F.B.I. agent largely matched what federal officials said in the immediate aftermath, as protesters were gathering at the scene and clashing with law enforcement. But it also included notable differences from that initial description and from a more detailed statement released by the Department of Homeland Security the following day.

In earlier descriptions, federal officials said that the incident started with “a targeted traffic stop in Minneapolis of an illegal alien from Venezuela,” but did not mention that the driver the agents were trying to stop was not who they first believed him to be. Officials have said that Mr. Aljorna and Mr. Sosa-Celis are both from Venezuela and are both in the country illegally.

In its more detailed statement on the day after the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security indicated that Mr. Sosa-Celis, not Mr. Aljorna, was the driver. The agency also used a different spelling of Mr. Aljorna’s last name. That statement accused a third man, also from Venezuela and also in the country illegally, of being involved in the incident. While the affidavit says that the agent believed a third man assaulted him with a shovel, only Mr. Aljorna and Mr. Sosa-Celis are accused by name in the complaint.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an email on Tuesday night asking about those differences.

The F.B.I. agent’s affidavit said that investigators found a broom and snow shovel outside the apartment building. The affidavit also said that law enforcement officials decided to leave that building “without executing a full search warrant” because of “unprecedented civil unrest that developed in the vicinity.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/20nat-minnesota-shooting-1-cptq/20nat-minnesota-shooting-1-cptq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:37.822244

​“Data center construction accounted for 92% of growth in U.S. GDP this year,” Al-Haj noted.","Around the United States, the rebellions against President Donald Trump’s militarized Immigration and Customs Enforcement invasions — bolstered by other agencies including the National Guard and, at least in one case, actual Marines—continue. National headlines have mostly skipped over Memphis, perhaps because it’s a smaller city in the South, far from the headquarters of national media. On the ground in Memphis, local policy organizer Amber Sherman explained, the fear— and resistance — are similar to what we see in bigger cities.

It’s not so much the National Guard, she said, but around the city, there are some 1,500 federal agents from the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force working alongside existing police and using traffic stops — reportedly more than 35,000 in two months — as a way to get their hands on people. This is the very issue — pretextual stops— that Memphis activists organized against so effectively after police killed artist and skateboarder Tyre Nichols two years ago. ​“It’s just scaring the hell out of people,” Sherman said. ​“A lot of people just aren’t going anywhere, and that’s really impacting all the economics. No one is going out to buy anything. People aren’t taking their kids to school.”

Unlike Illinois and California, Tennessee has a governor who is thrilled to have Trump’s troops. Gov. Bill Lee led the charge to overturn the police reforms that Memphis activists like Sherman had fought for, as I wrote in 2024. Cities under attack by the state government is a common story in the South, but the Memphis activists are also disappointed in their city government, which has offered to cooperate with the federal agents.

“We’re threatened constantly, and some people are susceptible to those threats,” Sherman said.

Activists in the city have fought for social services and youth programs that effectively lowered violent crime to a 25-year low— according to the police themselves. But too often the governor and state legislature overturn that work or its funding.

“Our mayor doesn’t want to push back because he knows that they’ll not fund or not give us grants for different programming,” Sherman said. ​“That’s how they keep us in check.”

What Memphis does have in common with most other cities on Trump’s list is Black leadership, a large Black population and powerful activist communities. And it’s beginning to fight back, too, against the tech takeover, embodied in Memphis in the form of Elon Musk’s xAI data center. So Trump sent in the task force — which had, between Oct. 1 and early December, made more than 3,100 arrests, and it won’t disclose who it has arrested or why. Local outlet MLK50 analyzed one day’s worth of arrest data to find that, despite the governor’s claims that the force is arresting violent criminals and gang members, ​“most of the people arrested were not charged with a violent crime, and immigrants are being arrested on administrative — not criminal — warrants.”

“It is meant,” Sherman said, ​“as a way to quell dissent.”

The rebellions have, so far, given us two iconic images of resistance. In Portland, Ore., we have the inflatable costumes—beginning with the frog and expanding to a whole menagerie. In Los Angeles, the indelible image is that of a string of automated Waymo taxis, put to the torch.

The costumes have quickly been seized on and replicated around the country, most visibly at the massive No Kings marches in October 2025. But as Julia Carrie Wong wrote in the Guardian, clowning in a frog suit is a de-escalatory tactic, designed to make masked agents of the state appear ridiculous.

By contrast, the flaming Waymos express something else: a targeted defiance of tech-enabled Trumpism with material consequences. If you’re going to treat our neighbors as disposable, the burned-to-a-crisp robotaxi says, we’re going to make you pay.

The flaming Waymos express something else: a targeted defiance of tech-enabled Trumpism with material consequences.

The Waymo is, after all, a privatized, automated taxi run as a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and rolled out in high-tech hubs like San Francisco, Phoenix and Austin, Texas.

Tech journalist Brian Merchant saw the husks of incinerated Waymos firsthand in Los Angeles and reported, ​“Protesters were reportedly calling them ​‘spy cars’ as they were vandalized and set ablaze, and some noted how the cars can share data with the LAPD.”

Merchant goes on: ​“ICE raids are carried out using data provided by Silicon Valley companies. … Whether directly or through third party contractors, much of big tech, including Google, has made deals with ICE, too.”

A Waymo car burns in the street as smoke billows during protests in Los Angeles, California, on June 8, 2025. Following a series of aggressive federal immigration operations in Los Angeles, tensions escalated when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted a high-profile raid on a Home Depot location. The raid sparked widespread protests across the city, where demonstrators decried the targeting of immigrant communities and the separation of families. Clashes soon broke out between protesters and federal agents, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to the city, a move harshly criticized by California officials, including the governor, as ""purposefully inflammatory."" (Photo by DAVID PASHAEE/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)

A photo posted of one Waymo, presumably before it was put to the torch, showed it splashed with graffiti, ​“Eat the Rich” and ​“Tech Fuels Fascism.”

The same tech hubs in which Waymo has so proudly unfurled its service, after all, were also increasingly unlivable before the camouflaged gun-toting goons marched in, where homelessness is rampant and gig workers sleep in their (non-self-driving) cars.

Driving for one of the various rideshare and delivery apps was one way that working-class people, immigrant or otherwise, could maybe piece together a living; now, robotaxis and a horde of delivery robots cheerily automate their jobs away. The workers so recently called ​“essential” in the days of Covid-19 lockdowns are tossed aside or fed into the deportation machine.

Communities have been disintegrating under the weight of supposed prosperity. As Eric Garcetti, then-mayor of Los Angeles, famously said in 2020: ​“In a good economy, homelessness goes up.”

What the Waymo represents, then, is the question of what happens in an increasingly automated economy, when more and more of us will no longer be “workers” at all.

Wealthy residents and visitors to LA can cruise past homeless encampments in a driverless car, ignoring the people rendered surplus when parts of the servant economy are mechanized. California Gov. Gavin Newsom personally joined the clearance of one LA camp, ostentatiously shoving items into a trash bag.

The symbolism couldn’t be clearer: When we no longer value your labor, you will be discarded.

What the Waymo represents, then, is the question of what happens in an increasingly automated economy, when more and more of us will no longer be ​“workers” at all.

What happens when U.S. capitalism simply needs fewer humans?

The idea of people being superfluous isn’t new, but it’s become a dominant structure of feeling in recent years. Over and over, when I was reporting on the Covid pandemic, workers told me some version of, ​“They say we’re essential. What they really mean is we’re expendable.”

They felt this way in the middle of lockdown, when suddenly the importance of grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, line cooks and farmworkers was made abundantly clear. Immigrant-dominated industries were suddenly so important that the president demanded they keep working; meanwhile, undocumented people were excluded from most of the benefits offered to Americans to survive the crisis. Five years on, with the government shut down for some six weeks and SNAP benefits for more than 40 million people only recently restored, those suspicions of expendability have been proven correct, and not only about immigrant workers. Sherman noted that Tennessee has a rainy day fund of more than $2 billion, and it would have taken only a fraction of that to cover food aid for the 700,000 estimated residents of the state who rely on SNAP.

The United States has a long history of absorbing workers, particularly from Latin America, when demand is high, and removing them when demand falters. As I recently wrote for In These Times, ICE enforcement can be scarce in the months after a disaster, only to swoop in after cleanup.

But this story goes back further.

Famously, there was the Bracero Program, established in 1942, which brought guest workers from Mexico for the farming season, issuing millions of temporary visas. There was the also the overlapping, repugnantly named Operation Wetback, a crackdown by border agents to deport people back to Mexico or push them into the Bracero standards.

Guest workers were preferable because they could not stay — they were sent back as soon as the need for their labor was done.

This same reason is why Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have advocated for expanded guest worker programs in tech — cheaper workers are easier to remove if they make trouble. In low-paid farmwork, the excuse is that ​“Americans won’t do this work”; in tech, the argument is Americans lack the skills. Both arguments offer cover for the continued desire for cheap and easily controlled workers.

Since the end of the Bracero Program, the United States has tightened the border more. Presidents of both parties have targeted Mexican and Latinx immigrants, fast-tracked deportations, and, in Daniel Denvir’s words in All-American Nativism, ​“us[ed] undocumented workers as leverage.”

The result is the continued dehumanization of migrants — at best, valued as units of labor power rather than human beings, and, at worst, demonized for simply daring to exist in the United States.

Today, it seems, the Trump administration’s smash-and-grab approach to deportations might finally have changed the calculus. Beyond just keeping migrants super-exploitable to drive down wages for us all, ICE has become the shock troops of a regime led by a man who posts AI-generated slop of himself raining shit on the people he governs; they arrest and brutalize citizen and migrant alike, grab children on their way to school, terrorize people in their homes.

This is occurring at a time of skyrocketing inequality, when decent jobs and affordable housing are harder and harder to come by. White Americans, particularly men, who are used to being first in line for the good stuff, are now feeling the loss in status. Meanwhile, demagogues aplenty are telling them their loss has been immigrants’ gain. The reality is that the capitalists, in tech and other industries, care little for any of our lives: White workers, as well as immigrants, are disposable, and the investments being poured into so-called artificial intelligence are in the hope that more expensive workers — whether skilled coders held up so often as the ideal, or Hollywood writers, or journalists — can be replaced by an algorithm.

The gigification of so many jobs by the app-based economy (the Ubers and Lyfts) laid the groundwork. As Emily Bender, co-author of The AI Con, explained, ​“If the work can be broken down into little replicable units that people can slot into, then you don’t need to see workers as people with expertise, with careers, with relationships. They are just providers of content or annotations or labeling or, in big scare quotes, ​‘intelligence.’”

The flaming Waymo, then, is not a symbol of nebulous or even misdirected rage. It is a symbol of the way that more and more people are being rendered surplus, through organized abandonment or deliberate removal.

It’s Taylorism for the 21st century, and there is no industry that the tech overlords would not like to apply it to. Whether we are deskilled (and devalued), or literally packed off to prison or a deportation flight, capital will keep flowing into the pockets of the Zuckerbergs and Musks. (Musk, we should recall, is also rolling out supposedly self-driving taxis.)

Rooting for Trump to deport all the immigrants is a desperate bid to stave off one’s own expendability. The better solution, as striking Hollywood writers proved, is organization. Or, as the people of LA and Chicago and everywhere else remind us, to raise hell.

The flaming Waymo, then, is not a symbol of nebulous or even misdirected rage. It is a symbol of the way that more and more people are being rendered surplus, through organized abandonment or deliberate removal. As Merchant wrote, ​“The Waymo contributes to congestion, surveils neighborhoods, replaces the Uber or cab driver, and sends any resultant future profits upstream to a tech company in Mountain View.”

The protesters know exactly why — and for whom — it exists.

We are in a new age of uprising, as Joshua Clover wrote in Riot. Strike. Riot. These rebellions are often kicked off by state violence, spurred by a recognition of the racial dimension of this disposability. From Memphis, Minneapolis and Ferguson, Mo., to Los Angeles and Chicago, police murder a Black person and are granted impunity; ICE stuffs someone who looks Latinx into an unmarked van as community members film and shout and sometimes succeed in pulling their neighbors back. The forces of so-called order operate above the law, and more and more of us know it.

As Clover also stressed, the return of the riot comes as profitability and ​“economic growth” have stagnated. He noted that capital’s ​“tragic flaw” is that, in Marx’s own words, ​“it presses to reduce labor time to a minimum, while it posits labor time, on the other side, as sole measure and source of wealth.” Capital needs us, even as it needs to replace us. It automates the labor, rendering more people surplus, even as it captures their skill in the machine and the algorithm — what Marx referred to so famously as ​“dead labor.”

So-called generative AI is a clearer illustration of this principle than Marx could have imagined. As Molly Crabapple and others wrote in an open letter, playing on his words, it is ​“vampirical, feasting on past generations of artwork even as it sucks the lifeblood from living artists.”

More prosaically: Machine learning sweeps up vast swaths of existing works of art, literature, journalism and scholarship, and vomits it back out in a fraction of the time it took to create the original, but mashed together, sometimes deliberately imitative. As we create and our work is made public, it is vacuumed up by the machine — a machine that requires ever more computing power, electricity and water. Trump uses AI to express his contempt for protests and, by doing so, expresses his contempt not just for the value of human labor but for the planet.

Meanwhile, people are rendered surplus along manufactured, racialized lines: the prison, the police killing, the migrant detention center, the deportation flight. Labor’s long-dear principle of last-hired, first-fired meant Black workers felt deindustrialization’s sting first and fiercest, though the stories we hear today nearly always figure the redundant worker as a white man. Factories moved overseas to wring greater profits from cheaper workers, and those left behind went into services, or gig work, or languished.

This cycle is familiar, and within it, the ICE raids — like the ar - rests of protesters with the movement to end the genocide in Gaza— work, as historian Robin D.G. Kelley told me, like a lynching: a public demonstration to instill fear and compliance. The ICE raid is a tool of discipline. And the bigger the surplus population, the more discipline needed.

Today’s rebellions have usually faced down the state, Clover noted, because ​“the state is near and the economy far.” The strike was the tactic of choice for the proletariat in the days of industrialized production because most people could reach out and touch the economy. But many cannot do so directly now because they are locked out entirely or their manager is an algorithm, an app, a ghost.

The riot is, as Clover argued, a struggle that ​“unfolds in the context of consumption, featuring the interruption of commercial circulation.” Protesters have, over and over, in the uprisings of recent years, taken to the streets, shut down transit, destroyed cars and looted shops, taking things because why do they deserve less than the rich? What Clover called the ​“surplus rebellion” mucks up circulation to be heard.

As humans are increasingly closed out of circulation, the targeting of tech makes more sense. As Brian Merchant noted, tech companies like automation ​“because it promises not just to remove labor from the equation, but accountability. There is no driver to blame if something goes wrong with the self-driving car, it’s a glitchy algorithm; or better yet, it was probably somebody else’s fault because Google’s algorithm is safe and sophisticated, even if it won’t tell you how that algorithm actually works.”

The protesters, though, turned that setup on its head: ​“There is no one around to stop them from hailing a Waymo car and destroying it.” The tech company has created a place where they can touch — and torch — what’s killing them.

The destruction of the Waymo also recalls an earlier period of transition, from the first round of riots to the strike. In the early days of industrialization, workers would smash the machine that replaced (or sped up and deskilled) their jobs. The Luddites were the most famous, and a series of books (by Gavin Mueller, Merchant himself, and Jathan Sadowski) have brought them back to public consciousness. The Luddites, far from opposing technology for its own sake, were well aware of who controlled the tech and how their labor was being encoded into it. Breaking the machine was not a symbolic action, but a direct one: The smashed machine can’t work, and the burned car doesn’t run.

“[M]achine-breaking,” Clover wrote, ​“is what the swing from riot to strike looks like.”

You may not be able to destroy the algorithm, but its avatar, roaming your streets, is still, necessarily, tangible.

AI is not produced out of nowhere. The Cloud is a bad metaphor. All of those searches we plug into ChatGPT or Midjourney are carried out on physical machines, and the mad rush to build more data centers means one of them is likely coming to a community near you.

In Memphis, there are no Waymos, but Elon Musk’s Colossus supercomputer has drawn the ire of many who are angry about its gas turbines and the pollution they bring to already-bad air. ​“They really weren’t ready for the level of pushback they would get,” Sherman said. The company is building another center and ​“they have all these private security guards that are everywhere” due to protests, she said.

Tech companies, said Sherman, seem to be ​“trying to get everything that they have wanted to do done right now because they have this president that’s supporting them.”

Just up the Mississippi, in St. Louis, local organizers are also fighting data centers. A project has been proposed for the middle of the city, at the Armory, a former entertainment venue located conveniently in a district that allows tax incentives and a lot of secrecy. They don’t know whose data center it will be just yet, said Jeremy Al-Haj, executive director of the Missouri Workers Center, but they know the city helped underwrite bonds for it.

The coalition — which includes organizations ranging from SEIU’s healthcare local to the Democratic Socialists of America to Metropolitan Congregations United and the Missouri Sierra Club — held a town hall and packed a local church with voices almost entirely in opposition. Their reasons, Al-Haj said, ​“ranged from the environmental concerns around the data center, water usage and electrical usage, the increased utility rates and the noise level from the data center,” as well as ​“just the very idea that this should be in the center of the city. And … outrage about AI and the automation of professional middle-class jobs and human creativity that implies.”

AI has proved a crappy replacement for humans — it’s not an accident that the common term for its digital output is ​“slop.” But it has contributed to the turning of decent jobs into lousy temporary gigs. In his book Work Without the Worker, Phil Jones noted, ​“AI does not tend to create fully automated systems but rather systems that partially automate jobs and outsource certain tasks to the crowd.” That crowd, he further pointed out, can be located anywhere that an internet connection can reach: automation and outsourcing continue to go hand in hand.

The Waymo car, Joanne McNeil pointed out, is a perfect example of this phenomenon. Remote contractors do the work that the algorithm and the robot can’t, but they’re hidden from view in what Astra Taylor called ​“fauxtomation.” Waymo’s co-CEO, McNeil noted, denied the cars have remote drivers, but this, she wrote, contradicted the company’s own filing with the California Public Utilities Commission, which ​“cited the remote workers in its automation chain as a critical safety feature.” Those workers can move the Waymo if the software fails; the company got its expansion approved because human involvement helps ​“minimize risk.”

Human workers compiled and cleaned the dataset that trained those workers in the first place — human drivers in Google Street View cars and humans behind computers deciding whether an object in a photo is a stop sign. Humans help train systems about which they know almost nothing; you’ve probably helped it yourself if you’ve ever had to use a reCAPTCHA to access a website. That data can be recycled, whether to train a Waymo or an armed drone. Bombing raids in Gaza were guided by AI; Memphis touts its new AI-powered surveillance hub.

Humans are present in every stage of the system, even as it renders them invisible, as Jones wrote. The AI is vampiric at first the way a mosquito is: a little nibble here and there. But mosquitos transmit viruses that kill.

The data centers are as distributed as the outsourced workers. In Mexico, communities battle the same pollution as Memphis, emitted by the same companies; electric grids falter under Microsoft and Amazon. Water shortages make people sick. The director of industrial development for Querétaro, where many of Mexico’s 110 data centers are, bragged in the New York Times of constructing data centers that would use the same amount of energy as 1.25 million U.S. homes. Meanwhile, the state plans to recycle sewage for drinking water.

This is the growth, domestically and internationally, that late capitalism offers. ​“Data center construction accounted for 92% of growth in U.S. GDP this year,” Al-Haj noted. ​“The New York Times just reported that Amazon’s planning to automate 75% of its workforce.” The Missouri Workers Center has been organizing with Amazon warehouse workers for several years, and those workers, he said, are worried: ​“And while they might create some small number of jobs for certain segments of the working class, for the remainder, they spell the loss of jobs.”

The algorithms and the robots are driven by humans, and their deployment is a human decision. The white supremacists who fear the so-called Great Replacement have their targets all wrong, in other words. The real great replacement they ought to worry about isn’t immigrants, but man (and woman, and everyone else) with machine.

In this economy, then, expect to see more machine-breaking.

Worker groups like the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and community organizations like Organized Communities Against Deportations have been building networks of communication, hosting know-your-rights trainings for migrants and concentric circles of activists who have documents, so they can join a rapid response or a more distant protest, amplify stories, serve as legal observers and more. Such groups, as I wrote in Necessary Trouble and From the Ashes, capture some of the outrage from moments of rebellion and build from it in strategically necessary directions.

In Memphis, Sherman said, as in many other cities, organizers have set up a rapid response hotline to report ICE or police activity. They’re canvassing and sharing information in multiple languages. She and others are organized under ​“Free the 901,” and their website offers know-your-rights flyers and information. ​“We post warnings about the different areas to avoid,” Sherman said. The group has also launched a rideshare program — the antithesis of the Waymo, a gesture of explicit human accompaniment — so people don’t have to brave the streets alone.

Organizers in Missouri have found they can indeed defeat the data centers. In St. Charles, community outrage seemed, to Jeremy Al-Haj, ​“pretty organic,” led by farmers who organized quickly. ​“It was also the case that the mayor’s cousin owned the plot of land that was going to get purchased, and the city council and the mayor had all signed nondisclosure agreements about the project.” Concerns about corruption, in other words, dovetailed with the anger at the secrecy and culminated in a yearlong construction ban.

Capturing the energy of a rebellion is like capturing lightning in a bottle. It doesn’t hold its form well. Not everyone is willing or able to come to weekly organizing meetings. That does not mean nothing has been learned in the streets, that knowledge-sharing isn’t taking place. During the LA rebellion, social media was overflowing with such sharing: Images from Hong Kong’s protests proliferated, and tips about tear gas were proffered by unlikely suspects, including one dermatologist who went viral.

In such moments, people learn the contours of their power. They learn how it feels to be part of a crowd, to have the scary thing happen and to stand up. In LA, successive generations of workers and organizers have survived police crackdowns and showed up again. Echoes of not just the 1992 LA riots or the 1965 Watts rebellion, but the 1990 police assault on a Justice for Janitors demonstration in Century City, could be seen in LA this summer.

David Huerta was one of those who cut his organizing teeth on the Justice for Janitors campaign. Now the president of SEIU California and of SEIU United Service Workers West, Huerta was arrested attempting to protect his community when the ICE raids began June 6. His arrest helped take the LA story national, as union leaders — even those less inclined than Huerta to put their bodies on the line — denounced his arrest.

The question is not how to organize every single person, but rather, how to prepare for the moments of explosion while focusing on what people need day to day.

Since Huerta’s arrest, ICE has escalated to arresting Brad Lander, the third-highest elected official in New York City, and California Sen. Alex Padilla, among others. Huerta’s original felony charge has been downgraded, though he still faces trial.

The Watts rebellion, Kelley noted, ​“grew not from chaos but from a mobilized community seeking change.” There were civil rights groups but also arts collectives; after the uprising, activists created more cultural spaces and joined more radical political groups, including the Black Panther Party. They built a network to monitor police abuses.

Communities dispersed by policing, economic displacement, deportations — by all the tendrils of organized abandonment — have a harder time coming together, but history reminds us it’s not impossible. We are seeing in the streets what political theorist Rodrigo Nunes called ​“distributed action” in Neither Vertical Nor Horizontal, as different forms of organizing ​“combine, communicate, relate and establish positive and negative feedback loops with one another.” Such action operates at multiple scales and times; it involves the collectivities in the streets as well as the long-term membership organizations that stay when national reporters leave. There is little that is absolutely right or wrong: What matters is whether it works, not whether it proves prior ideas.

To those who ask what good setting a Waymo car on fire does, then, we might reply, ​“too early to tell.” But there is power when long-term organizing and battle-tested strategists come into contact with the righteous anger sparked by repression. The question is not how to organize every single person, but rather, how to prepare for the moments of explosion while focusing on what people need day to day.

We know this means protecting people in our communities when the masked agents arrive, to the best of our abilities, and that requires getting to know those people ahead of time. We know the issues that will move people to act are the ones that, as Ruth Wilson Gilmore says, bite into their existence: the rent, the workplace, the police, the cost of groceries. Different organizations may focus on each, and when the flashpoints come, may be able to lead — or sometimes, importantly, to follow where the riot goes, and to learn in motion what it is that the people will no longer abide.

“We’re doing everything we can to keep our community safe,” Sherman said. ​“We want to make sure that we are answering the call of what people need in the moment.”",https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/itt-images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/5001w.F1Main.GettyImages-2219237857L.jpg?mtime=1767971869,N,,2026-01-21 15:02:27.512584

Quilala,” and then reduced his hours, removed him from an assignment, and ultimately terminated his employment after he complained.
Because the EFAA serves as a statutory limitation on the FAA’s enforcement mandate, the court held that judges must evaluate its applicability as a ""gateway"" question of arbitrability before compelling arbitration.
Substantively, the opinion also clarified the threshold for alleging a sexual harassment dispute sufficient to trigger the EFAA in the employment context.
As a result, none of Quilala’s remaining claims – including those involving wages or general wrongful termination – could be compelled to arbitration.","The First District Court of Appeal’s decision in Quilala v. Securitas Security Services USA, Inc. underscores the significant reach of the federal Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (EFAA) in California employment disputes and the judiciary’s principal role in determining the availability of arbitration when sexual assault or harassment claims are alleged. In that case, Francisco Quilala sued his former employer, Securitas, asserting twenty-two causes of action arising from his employment, including claims for sex, gender, and sexual orientation harassment under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA). He alleged that supervisors questioned his sexual identity, asked intrusive questions about his sexual activity, spread rumors about his sexual orientation, repeatedly mocked him as “Mrs. Quilala,” and then reduced his hours, removed him from an assignment, and ultimately terminated his employment after he complained. When Securitas moved to compel arbitration under a predispute arbitration agreement signed during onboarding, the trial court denied the motion, concluding that the EFAA barred enforcement of the agreement, and Securitas filed an appeal.

The Court of Appeal held that trial judges possess an independent duty to determine whether a dispute falls within the scope of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Because the EFAA serves as a statutory limitation on the FAA’s enforcement mandate, the court held that judges must evaluate its applicability as a ""gateway"" question of arbitrability before compelling arbitration. In this instance, the trial court raised the EFAA on its own initiative in a tentative ruling, even though the plaintiff had not cited the statute in his opposition. The appellate court emphasized that since the EFAA expressly mandates its applicability be “determined by a court, rather than an arbitrator,” a judge is empowered to raise the issue regardless of whether it was briefed by the parties, provided that fundamental due process is respected.

The appellate court further clarified that the trial court satisfied due process by identifying the EFAA as a potential bar in its tentative ruling and granting the parties an opportunity to argue the matter at the subsequent hearing. Under this framework, there is no obligation for a court to solicit supplemental briefing before relying on the statute. Additionally, the court ruled that a plaintiff “elects” to proceed in court for purposes of the EFAA simply by filing a lawsuit and opposing a motion to compel arbitration. No formal or express invocation of the EFAA is required for a claimant to benefit from its protections, as the act of seeking relief in a judicial forum sufficiently demonstrates that choice.

Substantively, the opinion also clarified the threshold for alleging a sexual harassment dispute sufficient to trigger the EFAA in the employment context. Securitas argued that Quilala’s allegations did not rise to the level of actionable harassment, but the court, applying current FEHA standards, held that conduct altering the conditions of employment need only be “sufficiently pervasive” or “extremely serious” and must be evaluated in light of Government Code section 12923 and recent California Supreme Court authority. The court concluded that repeated derisive references to “Mrs. Quilala,” intrusive and humiliating questions about sexual activity, and adverse actions allegedly tied to perceived sexual orientation described more than “simple teasing” and plausibly alleged a hostile work environment. Because Quilala stated a cognizable sexual harassment claim under FEHA, the court held that the dispute qualified as a “sexual harassment dispute” within the meaning of the EFAA, rendering the predispute arbitration agreement unenforceable once the plaintiff elected to remain in court.

Finally, the Court of Appeal confirmed that once the EFAA applies, it does so at the level of the “case” rather than individual claims, and employers cannot salvage arbitration of non-harassment causes of action by attempting to carve them out. Relying on the statute’s use of the term “case,” and in line with prior California decisions such as Doe v. Second Street Corp., Liu v. Miniso Depot CA, Inc., and Casey v. Superior Court, the court held that the presence of a qualifying sexual harassment claim brings the entire lawsuit within the scope of the EFAA. As a result, none of Quilala’s remaining claims – including those involving wages or general wrongful termination – could be compelled to arbitration. For employers, Quilala serves as a timely reminder that even a single adequately pled sexual harassment claim can invalidate enforcement of an otherwise enforceable arbitration agreement for the entire action and that courts, not arbitrators, will be the ones to make that determination in the first instance.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15036_5440.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:00:51.212941

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under Democratic President Joe Biden helped return Trump, a Republican, to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

""It's not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people's civil and human rights,"" she told The Associated Press. ""This country has done that before, and it can do it again.""

Violent scenes force a strong Democratic response

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

""I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,"" said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,"" Garcia added, ""which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.""

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats.

On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared with 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

""If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,"" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

""I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what's paying for ICE to be doing this,"" New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last week. ""The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this.""

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

Trump faces his own public opinion challenges

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, from 49% in March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

""Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it's going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,"" he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

""I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,"" he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

""Are we really going to be the Gestapo?"" he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said ""there's a lot of pain and anguish.""

""It's heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview. ""It's chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.""",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-20T222655Z_369020490_RC285JA2I107_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:31.333257

A few days later, the violence ICE is perpetrating in our city arrived, literally, on our doorstep: Armed masked men raided our neighbors’ homes, remaining at our corner for two long hours. As we prayed and cared for those around us, several of our pastors and staff were among those who were pepper-bombed.

Our city is under siege, and when we asked the children in our congregation how they are feeling, they told us, unsurprisingly, that they feel scared. One youth, the child of an immigrant, texted his grandmother in the middle of the night: “I’m scared every day i live in fear and I don’t know what to do if your awake please call me.”

How can we comfort our children? We feel scared too.

We can start by acknowledging that we — unlike Renee Good, unlike George Floyd — have lived to breathe another day. For one more day, we have the privilege of following the way of Jesus, who called on us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked — and welcome the stranger.

And so, in this climate of fear, we turn to that life-affirming work. Immigrant families are afraid to venture outside. We’ve had to cancel our children’s choir practice until we can confidently gather the children safely.

Yet a few children and their moms still rallied to go grocery shopping for immigrant families, delivering boxes to a local McDonald’s where many immigrants work. In distributing Happy Meals to the appreciative children, the assistant manager offered a lesson in how mutual care strengthens the bonds of community. “When you share,” he explained in his accented English, “we share.”

We wish that feeding one another during these terrible times would be enough. But our young people tell us it is not. As one of our youth said, “I want to make sure my friends are not stolen from their families.” Another child asked, “Could you make ICE disappear? They hurt people.”

Jesus understood what it meant to live under an occupying force — in his case, the Roman Empire. He understood the helplessness. He understood the stakes, and yet he persisted in showing us, before ultimately dying from the violence, that another way — a way of love — is possible.

So we will continue to deliver groceries. We will make arrangements so that, if the unfathomable happens, the children can stay with other families. And from the epicenter of this occupation, we send out the children’s plea: Please. Make the people who are hurting people disappear.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN251208_223-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:02:30.435650

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents increasingly have staked out court hearings in the state to arrest people amid President Trump's mass deportation effort. A WBUR analysis previously found court arrests jumped threefold in January through October 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

The legislation would require ICE agents obtain and show a judicial warrant to court personnel in order to take someone into custody at a courthouse for a civil immigration matter, such as overstaying a visa.

Federal agents often arrest people without a judicial warrant for civil infractions. If passed, this law would require a judicial warrant for officers to arrest someone on a civil matter on courthouse grounds in the state.

The proposed law also would ban anyone inside a courthouse from wearing a mask and require all law enforcement officers to identify themselves and state their purpose to court officials.

The East Boston senator said her bill protects access to justice by making sure no one is scared to go to court.

""When you don't feel safe to go to court — especially if you're a witness to a crime — that makes it harder for all of us to feel safe because how are we going to prosecute?"" she said.

What Temporary Protected Status is — and why it matters Temporary Protected Status is a humanitarian program that Congress authorized to allow nationals of designated countries to remain and work legally in the United States when conditions in their home country make return unsafe.
In recent months, the administration has suspended or delayed asylum hearings, leaving Iranian asylum seekers in legal limbo.
The United States cannot convincingly claim to stand with Iranian protesters while simultaneously deporting Iranians to a country that it vociferously condemns as repressive.
Temporary Protected Status and the reinstatement of asylum procedures would not resolve the complex challenges facing Iran or U.S.–Iran relations.","Over the past several weeks, protests have once again erupted across Iran, driven by a deepening economic crisis and broader demands for political accountability. In response, the Trump administration has issued strong rhetorical support for Iranian protesters and sharply criticized Tehran’s heavy-handed repression. President Trump and senior officials have repeatedly framed the demonstrations as evidence of the regime’s illegitimacy and brutality toward its own people.

Yet there is a striking contradiction at the heart of the U.S. response. Even as the administration condemns Iran’s treatment of its citizens, it has suspended asylum hearings, maintained sweeping travel restrictions, and deported Iranian nationals from the United States. These actions undercut Washington’s professed concern for human rights and weaken the credibility of its support for protesters inside Iran.

If the United States wishes to align its policies with its rhetoric, it should take an immediate and concrete step: designate Iran for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and fully reinstate asylum procedures. Doing so would not only provide humanitarian relief to vulnerable individuals, but would also send a clear signal that U.S. support for human rights extends beyond words.

What Temporary Protected Status is — and why it matters

Temporary Protected Status is a humanitarian program that Congress authorized to allow nationals of designated countries to remain and work legally in the United States when conditions in their home country make return unsafe. TPS is typically granted in response to armed conflict, natural disasters, or extraordinary and temporary conditions such as political instability and widespread repression.

TPS does not provide permanent residency, nor does it offer a pathway to citizenship. It is, by design, a limited and reversible measure, but it can be lifesaving. For individuals already in the United States, TPS offers protection from deportation, provides work authorization and the ability to live without fear while conditions in their home country remain dangerous.

The current situation in Iran clearly meets the threshold for TPS designation. Protesters have faced mass arrests, violent crackdowns, and internet shutdowns. This is occurring at a time when the Iranian economy is in freefall. Political dissent, whether expressed on the streets, online, or abroad, has been treated as a criminal offense, with protesters being called “enemies of God.” For Iranians who have participated in protests, expressed opposition to the regime, or are simply associated with diaspora activism, forced return carries significant risk.

The gap between rhetoric and policy

The Trump administration has framed itself as a defender of Iranian civil society, issuing direct language to condemn the regime. This rhetorical stance suggests an awareness that U.S. credibility on Iran depends on aligning itself with the Iranian people in this time of flux.

However, domestic immigration policy tells a different story. In recent months, the administration has suspended or delayed asylum hearings, leaving Iranian asylum seekers in legal limbo. It accelerated deportations of Iranian nationals last year. And it has kept longstanding travel bans and visa restrictions in place, reinforcing the perception that it views Iranians primarily as security threats rather than as individuals fleeing persecution.

Why TPS would strengthen US credibility

The administration has moved aggressively to terminate TPS designations for other countries, arguing that the program has been misused to provide indefinite relief rather than temporary protection. Iran presents a distinct case because the administration’s own characterization of the regime as uniquely brutal and unstable suggests that conditions genuinely are extraordinary and temporary — making Iran precisely the kind of situation TPS was designed for.

TPS would bolster American credibility in a number of ways.

First, it would offer immediate protection to Iranian nationals already in the United States who may face retaliation if forced to return. This includes students (who also should be considered for Special Student Relief), scholars, journalists, and family members who have been politically active or simply associated with opposition networks.

Second, TPS would demonstrate that U.S. concern for human rights is not selective or purely symbolic. Unlike sanctions or rhetorical condemnations, which often have indirect or ambiguous effects, TPS directly benefits individuals affected by repression. It is a tangible policy that aligns humanitarian principles with foreign-policy messaging.

Third, TPS would impose little cost on the United States. The Iranian-born population in the U.S. is relatively small, highly educated, and economically integrated. Allowing these individuals to remain and work legally would not strain public resources; in many cases, it would do the opposite by enabling continued participation in the labor market.

Reinstating asylum is equally essential

TPS alone is not sufficient. The administration should also reinstate full asylum processing for Iranian nationals. Asylum is a core commitment under both U.S. law and international refugee conventions. Suspending or delaying hearings during periods of heightened repression effectively denies protection to those most in need.

Importantly, asylum and TPS serve different functions. TPS provides blanket, temporary protection based on country conditions, while asylum offers individualized protection to those who can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. Reinstating asylum procedures would ensure that Iranians with strong claims — such as political activists, religious minorities, or journalists — have access to durable legal protection.

Together, TPS and asylum would form a coherent humanitarian response: immediate protection for many, and long-term solutions for those facing the gravest risks.

Aligning values with action

At its core, the case for TPS for Iranian nationals is about credibility. The United States cannot convincingly claim to stand with Iranian protesters while simultaneously deporting Iranians to a country that it vociferously condemns as repressive. Words of solidarity ring hollow when paired with policies that expose people to harm.

Temporary Protected Status and the reinstatement of asylum procedures would not resolve the complex challenges facing Iran or U.S.–Iran relations. But they would represent a clear, humane, and achievable step toward aligning American actions with American values.",https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2615305755-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:34.389106

The trove appears to be the largest known breach of Department of Homeland Security staff data. It follows the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis.

""It is a sign that people aren't happy within the U.S. government, clearly,"" ICE List founder Dominick Skinner told the Daily Beast.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other officials have condemned the ""doxing"" of agents and threatened to prosecute offenders.

The big picture: This form of strategic hacktivism has been more common overseas in recent years, particularly during uprisings, invasions and geopolitical conflicts.

Think of hackers taking sides in the war in Gaza, or Ukraine mobilizing local hackers at the start of Russia's invasion.

The intrigue: Sensitive data and surveillance have become central to the battle between ICE and those protesting its operations.

DHS directed much of its $75 billion cash infusion from President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act toward new surveillance contracts, including those with Israeli spyware vendors and Palantir to track potential targets for deportation.

U.S. activists have increasingly weaponized leaked data and built counter-surveillance tools since 2020, when the Black Lives Matter protest hit a fever pitch, Cooper Quintin, security researcher and senior public interest technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Axios.

Zoom in: Hackers and digital activists have targeted the wide array of surveillance tools ICE uses in its mass deportation efforts.

Protesters have built tools to map Flock Safety cameras, flag Bluetooth signals from law enforcement surveillance devices, and report ICE raid locations.

One YouTuber found a flaw in Flock cameras that allowed anyone to access the internal interface controlling the live surveillance feed.

The Com, a loose-knit hacker community behind a wave of major data breaches, leaked the personal information of hundreds of DHS and ICE officials in October.

Flashback: These efforts are far more controlled, strategic and quiet than the U.S. is used to seeing from hacktivists, Quintin noted.

Anonymous, the hacking collective known for attacking major companies, governments and religious organizations, leaned on louder tactics — like boasting about its work on YouTube and Twitter — than today's digital protesters.

What to watch: The litigation threats to hackers and other activists chronicling ICE's actions online are very real.

ICE has been pushing courts to give it ""unlimited subpoena authority"" to force social media companies to identify people running anonymous accounts tracking and monitoring the agency's work.

Three women were indicted in September for allegedly following an ICE agent to their home, livestreaming the encounter, and posting the agent's home address on Instagram.",https://images.axios.com/DXq8aPf4mar_sCd5WDgfEiC12P0=/1366x768/smart/2020/04/10/222827-1586557707373.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 12:03:14.475991

Why it matters: Jeffries' opposition comes as Democrats both inside and outside of Congress are lining up against the bill, which they say isn't nearly sufficient to constrain ICE following the shooting of Renee Good.

At least five House Democrats spoke up against the bill in the Wednesday morning meeting, with none speaking for it, sources told Axios.

Swing-district Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-N.M.), coming out of the gathering, told reporters he is a ""hell no.""

The progressive group MoveOn ""sent over 40,000 letters in just three days opposing any funding for ICE and Border Patrol until their lawless and dangerous behavior is reined in,"" spokesperson Britt Jacovich told Axios.

Driving the news: Jeffries told his members that Democratic leadership made five requests for ICE accountability measures and other related language that Republicans rejected, several sources told Axios.

As such, he said, he is opposed to the bill even as he supports the other appropriations bills the House is set to vote on separately this week.

Jeffries' speech came after Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.) and Lizzie Fletcher (D-Texas) all spoke against the bill in the meeting, according to sources.

Yes, but: Several battleground-district and centrist Democrats exited the caucus meeting saying they remained undecided on the bill.

That includes Reps. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), the battleground representative to leadership, and Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), the chair of the center-left New Democrat Coalition.

""I'm going to continue to speak with my colleagues and speak to my team around it,"" Rep. John Mannion (D-N.Y.), a swing district member, told Axios.

Between the lines: Lawmakers are under considerable pressure from their grassroots to oppose the bill.

MoveOn urged its members on Tuesday and Wednesday to call their representatives and senators, urging them to oppose the bill, Jacovich said.

MoveOn and Indivisible are also organizing a ""pause on economic daily activities"" in Minnesota — such as school, work and shopping — calling for Congress not to fund ICE.

Said Mannion: ""The American people are demanding, certainly in my district, that there has to be something that resembles law enforcement in this country ... and this is not it.""

State of play: The DHS funding bill is set to be voted on this week, separately from a government spending package that funds the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Transportation.

The DHS bill is likely to pass the House along party lines, though Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), an arch-centrist who negotiated the DHS bill as ranking member of the relevant appropriations subcommittee, told Axios he is a ""yes"" on it.

The other government package, often referred to as a ""minibus,"" is expected to pass the House with bipartisan support.

The bottom line: ""If Democrats in Congress truly want to stop ICE in Minnesota and across the country,"" Jacovich said, ""here's their chance to do it.""

""The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this.""","Democrats had planned to campaign in the midterm elections on affordability and health care, two issues where Americans are particularly unhappy with President Donald Trump. But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party's playbook.

Now Democrats are trying to translate visceral outrage into political strategy, even though there's little consensus on how to press forward on issues where the party has recently struggled to earn voters' trust.

Some Democrats want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a proposal that echoes ""defund the police"" rhetoric from Trump's first term, and impeach administration officials such as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others have taken a different approach, introducing legislation intended to curb alleged abuses by federal agents. But those ideas have been criticized by activists as insufficient, and there is mounting pressure to obstruct funding for deportations.

""We're Democrats. I'm sure we're going to have 50 different ideas and 50 different ways to say it,"" said Chuck Rocha, a party strategist who is advising several House and Senate candidates on immigration this year.

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under Democratic President Joe Biden helped return Trump, a Republican, to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

""It's not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people's civil and human rights,"" she told The Associated Press. ""This country has done that before, and it can do it again.""

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

""I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,"" said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,"" Garcia added, ""which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.""

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats. On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared with 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

""If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,"" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

""I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what's paying for ICE to be doing this,"" New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last week. ""The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this.""

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research polling, from 49% in March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

""Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it's going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,"" he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

""I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,"" he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

""Are we really going to be the Gestapo?"" he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said ""there's a lot of pain and anguish.""

""It's heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview. ""It's chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/0ee593e6-7d2b-425e-9b97-e69cb357d5f9/thumbnail/1200x630/ad13f972ca671ee67ef5318c936c7bf8/ice-mn-article-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:03:07.882364

At least six schools in and around South Seattle and Beacon Hill were under shelter-in-place protocols at one point Tuesday, according to Seattle Public Schools: Aki Kurose Middle School, Cleveland STEM High School, Maple Elementary, Mercer International Middle School, Dearborn Park International and Beacon Hill International.

It wasn’t clear whether ICE officers were actually in the area, and the district didn’t provide details about the initial reports that spurred the shelter-in place decisions.

“During shelter‑in‑place, students continue their regular class schedules but remain inside the building,” a district statement said. “Seattle Public Schools Safety and Security staff have been present throughout the day and have not observed any ICE presence. Staff remain on alert as a precaution.”

The district said “a shelter‑in‑place is a standard safety practice often used when there is any reported law enforcement activity nearby.”

While Seattle hasn’t seen a surge in immigration enforcement akin to that currently taking place in Minneapolis, the schools’ actions on Tuesday reflected just how high tensions are — and the effect even unconfirmed reports of ICE presence are having on the daily lives of students and their families.

Aki Kurose lifted its shelter-in-place at noon and Cleveland lifted it after lunch, according to the district. The others were expected to lift it at their dismissal times Tuesday afternoon.

The notifications sent to parents varied in their details: At Cleveland STEM High, Principal Jeff Lam told families in an email Tuesday that there were “credible reports of ICE activity in the community and possibly at other school campuses,” though not at Cleveland.

Maple Elementary School families received a message from principal Daisy Barragan saying a “nearby private school reported suspicious vehicle activity in the neighborhood,” but that there was “no activity directly involving Maple.”

Aki Kurose registrar Katie Jolgren said the middle school was notified by Seattle Public Schools that ICE agents may be trying to draw out families who were warned of ICE activity and were coming to school to pick up their children.

Jolgren said external doors were locked, and students were required to stay inside and couldn’t go to the field or playground. They could only leave if a family member came to pick them up, but it was business as usual inside.

Some parents picked up their children early out of caution, Jolgren said. Security support staff were expected to be watching over pickup and drop-off locations.

At pickup, Kate Reddy, who has a sixth grader and eighth grader at Aki Kurose, said she’d been at work when she got an email notification that the school was under a shelter-in-place order.

She said the incident was “very scary,” and made her think about ways Seattle families could be of help to others: For example, forming a network of community members who could offer carpools to kids whose parents are afraid of encountering ICE agents, she said.

That’s an effort already taking place in Minneapolis, where parents are organizing car rides and perimeter patrols to get students to class safely.

“The things we’re seeing on the news are going to happen here,” said Reddy, who lives in Columbia City. “It made me tear up.”

Parent Josh Apfel had been at home sick with his 13-year-old son when the teen got a text from a friend that Cleveland STEM High School was under a shelter-in-place order. Soon, he got another text from his 12-year-old confirming that Aki Kurose was under a shelter-in-place, too.

“I’ve been expecting things like this, so it’s not a surprise, you know?” Apfel, 53, said.

Apfel texted his child that they were safe inside the school, but that he could pick them up if they wanted. His child declined.

Apfel’s 13-year-old son texted his sibling that he was glad he was home sick from school that day, Apfel said.

SPS policy does not allow federal immigration authorities to access school buildings unless required by law, and says staff should not let immigration authorities into school buildings without consulting the district’s general counsel.

Metropolitan King County Councilmember Rhonda Lewis, whose district includes South Seattle, issued a statement praising the “quick thinking” of SPS.

“It’s a sad day in King County — or anywhere in America — when children and their families must live in fear of being abducted by their own government,” Lewis said. “I am deeply concerned about the ongoing impacts of this kind of activity in King County, especially in historically marginalized communities.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01202026_tzr_tzr_181826.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-21 15:02:51.590951

According to Fox News (whose reporters the agency brought with them into the area), ICE has already detained nearly 50 people. ICE is reportedly targeting about 1,400 people in the state that it says have criminal convictions.

Of the 50 people that ICE agents (many of whom were masked and all of whom were blurred out in the Fox News footage, which left detainees’ faces unblurred) it’s unclear how many of those people were on the list of people ICE says it’s in the state to target.

Regardless, it’s clear that ICE agents will be spreading fear throughout Maine cities and putting people at risk of detention, deportation, injury or even death. People in the targeted communities are working alongside allies at lower risk to protect and aid people impacted by ICE tactics. Here’s what you can do:

Regardless of who you are or where you’re from or your immigration status, if you think you might be at risk, make a safety plan

Immigration attorneys and community groups recommend that families make a plan before any encounter happens. That includes identifying trusted emergency contacts and memorizing their phone numbers, as well as ensuring children’s schools or day care providers know who is authorized to pick them up.

Parents are encouraged to provide written authorization allowing a trusted adult to make medical and legal decisions for their children if they are detained.

Whether you’re at risk or are an ally, know and defend your rights

If you are engaging with ICE agents in any context, you will probably be scared. But advocates stress the importance of staying calm. Do not run, argue, resist, or physically interfere with officers. You have the right to remain silent when ICE agents question you – but anything you say can later be used in immigration court.

If you’re stopped by someone who identifies as “police”, they may actually be an immigration officer. If this happens, you can ask the officer whether they’re from a local police department or from Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection.

Keep your documents with you If you are a U.S. citizen or have documentation, you may show documentation such as a passport, green card, or work permit. If you do not have documentation, you do not have to answer questions about your immigration or citizenship status.

You don’t have to let ICE agents into your home If officers come to your home, you do not have to open the door unless they present a warrant signed by a judge. ICE administrative warrants — which are signed by ICE officers, not judges — do not give agents permission to enter a home without consent.

If you see ICE activity nearby, stay safe and record Move to a safe indoor space if you believe immigration officers are in the area. Mainers who feel safe may observe and document activity from a distance. You are allowed to video record ICE agents.

Report ICE activity If you see suspected ICE agents, you can contact the Maine ICE Watch Hotline at (207) 544-9989. Trained volunteers verify reports before sharing information with community members.

Try to remember the SALUTE acronym when reporting:

S: Size (How many agents?)

A: Actions (What are they doing?)

L: Location and direction

U: Uniform or clothing

T: Time and date

E: Equipment, including vehicles and license plates

An undocumented immigrant can be detained and deported even if they have had productive lives in the United States for many years or decades.
We need a statute of limitations for immigration violations.","Immigration is one of the most divisive issues facing the United States, as it is in many countries. An ICE agent’s killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis is only the latest outrage that has brought the issue to the fore.

Facing a 30 January deadline to renew funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, Democrats are now insisting on limits on ICE, at risk of another shutdown. It may be a pipe dream, but it is worth asking whether now might finally be a time to forge the long-elusive bipartisan agreement on immigration.

I believe deeply in the value of immigration – my father was an immigrant, as were my mother’s parents – but even I must admit that the current system needs fixing. Until recently, immigrants flooded the US-Mexican border. Rather than trying to sneak across as in years past, most presented themselves at a formal border crossing and sought asylum.

They proceeded entirely lawfully, but because their numbers overwhelmed the asylum system, it could take years for a claim to be considered, effectively allowing long-term residence in the United States before any ruling on the merits. That contributed to the perception that the asylum system was broken.

Joe Biden’s administration addressed the problem by maintaining the theoretical right to seek asylum but imposing restrictions, including making many migrants wait in Mexico where they were vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Donald Trump has essentially withdrawn the right to seek asylum at the border, denying people fleeing war and persecution the opportunity to find a safe haven.

So what is the solution? Given the prominence that Trump gave the issue during his campaign, it is safe to read his 2024 electoral victory as a mandate to tighten enforcement at the border. That could involve beefing up border patrols to deter people from sneaking in. It could even involve extending his notorious wall.

But rather than destroy the right to seek asylum, a more appropriate response would be to increase the number of immigration judges – a funding issue – so that claims could be heard fairly yet expeditiously. Cutting the backlog would greatly decrease the time that asylum seekers without valid claims stay in the country.

Trump’s deportation raids in neighborhoods and workplaces are far more controversial. Of the estimated 14 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, at least two-thirds and possibly as many as 80% have been in the country for five or more years. About 45% have been in the country for 20 years or more.

The equities of deporting them are very different from deporting a recently arrived immigrant. The recent arrival has put down few if any roots. But immigrants who have been in the country for five or more years often will have US citizen spouses and children. They typically will hold jobs, pay taxes and have friends and relationships in the community. In short, the look like Americans in all but the papers they carry.

Advocates of tighter immigration enforcement justify deporting them by noting that they are in the country “illegally”. But that’s not the end of the matter.

If a person is accused of a crime, the criminal code contains a statute of limitations that, other than for the most serious conduct, bars prosecution unless charges are filed within five years of the alleged offense. Even most civil-law violations have a statute of limitations. That doctrine reflects in part the view that, even if someone’s conduct is illegal, they should be allowed at some stage to move on with their lives – that there is something unfair about upending their lives for something they did years ago.

A crime is more serious than merely entering or staying in the United States without authorization, but in this respect US law treats the issue more severely: there is no recognized statute of limitations for immigration violations. An undocumented immigrant can be detained and deported even if they have had productive lives in the United States for many years or decades.

Some prior administrations have tacitly recognized this unfairness by focusing immigration enforcement on recent arrivals along the border – a policy rather than a legal solution. Trump’s raids in neighborhoods and workplaces across the country end that approach.

We need a statute of limitations for immigration violations. If immigrants have not committed a serious crime while in the United States, as few of those being deported by Trump have done, they should be allowed to stay if they have been in the country more than five years. Immigration opponents will undoubtedly howl that this is a dreaded “amnesty”, but it is no different from the statute of limitations that already exists in the criminal law, which hardly could be said to amnesty criminality.

Why would immigration opponents support this measure? Because it could be part of a grand bargain. In return for beefing up enforcement at the border and increasing the capacity of the asylum system to expedite rulings, we would recognize the unfairness of deporting people who have built lives in the United States.

That is the right thing to do. It would be a nod to reality, since the truth is that despite the high profile of Trump’s deportation raids, they are capturing only a tiny fraction of undocumented immigrants.

There would also be political advantages to both sides. Democrats would make clear that they do not stand for open borders, which are broadly unpopular. And Republicans could rid themselves of ICE conduct that is becoming toxic as Americans sour on the idea of summarily deporting their colleague at work or their neighbor down the street.

A grand bargain on immigration wouldn’t solve everything. It wouldn’t determine how many immigrants should be admitted as skilled workers, allowed family unification, resettled as refugees, or granted temporary protected status. But it could address a big part of what Americans have found wrong with the old approach to immigration and what they dislike about Trump’s new approach.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61a2f16411ff10c24194387000942e2412a2fd06/362_0_2325_1860/master/2325.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=38db51791e51750475111a1fb8fda500",N,,2026-01-21 12:02:59.791697

Trump’s fragile political standing is one indication that the administration’s narrative is increasingly at “odds with what people see – their lived experience”, Ben-Ghiat said.","Three hundred and sixty-five days after Donald Trump swore his oath of office and completed an extraordinary return to power, many historians, scholars and experts say his presidency has pushed American democracy to the brink – or beyond it.

In the first year of Trump’s second term, the democratically elected US president has moved with startling speed to consolidate authority: dismantling federal agencies, purging the civil service, firing independent watchdogs, sidelining Congress, challenging judicial rulings, deploying federal force in blue cities, stifling dissent, persecuting political enemies, targeting immigrants, scapegoating marginalized groups, ordering the capture of a foreign leader, leveraging the presidency for profit, trampling academic freedom and escalating attacks on the news media.

The scale and velocity of what he has been able to accomplish in just a year have stunned even longtime observers of authoritarian regimes, pushing the debate among academics and Americans from whether the world’s oldest continuous democracy is backsliding to whether it can still faithfully claim that distinction.

“In 2025, the United States ceased to be a full democracy in the way that Canada, Germany or even Argentina are democracies,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, the prominent Harvard political scientists and authors of How Democracies Die, and the University of Toronto professor Lucan Way, wrote in Foreign Affairs last month. They argued that the US under Trump had “descended into competitive authoritarianism”, a system in which elections are held but the ruling party abuses power to stifle dissent and tilt the playing field in its favor.

There is no universally accepted definition of democracy. Some argue the US is a “flawed” or “illiberal” democracy, or a democracy facing substantial “autocratization” – a process that began long before Trump came to power a decade ago but which his presidency has rapidly accelerated. Still, others believe the concerns are overblown, or reflect an intense partisan dislike of the current president.

Since Trump’s first term, scholars have warned that it can happen here. But many now say this moment is different – not only because Trump’s approach is more methodical and his desire for vengeance more pronounced, but because he now faces far fewer internal constraints.

The president’s Republican critics have mostly been driven from public office and those who remain say they fear retaliation for speaking out. Trump has repeatedly circumvented the GOP-controlled Congress, on spending, tariffs and war powers. And the US’s European allies are scrambling to respond to Trump’s threats to acquire Greenland, by force if necessary. In an interview with the New York Times earlier this month, Trump declared that the only constraint on his presidential power was “my own morality”.

Quantitive assessments of the country’s democratic health point are bleak.

Ratings of US democracy by scholars – and Americans overall – dropped “significantly” after Trump took office last year, according to data from Bright Line Watch, a non-partisan democracy-monitoring initiative that surveys political scientists and the public on potential threats and erosions. In its September survey, experts rated US democracy 54 on a 100-point scale, placing the country closer to illiberal or hybrid regimes than to the full democracies of G7 peers such as Canada or the United Kingdom.

An assessment by the Century Foundation’s new democracy indexing project found that the US had recorded a staggering 28% “collapse” in democratic health over the past year – from 79/100 in 2024 to 57/100 in 2025, the kind of sudden decline more typically associated with coup or other major shock.

Nate Schenkkan, the report’s lead author and a former research director at Freedom House, hoped to help Americans distinguish between the “push-pull” of partisan politics and the “authoritarian behavior” of the current administration.

“When a major change happens in a political system, it’s very unevenly distributed,” Schenkkan said. “Certain people will feel it first. Certain communities will feel it harder and faster. And it is really important to recognize that just because it hasn’t come to you doesn’t mean that it won’t.”

The sense of alarm is especially acute among those who witnessed democratic backsliding elsewhere. Last year, a network of former intelligence and national security professionals applied the same analytical methods they once used to assess the fragility of democracies abroad to the United States. In October, they published an intelligence-style report, concluding with “moderate to high confidence” that the country was “on a trajectory” toward authoritarian rule.

The White House has repeatedly rejected claims that the president’s actions amount to authoritarianism, dismissing such criticism as “deeply unserious” and rooted in what the president calls “Trump derangement syndrome”. When pressed, the president has said he was handed a broad mandate to restore “law and order”, secure elections and dismantle what he has described as a corrupt federal bureaucracy.

“Here’s the reality: President Trump was resoundingly re-elected by the American people based on his America First agenda,” White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, said in a statement. “Now, he’s delivering on all his campaign promises – that’s democracy in action.”

Not all scholars agree that American democracy is in imminent peril. Some are wary that democracy indices rely too heavily on subjective indicators, which can amplify pessimism and media alarm over objective markers of democratic breakdown.

“I think we should be a little cautious – not that the experts are necessarily wrong,” said Andrew Little, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, whose research has found that scholars who rate democratic threats tend toward pessimism. He favors a “minimalist” approach to measuring the health of a democracy: “Is the country having free elections, and are people following the results of those elections?”

Especially worrying for scholars of contemporary authoritarianism is the president’s close relationship with tech billionaires, or the so-called “broligarchy”, many of whom donated to and were front and center at his inauguration ceremony a year ago. At the start of his presidency, Trump appointed the Tesla and SpaceX head, Elon Musk, to lead the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge.

Oligarchs typically exert influence from the outside, said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a prominent historian and author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present. But with Doge, the “oligarch of oligarchs was allowed to come inside the government and was basically given the key to access our treasury, the payment systems and data systems of a superpower”, she said. “So we are innovating the autocratic playbook.”

While at the White House, Musk took a chainsaw to the federal government, firing thousands of workers in sweeping, indiscriminate cuts that were quickly challenged in court. Estimates suggest more than 300,000 federal workers left in the Trump-era exodus, draining the government of top scientists, researchers and analysts.

Traditionally autocratic regimes expand social services for supporters as a way to buy loyalty, while stripping away their political rights, Ben-Ghiat said: “That’s how they get so many people to go along and look the other way.” But Trump, she said, has diverged from that model: rather than shoring up the social safety net, his administration, abetted by congressional Republicans, has moved to “kneecap” public health and social programs, including childcare benefits – cuts Democrats plan to foreground in this year’s midterm elections.

Even the most grim assessments stress that democratic decline is not irreversible – and warn that fatalism itself can accelerate backsliding.

“History suggests that it is possible to recover from democratic erosion – but far from a guarantee,” Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College and a co-director of Bright Line Watch, said by email.

Staying engaged, protesting, voting and supporting Republicans who dissent were all ways to contest Trump’s power, he said, adding: “The survival of democracy depends on people believing in its continued viability and fighting to defend it.”

Last year, millions joined No Kings rallies to denounce a president they say has wielded power like a monarch.

At the ballot box, Democrats won a series of victories in the 2025 off-year elections, and are well positioned to retake the House – and possibly the Senate – in the 2026 midterms. Trump, meanwhile, remains unpopular nationally – a vulnerability for his party heading into this year’s elections. A CNN poll found that a majority of Americans believe Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, and 58% call his first year a failure.

Trump’s fragile political standing is one indication that the administration’s narrative is increasingly at “odds with what people see – their lived experience”, Ben-Ghiat said. The more that gap widens, she said, “the more people will wake up”.

She pointed to Minneapolis, where Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act as a response to protests against the killing of a 37-year-old US citizen by a federal immigration officer. Instead of retreating, hundreds of Minnesotans registered for training to become “observers” of enforcement activity.

In the courts, Trump’s executive actions have been met with robust legal resistance. The ACLU, which has filed over 200 legal challenges against the Trump administration in the past year, touted a nearly 65% success rate in “defeating, delaying, or diluting federal policies”.

“We judge the moment we’re in not by examining the president’s actions alone, but by evaluating the system’s response to those provocations as well,” Ben Wizner, deputy legal director at the ACLU, said.

Despite the supreme court’s conservative supermajority – cemented by Trump in his first term – and the president’s sustained campaign to delegitimize judges, Wizner retained a measured optimism: “I am confident that we will emerge from this latest stress test to our democracy with our fundamental rights intact.”

Looking ahead, many scholars predict Trump’s assault on democratic norms and the rule of law is likely to worsen in the lead-up to the 2026 midterms – an erosion that could become entrenched if Democrats fail to secure a check on his presidency by winning back a chamber of Congress.

The most recent Bright Line survey found experts increasingly worried about political violence following the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Concerns also focused on the administration’s aggressive response to peaceful protest, the weaponization of government agencies to punish political opponents, and the president’s unprecedented push to gerrymander congressional districts in Republican states.

Elsewhere, Democrats and political observers have raised fears that Trump could dispatch the national guard to polling places as an intimidation tactic, while others worry about the expansion of ICE operations in Democratic-run cities.

In an interview with Reuters last week, Trump mused that he had accomplished so much in 2025, “we shouldn’t even have an election” in 2026. The White House said he was “simply joking”. Though the federal government cannot unilaterally cancel the midterms, Trump has already taken extraordinary steps to try to change how elections are conducted.

“Autocrats try to convince us that we’re hopeless and helpless. That they’re always going to be there, and there’s no point in resisting,” Ben-Ghiat said. But political dissidents of repressive regimes know better, she said, recalling a conversation with Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal colony.

She had asked Navalnaya how she viewed the US after Trump’s return to power. “You still have elections,” she replied. “And you can use them.”

But there’s a personal issue for just about any Illinois resident among the dozens of fights Raoul’s office is waging against the White House, the Democratic AG said while marking a year since President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Raoul’s office has joined or filed 51 lawsuits challenging administration policies since then, and has submitted more than 100 amicus briefs in the process to push back against sweeping funding cuts, military deployments in Chicago, restrictions on gender-affirming care, environmental protection rollbacks and other Trump priorities.

Raoul called it “365 days of chaos, 365 days of attacks upon civil rights, on the rule of law, and on the Constitution itself.”

“We are not demoralized, and we are certainly not exhausted,” Raoul said in front of his team of attorneys at the state’s West Loop office building. “We are standing our ground to defend the rights of the people of Illinois and the rule of law, and we’re winning in the courts.”

He pointed to Trump’s failed effort to federalize the National Guard to patrol the streets of Chicago as “an example of why to remain optimistic.” Trump gave up that effort — for now — after the conservative U.S. Supreme Court declined to lift a lower court’s block on the deployment.

Perhaps the premier court fight for Raoul’s office early in 2026 is the state’s legal challenge against Trump’s “occupation of Illinois and Chicago” by an influx of federal immigration agents.

“Our communities have faced masked agents with semi-automatic rifles who have created war zones by using tear gas, chemical weapons, and pepper balls against our law-abiding neighbors, including local police officers and journalists,” Raoul said. “We faced it here, we witnessed it in Los Angeles, in Portland, and now we watch the horror unfolding in Minnesota.”

Conversely, the same policies lambasted by Raoul and other Illinois Democratic leaders were celebrated by the White House Tuesday on a list of “365 wins in 365 days” for Trump, including driving “the number of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing into the country to a record low.”

The president highlighted “targeted enforcement operations in Chicago, resulting in the city’s fewest murders since 1965” — although in fact, the White House can’t take all credit for crime falling in the city. It started dropping before he took office, and experts have yet to fully explain why violent crime figures have fallen precipitously in Chicago and beyond since a COVID-19 pandemic spike.

“It’s been an amazing period of time,” Trump said in the White House press briefing room, boasting of accomplishing “more than any other administration has done by far.”

Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 presidential contender who has positioned himself as one of the most forceful national voices against Trump, staged a roundtable at an Uptown coffee shop with local business owners and other professionals decrying the effects of Trump policies, from reduced day care funding to increased supply prices.

“When tariffs go up, Illinois manufacturers feel it,” Pritzker said. “When trade wars escalate, Illinois farmers pay the price. When health care costs surge, Illinois families have to make impossible choices, and when Washington breaks its promises, real people bear the consequences.”

Pritzker underscored “the uncertainty that has caused more than just anxiety. It’s actually keeping people away from seeking services… They’re threatening to take something away, then we take them to court and it gets restored.”

Raoul suggested his office could use more resources from state lawmakers to stay afloat in the sea of legal battles. He pushed for increased funding from Springfield in last year’s budget season, though that $15 million boost was mostly neutralized by a decline in proceeds from his office’s other litigation.

“The strain has been a real one,” Raoul said. “But even if we didn’t have this type of administration, I would be appealing to the General Assembly to do more, so we can serve the public in all areas.”

Pritzker will deliver his budget proposal next month, with lawmakers on the clock to pass a spending plan by the end of May.

“Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop.","Three hours before Gov. Mikie Sherrill’s inauguration, former Gov. Phil Murphy pocket vetoed a pair of bills designed to protect the rights of New Jersey’s immigrants, drawing ire from advocates who had pushed Murphy to sign the lame-duck legislation before his departure.

In a press release, Murphy said he would reject a data-privacy bill because of a “drafting oversight” that would have put the legislation into conflict with federal law. Murphy said the second bill — which would have codified the Immigrant Trust Directive, a policy that generally bars New Jersey police from cooperating with federal agents on civil immigration enforcement — goes beyond the initial policy, potentially opening the Immigrant Trust Directive to a court challenge.

“Re-opening the door to judicial scrutiny of our State’s immigration policies, combined with the Trump Administration’s increasingly targeted actions against states and cities, is a recipe for disaster for our immigrant brothers and sisters and puts them in greater danger,” Murphy said in the release. “And that is not something I am willing to risk when the Directive is secure for the foreseeable future.”

The Legislature cannot override a pocket veto.

The two bills were part of a trio of immigration-related bills that landed on Murphy’s desk last week. Murphy signed the third: the “Safe Communities Act” directs New Jersey’s attorney general to develop policies requiring “sensitive” locations — like schools, hospitals, and courthouses — to remain accessible to all residents.

Immigrant advocates like Nedia Morsy, the executive director of Make the Road New Jersey, said the bills were designed to act like a package. The New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, a coalition of New Jersey-based organizations pushing immigration rights, said Murphy “walked away from his promise.”

“The three immigrant protection bills were designed to work together—to protect families not only in public spaces, but also from surveillance, data sharing, and coercive entanglement with federal immigration enforcement,” Morsy said in a release. “Our communities asked for protection, and today, they were denied.”

The first bill would have limited the collection of certain data, like immigration status and place of birth. Murphy said the legislation included a “drafting oversight” that wasn’t noticed until after the bill was on his desk; he said the oversight could have cost the state billions in federal funding.

Murphy said he is “hopeful that the Legislature will reintroduce and pass this version of the legislation in the coming weeks so it can be signed into law at the soonest possible opportunity.” If the Legislature does so, it will be up to Sherrill to sign the bill.

Former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal implemented the Immigrant Trust Directive in 2018 in an effort to build trust between the state’s law enforcement agencies and immigrants. A6310, the second bill Murphy pocket vetoed, would have codified the Immigrant Trust Directive. The directive has survived several challenges in court, but Murphy says the bill deviates slightly from the directive, putting the directive at risk.

“I am extremely concerned that signing this bill, which differs from the Immigrant Trust Directive, would open New Jersey up to a new court challenge and renewed judicial scrutiny from judges who may not render the same decision upholding these critical protections,” Murphy said. “Renewed litigation would also put our time-tested Immigrant Trust Directive at risk, endangering hundreds of thousands of immigrants in New Jersey in one fell swoop. I cannot in good conscience allow that to happen.”

Viri Martinez, the deputy director of strategy at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said Murphy’s decision was defined by fear.

“This decision reflects how Trump’s authoritarian playbook has seeped into our state, paralyzing decisive leadership and allowing fear, rather than values, to dictate who is protected and who is left behind,” Martinez said. “There is no other way to describe Governor Murphy’s refusal to sign all three immigrant protection bills but fear of the Trump administration, elevated above the will of the people.”",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/KBS_0975-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:59:45.967505

My arrest came after my participation in protests for a ceasefire and an end to Israel’s siege on Gaza at the gates of Columbia University in April 2024. The Department of Homeland Security publicly stated that it had targeted me because of my advocacy for Palestinian rights.

Though I was not a student, I felt compelled to participate. After all, Israel, with the backing of the United States, has laid waste to Gaza, forcibly displacing my family, killing nearly 200 of my relatives.

Since that time, an immigration judge has twice called for my release. But the Trump administration has exploited rarely used procedural loopholes to keep me confined, a practice now being challenged in federal district courts across the country, with many finding the practice unconstitutional.

My detention began on March 13, 2025, when I voluntarily went to ICE headquarters in Newark, New Jersey, for what I believed to be routine immigration questions. I came to the United States on a valid visa in 2016, and mistakenly relinquished my student visa on my path to pursuing permanent residency through my U.S. citizen mother.

Instead, I was thrown into an unmarked van and sent 1,500 miles away from my home in Paterson, New Jersey, where I had been working various jobs in waitressing and retail to help support myself, my mother and my younger brother with special needs.

I am not a threat. I just spoke out for Palestinian rights.

I don't consider myself a leader or an activist. I am a devout Muslim who is deeply committed to my faith and community. I am a daughter, a sister and a best friend. I’m a Palestinian woman who enjoys playing the oud, making pottery and hiking. Speaking out against what rights groups and experts have called a genocide is my moral duty and – I thought – a constitutionally protected right for all in this country. Except, it seems, when that speech defends Palestinian life.

I was spurred to action by my conscience and personal loss, inasmuch as I was by my lived experience growing up as a Palestinian under Israel’s brutal military rule.

I was born in occupied East Jerusalem and raised in the West Bank with my father. I grew up smelling tear gas on a daily basis and seeing him humiliated by Israeli soldiers. I once woke up to an Israeli soldier pointing his rifle at my head as I lay in bed. I was only 9 years old.

I spent the first few years of my life in Gaza with my mother until the Israeli siege no longer made travel back and forth possible. I was separated from her for nearly 20 years before reuniting with her here in the United States in 2016. In a cruel twist of fate, I now find myself forcibly cut off from her once again.

I am neither a flight risk nor a national security threat, as Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has claimed.

In a landmark decision in 2025, Judge William Young found the Trump administration’s efforts to revoke visas, detain and deport noncitizens ‒ such as Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi and Badar Khan Suri ‒ for their pro-Palestinian activism were unconstitutional, because they enjoy the same free speech rights as U.S. citizens.

All have been released, but their fight against this administration's ideological deportation and enforcement policy continues. It is past time for me to be released as well.

Through my continued detention, the Trump administration aims to send a chilling message: People who speak out for Palestinian rights or criticize Israel will face retribution. This is not only morally outrageous and unconstitutional; it is deeply unpopular among Americans.

If Donald Trump is willing to trample on the Constitution to silence critics of Israel, how can he call himself an America First president? Why is his administration spending taxpayer dollars keeping me and others locked up for protesting a genocide instead of funding schools and health care?

ICE detainees are people, too. No one deserves to be treated this way.

Inside the ICE facility where I’m being held, conditions are filthy, overcrowded and inhumane. For months, I slept in a plastic shell, known as a “boat,” surrounded by cockroaches and only a thin blanket. Privacy does not exist here.

As an observant Muslim woman, I struggle to find a clean, quiet space to pray. I have lost a significant amount of weight. The food is so bad that it makes me vomit. I now avoid eating it, instead opting to consume packaged food from the commissary. Despite my continued requests, I have been denied reasonable access to halal food.

Still, I consider myself one of the lucky ones. Many women come and go through this hall of sorrows, and I try my best to help them where I can. There are others with me who cannot afford legal representation. Some have diabetes or terminal cancer, or are wheelchair bound.

Ours is a daily battle for basic dignity. None of us deserve to be treated this way. All of our voices deserve to be heard. I think, too, of the thousands of Palestinians languishing in Israeli prisons, who are subject to beatings, torture and starvation.

My detention has only increased my resolve to be a more vocal advocate for all people facing injustice.

I solemnly marked my 33rd birthday in detention. Like most people my age, I have many dreams and goals. But more than anything, I long for my freedom, to return to my mother’s warm embrace and to help her care for my younger brother.

But this story is much bigger than me. It is about the struggle for the liberation of all Palestinians and those who speak up for a freer and more just world inasmuch as it is a struggle for the soul of America.

The U.S. may have moved on to another immigration crisis, but Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested last spring after participating in pro-Palestine protests, is still in the middle of his legal battle. Khalil was taken into custody in March, after Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely used mechanism in federal immigration law that claimed that the student’s actions would have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” The 30-year-old green-card holder was detained for three months, missing the birth of his first child, but was released in June. Last week, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a devastating blow to Khalil’s case: A three-judge panel dismissed his habeas corpus petition challenging the federal government’s attempts to detain and deport him.

In a 2–1 decision, the court ruled that the lower district court of New Jersey—which had ordered Khalil to be released from immigration detention in June—did not have jurisdiction to consider his habeas petition. The panel’s majority declared that these petitions challenging a final order of removal can be heard only in immigration court, a system overseen by the attorney general, who also handpicks immigration judges.

Khalil essentially has one option left before being forced to go through immigration court: request a rehearing en banc. If that is approved, all 14 judges on the 3rd Circuit would hear Khalil’s case. But not only does the current makeup of this particular court lean conservative; it received a notable new member last year—Emil Bove. A former defense attorney for President Donald Trump and the former deputy attorney general, Bove has been mired in controversy throughout his tenure in the second Trump administration.

To make sense of Khalil’s options, I spoke with Elora Mukherjee. A professor at Columbia Law School and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Mukherjee submitted an amicus brief in defense of Khalil, along with other students, scholars, and professors who have been charged under the same foreign-policy deportability ground that Khalil currently faces. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Shirin Ali: Before we get into the 3rd Circuit’s latest opinion, can you bring us up to speed on how exactly Khalil’s case ended up there?

Elora Mukherjee: On the night that Khalil was wrongly arrested, detained, and targeted for his speech—peaceful speech that should be protected by the First Amendment—he was initially detained at his apartment in graduate student housing at Columbia University. That night, his lawyers immediately filed a federal habeas petition for him with the Southern District of New York.

But by the time that petition was formally filed in federal court, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had already transferred Khalil to a detention center in northern New Jersey. For that reason, the initial federal judge assigned to Khalil’s case in SDNY found that he didn’t have jurisdiction to hear the habeas petition. Instead, he transferred it to the New Jersey federal district court. That transfer was done over the objection of the federal government, which argued that because Khalil was detained in Louisiana, the case should be either dismissed outright or transferred to the federal district court for the Western District of Louisiana.

The federal government again tried to get Khalil’s case transferred to Louisiana by filing a motion with the New Jersey district court but was denied. Eventually, the question [of who should hear the case] landed with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

And what do you make of the circuit court’s latest opinion?

The decision is wrong. It was a split decision with two judges in the majority and one judge in the dissent. Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas were in the majority—President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman, and Trump appointed Bibas during his first term. The majority interprets provisions of immigration law that were introduced with the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act as stripping federal courts of jurisdiction to hear the constitutional claims of individuals like Khalil, who are alleging that their rights are being irreparably harmed.

According to these two judges, Khalil is not eligible to file a federal habeas petition. The only recourse available to him is to raise any defenses that he has, first in his immigration court proceedings before the Board of Immigration Appeals, then to the federal circuit court that has jurisdiction over the immigration court that initially heard his removal proceedings—in this case, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

This is exactly what the Trump administration wants. The government has claimed that the jurisdiction stripping provisions of the IIRAIRA are broad in cases over the years, but that position has consistently been rejected in federal courts—including, most recently, in the U.S. Supreme Court, in Jennings v. Rodriguez, a case from 2018. In the Jennings case and in similar cases, the Supreme Court and other federal courts have consistently affirmed that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear habeas claims.

If the right to habeas corpus is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, how can the 3rd Circuit essentially take that away from Khalil?

This is what much of this litigation has been about. The Trump administration’s position is that there should be only one proceeding, and the only proceeding that Khalil is entitled to contest is in Louisiana immigration court. Once he loses in immigration court, he can appeal that to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Once he loses at the BIA, he can appeal that to the relevant federal circuit court, which for him, the administration would argue, is the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. That would be the administration’s position because Khalil was detained for the longest period of time in the Western District of Louisiana, and Louisiana is where the immigration judge issued the removal order against him.

In my view, and the position of reasonable people across party lines who care about the rule of law, is that federal habeas proceedings must be available to individuals who are targeted by the executive branch in violation of basic constitutional protections. There is a doctrine that allows for people to go to federal court and file habeas petitions when their constitutional rights have been violated, and it doesn’t require waiting months or years to first exhaust the immigration court proceedings, waiting again for the BIA to rule, and finally getting to a federal circuit court of appeals. By that point in time, Khalil could have been detained for months or years, during which time he would have suffered irreparable harm because of the Trump administration’s violation of his First Amendment rights.

The quick summary of this doctrine is this: If a person is suffering irreparable harm affecting their constitutional rights, then they should be able to seek relief through federal habeas court proceedings without first needing to wait months or years for their immigration proceedings to be exhausted.

Can Khalil appeal the 3rd Circuit’s decision? What options does he have now?

He can request a rehearing en banc with the 3rd Circuit, which is an opportunity for all the judges on the court to rehear his case. The full en banc panel could request a new briefing on these issues from both sides, asking what they think about the panel decision that was issued last week, and it would be extremely likely to have oral arguments. All the judges on the court would have a chance to weigh in on the en banc court’s final opinion, or opinions, as there would likely be a split decision from the 3rd Circuit, given the makeup of that court.

Through the Biden administration, the 3rd Circuit was considered a swing court, in that its makeup was about half appointees from Democratic presidents and about half appointees by Republican presidents. In the last year or so of the Biden administration, there was an opportunity to appoint a judge to the circuit that would result in the court being composed of a slight majority of federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Unfortunately, as the Biden administration ended, it left a vacant seat on the 3rd Circuit, and last year that seat was filled by Emil Bove.

If the en banc’s majority also ends up ruling against Khalil, at that point he would have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court grants cert in Khalil’s case and issues an opinion, it would likely have consequences for other noncitizen students and scholars who have spoken out against the Trump administration. It also could have broader consequences for noncitizens who are trying to seek habeas relief after they have been wrongly arrested and detained by the executive branch.

While this case has been unfolding, Khalil has had a separate legal challenge active in Louisiana’s immigration court. What’s going on with that one?

This is very confusing, because there are multiple proceedings taking place simultaneously. So there is a proceeding in immigration court in Louisiana, and that is taking place before an agency called the Executive Office for Immigration Review. It’s housed within the Department of Justice and is presided over by an immigration judge. This is one track that was proceeding at the same time the federal habeas proceedings were going forward in the District of New Jersey.

My understanding is that his case is currently pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals. I don’t know what the briefing schedule is, but it’s worth mentioning that over the past year the Trump administration has fired or reassigned all the reasonable members of the BIA. In 2025, I believe, with one exception, dozens and dozens of cases and opinions issued by the board almost uniformly narrowed the protections available to noncitizens. So there are real questions about whether the BIA is still a meaningful administrative appellate body.

Immigration judges here are also hired by the attorney general, but over the past year, more than 100 immigration judges who didn’t toe the administration’s party line have been fired—they don’t have any of the protections, such as life tenure, that one expects of federal judges. And in hiring announcements for what has historically been called immigration judges, the administration is now calling them deportation judges. The Trump administration is very clear about what it wants these administrative law officers to do. Lastly, the federal district court in the Western District of Louisiana has, the last time I checked, the lowest grant rate for federal habeas petitions in the country. Plus, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is known for being the least likely federal appeals court to protect people’s civil rights.",https://compote.slate.com/images/b5746aa0-0174-4dd2-8cfc-4ddea2628c75.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-21 11:03:28.146698

According to the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the naturalization ceremonies — two sessions, each swearing in about 1,300 people from more than 80 countries — are expected to proceed as scheduled, even as the region has become a flashpoint in the national debate over immigration enforcement.

The setting itself carried symbolic weight. The Pasadena Civic Auditorium will be filled not with celebrities but with former refugees, green-card holders, and longtime residents who had passed civics tests, submitted to background checks, and waited years for this moment. The ceremony itself would last barely 45 minutes.

Since Dec. 2, when the Trump administration expanded its travel ban to 39 countries following the shooting of National Guard members in Washington, D.C., by an Afghan national, some naturalization applicants have been “pulled out of line” at ceremonies nationwide — their approvals revoked at the last moment, their oaths deferred indefinitely. The ceremonies continued around them.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has “paused all adjudications for aliens from high-risk countries,” according to agency Policy Memo PM-602-0192, issued Dec. 2, 2025, “while USCIS works to ensure that all aliens from these countries are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

The affected nations span Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and Central America — including Afghanistan, Somalia, Haiti, Venezuela, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

It is not known if any of Wednesday’s 2,600 scheduled applicants received last-minute cancellation notices. USCIS does not publicly disclose the figures.

But the agency’s own data from past Pasadena ceremonies suggests the impact could be significant: at a June 2019 ceremony, the top five countries of origin were Mexico, the Philippines, China, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Two of those nations — El Salvador and Guatemala — are now on the restricted list.

More than 117 Democratic members of Congress have signed a letter to the Department of Homeland Security secretary and USCIS director condemning the selective cancellations. Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington has led efforts demanding that USCIS disclose the number of affected individuals and provide a timeline for ending the pause.

For those who do take the oath on Wednesday, the ceremony follows a script unchanged for generations. Applicants arrive hours early for security screening and document verification. They surrender their green cards — the plastic rectangles that had defined their legal status, sometimes for decades.

It’s slated to be a blockbuster session that appears likely destined for the Supreme Court.
The California GOP has already provided notice it is appealing directly to the Supreme Court.
In Chatrie v. United States, the Supreme Court took up its next major Fourth Amendment case.
But here’s what we’re watching for now: Today: The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments over Trump’s efforts to fire Federal Reserve board of governors member Lisa Cook.","President Trump’s power over the Federal Reserve goes before the Supreme Court Wednesday in a blockbuster review of the central bank governors’ firing protections.

As the president wages war against the Fed for not lowering interest rates quicker, Trump has looked to sack Fed governor Lisa Cook by accusing her of mortgage fraud, which she denies.

Lower courts sided with Cook. The justices have punted a decision for months on Trump’s emergency appeal until they hold oral arguments, which are set to kick off at 10 a.m. EST.

Here’s what to watch for as the argument gets underway:

How the justices interpret ‘for cause’

The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 only permits the president to remove Fed governors “for cause.”

The statute does not explicitly define “cause.” Wednesday’s case turns on how the justices interpret it.

Everyone concedes that disagreeing with a governor’s votes on interest rates isn’t sufficient. Beyond that, the sides diverge.

The Trump administration contends that “for cause” gives the president broad discretion to fire Fed governors for reasons related to their conduct, ability, fitness or competence.

If the justices agree, the administration says it’s an easy case and that the mortgage fraud accusations against Cook easily pass the test.

Cook’s lawyers push back. They say Congress intended “for cause” to be comparable to the standard in place at a handful of other independent agencies, which spell out inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance as the three preconditions to firing.

Watch to see if the justices agree with the Trump administration’s proposal, or if they agree with the concerns of Cook that it would imperil the Fed’s independence.

Does Cook’s due process argument gain steam

Regardless of whether Trump had valid “cause,” Cook will advance several other arguments Wednesday.

She asserts that due process protections under the Constitution and federal law guaranteed her a hearing to deny the mortgage fraud accusations.

“She unequivocally does, and she is prepared to refute the allegations in an appropriate forum,” Cook’s lawyers wrote.

The Trump administration says no such hearing is legally required and that Cook has not explained what it would look like or how it would make any difference.

Additionally, the administration will try to convince the justices that even if she was wrongfully removed, the lower courts had no power to grant an injunction reinstating Cook as the litigation plays out.

If the justices tip their hand on FTC decision

The case comes to the court weeks after the justices heard arguments on Trump’s power to fire Rebecca Slaughter, a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

The cases both involve the bounds of Trump’s presidential power, but they raise distinct issues.

At the Fed, Trump purports to have valid cause in sacking Cook.

But at the FTC, the president does not. Instead, he argues Slaughter’s firing protections infringe on the separation of powers — a broad assertion of presidential power that appears to have drawn sympathy with the Supreme Court’s conservative majority.

The Trump administration has not made that argument for the Fed, which the justices have signaled has special status that may justify its protections.

Under the court’s typical procedures, the justices would’ve taken an initial vote on Slaughter’s case in the days following the December argument. The opinion would’ve been assigned, and drafting would commence.

Watch on Wednesday to see if the justices’ comments tip their hand on what they plan to do in Slaughter’s case.

How Powell’s attendance impacts the case

Wednesday’s argument only directly concerns Cook’s firing, but watch to see if the justices connect it to Trump’s broader threats against the central bank for not lowering interest rates quicker.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will attend Wednesday’s argument at the Supreme Court, a source familiar with his plans tells our colleagueSylvan Lane, The Hill’s business editor.

For months, Trump has mused about firing Powell. But the president has yet to do so as the clock ticks closer to May, when Powell’s term as chair ends (he may remain on the board until 2028).

In the lead-up to Wednesday’s argument, things took a turn. The Justice Department issued a subpoena to the Fed, bringing its criminal investigation into Powell to light.

The investigation centers on congressional testimony Powell gave concerning the Fed’s multi-billion-dollar renovation of its headquarters, which has faced significant cost overruns. Powell denies wrongdoing and has cast the investigation as an attempt to influence the central bank’s monetary policy.

As the Fed’s chair, Powell is formally named as a defendant in Cook’s lawsuit.

His attendance makes him the elephant in the room. Government officials typically sit near the front of the public gallery, which is in the back half of the courtroom behind the bar section.

We’ll be in the room Wednesday to watch the justices — and Powell. So stay tuned.

IN FOCUS

Looking back at 1 year of Trump v. the courts

President Trump entered the second year of his White House term this week.

As his first year rapidly remade Washington, it flooded courts across the country.

Democratic state attorneys general, legal groups formed to oppose Trump, civil rights organizations and more asked judges hundreds of times to to rule pieces of Trump’s agenda unlawful — and halt them in the meantime.

Lawsuits began flying while Trump was still in the Capitol Rotunda for his inauguration ceremony.

Within minutes of Chief Justice John Roberts administering the oath, three lawsuits sought to dismantle the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) before it even got started.

They claimed DOGE was a federal advisory committee that wasn’t following transparency requirements. No judge has yet to endorse the argument, and some of the cases were later dropped.

Still, it became the first of hundreds of legal battlefronts to come.

And in the early months of the administration, challenges to DOGE dominated.

Some contested the administration’s assertion that Elon Musk was not formally in charge of the group. Others sought to subject DOGE to the Freedom of Information Act. But by and large, the cases concerned efforts to implant DOGE personnel at agencies across the government and allegations they were violating the Privacy Act.

Government unions led the charge in many of the cases. And as they would go on to do on issue after issue, left-leaning legal groups like Democracy Forward and Democracy Defenders Fund represented many of the plaintiffs in court.

And within months, they secured dozens of injunctions from federal district judges, stymying Trump’s agenda. Temporarily.

Repeatedly over the past year, the administration filed emergency appeals all the way to the Supreme Court, almost always emerging successful.

In total, the administration brought 32 Supreme Court emergency appeals. That’s more than former President Biden’s Justice Department filed during his entire four years in office.

Trump’s critics say the barrage reflects how he is acting lawlessly.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D), speaking Tuesday at an event celebrating the 54 lawsuits his office has brought against Trump, summed up the president’s first year as a “sweeping, often illegal campaign to remake America.”

“We said then if he breaks the law, we will take him to court. We are here today to say we have fulfilled that promise,” Bonta said.

The president’s legal allies push back, suggesting the nonstop pace reveals how lower judges have overstepped their authority by granting one injunction after another.

The real score is the administration’s record at the high court, those allies argue.

The exact tally depends on how you count a few mixed rulings, but on our scorecard, the administration has lost only four cases and emerged victorious in roughly 20.

Among others, that list includes greenlighting the administration’s efforts to fire more than 16,000 probationary employees, ban transgender troops from serving openly in the military, revoke temporary legal protections extended to more than 300,000 Venezuelans and parole for 532,000 people from Latin American countries, freeze $65 million in teacher preparation grants and lay off roughly half the Education Department

Only in a few cases, like Trump’s bid to deploy the National Guard in the Chicago area, did the court rule against the president.

What’s in store for his second year? Here are five issues that will define the legal landscape:

Does Trump’s string of Supreme Court victories continue as the justices begin handing down final decisions on the merits of Trump’s policies — like his sweeping tariffs and efforts to control independent agencies — rather than preliminary decisions on the emergency docket?

Will the Justice Department criminally indict more prominent Trump foes, like Powell, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and former Special Counsel Jack Smith?

Will the Supreme Court rein in judges who’ve granted nationwide relief to plaintiffs by signing off on class actions in the wake of the justices clawing back universal injunctions?

Will Trump’s rapid pace of executive orders, which now exceeds 200, slow down?

Will Trump invoke the Insurrection Act?

Alien Enemies Act back in court

One of the most prominent legal battles of Trump’s first year back in the White House returns to the courtroom later this week.

Last March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members.

It began with sending dozens of migrants to a Salvadoran megaprison. Another wave in April was underway when the Supreme Court intervened in the middle of the night to halt the flights at the pleas of the American Civil Liberties Union.

The deportations became a prominent sign last spring of Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda.

In the months since, the legal battle has calmed in some respects. It’s about to return to the spotlight.

On Thursday, all 17 active judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will convene at the federal courthouse in New Orleans to hear oral arguments on whether Trump legally invoked the Alien Enemies Act.

It’s slated to be a blockbuster session that appears likely destined for the Supreme Court. More than a half-dozen other legal challenges to Trump’s use of the law are on hold, all awaiting word from the 5th Circuit.

The Alien Enemies Act allows the president to summarily deport migrants when a foreign nation perpetrates an “invasion” or predatory “incursion.” It has only been invoked three prior times: the War of 1812 and World Wars I and II.

Trump claims Tren de Aragua is perpetrating an invasion against the U.S., and he has tied the transnational criminal gang to the Venezuelan government.

In April, the Supreme Court ruled that migrants detained under the Alien Enemies Act must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal before they are deported.

That decision leaves several questions unanswered that have been simmering ever since. The 5th Circuit will get the next bite at the apple Thursday.

American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Lee Gelernt will argue the Alien Enemies Act requires a a declaration of war or a military attack for the president to invoke the law.

The statute requires the attack be committed by a foreign nation, and Gelernt will make the case that Trump can’t tie his concerns about Tren de Aragua to deposed President Nicolás Maduro’s regime.

And even if the president did lawfully invoke the statute, Gelernt will argue that migrants should be afforded at least 30-days’ notice to ensure the Trump administration can’t deport them without judicial review.

The Trump administration will be represented by Drew Ensign, who leads immigration litigation for the Justice Department. He will assert that the Alien Enemies Act compels the courts to provide the president extreme deference.

Tren de Aragua has perpetrated an invasion “by any metric” and is sufficiently connected to Maduro’s government, administration wrote in court filings. The administration has also argued requiring 30-days’ notice is unwarranted.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

IN: Roundup weed killer, geofence warrants

The court took up four new cases at Friday’s conference, perhaps the final cases that will be argued this term.

First, the court agreed to hear Bayer’s appeal to limit liability for its Roundup weed killer, which has come under thousands of lawsuits alleging it causes cancer and did not include a proper warning label.

Bayer argues the state lawsuits are preempted by federal law, which does not require the warning. The case is Monsanto Company v. Durnell.

In Chatrie v. United States, the Supreme Court took up its next major Fourth Amendment case.

The justices will review whether geofence warrants, which allow law enforcement to seize information on cellphones online at a location during a specific time window, violate constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.

The court will also review an employment retirement plan case interpreting the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, (ERISA).

In Anderson v. Intel Corporation Investment Policy Committee, the justices will examine whether plaintiffs alleging their employer’s plan underperformed must show a “meaningful benchmark,” which would make it more difficult to bring ERISA lawsuits.

Finally, the court agreed to hear Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA v. Amarin Pharma.

The fight between the two pharma companies poses broad implications for so-called “skinny labels,” which allow generic drugmakers to bring products to market faster by carving out a product’s brand-name, patented use on the label.

OUT: SCOTUS fee waivers

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court’s juniormost liberal justice, has thoughts on how the court handles filings from incarcerated defendants.

The Supreme Court chooses what cases it hears. But anyone can try their luck, so long as they submit a $300 filing fee and pay to print 40 bound copies (yes, this is still a requirement in 2026, and Jackson noted it’s usually the much higher cost).

The justices routinely waive the fee for poor incarcerated defendants who can’t afford it. But if the defendant then repeatedly tries to file frivolous litigation, the court cuts them off.

The court did so Tuesday for a handful of defendants, including Danny Howell, who was sentenced to 70 years in prison after being convicted of child molestation and other charges. The clerk will no longer accept “any further petitions in noncriminal matters” from Howell unless he pays the fee.

“Even if Howell were to identify meritorious grounds for habeas relief or wanted to bring a justifiable challenge to his conditions of confinement, he will now be prevented from doing so unless he pays the filing fee—no matter what,” Jackson wrote in dissent.

“A categorical, forward-looking filing bar is a questionable restriction as to any litigant who cannot afford to pay a filing fee. For me, it is an intolerable one as to incarcerated individuals.”

(And also a few million more than Mr. Trump’s own estimates of 21 million from July.)
Most metrics do not support Mr. Trump’s claim of transforming the economy from the “worst” to the “best.” Inflation was 3 percent in January 2025, when Mr. Trump took office.
But those measures rose slightly from January, when Mr. Trump took office, not from record lows.
In contrast, local officials in Democratic-led cities and states have resisted Mr. Trump’s deployment of troops.","In the first year of his second term, President Trump has cited an arsenal of falsehoods, baseless claims and distortions to justify significant policy changes on the economy, immigration and deployments of the military.

His case for ushering in a turnaround rests on inaccurate superlatives (the “worst inflation” ever under his predecessor and the “best numbers” now under his presidency), mathematically impossible figures (a “600 percent” decline in drug prices) and evidence-free assertions (the decimation of maritime drug smuggling).

Here’s a fact-check of some of the falsehoods that fueled Mr. Trump’s first year back.

This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has long overstated the unauthorized migration under his predecessor and has wrongly portrayed most migrants as criminals. Likewise, contrary to his claims, most migrants deported in his first year back in office had no criminal convictions.

First, the 25 million figure is more than double most credible estimates of unauthorized migration under the Biden administration. (And also a few million more than Mr. Trump’s own estimates of 21 million from July.) Mr. Trump has also not provided any evidence of his repeated assertion that “many” of those migrants were criminals and “some of the worst people on earth.”

From the 2021 to 2024 fiscal years, officials recorded roughly 11 million “encounters” of unauthorized migrants at borders and ports of entry, including about seven million at the southwestern border with Mexico. More than a quarter of the migrants were repeat offenders. Republican lawmakers have estimated that about 2.2 million more unauthorized migrants evaded detection during this time. And a March report from the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank that supports lower levels of immigration, estimated that 11.5 million to 12.5 million migrants — both legal and illegal — settled in the United States under the Biden administration.

Most migrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Mr. Trump’s first year had no criminal convictions. In late November, of the 65,000 people in detention, about 26 percent had a criminal conviction, 26 percent had pending charges and 47 percent had immigration violations, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonprofit at Syracuse University.

A New York Times analysis of ICE arrests and detentions from Jan. 20 to Oct. 15 of last year found that just 7 percent of those arrested nationwide had a violent conviction. Thirty-seven percent had a previous conviction, with driving under the influence and traffic violations as the most common offenses. A third had no criminal charges at all. And in locales where ICE has conducted high-profile operations — Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and across Massachusetts — more than half had no charges at all.

False. Most metrics do not support Mr. Trump’s claim of transforming the economy from the “worst” to the “best.”

Inflation was 3 percent in January 2025, when Mr. Trump took office. That was far from the “worst” recorded — inflation was much higher in the 1980s, when it topped 14 percent. The rate declined slightly to 2.7 percent in December, the most recent month with available data.

Unemployment grew to 4.4 percent in December 2025, up from 4 percent that January. For comparison, unemployment surged to 14.8 percent in April 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, and it was 6.4 percent in January 2021, the last month of Mr. Trump’s first term.

Nominal median wage growth, too, fell to 3.7 percent by December 2025 from 4.2 percent in January of that year. After adjusting for inflation, real hourly earnings grew at 1.1 percent in both December 2024 and December 2025, while real weekly earnings grew to 1.1 percent in December 2025 from 0.5 percent in December 2024. None of those figures were historically high or historically low.

Gross domestic product did increase to a robust 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2025, compared with 1.9 percent in the last quarter of 2024. In comparison, the economy grew at a faster clip in the third quarter of 2023 at 4.7 percent and contracted in the first quarter of 2025 by 0.6 percent.

A White House official cited two less commonly cited economic measures — the Federal Reserve’s industrial production index and its count of shipments of manufacturing orders — hitting record highs under Mr. Trump. But those measures rose slightly from January, when Mr. Trump took office, not from record lows.

Trade

What Was said

First, his $18 trillion figure is almost double the White House’s own tally of investments ($9.6 trillion). While it is possible that the pledges will result in economic gains, those effects have yet to come to fruition.

The $9.6 trillion also includes broad pledges and previously announced projects. And more than half of that amount comes from informal pledges from foreign countries to invest in the United States that experts warn may be unrealistic. For example, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates each pledged more than $1 trillion in investments, which is more than their gross domestic products.

And so far, there is little evidence that Mr. Trump’s tariffs have ushered in a manufacturing renaissance, job and wage growth, or a decline in drug prices. Economists have said that the sustained economic growth in the United States was in spite of tariffs, not because of them.

The manufacturing sector shed 63,000 jobs from January 2025 to December 2025. Construction spending in manufacturing has also declined. Economic activity in the sector in general contracted for 10 consecutive months in 2025, according to a longstanding survey by the Institute for Supply Management.

Mr. Trump’s claim that his tariffs brought a decline of 400 to 600 percent in drug prices is not mathematically possible. A 100 percent decline would mean that the product is free.

The White House cited data from Customs and Border Protection showing that officials with the agency’s Air and Marine Operations in the United States seized a record amount of drugs in July — more than 220,000 pounds — and that number has since fallen to 2,000 pounds in December. But of that figure of 220,000 pounds, more than 200,000 pounds was of marijuana and it is unclear where those interdictions took place. Moreover, C.B.P. is not the only agency that seizes drugs.

As the strikes occurred, the Coast Guard continued to conduct other maritime drug enforcement operations. For example, the Coast Guard reported seizing nearly 20,000 pounds of cocaine across 10 days in November as part of Operation Pacific Viper. The Coast Guard also announced on Thursday the seizure of more than 2,200 pounds of cocaine in a 45-day patrol in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.

Jeremy McDermott and Steven Dudley, the co-founders of InSight Crime, a Latin America crime and security think tank, wrote in a recent post that while the military strikes had likely disrupted some drug routes, the campaign had not halted trafficking altogether.

“This has not stopped the flow of drugs; it simply forced traffickers to use different routes and modus operandi,” they wrote.

Executive Power

What Was said

This is misleading. Mr. Trump has justified deploying National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities by overstating their crime rates, and then overstating the impact of those deployments. After the Supreme Court ruled in December that he could not deploy the Guard over the objections of local officials in Illinois, Mr. Trump instead asserted his authority to deploy more conventional troops to American cities — an authority, he argued misleadingly, that most other presidents had exercised.

Mr. Trump’s claims about the National Guard’s effect on crime in Portland, Ore., were particularly inaccurate, as the Guard barely had a presence in the city.

In late September, after protests over immigration enforcement in Portland, Mr. Trump announced he would deploy the Guard to the city. Local officials challenged the deployment in court almost immediately. Emails released in court showed — and a Justice Department lawyer acknowledged — that about seven to 10 members of Oregon’s National Guard were briefly sent to an ICE building in downtown Portland from about 11:30 in the morning on Oct. 4 and left sometime at night, after a judge barred the deployment in the afternoon. After the Supreme Court ruling in December, Mr. Trump abandoned his efforts to deploy the Guard to Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles.

The White House cited a decline in crime from September, when Mr. Trump announced the deployment, to November. But even before the announcement and the half-day deployment of a handful of troops in October, crime in Portland had been falling, with homicides already declining by more than 50 percent in the first half of 2025 and violent crime down by 17 percent. Last year, the local police recorded 4,000 to 5,200 monthly offenses from January to November, the month with the most recent data available. The greatest number of offenses were recorded in October, the month with the brief appearance of National Guard troops.

Mr. Trump’s contention that half his predecessors have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807, which gives the president broad authority to mobilize troops domestically under certain conditions, is overstated and leaves out critical context.

Since the 1790s, 17 presidents have used or invoked the Insurrection Act a total of 30 times, according to a timeline compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice. That’s about 38 percent of all presidents. Most invocations — 19 instances — occurred before 1900. Many of the invocations in the last century occurred during the Civil Rights era. For example, President Dwight D. Eisenhower invoked the act after the governor of Arkansas deployed the state’s National Guard to stop nine Black students from enrolling at a high school in Little Rock.

Most recently, President George H.W. Bush invoked the act twice, not 22 times as Mr. Trump said, in 1989 to quell looting after a hurricane in the Virgin Islands and in 1992 to quell unrest after the police beating of Rodney King. Mr. Bush invoked the act at the request of the California governor. In contrast, local officials in Democratic-led cities and states have resisted Mr. Trump’s deployment of troops.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/us/politics/dc-fact-check-2/dc-fact-check-2-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 09:57:39.262221

State and local leaders are not confirming anything credible right now, even as advocacy groups and immigration lawyers prepare for the worst.

More than a hundred students at Red Mountain High School in Mesa on Tuesday took to standing up against ICE operations around the country. Communities in the Valley are bracing for what could happen here.

“The concern is that if ICE and border patrol were to come to Arizona as they’re doing in Minneapolis, that is concerning to us,” said Jose Patino, with the immigration advocacy group Aliento.

Groups like Aliento say they have not heard anything concrete about whether ICE could surge in the Phoenix metro. That is not stopping them from preparing the community for anything: Teaching people to have their documents ready and to know their rights.

“We always tell folks not to panic, but be prepared. You just never know when it’s going to rain,” said Patino.

For their part, ICE Director Todd Lyons told Scripps News their job is to keep neighborhoods safe.

“Over 70 percent of people that are in ICE detention right now either have a criminal conviction or a pending criminal charge,"" said Lyons.

ABC15 contacted local ICE officials to ask about enforcement in Arizona, but we did not receive a response.

ABC15 anchor Javier Soto also sat down with Governor Katie Hobbs earlier this month to ask about immigration enforcement.

“There was a report last week that said Arizona, specifically Phoenix, was the next target for mass immigration sweeps. Have you been able to confirm that, and what’s your response to that?” asked Soto.

“So I’m not going to act on rumors, and there’s a lot of reporting out there. We want to make sure we’re getting in front of misinformation. We’ve been in contact with the administration. We can’t confirm anything,” replied Hobbs.

But how much will Arizona law enforcement work with federal immigration officers?

According to ProPublica, of at least 106 municipal police departments, sheriff's offices, and county attorneys in the state, only nine currently have agreements to cooperate with ICE in making arrests, as of late last year.

Maricopa County Sheriff Jerry Sheridan posted on social media over the weekend, promising to protect ICE agents and arrest anyone interfering with their work.

One immigration lawyer we spoke with says it is only a matter of time before ICE shows up here in full force.

Federal agents raided two construction sites in a suburb east of town on Jan. 15.","Federal immigration agents pulled over a Hispanic high school football coach driving his players to a game and pointed a pistol at his head.

They swarmed a high school parking lot to question Hispanic students about their citizenship. When the teens explained they were U.S. citizens, agents loaded them into a Border Patrol vehicle anyway.

Agents plowed their vehicles through the high school's baseball diamond and football fields. And they questioned the school secretary's citizenship on her way home from work.

This wasn't Minneapolis, Los Angeles, or Chicago in recent months. It was El Paso, Texas – back in 1992.

The U.S. Border Patrol at the time was operating with impunity, aggressively going after anyone who looked Hispanic and lived in aneighborhood near the U.S.-Mexico border.

A rights movement gained traction in the wake of a community lawsuit, and grassroots organizers soon began warning the rest of the country that tactics applied at the U.S.-Mexico border eventually could be exported to American cities everywhere.

""We were saying: The border will become the nation,"" said Fernando Garcia, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights. ""And then it happened.""

Enhanced powers in the border zone

The 19 million people living in the Southwest border zone, which extends 100 miles inland, are under constant surveillance. They're at risk of getting in the way of the Border Patrol's high-speed vehicle pursuits. And they're surrounded in all directions by federal highway checkpoints where they must affirm or prove their U.S. citizenship.

Sito Negron, 59, originally from the Bronx borough in New York, moved to El Paso as a teenager in the 1980s and quickly learned the exceptions to ""normal"" American life on the border.

""The first time I went through an interior checkpoint, I was like, 'What the (expletive) is this?' "" he said. He had believed, until then, ""that Americans are free because we don't have armed, uniformed, paramilitary officers roaming around to verify my identity and my ability to move around.""

But in the border zone, by law, federal agents can push the limits of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in ways they cannot in the country's interior. (The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches; the Fourteenth guarantees equal protection under the law, regardless of race.)

What's less known is that the 100-mile zone doesn't just include border cities and towns like San Diego, Tucson in Arizona, or El Paso and Brownsville in Texas. It stretches 100 miles inland from every coast and along the northern border to include Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Boston, New York, Miami, New Orleans and Houston. It includes more than 200 million people ‒ nearly two-thirds of the nation's population.

Within that sprawling zone, much of it rarely enforced as a ""border"" until now, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers and agents can board public transportation, set up checkpoints and question people about their immigration status – without a warrant or probable cause, according to the Southern Border Communities Coalition. American Civil Liberties Union affiliates are challenging these actions in Washington, DC, Chicago and Minneapolis, which are more than 250 miles from the Canadian border.

Despite the distances and the agency's documented history of rights abuses, the executive branch, backed by the courts, has fortified Border Patrol ""with extra-Constitutional powers,"" Garcia said.

""Now Border Patrol, trained at the U.S.-Mexico border, is the one leading immigration enforcement agencies in other areas of the nation,"" he said.

Immigration enforcers, two different agencies

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has emerged as the brand-name enforcer of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign. ""ICE Watch"" groups in Minneapolis and other major cities track immigration enforcers' movements. Protestors chant slogans, calling for ICE's abolition. Hollywood stars are sporting ""ICE out"" pins on red carpets.

But in social media videos and photographs of violent encounters, including in Minneapolis, it's often agents wearing Border Patrol patches conducting the enforcement.

CBP is the nation's largest law enforcement agency, with more than 25,000 customs officers and more than 19,000 Border Patrol agents.

ICE, the agency tasked with conducting immigration enforcement in the nation'sinterior, was small by comparison with roughly 6,000 deportation agents before a recent hiring spree. Historically, ICE targeted immigrants who had committed serious crimes, surveilling and quietly arresting them.

In Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Minneapolis, Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino has directed enforcement operations, aided by an elite, El Paso, Texas-based Border Patrol force known as BORTAC.

It's essential for border agents to find and arrest migrants who arrived during the Biden administration and weren't properly vetted, said Art Del Cueto, a retired Border Patrol agent.

""I can't say it's a great look when all these individuals are heavily armed in camouflage in city streets,"" he said, ""but they're there for the ineptitude of the last administration.""

In a post on the social media site X, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both ICE and Border Patrol, said ""Operation Metro Surge"" in Minneapolis has so far led to the arrest of 2,500 alleged ""murderers, fraudsters, predators and gang members.""

The DHS declined a USA TODAY request for a breakdown of Border Patrol agents and ICE officers among the roughly 3,000 federal agents deployed to Minneapolis.

Regardless of who's doing the enforcement, immigration agents deployed to interior cities are creating more problems than they're solving, said Minneapolis council member Jason Chavez.

""You have our immigrant neighbors driving to work … shaking as they are holding their wheel and praying to God that they are going to make it to work and then make it back home,"" Chavez said.

On Jan. 15, the ACLU sued the Border Patrol, its commanders and other federal agencies, alleging a ""startling pattern of abuse"" in Minneapolis that includes ""violently stopping and arresting countless Minnesotans based on nothing more than their race and perceived ethnicity.""

Minnesota also sued the DHS to stop the ongoing immigration enforcement, describing it as a ""federal invasion."" On Jan. 14, a federal judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order to halt the operations.

The Minnesota Star Tribune's next-day, front-page headline could have been torn out of an old El Paso newspaper: ""Citizens sue, seek ruling to rein in agents' tactics.' ""

Border Patrol's actions 'didn't make the community safer'

El Pasoans won relief in that 1992 lawsuit, and it opened the door to better communication and cooperation between the community and Border Patrol.

""The judge recognized the boundaries that were being pushed,"" said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas. ""The way Border Patrol was acting during that era created a chilling effect in the community and it didn't make the community safer. It created mistrust.""

El Paso shares an urban border with Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, and Bowie High School – the center of the 1990s enforcement controversy – overlooks the borderline. Today, the city is more than 80% Hispanic and votes majority Democrat, but Trump gained traction in the last election.

It's a region of contradictions, where immigration enforcement is militarized, but Border Patrol agents coach the local soccer team; where a majority of residents can trace their roots to Mexico, including border agents themselves; where racial profiling is an uncomfortable reality of daily life for many, by agents who are also Hispanic.

Ruby Montana, 44, grew up in El Paso; her dad was a Border Patrol agent in the 1980s and ’90s. She recalled how he kept photos of himself posing over handcuffed migrants, ""as if they were hunting trophies,"" she said. She fought with him about it, reminded him that his own parents came from Mexico without permission.

Today, Montana is a Chicano studies professor at the University of Texas at El Paso and works closely with Border Patrol to rescue animals found along the border. She sees the two faces of the agency, the institutional biases that can lead to heavy-handed enforcement, but also the individuals who call her for help with abandoned animals.

""People will say, 'Border Patrol is just following the laws,'"" she said. ""Technically, people here illegally are breaking the law – a misdemeanor – and agents are following their orders. Slavery was the law of the land. Hiding Jews from Nazis was breaking the law. A lot of people are conflating laws with morals.""

After the 1992 lawsuit,Garcia's Border Network for Human Rights became the conduit for an engagement model that included regular roundtables with Border Patrol leadership and led to a sharp reduction in complaints about the agency's tactics.

That cooperation has largely ended under Trump, Garcia said.

""There was a successful story in the past,"" he said. ""Now the relationship is in limbo.""

Federal agents raided two construction sites in a suburb east of town on Jan. 15. Concerns about the old days of blanket enforcement prompted local Democrat officials to hold a news conference and call for restraint.

""We were being aggressively occupied in that era,"" Negron said. ""The federal government heard the community and realized it was wrong. Now they're doing this in the rest of the country.""

He added, ""Americans should not get used to living in these conditions.""

In late 2022, Homeland Security Investigations signaled an intent to lease the fourth floor of Allentown’s Hamilton Financial Center, a 10-story building owned by Lehigh County.
It’s being run by (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security) Kristi Noem, who I have no respect for,” Pinsley said.","A sitting county controller and U.S. House candidate maintains that a federal agency hasn’t paid its rent to Lehigh County since 2022, despite occupying office space owned by the government body.

Mark Pinsley, the Lehigh County controller, announced Tuesday that Homeland Security Investigations — which falls within the broader Immigration and Customs Enforcement framework at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — owes the county $115,426, not including late fees of $7,600.

“I don’t think as a county government we should be supporting anything like that,” said Pinsley. “We should deport ICE out of our building so that we’re not associated … We should be supporting our residents in every way that we can.”

Following Pinsley’s findings, newly elected county executive Josh Siegel said he would move to “evict” federal agents, according to the Morning Call.

Pinsley’s held his position since 2020 and ran unsuccessfully for state auditor general in 2024. He’s now in a crowded Democratic primary to challenge first-term U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a Republican aligned with President Donald Trump. The Lehigh Valley’s 7th District is a perennial toss-up and closely watched by politicos nationwide.

He spoke to the Capital-Star Tuesday ahead of the announcement, tying a recommendation to issue an eviction notice with a repudiation of the federal agency’s recent actions in Minnesota and beyond.

The outsized presence of federal officials in Minneapolis has increased city tensions, prompting protests, mass arrests and networks of private citizens countering agency actions. A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found the majority believe ICE was being “too tough,” while 54% of those interviewed believed that immigration officer Jonathan Ross was “not justified” in the fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.

Neither Homeland Security nor ICE immediately responded to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.

Lehigh County isn’t among the agencies in the commonwealth that has a formal agreement to help ICE with immigration enforcement. The county’s policy is to cooperate with the agency “to the fullest extent legally possible.”

What happened?

In late 2022, Homeland Security Investigations signaled an intent to lease the fourth floor of Allentown’s Hamilton Financial Center, a 10-story building owned by Lehigh County. First, the two government agencies would sign a Memorandum of Agreement for ten months, followed by a three-year lease from Oct. 1, 2023 to Sept. 31, 2026.

The former would net the county $29,250 while the latter would bring in another $111,745, according to an agreement attached to a Board of Commissioners meeting agenda from November 2022.

Loading...

Commissioners didn’t spend more than five minutes discussing the agreement during its first reading on Nov. 9, 2022 or its final vote on Nov. 22, 2022.

“I think this would be a great opportunity with the county and Homeland Security and give us the opportunity to welcome them into our county,” said sponsoring commissioner Zakiya Smalls at the latter meeting.

But only the first document ever got the required signature from HSI, while the lease remained unsigned.

“Normally, once a contract gets signed, it goes into our computer system and then we know to expect revenue,” said Pinsley. “In this case, that never happened because it was never signed.”

Pinsley reported that the federal government told him that Special Agent in Charge William S. Walker “lacked proper authority” to sign the memorandum. At the time, media described Walker as a deputy special agent for Homeland in Philadelphia who oversaw investigations into sex and drug trafficking.

According to his LinkedIn, Walker was working as an acting assistant director when he left the agency in September 2025 to become a senior vice president at an anti-trafficking nonprofit.

Lehigh County’s Pinsley said that a tip to his office following a recent administration change at the county level brought the lack of payment to the forefront as the federal agency explores a new lease past the expiration of the original proposal — which he said could be signed with ICE, not HSI.

“I don’t think we should be housing HSI at all. It’s being run by (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security) Kristi Noem, who I have no respect for,” Pinsley said. “I don’t care if they call it HSI or ICE. It doesn’t matter what the name is.”

Two of Pennsylvania’s 19 U.S. House members signed onto an effort to impeach Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, last week. Noem has repeatedly defended her agency’s actions, backtracking after initially claiming officers weren’t using chemical weapons like pepper spray against protesters. The effort would need Republican support, since the party holds the majority in both the House and Senate.

Next steps

Pinsley said he is “hopeful that we will be able to collect the money that is owed.”

“Ultimately, they did reside in our county and it was never meant to be free, and so they should have to pay,” said Pinsley. “I believe they should have to pay market rate, which is definitely above” the rate included under the unsigned lease.

Pinsley said he would also recommend that the county launch a database allowing locals to report alleged ICE misdeeds, such as the physical altercations or damage to personal property reported in Minneapolis.

He additionally called for “stability” in the nation’s immigration system that didn’t change from administration to administration, as well as a “path to citizenship” for “someone who’s been working here ten years and is paying taxes and is a good neighbor.”

“When (President Donald Trump) was talking about this, he was talking about violent felons. But we’re not going after violent felons — they’re going after grandma now,” said Pinsley. “And when they’re doing that, they’re causing a lot of fear. They’re tear gassing people; they’re using pepper balls; they’re putting on masks in American cities. I have no tolerance for that.”

According to December data analyzed by the New York Times, one-third of immigrants arrested by ICE have no history of criminal charges, compared to 7% with violent convictions.

In contrast, Mackenzie offered his support to ICE agents during a public appearance last week, telling the Lehigh Valley News that in the Good shooting, “When situations are in the heat of the moment, law enforcement has to take proper actions to keep themselves safe. That’s what this individual did.”

Democrats are targeting Mackenzie’s swing district seat in their effort to flip control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Along with Pinsley, six other Democrats are running for a chance to challenge Mackenzie:

Bob Brooks, firefighter and president of the Pennsylvania Professional Firefighters Association

Former federal prosecutor Ryan Crosswell

Bethlehem resident Aidan Gonzalez

Former Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure

Former PPL Electrics Utilities executive Carol Obando-Derstine

The US Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao’s home as a “targeted operation” seeking two convicted sex offenders.
“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said.
Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home.","Federal immigration agents forced open a door and detained a US citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out on to the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by the Associated Press.

ChongLy “Scott” Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap on Sunday afternoon and said that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.

“I was shaking,” he said. “They didn’t show any warrant; they just broke down the door.”

Amid a huge surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and the local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protesters and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.

“ICE is not doing what they say they’re doing,” said Kaohly Her, the St Paul mayor and a Hmong American, in a statement about Thao’s arrest. “They’re not going after hardened criminals. They’re going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.”

Thao, who has been a US citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn’t want to see it.

Instead, as his four-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.

Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao’s family alone.

Thao said agents drove him “to the middle of nowhere” and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.

Agents eventually realized that he was a US citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.

The US Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao’s home as a “targeted operation” seeking two convicted sex offenders.

“The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,” DHS said. “The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID’d. He matched the description of the targets.”

Thao’s family said in a statement that it “categorically disputes” the DHS account and “strongly objects to DHS’s attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims”.

Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property’s owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.

The DHS did not respond to a request from the Associated Press seeking the identities of the “two convicted sex offenders” or why the agency believed they were present in Thao’s home.

Thao’s son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin’s boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.

The family said they were particularly upset by ChongLy Thao’s treatment at the hands of the US government because his mother had to flee to the US from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.

Thao’s adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the US government’s “secret war” from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.

Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, “treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with US personnel”, her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on a GoFundMe page for the family.

ChongLy Thao says he is planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against the DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.

“I don’t feel safe at all,” Thao said. “What did I do wrong? I didn’t do anything.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82165fd0c75e3fe4f4a29f34e32e51f797f9518c/463_0_4769_3816/master/4769.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77a465c59d05240809516dd9f910cbfa",N,,2026-01-21 09:58:03.871704

Just in the past few weeks, a woman in Minneapolis was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, the U.S. government attacked Venezuela and captured its head of state, and Trump withdrew the United States from more than 60 international cooperation efforts. It’s a dangerous and volatile moment in U.S. history, one that is a culmination of a huge slide toward authoritarian practices many of us could never have imagined.

Amnesty International has long documented authoritarian practices in many countries and contexts. We recognize the warning signs and so are ringing the alarm bells. And we also know there is still time to stop it.

Trump silences free speech and punishes journalists

Over the past year, the Trump administration has leveraged multiple tools, including government censorship and targeting protesters, to try to crush dissent. Peaceful protesters, particularly students and activists advocating for Palestinian rights, have been singled out for punishment, with the clear aim of spreading fear among all who might dare to raise their voices.

Universities have come under pressure to suppress student voices, with academic freedom and freedom of expression thrown to the wayside. Mahmoud Khalil, a student protester at Columbia University, was detained for months before a judge ordered his release, simply for speaking his mind.

Despite his release, he continues to face immigration proceedings. Leqaa Kordia, a 33-year-old Palestinian woman, has been arbitrarily detained since March following a protest at Columbia University. Their examples send a clear message: Exercising the right to speak out can put your liberty and your future in this country at risk. The goal is clear: to instill fear and make dissent too dangerous to attempt.

At the same time, the administration has sought to limit press freedom. Journalists covering protests and human rights violations have been detained, harassed, threatened and, in some cases, like U.S.-based Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara, deported. Punishing journalists is a key feature of authoritarian practices, as it denies the public the needed information to hold those in power accountable, thus enabling human rights violations to go unchecked.

These attacks on freedom of speech and press are reinforced by the expansion of surveillance and increased law enforcement and military presence in our communities. Across the country, militarized federal forces have been deployed − often over the objections of local officials and in defiance of court rulings.

Protesters challenging or recording cruel ICE tactics have been met with riot gear, tear gas, rubber bullets, threats of arrests and pointed guns, deterring others from speaking out. And sometimes with deadly consequences, as we saw in Minneapolis.

Trump's policies hurt human rights agreements

Vilifying and targeting immigrants while cracking down on protests against Trump’s cruel policies are central to this administration’s authoritarian practices. People seeking safety at the border are denied their right to seek asylum. Immigrants are being detained and deported at historic levels, many without warrants or due process. People are being held in inhumane conditions, enduring torture, denied medical care and cut off from legal counsel.

What makes this moment especially dangerous is the administration’s simultaneous assault on the institutions designed to restrain power and ensure oversight and accountability. The Trump administration is attempting to curb the authority of courts when they issue rulings the White House doesn't agree with and threatening lawyers and judges.

It isn’t only in the United States. Not even three days into 2026, President Trump attacked Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, raising grave concerns for further escalation of human rights violations in Venezuela and the entire region. This followed months of U.S. air strikes on boats that killed more than 100 people off the Venezuelan coast and in the Pacific.

Furthermore, the administration has significantly altered critical global human rights agreements and bodies, cruelly and chaotically zeroed out foreign assistance, and modeled a disregard for human rights and global norms. In short, President Trump’s actions on the international stage are a dangerous wrecking ball to accountability and justice – and lethal to life and liberty.

After a year, a clear pattern has emerged: systematic erosion of human rights, and open disregard for the systems meant to protect human rights. The Trump administration has violated international law, punished protesters, silenced journalists, militarized communities and sidelined the courts.

The question now is not whether more rights will be eroded, but whose will be next. The future of human rights in the United States and beyond depends on whether we confront this crisis now or allow it to deepen unchecked.

This moment demands action from all of us. We must call on lawmakers to hold the Trump administration accountable by investigating abuses, cutting funding to agencies that violate rights and establishing real oversight over a lawless administration. We must demand that colleges and universities safeguard students’ rights to learn, be safe on campus and express themselves freely, without fear or punishment.

We must demand that the United States reengage globally by rejoining and committing to global human rights initiatives and systems. Courts must continue to serve as a check on executive abuses. We must not turn away or normalize attacks on freedom of expression and protest. We must not accept this.

We all have the human right to live freely, equally and in dignity. Together, we must move forward on the path of accountability, courage and collective action.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/09/USAT/88103821007-usatsi-27965893.jpg?crop=5994,3372,x0,y310&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 06:59:24.874419

Best, Mayor Erin Mendenhall _______","Reports have circulated that federal immigration authorities are exploring the use of a Salt Lake City property for a potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility.

City officials confirmed they have not been formally notified of a finalized proposal, but Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall sent a letter on Jan. 15, 2026, to Ritchie Group principal Ryan Ritchie outlining zoning and infrastructure concerns tied to any high-occupancy or restricted-movement use of the site.

According to the mayor’s office, the letter was sent without confirmation of a specific parcel, but was based on media reporting of the proposed location and the Ritchie Group’s ownership of several industrial sites within that area.

Utah reported among states for potential ICE detention center

The property in question, the mayor writes, is located in an M1 zoning district, which the city says is intended for light industrial uses that do not significantly impact nearby properties.

In her letter, Mendenhall noted that if the building were used to house more than 20 individuals whose movements are restricted, the site would be required to meet a different set of building and safety standards, including requirements for bathrooms, exits, and fire suppression systems.

The mayor also raised concerns about the area’s water and sewer capacity, stating the surrounding utility infrastructure was designed for warehouse-level use, not for a large residential or detention population.

City officials said any lease or occupancy permit would require those issues to be addressed before approval. As of publication, neither ICE nor the Ritchie Group has publicly confirmed whether negotiations are underway.

A spokesman for the mayor's office said they have not received a response from Ritchie or the Ritchie Group.

Request for comment from the Ritchie Group about the letter or the prospect of an ICE detention facility at one of their properties was not immediately returned Tuesday.

Here is the full text of the letter sent by Mayor Erin Mendenhall to Ryan Ritchie:

Dear Ryan,

I am reaching out after learning of the potential interest by federal agencies in property owned by Ritchie. Although I lack solid information on both their interest and your engagement with them, I wanted to provide some potentially relevant information regarding the property and applicable City regulations.

The property of note is located within an M1 zone, intended to provide an environment for light industrial uses with no significant impact to nearby properties.

If the property were to be utilized for the housing of more than 20 individuals whose movements are restricted in any way, it would need to comply with our building code and its requirements for bathrooms, exits, fire suppression systems, and more.

Additionally, any potential usage changes would have an enormous impact on our water and sewer infrastructure and capacity. The area’s utility system has been built specifically for warehouse use, not high occupancy, and there are downstream constraints. We do not have the public utilities infrastructure to serve a large residential population.

If you intend to lease the building, please note that all of these concerns would need to be addressed before receiving an occupancy permit.

Should you or your team want to discuss these factors with the City, we are always happy to connect.

Best,

Mayor Erin Mendenhall

It was unclear on Tuesday whether the two men were the intended targets of Sunday’s raid, or were connected in some way with Mr. Thao.
But in an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Thao said the agents did not explain or apologize for the arrest.
Mr. Thao is not listed in the Minnesota registry of sex offenders.","It was over in a flash.

Masked federal agents descended on a one-story home in St. Paul, Minn., on Sunday and dragged a man wearing nothing but his underwear and slip-on shoes from his doorstep, through an icy snowbank and into an idling S.U.V.

Tires screeched. Whistles sounded. Neighbors shrieked in the background. And then the agents and the man were gone.

The arrested man was identified as ChongLy Scott Thao, a Hmong immigrant and naturalized U.S. citizen with no criminal record, according to his family. He was released about an hour later without being charged, they said.

The images of the diminutive, barely clad man being led away through freezing temperatures spread instantly. The Department of Homeland Security said Mr. Thao’s arrest was made amid an attempt by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain convicted sex offenders. But in a community on edge, the operation quickly came to represent what critics call a callous and brutal enforcement campaign.

It has also has touched off panic on St. Paul’s east side, where a large population of Hmong people has lived for decades. Neighbors in the area have described a surge of immigration raids in recent days targeting people of Asian descent.

The Department of Homeland Security said on Monday that the arrest had been part of a targeted operation seeking two sex offenders who lived at the address with Mr. Thao. On Tuesday, they identified two men from Laos and said both are wanted for sexual assault. It was unclear on Tuesday whether the two men were the intended targets of Sunday’s raid, or were connected in some way with Mr. Thao.

Local officials and Mr. Thao’s family have disputed the department’s account, describing instead a chaotic case of mistaken identity and an incursion of armed agents who forcibly removed a U.S. citizen from a residence without presenting a warrant or allowing him to show identification.

“ChongLy was taken outside in freezing weather wearing only underwear and Crocs, placed into an SUV, and driven around for nearly an hour while being questioned,” Louansee Moua, Mr. Thao’s sister-in-law, wrote in a description of the event on a GoFundMe page fund-raising for Mr. Thao’s legal fees and other costs.

The family declined to comment further on the arrest on Tuesday. But in an earlier interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Thao said the agents did not explain or apologize for the arrest. “They didn’t say sorry or anything,” he said.

Mayor Kaohly Her of St. Paul, who said she knows the Thao family personally, said that available evidence showed that agents had the wrong person and were offered information to confirm that. “And they just ignored that information,” she said.

Dana Haberman, a neighbor who witnessed the raid, said roughly 10 vans carrying federal agents appeared on the street. The agents, some of whom carried rifles and riot shields, walked up the front steps to Mr. Thao’s home and knocked several times, waiting about a minute, before using a battering ram to break down the door, he said.

“Seeing this elderly man being taken out like that,” Mr. Haberman said, “the frustration is palpable.”

Mr. Thao was driven around for almost an hour while the agents questioned him. After fingerprinting him and running his information, they returned him home, Ms. Moua said.

In its statement on Monday, homeland security said that Mr. Thao had refused to be fingerprinted or facially identified and that he had matched the description of the two sex offenders they were seeking. “It is standard protocol to hold all individuals in a house of an operation for safety of the public and law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the department, wrote on social media. It did not appear that any other members of the family were arrested on Sunday.

Mr. Thao is not listed in the Minnesota registry of sex offenders.

The ordeal has been particularly painful for Hmong residents in the Twin Cities, many of whom fled Laos as refugees after supporting the United States in its fight against communism during the Vietnam War. The Twin Cities has one of the largest concentrations of Hmong immigrants in the United States.

""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""","The U.S. Department of Justice said Sunday it is investigating a group of protesters in Minnesota who disrupted services at a church where a local official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apparently serves as a pastor.

A livestreamed video posted on the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, one of the protest's organizers, shows a group of people interrupting services at the Cities Church in St. Paul by chanting ""ICE out"" and ""Justice for Renee Good."" The 37-year-old mother of three was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month amid a surge in federal immigration enforcement activities.

The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors — David Easterwood — also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.

U.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations ""by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.""

RELATED STORY | Federal immigration crackdown engulfs Twin Cities in daily clashes

""A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!"" she said on social media.

Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying that any violations of federal law would be prosecuted.

Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

""When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,"" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. ""If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.""

The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.

Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.

Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.

In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents ""knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.""

""Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,"" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. ""They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.""

Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.

""If you got a head — a leader in a church — that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?"" Cullars-Doty said.

After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.
ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities.
By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.
In just one year, the agency says, it ""more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000.""","Just 10 years ago, the annual budget for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, was less than $6 billion — notably smaller than other agencies within the Department of Homeland Security. But ICE's budget has skyrocketed during President Trump's second term, becoming the highest-funded U.S. law enforcement agency, with $85 billion now at its disposal.

The windfall is thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted last July. After hovering around the $10 billion mark for years, ICE's budget suddenly benefited from a meteoric spike.

""With this new bill and other appropriations, it's larger than the annual budget of all other federal law enforcement agencies combined,"" said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior director of the justice program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy institute.

ICE is now the lead agency in President's Trump immigration crackdown, sending thousands of agents into U.S. communities. As its funding and profile has grown as part of those efforts, ICE has come under increasing criticism for its officers' actions, from masked agents randomly stopping, questioning, and detaining people and thrusting them into unmarked vehicles to the recent killing of Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis.

A cycle of more migrants, more money and a larger ICE mission

ICE's sudden growth spurt follows roughly two decades of relatively modest funding since 2003, when the agency was created by merging the U.S. Customs Service with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 2015, for instance, Congress approved a budget of around $5.96 billion, which was nearly $1 billion less than then-President Barack Obama had requested.

In 2019, during the first Trump administration, border control officer's encounters with migrants attempting authorized entry to the U.S. spiked. Those numbers then plummeted as the COVID-19 pandemic prompted invocation of the Title 42 public health law, allowing CBP to expel migrants more quickly, with restricted pathways to asylum.

Encounters rose sharply under former President Joe Biden and soared above 3.2 million in 2023, when Biden lifted Title 42. By late 2024, fewer migrants were arriving at the border, due to U.S. asylum limits and Mexico bolstering enforcement.

When Trump returned to the White House in 2025, he sought to empower immigration authorities to quickly remove migrants and announced a crackdown led by ICE.

Under the 2025 law, ICE has a $75 billion supplement that it can take as long as four years to spend, along with its base budget of around $10 billion. If the agency spends that money at a steady pace and current funding levels continue, it would have nearly $29 billion on hand each year. That essentially triples ICE's total budget from recent years.

To give that large number a sense of scale, consider that the Trump administration's 2026 appropriations request for the entire Justice Department, including the FBI, stands at a little over $35 billion.

The Trump administration has set lofty goals for ICE, aiming to deport 1 million people each year. And the One Big Beautiful Bill Act also allocates $45 billion for ICE to expand its immigration detention system — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last June that the agency will be able to hold up to 100,000 people in custody daily. By comparison, the federal Bureau of Prisons currently holds over 153,000 inmates.

As of Nov. 30, 65,735 people were held in immigration detention, according to the data tracking project Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

With those metrics in mind, ICE went on a hiring spree in 2025, fueled by its bigger budget. In just one year, the agency says, it ""more than doubled our officers and agents from 10,000 to 22,000."" (The Office of Personnel Management, which tracks federal workforce statistics, is only updated through Nov. 30 and does not reflect any hiring made by the DHS in the last quarter of the year.)

According to the DHS, ICE received 220,000 applications in 2025, thanks in part to a generous incentive package with perks like a signing bonus of up to $50,000, disbursed over the course of a five-year commitment, and up to $60,000 in student loan repayment.

ICE is still on that hiring spree, looking to hire deportation officers in at least 25 cities around the U.S., according to a job listing on the USA Jobs website that will remain active through the end of September. The starting salary for an ICE deportation officer in the Enforcement and Removal Operations division, or ERO, ranges from $51,632 up to $84,277.

The dramatic growth came in the same year that the Trump administration sharply reduced the number of federal workers, firing thousands of employees and inviting many more to resign.

What else will the new funds be spent on?

With base level funding for DHS and ICE due to expire at the end of January, Democrats in Congress are calling for changes to how ICE operates. It comes after a year in which deaths of people in ICE custody spiked to the highest levels in decades, with ICE reporting seven deaths in December, and three more in 2026, as of Jan. 16.

ICE's increased budget makes sense to Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the right-wing Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group advocating for lower levels of immigration. He says the funding boost "" is directly commensurate with the size of the task the agency is addressing.""

""ICE exists to find and remove people who are in the country illegally,"" Mehlman said, referring to a category that grew when the Trump administration stripped legal status from 1.6 million immigrants in 2025.

The focus of the new spending reflects President Trump's emphasis on arrests and removals, said Margy O'Herron, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center's liberty and national security program who worked at the DOJ in the Biden administration.

O'Herron said she agrees with the idea that, for years, a reasonable case could be made that DHS agencies such as ICE and CBP needed more money. But other parts of the immigration system aren't getting as much help, she said.

""All of the money is going to enforcement to arrest, to detain and to deport,"" she said. ""It's not going to things like immigration hearings or immigration judges, to conduct additional review of whether or not somebody should be in the country. And that is a real problem for the system.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8640x4860+0+0/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F20%2F22%2F55db3f65464c9460c780ae2cf733%2Fap25330456653535.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 05:58:26.246797

Why it matters: Democrats largely agree that the bill doesn't go far enough in constraining ICE and Customs and Border Patrol officers, but some in the party still feel compelled to vote to fund the department as a whole.

""It's going to be a tough vote for everyone,"" said Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), who represents battleground-district House Democrats in leadership, telling Axios she is personally undecided.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) isn't offering any guidance so far, telling Axios: ""We're having a conversation about it in the caucus meeting tomorrow.""

State of play: The House is set to vote this week on a package of appropriations bills that would fund the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Labor, along with DHS.

The bills would effectively head off a partial government shutdown through September, which would offer Congress substantial breathing room as it heads into the 2026 midterms.

The package was negotiated by top lawmakers in both parties, but the DHS bill — which is expected to be voted on separately — is already garnering vocal opposition from some corners of the House Democratic caucus.

What they're saying: ""The whole fact that they separated it out is because they know that so many of us have huge concerns about this,"" Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Axios.

Jayapal announced her opposition in a statement, saying that while the bill includes new oversight measures for immigration agents and funding for body cameras and inspections, it ""simply does not meet the moment.""

Several other prominent progressives, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), said they are opposing the bill for similar reasons.

The intrigue: It's not just progressives. ""I'm incredibly concerned that the agencies are so unresponsive, and ... these agencies are not in charge of themselves and Trump's not king,"" said Rep. Adam Gray (D-Calif.).

Gray, who represents a swing district and is a member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, told Axios that ""people either start responding to things, or it forces Congress' hand to vote 'no' just to heel these folks.""

""So I could see voting against it for that reason,"" he said, but ""as far as the funding for DHS I'm generally supportive of that stuff. So I could go either way right now.""

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, an Aurora Democrat, sponsored the law that requires DHS to permit congressional oversight visits and is among the plaintiffs.","WASHINGTON • A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week’s notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who is based in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn’t violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

Cobb stressed that she isn’t ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs’ attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong “procedural vehicle” to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn’t subject to her prior order, which she issued in the plaintiffs’ favor.

The plaintiffs’ lawyers had asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month — three days after an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis.

Video footage showed Good’s SUV stopped sideways in the street and agents approached the vehicle, one of whom attempted to open the driver’s side door. As the SUV moved forward, the ICE officer, standing near the front of the car, fired at least two shots into the vehicle. The SUV then traveled a short distance before crashing into a parked car, where Good was found with a gunshot wound to the head.

Details of the shooting are in dispute. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other federal officials described the shooting as self-defense, calling Good’s actions “domestic terrorism.” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey had called the account “bulls—” and alleged Ross “recklessly” used force. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he believes the video evidence shows an “escalation by the officers” and that Good was trying to evade, not attack.

Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week’s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

A day after Good’s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn’t disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.

On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.

“The Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs’ motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants’ January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,” the judge wrote.

Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE’s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused the Trump administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in illegal immigration enforcement operations.

A law bars DHS from using appropriated general funds to prevent members of Congress from entering DHS facilities for oversight purposes. Plaintiffs’ attorneys from the Democracy Forward Foundation said the administration hasn’t shown that none of those funds is being used to implement the latest notice policy.

“Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,” plaintiffs’ attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.

Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.

“This is really a challenge to a new policy,” Richer said.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS’s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.

“This is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,” the lawyers wrote.

U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, an Aurora Democrat, sponsored the law that requires DHS to permit congressional oversight visits and is among the plaintiffs.

“The law is clear: Members of Congress have a legal right to conduct oversight of federal facilities,” Crow said in a statement to Colorado Politics. “I’ll keep fighting to hold this administration accountable and bring much-needed transparency to taxpayer dollars being spent on these facilities.”

Government attorneys have said it’s merely speculative for legislators to be worried that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. The judge had rejected those arguments last month.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.

The survey, shared with Salon by the Public Policy Polling, found that 53% of Americans believe that “ICE agents are going too far” with their immigration raids, while half, 50%, say that ICE tactics are making communities “less safe.” In contrast, around 40% of respondents said that they did not believe ICE was going too far and 42% said that ICE tactics were making communities “more safe.”

55% of responders supported the idea that the Trump administration was focusing “too much” on immigration and not enough on “on fixing the economy, inflation and the rising cost of living,” and 57% said that ICE officers “should be required to adopt police officer standards like working without a mask and displaying a visible badge number.” Just 37% disagreed that the Trump administration was focusing too much on immigration and 33% disagreed that ICE officers should be held to the standards of police.

The survey also found that 76% of Americans had heard “a lot” about Ross’s killing of Good, while just 16% had heard either “just a little” or “nothing at all.”

Half of the respondents said that they agree that “the ICE officer shot and murdered Renee Nicole Good when she tried to drive away” while 42% said that they believed the administration’s line, that Ross killed Good in “self-defense.”

More broadly, 52% of respondents disapproved of President Donald Trump’s handling of immigration, while 45% approved of his performance on the issue. Another 50% agreed that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “should be fired,” and 53% said that they believe Congress should exercise more restrictions on the behavior of ICE officers before agreeing to fund the agency. Just 31% said they did not think ICE should face more restrictions.

Students from Taft High School staged a walkout just before 2 p.m., calling for justice and safety in their communities. The demonstration was marked by loud chants and energetic participation as students carried signs along Culebra Road. ""No hatred, no fear,"" was the message echoed by the students.

Temperance, a sophomore at Taft, expressed her concerns, saying, ""ICE should not be in our communities and terrorizing families that don't deserve it."" She emphasized that her focus should be on schoolwork, not on the fear of losing friends and loved ones.

Mars Segovia, who created flyers for the walkout, was surprised by the turnout. ""A lot of TAFT students are immigrants and I'm really scared seeing the violence that's happening, not only in Michigan, but here too, we've been seeing reports of ICE everywhere in San Antonio and it's scary,"" Segovia said.

Meanwhile, a father with a daughter at Taft attended for a different reason, supporting the nationwide immigration crackdown. ""So I just come here to protest, the anti-ICE protest, because I'm pro-America,"" he said.

""I'm a veteran. And when I saw a bunch of illegals crossing the border over the last four years under Biden, it broke my heart. I support legal immigration,"" he added.

But the aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota, including the killing of an American mother during a confrontation with federal agents, has scrambled the party's playbook.

Now Democrats are trying to translate visceral outrage into political strategy, even though there's little consensus on how to press forward on issues where the party has recently struggled to earn voters' trust.

Some Democrats want to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a proposal that echoes “defund the police” rhetoric from Trump's first term, and impeach administration officials like Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others have taken a different approach, introducing legislation intended to curb alleged abuses by federal agents. However, those ideas have been criticized by activists as insufficient, and there's mounting pressure to obstruct funding for deportations in an ongoing funding debate.

“We’re Democrats. I’m sure we’re going to have 50 different ideas and 50 different ways to say it,” said Chuck Rocha, a party strategist who is advising several House and Senate candidates on immigration this year.

If Democrats fail to strike the right balance, they could imperil their efforts to retake control of Congress and statehouses around the country. They could also hamper a chance to rebuild credibility with voters whose dissatisfaction with border enforcement under President Joe Biden helped return Trump to the White House.

Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and Biden's former domestic policy adviser, believes the party can thread the needle.

“It’s not too much to ask that we have a government that can produce a secure border, that can deport people who are not legally here, and that can also respect people’s civil and human rights,” she told The Associated Press. “This country has done that before, and it can do it again.”

Immigration crackdowns have spread from city to city since Trump took office, but the latest operation in Minnesota has generated some of the most intense controversy.

Renée Good, 37, was fatally shot by a federal agent earlier this month, prompting protests and angry responses from local Democratic leaders. Administration officials accused Good of trying to hit an agent with her car, an explanation that has been widely disputed based on videos circulating online.

“I think the party is very unified in our disdain and concern of the actions certainly of DHS and ICE,” said Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. “We should campaign on fairness and due process for all people,” Garcia added, “which is being violated every single day by ICE and DHS. We should be aggressive in that posture.”

But pushing back on the administration requires Democrats to step onto difficult political terrain.

About 4 in 10 U.S. adults trusted Republicans more to handle immigration, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll from September, higher than about 3 in 10 who said the same about Democrats.

On the issue of crime, Republicans also held the advantage. About 44% thought Republicans were better, compared to 22% for the Democrats.

Republicans feel confident that their intertwined messages on crime and immigration will resonate with voters in the midterms. They frequently highlight violent criminals detained or deported, downplaying examples of nonviolent migrants who have been swept up.

“If Democrats want to make 2026 a referendum on which party stands for strong immigration policies and protecting public safety, we will take that fight any day of the week,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Some Democrats are more interested in using the issue as a way to pivot back to core messages about health care and the cost of living.

“I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for ICE to be doing this,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said last week. “The cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this.”

Democratic strategists have circulated the clip as an example of a potentially effective pitch, particularly after Trump slashed funding for some safety net programs during his first year in office.

The president's approval may be slipping on the issue of immigration.

His approval rating on the issue has fallen since the start of his term, according to AP-NORC polling, from 49% last March to 38% in January.

Juan Proaño, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights group in the U.S., said crackdowns have hurt Trump politically.

“Republican members of Congress are really uncomfortable with these agencies and their existing tactics, because they know it’s going to hurt them back at home come election cycle,” he said.

Proaño said he had been disappointed with how Democrats had accommodated the Trump administration on immigration in the last year, but he praised changes in the party's strategy since Good's death was captured on video.

“I think everyone just gasped at that, and I think there has been a marked shift since then,” he said.

Some people who have vocally supported Trump in the past, like podcast host Joe Rogan, have expressed reservations.

“Are we really going to be the Gestapo?” he asked recently.

But Trump has not shown any sign of backing down. The administration has ramped up the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota and the Justice Department issued subpoenas to the state's Democrats, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, as part of an investigation into whether they obstructed or impeded enforcement operations.

Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who used to lead the party in his home state of Minnesota, said “there's a lot of pain and anguish.”

“It’s heartbreaking,"" he said in a recent interview. ""It’s chilling to think that this is the United States of America, what is supposed to be a beacon for democracy and freedom.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1fc638c1-e064-4748-99ad-ac736c1f6f0f/wirestory_1108b6228c0f088aa85d4c6d8ce744ba_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-21 04:59:04.722854
