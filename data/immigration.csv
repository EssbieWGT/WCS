Homeland Security says Border Patrol agents had entered the Sam's parking lot shortly after deploying crowd control measures on the residents of Little Village.
""Individuals stalked and followed the convoy into the parking lot and a vehicle rammed a Border Patrol's vehicle,"" a DHS statement read in part.
""After departing the parking lot, the law enforcement convoy was again attacked resulting in a broken window.""
Homeland Security in their statement continues to call protesters ""rioters,"" saying that Border Patrol arrested nine people Saturday, eight of them U.S. citizens.","Saturday's clashes during federal immigration operations in Little Village came just days after a federal judge tightened the rules regulating how immigration enforcement agents are allowed to employ use of force tactics against residents and journalists during Operation Midway Blitz.

While the U.S. Department of Homeland security is once again justifying their actions, the question becomes whether the judge overseeing the preliminary injunction will agree as even her orders are now being appealed by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Cellphone video showed the moment Saturday morning Rafael Veraza says he and his family were pepper sprayed by Border Patrol agents in the parking lot of a Sam's Club in Cicero, just over the city border from Chicago's Little Village neighborhood.

""He started spraying from the front of the car towards the back. Basically I got sprayed all over my face,"" Veraza said.

He says the effect was immediate.

""I'm asthmatic. I've been with asthma since I was a little kid,"" Veraza said. ""So the moment that it hit me, I couldn't breathe.""

He said his 1-year-old daughter Arianna, who was riding in the back of the car, also breathed in the gas. Both were briefly hospitalized.

""My daughter was trying to open her eyes,"" Veraza said. ""She was struggling to breathe.""

Homeland Security says Border Patrol agents had entered the Sam's parking lot shortly after deploying crowd control measures on the residents of Little Village. It happened in the aftermath of what they said were gunshots fired from a black Jeep Wrangler aimed directly at them.

""Individuals stalked and followed the convoy into the parking lot and a vehicle rammed a Border Patrol's vehicle,"" a DHS statement read in part. ""After departing the parking lot, the law enforcement convoy was again attacked resulting in a broken window.""

Images showing the damage were also released by DHS. However, there was no explanation as to why Veraza and his family, who had decided to abort their shopping trip after seeing the agents' presence, were pepper sprayed.

""I'm not even doing a thing,"" Veraza. ""I'm trying to exit.""

On Sunday, surrounded by elected officials and other community members, Veraza came forward with his story. He and others expressing outrage at the way in which they say agents lashed out at the entire community in the aftermath of shots allegedly being fired. With tear gas and other chemical agents that were deployed at those that had come out to protest the agents presence in Little Village.

""There were ten cars in front of me. There were neighbors all around. People were upset. All of the agents popped out of the car, guns drawn. Did not hear a single warning,"" said Pastor Matt DeMateo with New Life Community Church. ""I thought my van was going to get hit from behind... I turned to my left. Hadn't noticed he was there. There was Bovino with the grenade. Pulls the pin. Holds it, carries it, has an interaction with neighbors and then hops into his van.""

Congressman Jesús ""Chuy"" García called out what he calls the federal government's ""campaign of terror"" against Chicago, but also imploring for peace to prevail even while encouraging people to continue documenting what they see.

""I recognize the anger. I recognize how so many people feel. however if we succumb to violence we will lose our battle,"" Rep. García said. ""If we succumb to violence our message will get lost.""

The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens.
Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there.
Despite Equatorial Guinea’s oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty.
Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration made a $7.5 million payment to the government of Equatorial Guinea as it seeks to deport people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders, according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that “this highly unusual payment — to one of the most corrupt governments in the world — raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.”

Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would “far exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined” to the country.

The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money.

The State Department declined to comment on the details of diplomatic communications, but said, “Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State. As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.”

As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust.

The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens. Immigration advocacy groups have criticized the “third country” policy as a reckless tactic that violates due process rights and can strand deportees in countries with long histories of human rights violations and corruption.

At the same time, the Trump administration has developed ties with the vice president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro “Teddy” Nguema Obiang, who is notorious among world leaders accused of corruption for a lavish lifestyle that has attracted the attention of prosecutors in several countries.

The AP has reported that the State Department granted a sanctions waiver to allow him to travel to a high-level U.N. gathering in New York in September and visit other American cities. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also met with Obiang.

Besides deportations, the U.S. is trying to counter Chinese influence in Equatorial Guinea and boost American oil and gas business interests there.

Obiang is the son and presumed successor of Equatorial Guinea’s longtime ruler. He’s accused of decades of corruption and abuse of power. The vice president, who oversees national defense and security, has been under international sanctions for years and faces allegations of siphoning state wealth while most people live in poverty.

Despite Equatorial Guinea’s oil and gas riches, at least 70% of its nearly 2 million people live in poverty. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, Obiang’s father, is Africa’s longest-serving president, holding power since 1979.

In 2017, a French court found the younger Obiang guilty of laundering and embezzling millions of euros, handing down a three-year suspended sentence and a 30 million euro fine as well as ordering the confiscation of his luxury Paris properties and car collection worth tens of millions. Equatorial Guinea has challenged those asset seizures at the International Court of Justice.

U.S. prosecutors also reached a $30 million settlement with Obiang in 2014. He had to surrender assets, including a Malibu mansion, a Ferrari and Michael Jackson memorabilia.

And on Oct. 27, ICE agents dragged a 67-year-old Chicago resident—a U.S. citizen—from his car, breaking six of his ribs and causing internal bleeding.
First is the centuries-old compact in the United States that people deserve due process, the right to protest and the protection of the rule of law.
Many who seek to limit immigration to the United States argue that social cohesion is impossible when any state absorbs too many newcomers at once.
Immigrants are woven into American life as our neighbors, our fellow worshipers, our friends and family.","“States have the right and the duty to protect their borders.” These words came not from President Trump, or any other American politician, but from Pope Leo XIV on Oct. 23. That recognition provides the rationale for nations to protect the basic rights and way of life of their citizens—and also recognizes the enormous stresses on social and physical infrastructure that open borders can produce. But the assertion of that standard was followed by an appeal to human conscience that every American needs to hear. This right of every nation to secure its borders, Pope Leo said, “should be balanced by the moral obligation to provide refuge.”

The pope said that many nations are ignoring this moral obligation: “Ever more inhuman measures are being adopted—even celebrated politically—that treat these ‘undesirables’ as if they were garbage and not human beings.”

It was a clear reference to the migration policies of the developed nations of the world, including the United States, a nation that still displays on its most revered monument words that our ancestors—refugees—saw as a balm and a promise: “Give me your tired, your poor,/ Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”

The pope’s words came during yet another day of violence and confrontation on the streets of the United States, where the masked agents of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency continue a crusade of intimidation, terrorizing residents in cities across the country. On Oct. 8, millions of Americans saw the image of an ICE agent firing a pepper-spray projectile directly into the face of a Christian pastor who was advocating for those bearing the brunt of ICE actions in Chicago, a city recently singled out by Mr. Trump as “a hellhole” in need of federal intervention. And on Oct. 27, ICE agents dragged a 67-year-old Chicago resident—a U.S. citizen—from his car, breaking six of his ribs and causing internal bleeding. The incident occurred during an ICE raid on a children’s Halloween parade.

Those recorded acts of violence have been accompanied over the past few months by many more unseen and completely unnecessary violations of human dignity and American law by agents of ICE and other government agencies against both new migrants and longtime American citizens.

The words of Pope Leo—and the fundamental promise of America inscribed at the feet of the Statue of Liberty—are also under attack in that violence. So, too, are two traditions. First is the centuries-old compact in the United States that people deserve due process, the right to protest and the protection of the rule of law. The second is the internationally recognized right stated in the United Nations Global Compact on Migration (from which the United States withdrew during the first Trump administration) that migrants “are entitled to the same universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, which must be respected, protected and fulfilled at all times.”

They are not “garbage”; they are not vermin to be eradicated; they are not the enemy. They are here in the United States seeking the same rights of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” with which we are all endowed by our creator.

Where did we go wrong?

When did the notion that we should protect our borders and regulate immigration devolve into a determination to unleash anonymous masked agents pulling people from cars, and to publicly celebrate the creation of true hellholes like the Alligator Alcatraz detention facility?

The Trump administration would have us believe that migrants are here to steal American jobs, to commit crime, to pollute our unique way of life. These are in some cases the same tropes used by Nazi criminals whom Americans died to overthrow in World War II. They are also an echo of the ugliest instincts of human nature. And they are, at their core, sentiments that are un-American, ones that betray our heritage as they also betray the words of the Gospel.

Americans now hear and see stories on a daily basis about people detained by ICE, both residents and visitors to the United States, who are held without a charge for weeks, and stories of those who have sought to obey American jurisprudence being seized outside the very courtrooms they were summoned to in observance of the law.

The positive contributions of immigrants to the United States are being deliberately denigrated, even as citizens reap the bounty of their work in industries where Americans simply will not toil under current conditions: agriculture, manual labor and in the many other industries that contribute to our national economic output and the necessities of daily life. No one, for example, has offered an alternative to the current economic system that orders our nation’s farm life, from the breadbaskets of California to the processing plants of the Midwest. Far from compensating our agricultural workers (42 percent of whom are undocumented) with a living wage and a chance at upward mobility, our politicians are terrorizing them, telling them they are not welcome while pretending the sweat of their brows is not what keeps our economy and society robust.

People of faith across the country have stood up for these least in the past few months, often with admirable tenacity and courage, but we need to do more. The Gospel mandates it, to say nothing of history and economic reality.

On a practical level, we have also created a situation in many cities where the supposed forces of law and order are creating chaos, a classic example of setting fires to claim credit for putting them out. The public scenes provoked by ICE agents have been used in several cases by Mr. Trump to justify the deployment of National Guard troops to cities to restore order—actions that have been opposed in almost every case by the governors and mayors tasked with local governance.

Many who seek to limit immigration to the United States argue that social cohesion is impossible when any state absorbs too many newcomers at once. The response of terrorizing communities with inhumane immigration enforcement, however, demonstrates the moral blindness of this claim. It is not undocumented immigrants who threaten social cohesion in our cities, but rather the tactic of forcing them to choose between self-deportation or living in fear of arrest and detention.

Immigrants are woven into American life as our neighbors, our fellow worshipers, our friends and family. As the past months have amply demonstrated, it is not possible to target immigrants en masse without also targeting the communities of which they are an integral part. In that sense, the immoral and violent tactics presently being used for immigration enforcement are a true reflection of the goals at which they aim. They are also a compelling argument for why such goals are a betrayal of not only American values but also of the Gospel.

WASHINGTON – Earlier this month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested a criminal illegal alien who is a confirmed member of the 18th Street Gang, a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), and was on El Salvador’s most wanted gang members’ list.

Antonio Israel Lazo-Quintanilla was arrested by ICE in October. While technically his only crime in the United States is driving without a license, this illegal alien is wanted in El Salvador for aggravated homicide, extortion, possession of drugs, and a litany of other felonies.

70% of the illegal aliens arrested by ICE have been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. But this statistic doesn’t even count gang members, terrorists, human rights abusers, and foreign fugitives who lack a rap sheet in the U.S.

“70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the United States,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “This gang member on El Salvador’s most wanted list is a perfect example of ICE targeting the worst of the worst.

SENATE SHUTDOWN DEAL: Senators have reached a tentative bipartisan agreement to end the government shutdown, sources with knowledge of the details said. The proposal would advance three full-year spending bills for certain agencies and a short-term measure to fund the rest of the government at current spending levels through Jan. 30.

TRUMP ISSUES 2020 PARDONS: President Donald Trump pardoned Rudy Giuliani and dozens of others involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the Justice Department’s pardon attorney, Ed Marin, said late last night.

Jeffries vows to continue fight over health care costs when the House receives the bill to reopen government from the Senate

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.,said House Democrats will “continue to wage this fight” over health care costs when the Senate sends the amended short-term government spending bill back to the House, adding that the eight Democratic senators who voted with Republicans last night to take up the measure owe their constituents an explanation.

“I’m not going to explain what a handful of Senate Democrats have decided to do, that’s their explanation to offer to the American people,” Jeffries told reporters. “What we’re going to continue to do as House Democrats, partnered with our allies throughout America, is to wage the fight.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders endorses Minnesota Lt. Gov Peggy Flanagan for Senate

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is endorsing Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan for retiring Democratic Sen. Tina Smith's seat.

Flanagan, who serves as lieutenant governor under Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, wrote in a post on X, ""@BernieSanders has fought for working families since Day One. He’s built a movement that is taking on special interests and fighting for an economy that works for everyone. I’m honored to have earned his endorsement of my campaign for US Senate.""

The independent senator reposted Flanagan's message on Instagram.

Sanders said in a statement provided to The New York Times that Flanagan has “the guts to stand up for working people against the billionaires and the corporate interests.”

Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., is the other candidate running in the Democratic Senate primary in Minnesota next year.

Sanders' endorsement of Flanagan came as he has expressed opposition to a deal to end the government shutdown that a group of Senate Democrats decided to advance last night.

In a post on X yesterday, Craig slammed the agreement as well because it doesn't guarantee any extensions to expiring Obamacare subsidies and said she plans to vote against it.

Supreme Court skeptical of Rastafarian man’s religious rights claim

The Supreme Court appeared unlikely this morning to allow a devout Rastafarian to bring a damages claim against Louisiana prison officials who cut his dreadlocks in violation of his religious rights.

Based on the morning argument, a majority of the justices did not appear to think Congress specifically allowed for state officials to be sued under a federal law called the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is often solicitous toward religious claims, although the bulk of recent cases have involved cases brought by conservative Christians.

Johnson tells lawmakers the House could vote on a bill to reopen government on Wednesday

Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., laid out a potential timetable for the House schedule this week, including a vote on a government funding bill, during a conference call with House Republicans this morning, four sources on the call said.

Johnson said he’s hoping to vote as soon as Wednesday on the Senate’s deal to re-open the government, although that will depend on how quickly the Senate is able to move, the sources said. Although the vote timing is fluid, members were encouraged on the call to start getting back to Washington as soon as possible given the air travel delays.

The speaker also vowed that before the House votes, he will swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, D-Ariz., who won a special election on Sept. 23. Following her swearing-in, the House will then vote on a rule for the Senate deal, followed by final passage, and then the House will leave town again, Johnson told members on the call.

While the vote is expected to be tight, and leadership is still in the process of doing a whip check, Johnson expressed confidence that they would be able to pass the Senate’s government funding package, the sources said.

N.Y. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani selects key aide and de Blasio alum for 2 top posts

Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani named his appointments for key administration roles this morning, tapping campaign manager Elle Bisgaard-Church as chief of staff and public service veteran Dean Fuleihan for deputy mayor.

Fuleihan, who has decades of experience in New York politics, is a more conventional choice for a top post. He was director of New York City's Office of Management and Budget under Mayor Bill de Blasio and served as de Blasio's first deputy mayor from 2018 to 2021.

""I will turn to Dean for council, not only for his wealth of managerial experience, but also because of the similarity between our visions for this city,"" Mamdani said.

Bisgaard-Church managed Mamdani's primary and general election campaigns. She also worked as his chief of staff during his time as a state representative in Albany, N.Y.

""Few have played a more central role in this movement, or in every victory we achieved together in the assembly than Elle,"" Mamdani said. ""Together, alongside Dean, she will be responsible for ensuring that our commitment to excellence remains inviolable.""

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman will not run for re-election

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., announced she will not run for re-election in 2026 after her sixth term concludes.

Watson Coleman, 80, was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2014 making her the first African American woman from New Jersey to do so, her office noted in a news release. Before being elected to Congress, she served as majority leader of the New Jersey General Assembly.

In a statement, Watson Coleman said she made the decision after much reflection and conversations with her family.

""I have always stood on the frontlines in the fight for principled progressive policies and my work has centered on the belief that there must be a floor below which we should never allow any child, family, or person to fall,"" she said, adding that her legislative record on issues such as criminal justice, health care, poverty and the economy reflected those priorities.

""I hope we will see, in this district and districts across the nation, representatives who, in the words of my dear former colleague and friend, Congressman John Lewis, stand ready to, 'Get in good trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America,'” she said.

Trump criticizes air traffic controllers who took time off during the shutdown

In a post to Truth Social, Trump slammed air traffic controllers who took time off during the shutdown and also recommended bonuses for those who stayed on the job.

""For those Air Traffic Controllers who were GREAT PATRIOTS, and didn’t take ANY TIME OFF for the 'Democrat Shutdown Hoax,' I will be recommending a BONUS of $10,000 per person for distinguished service to our Country,"" Trump said in a post.

""For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,"" he added.

Trump said those who took days off ""will have a negative mark, at least in my mind, against your record,"" and encouraged those who might want to leave their jobs, saying, ""please do not hesitate to do so, with NO payment or severance of any kind.""

The Federal Aviation Administration had a shortage of air traffic controllers before the shutdown, which has caused flight delays and cancellations across the nation.

Johnson urges House members to travel to D.C. for a shutdown vote

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., this morning urged House members to begin traveling back to D.C. to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Johnson said he would issue an official 36-hour notice before votes in the House.

“There’ll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us,” Johnson said of the work to be done when the House returns.

The House could have stayed in session during the shutdown, which is now the longest in U.S. history, but he chose to designate every week since Sept. 19 a district work period.

Senators reached a bipartisan agreement yesterday to advance a bill that would end the shutdown, NBC has reported.

6 killed in U.S. strikes on 2 more alleged drug boats in eastern Pacific

U.S. forces struck two more boats allegedly operated by drug cartels in the eastern Pacific yesterday, killing six people, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement.

The latest in a string of similar operations against what the U.S. government calls “designated terrorist organizations,” the two strikes were carried out in international waters and three men were aboard each vessel, Hegseth said.

“These vessels were known by our intelligence to be associated with illicit narcotics smuggling, were carrying narcotics, and were transiting along a known narco-trafficking transit route in the Eastern Pacific,” Hegseth said on X.

China suspends port fees on U.S. ships as tensions ease

China announced today that it has dropped countermeasures on U.S.-linked vessels for a year as trade tensions ease between Washington and Beijing.

Effective at 12:01 ET today, the Chinese Transport Ministry suspended its port fees and investigations related to American ships following the U.S. move to pause investigations into China’s maritime industry.

The suspension was part of a consensus reached by U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators in Kuala Lumpur last month, the ministry said.

Beijing also dropped sanctions targeting five U.S. subsidiaries of the South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean.

Trump's attorneys demand BBC issue a retraction, threaten to sue

Trump's attorneys sent a letter to the British Broadcasting Corp. over the weekend demanding a retraction and threatening to seek $1 billion in damages from the broadcaster.

The move comes amid a growing controversy over edits to the president’s infamous Jan. 6 ellipse speech in a documentary that aired on the BBC. Two top BBC executives have already resigned.

The White House referred NBC News' request for comment to an outside legal team.

“The BBC defamed President Trump by intentionally and deceitfully editing its documentary in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election,” a spokesman for the president’s outside legal team told NBC News. “President Trump will continue to hold accountable those who traffic in lies, deception, and fake news.”

A BBC spokesperson told NBC News, “We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.”

Critics have framed the BBC's edits of Trump's Jan. 6 speech as misleading and criticized the decision to cut a portion of the president's speech when he told supporters to protest peacefully.

BBC Director General Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness left the company.

Turness said in a letter to staff members that she was stepping down because ""leaders need to be fully accountable.""

""While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,"" Turness said.

Supreme Court to weigh imposing new limits on mail-in ballots in a major election case

Taking up a contentious election issue with nationwide implications, the Supreme Court this morning agreed to consider whether federal law bars states from counting mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day.

The case pits Republican-led Mississippi, defending its election law that allows for mail-in ballots received after Election Day to be counted, against the Republican National Committee and the state’s own Republican Party. The Libertarian Party of Mississippi also joined the challenge in opposing the law.

If the RNC’s argument were applied nationwide, it would upend election law in many states, which count ballots that come in after an election as long as they were postmarked on time. Many of those laws were designed to ensure that overseas military members who submit ballots from afar have their votes counted.

Supreme Court rejects long-shot effort to overturn same-sex marriage ruling

The Supreme Court this morning turned away a long-shot attempt to overturn the landmark 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

Without comment, the justices rejected an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a former county clerk in Kentucky who was sued in 2015 for refusing to issue marriage licenses because of her opposition to same-sex marriage based on her religious beliefs.

Her latest appeal in the case, brought a decade later, had attracted considerable attention amid fears that the court could overturn the 2015 same-sex marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges, in the aftermath of the 2022 ruling that overturned the landmark abortion rights decision, Roe v. Wade.

Supreme Court weighs Rastafarian man’s religious rights claim over shorn dreadlocks

The Supreme Court will hear arguments today on whether a devout Rastafarian can bring a damages claim against Louisiana prison officials who cut his dreadlocks in violation of his religious rights.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is often solicitous toward religious claims, although the bulk of recent cases have involved cases brought by conservative Christians.

Prior to the 2020 incident at the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center, Damon Landor had not cut his hair for almost 20 years, following a practice known as “the Nazarite vow.”

Democrats seek investigation into agency messages blaming Democrats for the shutdown

A group of Senate Democrats is pushing for an investigation into the Trump administration’s use of federal agency websites and emails to post partisan messages blaming Democrats for the government shutdown.

In a letter obtained by NBC News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other Democrats are asking the Government Accountability Office to open a probe into whether the political messages violated federal appropriations laws.

The lawmakers point specifically to a rule that prohibits the executive branch from using funds for “purely partisan” purposes. They are asking for more information from the GAO to see if several agencies violated laws that pertain to ethics and partisan political activity.

Senators advance tentative deal to end the government shutdown

Senators struck an agreement Sunday, projecting confidence that it will be sufficient to end the lengthy U.S. government shutdown, three sources with direct knowledge of the details told NBC News.

The agreement, reached by a group of Democrats who teamed up with Republicans, cleared the first hurdle on a vote of 60-40 to advance in a late-night Senate vote. If it’s approved, it would then need to pass the House and gain Trump’s signature to become law and reopen the government.

Even if it has enough support to clear those hurdles, the process is expected to take days.

Nonprofit civil rights organization Faith in Action East Bay, based in Alameda and Contra Costa counties, organized the afternoon march to denounce what they see as illegal and immoral racial profiling, separation of families, and violation of detention rights. They advocated for the departure of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents from the Bay Area.

Marchers gathered outside the federal San Francisco Immigration Court before walking half a mile to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services building.

The steady beat of a drum played while the group continuously sang a hymn that switched between the names of different deities, demonstrating the presence of several faith groups.

Rabbi Allan Berkowitz helped organize the walk and spoke about what he believes is a gross violation of human rights and dignity.

“Every single faith tradition represented today carries values and messages that people matter,” said Berkowitz. “What unites us is the commitment to preserve the sanctity of every human being.”

Berkowitz likened the actions of today’s clergy against President Donald Trump’s administration as a similar action by previous faith leaders, such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

“Very often it’s clergy who show the moral courage and show the moral leadership to stand up to dictators and stand up to oppression,” said Berkowitz.

After arriving outside of the USCIS building, the group set up a vigil across the street. Organizers and San Francisco police shut down half the street to accommodate the large crowd.

The Rev. Deborah Lee, co-executive director of the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, denounced the activities going on within the federal building.

“Today, this is a place of arrest, of kidnappings, family separation. This is a point of captivity, a point of no return into the web of detention centers, exile and deportation, sometimes to third-party countries,” said Lee.

Growing numbers of detainees

The Migration Policy Institute, an independent nonprofit that tracks immigration data and policies, estimated over 60,000 people were being detained by the Trump administration as of late August. In comparison, there were nearly 40,000 people detained when former President Joe Biden left office in January.

According to the Deportation Data Project, a team made up of professors and students across the University of California system, over 2,000 individuals in the San Francisco area alone have been detained by ICE since the start of the Trump administration.

The project noted, however, they do not expect new data to be released during the government shutdown, potentially drastically undercounting the number of detentions.

The Rev. Katie Choy-Wong spoke to the crowd about her grandparents’ experiences as undocumented Chinese migrants who faced prejudice and bias when arriving to the Bay Area. She offered a prayer to all people involved in the immigration enforcement system, including the officials, in a hope their minds would change.

“Help us to support our brothers and sisters being detained, deported, dehumanized, demoralized, not only support them in our prayers, but in a tangible way,” said Choy-Wong. “We pray that (government officials) look into their own conscience. We pray, oh God, that they treat people with respect, decency and nonviolence. We pray that they use their capacity to fight injustice from within.”

When asked whether he had glimmers of hope for the future, Berkowitz said the results of Tuesday’s elections in favor of Democratic policies was something that gave him hope.

“I think Tuesday was a sign, a reminder that there is reason to hope and that there are good people out there, and there are people taking a stand and saying, ‘We can do better, and we must do better as a society,’” said Berkowitz.",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LNM-20251107-ICEWALK-02.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-10 14:00:56.009964

Effective October 30, 2025, most employment authorization document (EAD) renewal applications that previously qualified for the 540-day automatic extension will no longer receive this benefit. However, applications filed before October 30, 2025, will remain unaffected by this change.

This policy shift marks a significant departure from previous DHS practices and could impact thousands of workers and employers who rely on extended work authorization during processing delays.

Background

Under prior policy guidance, certain foreign nationals who timely filed to renew their employment authorization were eligible for an automatic extension of up to 540 days. This policy helped eligible foreign nationals avoid disruptions in their employment authorization amid increasingly lengthy U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) processing times.

DHS asserts that this policy change is consistent with several of the Trump administration’s executive orders and the administration’s overarching immigration policy.

Impacted Categories

Several commonly impacted employment eligibility categories include:

A-3: Refugee

A-5: Asylee

A-17: Spouse of a principal E nonimmigrant

A-18: Spouse of a principal L nonimmigrant

C-8: Pending Asylum

C-9: Pending Adjustment of Status under Section 245 of the INA

C-26: Spouses of certain H-1B principal nonimmigrants

It is important to note that this interim final rule does not affect the 180-day automatic extension available to F-1 students applying for STEM OPT extensions. The STEM OPT extension is authorized under a separate regulatory framework and therefore remains outside the scope of the recent IFR. USCIS has previously confirmed that 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) does not apply to F-1 STEM OPT extensions. While the IFR does not expressly state that STEM OPT is excluded, it acknowledges that its provisions do not alter other regulatory authorities, such as those governing Temporary Protected Status.

Best Practices for Foreign Nationals and Employers

Foreign nationals in the affected categories can no longer rely on automatic extensions once their EAD expires. As a result, depending on USCIS processing times, foreign nationals and employers should be prepared for potential gaps in employment authorization. To minimize disruptions, employers should continue to monitor EAD expiration dates and encourage employees to file renewal applications as early as possible – up to 180 days before the current EAD expires. Early filing is critical to reducing the risk of work authorization interruptions due to delayed adjudication.

The increased risk for federal contractors and recipients of federal funds takes several forms.

E-Verify. Two noteworthy FCA cases this year reflect a crackdown on federal contractors’ failure to use E-Verify to confirm that their employees were eligible to work in the United States. DOJ announced in September that Bayonne Drydock and Repair Corporation agreed to pay more than $4 million to resolve allegations that it violated the FCA by employing immigrants lacking work authorization for work under two federal contracts. This settlement follows an announcement in January — during the final days of the Biden administration — that a different federal contractor had agreed to pay just over $1 million to resolve similar allegations. Both cases alleged that the contractors failed to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222-54, which requires employers to electronically confirm employees’ employment eligibility in the federal E-Verify database. These settlements underscore the importance of government contractors monitoring their compliance — and their subcontractors’ compliance — with E-Verify requirements.

PRWORA. Potential FCA exposure also might arise from the Trump administration’s July announcement that it was effectively rescinding longstanding guidance under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). PRWORA provides that an organization that administers a “federal public benefit” is required to verify an applicant’s immigration status before issuing benefits (with limited exceptions for charitable organizations in certain circumstances). The Trump administration’s interpretation of the law significantly expands the number of federal benefit programs that are subject to the immigration-status restrictions — including Head Start programs, Title X family planning clinics, community services block grant programs, and community health centers. Although many of these policy changes are currently enjoined in a number of states and as to Head Start nationwide, other aspects are in effect and could give rise to potential FCA liability.

“Sanctuary Cities.” Many federal agencies — including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — have announced new conditions on federal grants requiring recipients to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. These conditions are often accompanied by conditions related to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. Although multiple jurisdictions have successfully obtained injunctions against these new conditions, where they apply, the terms could create additional FCA risk for jurisdictions that accept the federal funds but are later deemed uncooperative by federal immigration officials.

These are just three examples of how the Trump administration could continue to advance its immigration policy priorities through FCA enforcement. Government contractors and grant recipients should take proactive steps, including by carefully reviewing their agreements with and certifications to the government, as well as their immigration-verification compliance mechanisms. Early attention to these issues can help mitigate risk and avoid costly investigations or enforcement actions.

How long will Wisconsin farmers continue to believe this administration is on their side?
Many hope the short-term pain of Trump’s tariffs will pay off in the long term, with a stronger and more stable U.S. economy.
Until recently, many Wisconsin dairy farmers and their workers hoped to remain under the radar, even as immigration raids have caused chaos in other states.
Wisconsin dairy farmers skated through the first Trump administration without any dairy farm raids.","President Donald Trump’s tariffs, trade wars and immigration crackdown are taking a toll on Wisconsin farmers. For almost six months, China refused to purchase U.S. soybeans in response to Trump’s escalating tariffs, leaving Wisconsin farmers with no customer for their bumper soybean crop this year. Commodity prices are low, due to high yields and depressed demand. And recently after a long period of quiet, federal immigration agents arrived in Wisconsin, targeting construction workers in Madison and farm hands in Manitowoc — bad news for Wisconsin’s dairy industry, where 60-90% of the workforce is comprised of undocumented immigrants.

It’s an anxious, uncertain time in rural areas of the state.

Yet on a recent drive from Madison to Reedsburg, I passed dozens of giant Trump signs planted among the corn and soybean fields and banners declaring “Take America Back!” on the sides of red barns.

How long will Wisconsin farmers continue to believe this administration is on their side?

National polls show rural support for the president remains strong, even as farmers say their own economic situation is weakening. Many hope the short-term pain of Trump’s tariffs will pay off in the long term, with a stronger and more stable U.S. economy. Ever since he first ran for president in 2016, Trump appealed to many farmers with his pitch that he would remember “the forgotten men and women of America” and, especially, with his criticism of global trade deals like NAFTA, which accelerated the “get big or get out” trend in agriculture that helped kill off more than half of family farms in our state since the early 2000s.

Year after year, Wisconsin was the No. 1 state for farm bankruptcies in the country, as the number of dairies dropped from 16,000 in 2004 to fewer than 7,000 today. Since 2023, we no longer lead the country in bankruptcies — consolidation and foreclosure have simply weeded out so many farms that there aren’t that many left to shut down.

When things have been as bad as they have been for as long as they have, it’s not surprising that Trump’s brash, anti-establishment message resonated with rural voters. Many hoped that he would throw a rock at the whole system and shake up what felt like an impossibly rigged economy. Alas, it turns out it’s possible for things to go from bad to even worse.

Recently, Trump promised to use some of the revenue generated by his chaotic tariffs on other countries’ products to make bailout payments to farmers, although the status of those payments is up in the air during the government shutdown. Even without the shutdown, converting tariff revenue into subsidies for U.S. farmers is “not even like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It’s like robbing Peter to pay Peter,” Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former senior adviser for rural development at USDA, told me. Tariffs are essentially a tax on domestic consumers, who have been paying much higher prices for goods like farm equipment and fertilizer. Taking that money and giving it back in the form of a handout to the same farmers who paid for the tariffs in the first place is no real solution.

Plus, getting another bailout “isn’t what farmers want. We want to receive our money from the marketplace and let that process work out,” Darin Von Ruden, president of the Wisconsin Farmers Union, told the Green Bay Fox affiliate WLUK-TV.

Von Ruden recently hosted a listening session on his farm in Westby, part of a multistate tour by Farmers for Free Trade to dramatize the harm done by tariffs. The group hopes to pressure members of Congress to recognize the problem and vote to change course. But so far Republican members of Congress in Wisconsin seem determined to show how loyal they are to Trump, even if that means a whole lot of pain for their constituents.

Beyond the next bailout for farmers, whenever that might come, unstable markets caused by trade wars are a long-term problem. Soybean farmers say it will take years to regain a good trading relationship with China. And there is no thoughtful government effort underway to support smaller, local and regional food economies. Meanwhile the looming loss of health care and food assistance under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” also threatens lasting damage to rural Wisconsin.

And then there are the ICE raids. For decades, Wisconsin dairy farms have depended on an immigrant workforce that does not qualify for any form of work visa under current rules, since the U.S. government only offers visas for seasonal, not year-round farm work. More than half of the workers on Wisconsin dairy farms are undocumented immigrants. Until recently, many Wisconsin dairy farmers and their workers hoped to remain under the radar, even as immigration raids have caused chaos in other states. Across the country this year, half of farmers report contending with a serious labor shortage, according to Zach Rutledge, an ag researcher at Michigan State University.

Wisconsin dairy farmers skated through the first Trump administration without any dairy farm raids. This year, high-profile ICE crackdowns in Chicago and Los Angeles seemed far away and farmers could kid themselves that Trump was only trying to round up “bad” immigrants, not the hardworking people they employ. But then came the arrests in Manitowoc, a big dairy producing area of the state, and the startling roundup of seven construction workers who shared a house in Madison.

In late October, Trump’s Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the Twin Cities and defended a raid that snatched a group of roofers off a work site in St. Paul.

The cruelty, the waste, the lack of any coherent plan by this administration is becoming clearer and clearer.

According to one dairy farmer I know, farmers have received mixed signals from the Trump administration, with the ag and labor secretaries assuring them they understand the importance of the immigrant workforce, while Stephen Miller continues to press for mass deportations, consequences be damned.

Trump, busy building his massive White House ballroom, remains distracted, unpredictable, unconcerned about the chaos he has unleashed. Sooner or later, even his core constituency, the people who put food on our tables and who are accustomed to enduring economic uncertainty and hardship year after year, are bound to get fed up.

This month we provide updates on the Crystallex sales process, Helms-Burton litigation, and developments in various cases of interest.

Crystallex

As we have previously discussed (here, here, here, and here), the United States District Court for the District of Delaware is presently holding a judicial sale of shares of Citgo's parent company, in order to satisfy tens of billions of dollars in debts owed to creditors by Venezuela and its state-owned oil company.

After holding a week of hearings in September, which we summarized in our October FTU (here), the parties conducted post-trial briefing and Judge Stark held another two days of hearings on October 20 and 21. These hearings concerned motions filed by Gold Reserve and Venezuela to disqualify the Special Master overseeing the sale process and the Special Master seeking approval of the Amber Energy bid for the PDVH shares (the entity which owns CITGO). No decision has been made by the court, which accepted post-trial briefs on October 28.

Previously, Judge Stark terminated the Gold Reserve SPA and permitted the Special Master to execute the Amber Energy SPA. However, Amber Energy's financing is only committed until December 1, 2025. Amber Energy's bid for Citgo has a total value of approximately $8.5 billion, with approximately $5.859 billion going to Venezuelan creditors, $500 million in additional consideration for creditors, and $2.125 billion in cash to settle bondholder claims against its parent company, PDVSA. (This represents a discount from the $2.8 billion judgment those bondholders recently received from the Southern District of New York; the bondholders have the right to terminate the settlement on December 1 if a sale order has not been signed.)

At the hearing, Gold Reserve argued that OFAC sanctions prevented the 2020 bondholders from taking any actions that would interfere with the merger that would be required for Gold Reserve's financing to close. Gold Reserve also argued that the court should favor price over certainty, and that the Special Master had failed to generate adequate competitive tension.

Venezuela impugned the Special Master's motives in its disqualification materials and leaned heavily on many of those same argument in its merits arguments, as well as emphasizing its previous arguments about the valuation and the price of the Amber bid. Accordingly, Venezuela argued that the proper valuation is $18.6 billion and any sale needs to be for at least 50% of that (and therefore the Amber bid is too low), and the Special Master should have done a host of things differently with respect to the sale to increase the competitive tension.

The parties who support the Amber bid, including the Special Master, Crystallex, ConocoPhillips, OIEG, Red Tree, and more, attacked Venezuela's valuation as significantly too high (relying on testimony from Venezuela's expert at the sale hearing that it was a theoretical valuation that didn't discount the litigation risk from the 2020 bonds). They also challenged Venezuela's position on the 50% rule and explained that they had found competitive tension in the sale process, which they believed was fair and in compliance with Delaware law. Many creditors challenged Gold Reserve for ignoring the fact that Judge Failla had not only found the 2020s to be valid but issued a $2.8 billion judgment, and also pointed out that because Gold Reserve lost its committed financing, it no longer has a conforming bid.

It is anticipated that a decision from Judge Stark will come out this month, in advance of the December 1, 2025 date when Amber's settlement agreement with the 2020 bondholders will terminate if a sale order has not been entered. Another issue looming over the proceedings is the necessity of obtaining a license from OFAC to allow the transaction to close.

Another Helms-Burton Case Reaches the Supreme Court

Last month, we reported on the Supreme Court's historic decision to grant certiorari in Exxon Mobil Corp. and Havana Docks—marking the first time the court has agreed to weigh in on the scope of the Helms-Burton Act (HBA). As those petitions were under consideration, a third certiorari petition concerning HBA was filed in Seaboard Marine Ltd. v. de Fernandez (No. 25-283).

The respondent-plaintiff in Seaboard, Odette Blanco de Fernandez, claims to be the surviving shareholder of two Cuban corporations that owned land and port development rights in Mariel Bay, Cuba. She alleges that a portion of the land formerly owned by one of the companies is now occupied by Cuba's principal container terminal. The defendant, Seaboard Marine, is an international shipping company that delivers goods to the terminal. De Fernandez filed suit in the Southern District of Florida, asserting that Seaboard's use of the port constitutes ""trafficking"" under the HBA. The district court granted summary judgment in Seaboard's favor, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed in part, allowing certain claims to proceed. Seaboard's certiorari petition raises three key issues with the Eleventh Circuit's decision, which we lay out below.

Shareholder Standing to Sue for Corporate Property

Seaboard argues that the Eleventh Circuit erred in allowing de Fernandez to sue under the HBA based on her status as a shareholder. The Eleventh Circuit reasoned that the statute's reference to plaintiffs who ""own a claim"" reflects Congress's intent to expand the pool of eligible claimants beyond titleholders. Seaboard contends that this interpretation is overly broad, violates traditional principles of corporate separateness, and risks opening the floodgates to duplicative or competing claims from multiple shareholders of confiscated corporations.

This issue will undoubtedly be significant for future HBA cases. We expect—especially in view of the claims filed to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission—that a great number of the most valuable claims to property in Cuba are owned by corporations.

Breadth of the Definition of ""Trafficking""

The Eleventh Circuit interpreted ""trafficking"" under the HBA to include any commercial activity that ""benefits from"" confiscated property, even indirectly. Seaboard challenges this interpretation, arguing that the Act requires a more direct connection between the alleged trafficking and the property. Below, the district court found no evidence that Seaboard's freight was loaded, offloaded, or transported over the specific parcel of confiscated land. Nonetheless, the Eleventh Circuit held that Seaboard benefited from the land because the terminal's overall functionality depended on it. Seaboard argues that this reading is overly expansive and that ""benefits from"" should be limited to investment-like exploitation rather than routine commercial use.

Narrow Construction of the ""Lawful Travel"" Exception

Seaboard also argues that its shipments of agricultural goods to Cuba fall within the HBA's ""lawful travel"" exception, which exempts from liability transactions incident to lawful travel. Seaboard operated under federal regulations that authorize such exports, including humanitarian shipments. However, the Eleventh Circuit narrowly construed ""travel"" to mean only the movement of people, excluding trade-related activities. Seaboard contends that this interpretation conflicts with federal law and regulations, which explicitly link lawful travel to authorized trade.

De Fernandez initially waived her response to Seaboard's petition. However, following its November 7, 2025 conference, the Supreme Court ordered a response, which is due by December 1, 2025. We will continue to monitor developments in de Fernandez closely. Alongside Havana Docks, the Eleventh Circuit's decision in de Fernandez is among the first appellate rulings to meaningfully address the scope and application of the HBA. Unless the Supreme Court intervenes, the Eleventh Circuit's interpretation will remain a significant precedent for HBA litigants.

Other Important Developments

A variety of interesting cases in the cross-border/judgment enforcement/arbitration-adjacent areas are winding their way through the courts. Next month, we will report on a few of these in greater detail, but here are some highlights.

Petersen v. Argentina

The long-running dispute (commenced in 2015) over the Petersen plaintiffs' multibillion-dollar claim against Argentina arising out of the partial renationalization of YPF (the Argentine oil and gas company) moved into the Court of Appeals. Last week, the parties argued Argentina's appeal of a judgment entered against it by the New York federal district court. The three-judge panel was comprised of Judges Chin, Cabranes and Robinson of the US Circuit Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit. The issues on appeal include forum non conveniens, comity, whether Argentine law was properly applied, and damages methodology. Argentina's sovereign-immunity defense was rejected by the Second Circuit in 2018.

Litigation Against Spain and India

High profile sovereign litigation against Spain and India continues to proceed in US courts. Spain is seeking certiorari to the US Supreme Court over a DC Circuit decision allowing a path to enforce arbitral awards against it in favor of NextEra Energy, Inc. of approximately $386 million. Spain contends that it did not agree to arbitrate, while the claimants have prevailed on their argument that the ICSID Convention makes clear that the question of whether Spain agreed to arbitrate falls to the arbitral tribunal. Last month, the Supreme Court sought the position of the Solicitor General on the question presented.

As to India, Antrix Corp. Ltd., a state-owned commercial division of India's space agency, is urging the Ninth Circuit to once again refuse to enforce a decade-old $1.3 billion arbitral award issued to satellite communications company Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd, arguing that the award has been set aside in India and that, in any case, jurisdictional obstacles stand in the litigation's way. You may recall we reported on this case previously at the Supreme Court last term, when the court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision that the FSIA required personal jurisdiction to be established over the sovereign in enforcing an arbitral award. See FTU here.

Is there a time Limit to Vacate a Void Judgment?

Today, the Supreme Court will hear challenges to President Trump's tariffs, but there is also another case being argued: whether there's a time limit for filing motions to vacate allegedly void judgments based on claims that the issuing court lacked personal jurisdiction over a party.

Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited, Inc., has asked the justices to overrule a Sixth Circuit panel's refusal to vacate a 2015 default judgment against it. Coney Island Auto Parts claims the judgment was void when issued and is unenforceable now. Coney Island Auto Parts Unlimited Inc. v. Burton, case number 24-808.

The Sixth Circuit (a 2-1 panel decision) held that Coney Island Auto Parts' motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4), which allows motions to vacate void judgments, was untimely because it had failed to file the motion within a ""reasonable time,"" as required by Rule 60(c)(1).

Coney Island Auto Parts claims the Sixth Circuit's reading of Rule 60(c)(1) cannot be reconciled with its plain text and history or the practicality of void judgments. While the rule establishes a one-year deadline for motions to vacate based on mistakes, new evidence or fraud, it only states that motions based on other reasons should be filed in an undefined ""reasonable time."" Since void judgments are invalid from the very beginning and cannot become valid over time, the company argues they can be challenged at any time.",http://www.mondaq.com/images/MondaqThumb.png,N,,2025-11-10 13:02:48.760506

She was removed from the case last year after a judge determined she publicly leaked internal records from Dominion in violation of a court order.
“If you are wondering how it could be that people are claiming that the 2020 Election was stolen and Donald Trump was able to win in 2024, this is why,” he said.
“This is all I can say on this issue at this time.” Dominion Voting Systems was sold last month to Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican director of elections for St. Louis, Mo., and renamed Liberty Vote.
It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s sweeping pardon Sunday night for efforts to expose voting fraud would affect Lambert’s case.","The Supreme Court on Monday declined to review the disqualification of an attorney accused of improperly accessing voting machines after the 2020 election as counsel in a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems.

Michigan attorney Stefanie Lambert represented Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrne in the defamation suit brought by Dominion, a voting technology company that conspiracists homed in on in the wake of President Trump’s 2020 election loss.

She was removed from the case last year after a judge determined she publicly leaked internal records from Dominion in violation of a court order.

A lawyer for Byrne contended to the justices that Lambert’s apparent expertise in “election fraud” has made her a threat to Dominion, prompting the company’s bid to disqualify her from representing him in the case, even as she represents him in other litigation.

“Here, Petitioner’s counsel of choice is the leading expert attorney and primary counsel in election related cases across the country and other matters involving Respondent, including a breach of contract action,” lawyer Peter Ticktin wrote in Byrne’s petition to the court.

“Respondent’s motives are evident, because it continues to engage in reactive actions and conduct demonstrating its fear that Petitioner’s counsel will be able to continue to represent Petitioner in litigation with and involving Respondent,” he said.

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Dominion waived its right to respond to Byrne’s petition.

Lambert faces criminal charges in Michigan over an alleged scheme to access voting tabulators following the 2020 election, as Trump’s supporters sought evidence that he won instead of former President Biden. She was scheduled to go to trial last week, but a judge pushed the proceeding to March.

Ticktin told The Hill that the case remains open for appeal that Byrne did not have the assistance of the attorney of his choice in the Dominion litigation. He also defended Lambert’s actions, saying she gave Dominion’s discovery file to law enforcement “as she was required to do so by statute” and describing her as responsible for preventing foreign election interference in the 2024 race.

“If you are wondering how it could be that people are claiming that the 2020 Election was stolen and Donald Trump was able to win in 2024, this is why,” he said. “This is all I can say on this issue at this time.”

Dominion Voting Systems was sold last month to Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican director of elections for St. Louis, Mo., and renamed Liberty Vote. The Hill reached out for comment.

“Does Dominion even exist anymore?” Ticktin asked, attributing its apparent disappearance to Lambert.

It was not immediately clear whether Trump’s sweeping pardon Sunday night for efforts to expose voting fraud would affect Lambert’s case.

Though Lambert is not named in the pardon, it grants a “full, complete and unconditional pardon to all United States citizens” for conduct relating to both the so-called “fake electors” scheme and “any conduct relating to their efforts to expose voting fraud and vulnerabilities in the 2020 presidential election.”

However, presidential pardons are limited to federal offenses, not state offenses, so it is not likely that she would immediately be absolved.

In January 2025, authorities said they had expelled two boats ferrying about 300 undocumented migrants from Myanmar from the country’s waters.","Responding to the deaths of refugees and migrants on a boat that sank off the coast of Malaysia, Amnesty International’s Myanmar Researcher Joe Freeman said:

“This latest tragedy at sea in Southeast Asia once again lays bare the deadly risks faced by Rohingya Muslims who attempt to flee conflict and persecution in Myanmar, plus deteriorating conditions in refugee camps in Bangladesh.

“Those who were aboard a boat that sank off the coast of Malaysia had left a rapidly worsening situation both at home in Rakhine State and in overcrowded and underfunded camps over the border in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh.

“In Myanmar, Rohingya civilians face food shortages, forced labour, arbitrary detention, and restrictions on movement while they remain trapped in a conflict between the Myanmar junta and the Arakan Army that has driven more Rohingya into camps in Bangladesh.

“Meanwhile, US funding cuts have led to shortages in shelter, education services and aid in the Bangladesh camps, putting additional strain on communities and further compelling people to seek the dangerous option of fleeing by boat.

“The Malaysian and Thai governments must coordinate comprehensive search and rescue missions for survivors of this tragedy and provide them with humanitarian assistance and protection from forcible return to Myanmar.

“The unconscionable practice of pushing boats away from borders must end, and regional governments must ensure that any boats carrying refugees and migrants are allowed to land safely in the nearest country. ASEAN leaders must act decisively to address the long-standing issue of Rohingya boats at sea, as well as the ongoing conflict in Myanmar.”

Background to the Rohingya refugee crisis

At least 11 people are reported to have died after a boat carrying around 70 migrants and refugees sank near the border between Thailand and Malaysia.

The passengers were among a group of around 300 mostly Rohingya people who were originally on a larger vessel before splitting onto small boats, according to Malaysian officials. It is currently unclear whether the boat began its original journey in Myanmar or Bangladesh.

Civilians in Rakhine State have been trapped in the armed conflict between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar military, which has blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid and carried out deadly indiscriminate air strikes. Amnesty International and other groups have also documented violations of international humanitarian law and mounting abuses against civilians by the Arakan Army, which now controls most of northern Rakhine State.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya are internally displaced, and more than 150,000 Rohingya men, women and children have fled across the border to the Bangladesh camps since late 2023, bringing the total number of refugees to an estimated 1.2 million.

The ruling is the latest legal blow to the Trump administration as it attempts to crackdown on protests against immigration raids nationwide.","President Trump has issued sweeping and unconditional pardons to his top allies who aided him in his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election–that’s according to the Justice Department’s pardon attorney. Among those pardoned were Rudy Giuliani, who tried to pressure state legislatures to reject Joe Biden’s victory in key swing states; Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff in 2020; John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro, two attorneys who conspired to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election results on Jan. 6; Boris Epshteyn, an adviser to Trump; and Sidney Powell, who filed lawsuits challenging election results in key swing states. The pardons only apply to federal charges and don’t include state charges. Both Powell and Chesebro had pleaded guilty to state charges. Giuliani has been indicted in Georgia and Arizona. On Sunday, Trump also pardoned dozens of other Republicans who were involved in the plan to organize fake electors and promote conspiracies of alleged voter fraud during the 2020 election. Earlier this year, Trump had pardoned more than 1,000 Jan. 6 rioters.

The U.S. federal government shutdown has entered its 41st day. On Sunday night, seven Democratic senators broke away from their party to vote alongside Republicans on a key bill to end the shutdown and fund most government agencies until January 30. The Democratic senators include Tim Kaine of Virginia, Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, and Dick Durbin of Illinois, as well as Maine’s Independent senator Angus King. The measure does not include an extension of the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. The bill still needs to pass the House before the government can be reopened, and that would require Speaker Mike Johnson to call a House session and finally swear in Representative Elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona; she would be the final vote on a discharge petition to release the Epstein files.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that air travel would be “reduced to a trickle” if the shutdown continues. U.S. airlines canceled more than 3,500 flights over the weekend, impacting tens of thousands of travelers nationwide. Travelers expressed outrage over the delays.

bq.Traveler Delia Nau: “I’m shocked and I’m shocked. And I’m…it is definitely a Republican shutdown. It’s not the Democrats. I understand why they don’t want to take all those people off, you know, health and wellness and insurance. It’s just, it’s ridiculous.”

Israeli air raids and drone attacks continue in Gaza despite the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that went into effect a month ago. Al Jazeera reports 2 people, including a child, were killed in southern Gaza today. This is Nidal Abu Arqoub from Khan Younis.

bq.Nidal Abu Arqoub: “The future is bleak and uncertain. Given our current situation, things remain as they are. Truce, no truce, we do not see a truce. The war is ongoing, and the horizon is dark. We see the country’s situation as very difficult.”

Meanwhile, Hamas handed over the body of Hadar Goldin, an Israeli soldier who was killed in a 2014 war in Gaza. It comes as Reuters reports U.S. officials gathered intelligence that Israeli military lawyers warned there was evidence that war crimes charges could be brought against Israel for its war on Gaza. The former U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters said the material was not broadly circulated within the U.S. government until late in the Biden administration. Lawyers with the State Department also reportedly flagged to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Israel might be committing war crimes.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces killed a Palestinian man in the Far’a refugee camp. It comes as Israeli settlers attacked a group of Palestinian villagers, activists and journalists on Saturday who had gathered during an attempt to harvest olives near a settler outpost. Two Reuters journalists–including photographer Raneen Sawafta–were injured in the attack in an area close to the Palestinian village of Beita. This is Mohammed Al-Atrash, a journalist with Al Jazeera, who recounted the attack by Israeli settlers.

Mohammed Al-Atrash: “I found myself alone and all the farmers walked down, so I decided to leave the area, during that they hurled stones toward us, like nothing I have witnessed before.”

In Oregon, a federal judge has permanently blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland. In her ruling U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointee, said the president “did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard” and that “there was neither 'a rebellion or danger of a rebellion'” in Portland, as claimed by the federal government. The ruling is the latest legal blow to the Trump administration as it attempts to crackdown on protests against immigration raids nationwide.

In Massachusetts, a video obtained by the Boston Globe shows a man having what appears to be a seizure after federal immigration agents pushed, hit and pressed on his neck when the man attempted to hold on to his wife and crying child after the agents ambushed their car. Carlos Zapata, who is from Ecuador, reportedly lost consciousness as a bystander is heard saying on the video, “They’re trying to rip the baby out of [his] hand.” His wife was taken into custody by federal agents in front of their daughter, who is 1 and a half years old.

The Homeland Security Department later mocked the video of Zapata and his family, saying he faked a seizure to try to stop his wife’s arrest. She now faces deportation.

Two top executives at the BBC on Sunday abruptly resigned following backlash over the public broadcaster’s edit of a speech made by President Trump on January 6, 2021, before a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. The resignation of BBC director general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness came just days after The Daily Telegraph published details of a leaked internal memo that said a BBC documentary edited Trump’s remarks in a way that it appeared he explicitly encouraged the Capitol insurrection. The BBC is reportedly planning to formally apologize to Trump, who celebrated the resignations saying on Truth Social: “These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election…What a terrible thing for Democracy!”

Trump has repeatedly defended unfounded claims that his 2020 loss to Joe Biden was rigged.

And the UN Climate Summit opens today in Belém, Brazil where the United States will be notably absent after the Trump administration declined to send a high-level delegation. The U.S. is still expected to influence the climate talks as Trump officials use lobbyists and economic threats to attempt to sabotage environmental initiatives and efforts to cut emissions proposed by representatives from around the world. The United States is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters, while Trump has called the climate crisis a “con job.” Meanwhile, representatives from the Alliance of Small Island States are again urging leaders of the Global North to commit to stronger action in order to prevent the worst impacts of global warming, including the phase-out of fossil fuels. This is Tuvalu’s Environmental Minister speaking in Belém Friday.

Tuvalu’s Environmental Minister Maina Vakafua Talia: “We had high hopes that this new agreement would give us the necessary legal measures to protect Tuvalu from the worst impacts of climate change related sea-level rise. Ten years on from Paris, we are gravely concerned about the slow progress in delivering significant emission reductions to ensure our survival.”

Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?” Since this meeting, the prevalence of aggressive collateral and warrantless ICE arrests has increased drastically, and their impact on communities is widespread.","Since President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January of this year, the total number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees has increased by over 20,000 people. As of September 2025, there were 59,762 people being held in immigration detention centers nationwide.

Due to such a rapid increase in detainees, detention centers are overcrowded, contributing to inhumane and troubling conditions. Many people have been given spoiled food and non-potable water, had no access to showers or clean clothes and face medical neglect for both physical and mental health concerns.

At least 23 deaths occurred in ICE detention during fiscal year 2025, an increase from 24 deaths in the prior four years combined. Several of these deaths were a result of apparent suicide due to the grueling conditions.

Although Trump and his administration promised to target “the worst of the worst,” 71.5% of those detained have no criminal convictions.

Many people have also been denied due process. The National Immigrant Justice Center states there must be probable cause that an individual is violating immigration laws and that they’re likely to escape before a warrant for arrest can be obtained. The agency’s policies list one of the most significant factors in determining the likelihood of escape is their ties to the community.

If these requirements are not met, the ICE agent is not legally permitted to make a warrantless arrest. Nonetheless, many long-term community members in the Chicago area were arrested without warrant by ICE and Border Patrol in early September during “Operation Midway Blitz.” The operation led to over 3,000 arrests by the end of October, many of these arrests being “collateral arrests” by ICE agents patrolling the streets.

A WBEZ Chicago interview with U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino revealed the collateral arrests in Downtown Chicago are partly based on “how they look.” Bovino has claimed his comments were taken out of context, but the unedited recording of the interview says otherwise.

Rather than seeking individuals who have raised legitimate suspicion of illegal activities, ICE is increasingly concerned with the appearance of arrestees.

While the arrests themselves are unjust, the violent methods used are even more so. In a “60 Minutes” interview with Trump, Norah O’Donnell described agents tackling young mothers, tear gassing in residential areas and smashing car windows during ICE arrests.

When asked if he felt ICE has gone too far with such tactics, Trump boldly states, “I think they haven’t gone far enough.”

It is this rhetoric that led ICE agents to detain pre-K teacher Diana Patricia Satillana Galeano on Nov. 5, following her into her place of work and dragging her out. Parents and children watched as this took place during one of the busiest hours of drop-off, according to Chris Widen, whose 4-month-old son is taught by Galeano.

DHS has disputed this narrative, claiming they attempted to conduct a targeted traffic stop prior to arriving at the learning center, and that they did not enter the building.

However, numerous eyewitnesses, including U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, stated the ICE agents entered the facility and went room to room looking for teachers while young children watched. Ramirez and other elected officials are calling for a federal review of the agents’ actions.

The Trump administration pushes the narrative that detainees are dangerous, and that ICE is protecting the “American way of life.” ICE admitted in court that they identify people with pending charges or whose charges were dismissed as criminals, dismissing the right to a fair trial.

Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who served during Trump’s first term as senior advisor and speechwriter, has been one of the most active ICE proponents.

At a meeting between Miller and ICE’s top 50 field agents, Miller “eviscerated” everyone for not detaining more people who aren’t criminals. Miller’s desire to have everyone arrested with or without a basis for arrest is very clear, asking the field agents, “Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?”

Since this meeting, the prevalence of aggressive collateral and warrantless ICE arrests has increased drastically, and their impact on communities is widespread.

Miller told Fox News that ICE is looking to arrest at least 3,000 people a day, proudly stating Trump is going to continuously raise that number. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson also emphasized the administration’s determination to “aggressively and efficiently” deport undocumented immigrants.

As of April, the University Police Department and the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office signed a 287(g) agreement allowing ICE to intervene on UF’s campus. This followed the detainment of UF student Felipe Zapata Velásquez, despite no previous criminal record.

Since then, students have been speaking out for others that can’t speak out for themselves. A recent protest on Nov. 5 shows their continuous effort to protect students and the community.

Regardless of your stance on immigration, needless aggression for the sake of efficiency is unacceptable. This blatant lack of empathy is not just impacting immigrants — it’s impacting entire communities nationwide.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ufa/ef41c3ee-b912-4c7e-b673-acd2368cb3e6.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&dpr=2&ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=faces,N,,2025-11-10 11:03:18.203822

USDA’s latest memo, sent Saturday to state directors of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, instructed states to deliver just 65 percent of benefits during the government shutdown and required those who already sent full payments to claw back that money.

“To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized. Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,” the memo notes.

The department threatened to take various actions if states don’t comply, including cancelling federal funds that go toward administrative costs for the program or holding states liable for “overissuances.”

The Saturday memo is the latest in a string of moves from the Trump administration that has altered federal guidance on SNAP on a near daily basis, first directing states to pay partial benefits, then saying USDA would comply with full benefits, then filing an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson agreed late Friday to lift a deadline imposed by a Rhode Island judge, who ordered officials to tap into a separate USDA nutrition account to deliver full SNAP payments this month.

Nearly 42 million Americans rely on the anti-hunger program, which went dark for the first time on Nov. 1 during the record-breaking shutdown.

Several states have rushed to redirect their own funds to support food banks and benefits for families, but the back-and-forth in court has caused significant confusion across the country. Before Jackson granted an administrative stay, states including Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania had announced they had begun the process of issuing full benefits.

Hotspots of injustice While most people are at risk of poor environmental conditions, not everyone feels the same impact.
Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found.
""No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,"" Ormaza-Zulueta said.
The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.","More than 99% of the world's 7.7 billion people have one or more of their environmental rights threatened, according to new research.

In the most comprehensive analysis of inequality in environmental conditions to date, CU Boulder researchers revealed that nearly half of the global population lives in regions facing three or more environmental problems. Those include polluted air, unsafe water, extreme heat, food insecurity and biodiversity loss.

The analysis was published September 25 in Environmental Research Communications.

It provides strong evidence for urgent climate action, as representatives from nearly 200 countries prepare to convene for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the United Nations' annual climate meeting, in Brazil beginning November 10.

""Over the years, communities around the world have been fighting for local environmental justice,"" said first author Naia Ormaza-Zulueta, a doctoral student in the Department of Environmental Studies. ""We want to stitch their stories into a single, undeniable global tapestry so that they can't be dismissed as isolated problems.""

In 2022, the UN formally recognized that everyone on Earth has the right to a healthy environment. The landmark resolution, while urging countries to take action to protect that right for their people, is not legally binding.

The resolution also failed to account for environmental harm caused by activities in other countries, said Ormaza-Zulueta. Extensive research has shown that large, industrialized nations, such as the United States, emit the most greenhouse gases, but lower-income countries experience the greatest impacts.

Pollution without borders

Ormaza-Zulueta and Zia Mehrabi, a data scientist in the Department of Environmental Studies and founder of the Better Planet Lab, wanted to put a number on how many people have had their environmental rights threatened.

They collected large datasets on environmental problems to calculate whether an individual in a given location around the world is experiencing, or has recently experienced, conditions that violated their rights in five core areas defined by the UN: clean air, clean water, a safe climate, healthy and sustainably produced food, and thriving biodiversity and ecosystems.

The team found that almost everyone on Earth lived in places that have recently experienced at least one environmental risk that failed to meet the UN conditions. Over 45%, or 3.4 billion people, had at least three rights threatened, and 1.25%, or 95 million experienced all five conditions.

""The numbers are heartbreaking,"" said Ormaza-Zulueta.

Having access to clean air, defined as an annual average outdoor particulate matter concentration below the World Health Organization guideline, was the most common threat, followed by access to healthy and sustainably produced food.

In Colorado, a study has revealed that ozone pollution, mainly from cars and oil and gas operations, causes more than 800 deaths each year.

""A lot of people think Boulder has great air quality for being so close to the mountains,"" said Mehrabi. ""But the reality is that our ozone level is high for multiple months during the summer. There are days when the air quality is so bad that our children can't play outside.""

Hotspots of injustice

While most people are at risk of poor environmental conditions, not everyone feels the same impact. Consistent with previous research, disadvantaged populations, such as those with lower incomes, those who are displaced and those living on Indigenous lands, are far more likely to experience poor air quality, limited access to clean water and excessive heat than the rest of the population.

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.

Internationally, several environmental impact hotspots stood out in the study: South Asia, for example, contains 41% of all people living with all five threats to environmental rights, despite making up only one-fifth of the world's population.

Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found. For instance, pollution from the United States is responsible for 12,000 deaths from poor air quality in India each year and 38,000 deaths in China. Meanwhile, emissions from the 27 countries in the European Union have made extreme weather events 1.8 times more likely in Southeast Africa and the Amazon rainforest.

""No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,"" Ormaza-Zulueta said. She added that the large demand for products in the United States and Europe has caused biodiversity loss and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The resulting global warming and increased frequency of extreme weather events are felt around the world.

""An unstable environment destabilizes our society,"" Mehrabi said. ""There is already a lot of fear in the United States and elsewhere about conflict, immigration, and other signs of instability. Environmental issues are only going to make them worse.""

Even though the statistics are bleak, Mehrabi said they don't tell the whole story. In addition to the five core categories, many people are at risk of other poor conditions that were not measured, such as exposure to toxins released from mining and plastic waste.

""There are many solutions to these environmental problems we're facing now, from responsible clean energy to a more sustainable and just supply chain. We need strong policies that encourage businesses to adopt these solutions,"" Mehrabi said.

Mehrabi pointed to due diligence laws in countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Germany, which require domestic companies to uphold human rights across their global operations. He said other nations need to follow suit.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.

""By showing how these injustices are happening across the world, deniers can no longer dismiss the polluted river here or dirty air there as anecdotes. This can be a critical tool for pushing for policy changes,"" Ormaza-Zulueta said.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/billions-live-in-envir.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 12:03:01.813455

TOP TALKER

TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS: A group of business and civic leaders published an open letter in the Chicago Tribune on Sunday to voice their opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration-enforcement actions.

“We are united in opposing these extreme enforcement methods that cause long term harm to our city. While immigration policy is complex and opinions differ, we agree on this: these tactics are not welcome in our city,” they wrote in the full-page ad.

Most of the signatories are familiar names in Democratic circles — Chicago is a Democratic town, after all. Among them: John Atkinson, head of the Illinois Economic Development Corporation and an ally of Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, former Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Ariel Investments Co-CEO and Democratic donor John Rogers Jr.

But also signing the letter was Craig Duchossois, chair emeritus of the Duchossois Group, which recently secured a $5 billion investment from Blackstone Inc. Duchossois is also a major Republican donor, contributing more than $18 million to GOP candidates and causes in the last election cycle. Duchossois’ daughter, Ashley Joyce, who chairs the family company, also signed the letter in the Tribune. Neither returned our request for comment.

What it means: Duchossois speaking up signals that Democrats aren’t the only ones opposed to tactics by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. We hear other Illinois Republicans in the business community have also, quietly, voiced their concerns to friends within Trump’s circle.

The White House defended its actions, saying, Operation Midway Blitz has taken “dangerous criminal illegals” off Chicago’s streets. “Making Chicago communities safer will create an environment where all businesses can thrive in the long-term and their customers can feel safe. Chicago leaders should’ve never made their city a sanctuary for these dangerous criminal illegals to begin with.” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Playbook.

On Friday, some of those who signed the public letter stood together at a press briefing to express their concern that immigration enforcement is hurting the economy.

“We know the president listens to business leaders,” said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition. “He’s extremely motivated by what the business community has to say.”

Shi said revenues for some businesses have declined by 50 percent. “Immigrants, along with undocumented immigrants, contribute $22 billion in taxes and local spending every year,” Shi said. “They’re not just part of our economy. They drive it.”

And Jack Lavin, CEO of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, said the ramped up immigration enforcement has “scared people away” from restaurants, cultural events and downtown “the heart of Chicago’s economic engine.” More from ABC 7’s Sarah Schulte

Aliya Yousufi, senior policy and advocacy manager at the Council on Islamic-American Relations in Anaheim, said the legal aid fund is necessary because immigrants aren’t always guaranteed a public defender.
Tanya Leon, a resident and program manager with the OC Justice Fund, said without city support Fullerton residents in detention will have no place to turn for help.
Let’s use city funds on services and projects that are needed here and that benefit all city taxpayers.” Another speaker on Zoom who identified himself solely as Tony agreed.
“It’s not the job of the government to help people with legal aid,” he said.","Fullerton residents detained by federal immigration agents will not benefit from $100,000 worth of legal support or $100,000 for rent and grocery assistance like in other Orange County cities.

At least for now.

[Read: Immigrant Aid in Orange County Poised to Expand]

On the Prop. 50 election night, city council members voted 3-2 to table proposals for a $100,000 immigrant legal defense fund and a $100,000 rent and food assistance program amid budget concerns as officials are projected to face a $10 million deficit at the end of the decade.

Councilman Nick Dunlap said the city can’t afford to fund the aid programs.

“We’ve got parts of our city where entire neighborhoods are without street lights. We’ve got neighborhoods where the roads and streets are so bad that kids and adults can’t ride their bikes and can’t play without worrying about tripping or hurting their feet,” he said.

Dunlap also said people reached out to him and raised concerns that the aid programs were divisive because of their limited funds.

“It seems extra divisive because if there were additional funds available, they should be going to serve our entire community and not a particular group of our community,” he said.

Council members Ahmad Zahra, who spearheaded the proposals, and Shana Charles were the dissenting votes.

“If fiscal responsibility is the goal then I think we should go and reconsider a lot of votes that we’ve taken in the past,” Zahra said at Tuesday’s meeting.

“Maybe we should reconsider firing our city manager back a few years ago, that cost us to pay two city managers at the same time because we had a nine months severance package.”

Charles called the widespread deportation sweeps a public health emergency and said federal immigration agencies are disregarding the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S, Constitution.

“I hope you find it within your heart to have compassion for our neighbors who are experiencing terrifying persecution because of their skin color or spoken language. This is how we show that our city stands up for human rights and the U.S. Constitution,” she said at Tuesday’s meeting.

Charles said she worries about her own family including her children who are Guatemalan American.

“I would be worried that my kids would say to me, ‘Mom, I’m now ashamed of what you did’ if I said to them, yeah, we have $30 million in the bank, and we’re just going to leave $200,000 of it sitting there instead of doing something real that could help real families,” she said.

“This $200,000 is not going to break us, but it could absolutely do some real good right now.”

The council’s aid fund rejection comes as immigrant advocates warn that the roving deportation sweeps that kicked off in June are ramping up again as food bank leaders warn of a sharp increase in hunger amid the longest government shutdown in history.

According to the USC Equity Research Institute, about 16% of Fullerton residents are undocumented or live with an undocumented family member in a city of roughly 137,000 people.

Fullerton’s Financial Woes

Funding for both programs would have come from the roughly $27 million left in the city’s general fund reserve after officials allocated roughly $3.8 million from that pot of money to balance their budget earlier this year.

Fullerton is also facing a projected $9.3 million deficit next fiscal year that, if left unchecked, could go up to $10 million by the end of the decade, according to the city budget.

Councilwoman Jamie Valencia, who had previously voted to bring back proposals on the immigration aid funds, did not directly speak to why she voted against the proposals this time but asked a couple of questions on the budget.

“We have such a huge deficit that we need for critical infrastructure for our city. That’s what cities focus on,” she said.

“When we brought this two weeks ago to council, my main concern was that I would love city staff to come back to the table and explain, does our city and can our city financially support without getting away from our critical infrastructure bank and to keep our city going?”

The proposed amount for the programs – $200,000 – is less than 1% of the city’s reserves.

Like Valencia, Mayor Fred Jung didn’t speak to his vote directly, but asked about the budget.

Zahra said the programs were about helping residents in need and the amount wouldn’t break the bank.

“This is not going to impact us. We can weather this. It’s a small amount of money,

and these are what reserve funds are for,” Zahra said.

Charles said the city is expected to discuss two separate proposed sales tax increase measures before next year’s November election that could bring in $15 million for infrastructure like road repairs and $15 million for public safety.

Sounding Off on Immigration Aid Funds in Fullerton

Dozens of people came out to speak in favor of the aid funds in Fullerton Tuesday, arguing officials need to step up to protect and support local immigrant families during a time when they are struggling and fear their loved ones being deported.

A majority of Fullerton School Board members, including Vanessa Estrella, Miguel Alvarez and Ruthi Hancett, were among the speakers in favor of the proposals arguing that it was necessary to keep families together.

“Fullerton School District has already lost some of our students when their parents were deported suddenly,” Hancett said.

“Other families are living in constant fear and have restricted their movements because of the risk of being deported, not because they’re criminals, but because of the illegal ways that immigration is being enforced.”

Some of the speakers wore t-shirts with monarch butterflies – a longtime symbol of immigration for the insect’s migration pattern between Mexico and the U.S.

Others wore white.

Aliya Yousufi, senior policy and advocacy manager at the Council on Islamic-American Relations in Anaheim, said the legal aid fund is necessary because immigrants aren’t always guaranteed a public defender.

“Without access to legal representation, many residents, including those who worship, work and study right here in Fullerton, are forced to face the system alone,” she said at Tuesday’s meeting.

“A legal defense fund would ensure that every Fullerton resident, regardless of status, has fair representation and a chance to stay with their family.”

Some of the speakers spoke directly to Councilwoman Valencia saying she represented a predominantly Latino district and urged her to support local families.

Tanya Leon, a resident and program manager with the OC Justice Fund, said without city support Fullerton residents in detention will have no place to turn for help.

“I just don’t see what the point of fixing critical infrastructure is if Fullertonians are no longer here to use it,” Leon said. “Our residents are district four residents. They are being removed. It makes no difference to me if my streets are better, if my neighbors can’t use them.”

Two people on Zoom spoke out against the proposals, arguing private nonprofits should be the ones supporting immigrants, not the taxpayers.

Jack Dean, a Fullerton resident who served on the city’s fiscal sustainability committee, said the city doesn’t have the money and taxpayers shouldn’t fund a partisan cause.

“I would urge you to work with existing organizations to assist undocumented immigrants begin collecting donations,” he said.

“If you truly believe in this cause, all of you in attendance tonight should be among the first to contribute. Let’s use city funds on services and projects that are needed here and that benefit all city taxpayers.”

Another speaker on Zoom who identified himself solely as Tony agreed.

“It’s not the job of the government to help people with legal aid,” he said.

“I’m willing to help them. I mean, everybody that was here tonight, if they all pitched in, we’d probably have $200,000. We don’t need the government to help community members.”

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.
Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found.
“No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,” Ormaza-Zulueta said.
The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.","More than 99% of the world’s 7.7 billion people have one or more of their environmental rights threatened, according to new research.

In the most comprehensive analysis of inequality in environmental conditions to date, CU Boulder researchers revealed that nearly half of the global population lives in regions facing three or more environmental problems. Those include polluted air, unsafe water, extreme heat, food insecurity and biodiversity loss.

The analysis was published September 25 in Environmental Research Communications.

It provides strong evidence for urgent climate action, as representatives from nearly 200 countries prepare to convene for the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, in Brazil beginning November 10.

“Over the years, communities around the world have been fighting for local environmental justice,” said first author Naia Ormaza-Zulueta, a postdoctoral researcher in the Better Planet Lab at CU Boulder. “We want to stitch their stories into a single, undeniable global tapestry so that they can’t be dismissed as isolated problems.”

In 2022, the UN formally recognized that everyone on the planet has the right to a healthy environment. The landmark resolution, while urging countries to take action to protect that right for their people, is not legally binding.

The resolution also failed to account for environmental harm caused by activities in other countries, said Ormaza-Zulueta. Extensive research has shown that large, industrialized nations, such as the United States, emit the most greenhouse gases, but lower-income countries experience the greatest impacts.

Pollution without borders

Ormaza-Zulueta and Zia Mehrabi, a data scientist in the Department of Environmental Studies and founder of the Better Planet Lab, wanted to put a number on how many people have had their environmental rights threatened.

They collected large datasets on environmental problems to calculate whether an individual in a given location around the world is experiencing, or has recently experienced, conditions that violated their rights in five core areas defined by the UN: clean air, clean water, a safe climate, healthy and sustainably produced food, and thriving biodiversity and ecosystems.

The team found that almost everyone on Earth lived in places that have recently experienced at least one environmental risk that failed to meet the UN conditions. Over 45%, or 3.4 billion people, had at least three rights threatened, and1.25%, or 95 million experienced all five conditions.

“The numbers are heartbreaking,” said Ormaza-Zulueta.

Having access to clean air, defined as an annual average outdoor particulate matter concentration below the World Health Organization guideline, was the most common threat, followed by access to healthy and sustainably produced food.

In Colorado, a study has revealed that ozone pollution, mainly from cars, and oil and gas operations, causes more than 800 deaths each year.

“A lot of people think Boulder has great air quality for being so close to the mountains,” said Mehrabi. “But the reality is that our ozone level is high for multiple months during the summer. There are days when the air quality is so bad that our children can’t play outside.”

Hotspots of injustice

While most people are at risk of poor environmental conditions, not everyone feels the same impact. Consistent with previous research, disadvantaged populations, such as those with lower incomes, those who are displaced and those living on Indigenous lands, are far more likely to experience poor air quality, limited access to clean water and excessive heat than the rest of the population.

Those living in wealthier areas usually experience the best environmental conditions and are more likely to escape the worst impact as climate change progresses.

Internationally, several environmental impact hotspots stood out in the study: South Asia, for example, contains 41% of all people living with all five threats to environmental rights, despite making up only one-fifth of the world’s population.

Much of the poor environmental conditions around the globe result from the activities of wealthy nations, the study found. For instance, pollution from the United States is responsible for 12,000 deaths from poor air quality in India each year and 38,000 deaths in China. Meanwhile, emissions from the 27 countries in the European Union have made extreme weather events 1.8 times more likely in Southeast Africa and the Amazon rainforest.

“No matter where we live, our rights are inherently connected to those of people in other parts of the world,” Ormaza-Zulueta said. She added that the large demand for products in the United States and Europe has caused biodiversity loss and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The resulting global warming and increased frequency of extreme weather events are felt around the world.

“An unstable environment destabilizes our society,” Mehrabi said. “There is already a lot of fear in the United States and elsewhere about conflict, immigration, and other signs of instability. Environmental issues are only going to make them worse.”

Even though the statistics are bleak, Mehrabi said they don’t tell the whole story. In addition to the five core categories, many people are at risk of other poor conditions that were not measured, such as exposure to toxins released from mining and plastic waste.

“There are many solutions to these environmental problems we’re facing now, from responsible clean energy to a more sustainable and just supply chain. We need strong policies that encourage businesses to adopt these solutions,” Mehrabi said.

Mehrabi pointed to due diligence laws in countries such as the Netherlands, France, and Germany, which require domestic companies to uphold human rights across their global operations. He said other nations need to follow suit.

The team hopes this study can empower communities and lawyers working on environmental rights issues.

“By showing how these injustices are happening across the world, deniers can no longer dismiss the polluted river here or dirty air there as anecdotes. This can be a critical tool for pushing for policy changes,” Ormaza-Zulueta said.",https://mediasvc.eurekalert.org/Api/v1/Multimedia/1ced1b58-b9ce-4992-ac00-e2831fdf48d9/Rendition/thumbnail/Content/Public,N,,2025-11-10 12:03:07.241751

Sample of Portland, Ore., declared in a Nov. 8 statement regarding recent immigration enforcement activity in that state.
“It does not matter whether some of our brothers and sisters have proper documentation or not,” said Archbishop Sample.
“My heart is heavy because of the continued fear and anxiety that runs through the community of our Hispanic brothers and sisters in this archdiocese,” said Archbishop Sample.
“As your archbishop and spiritual father, I wish I could remove this cross from you,” Archbishop Sample told the Hispanic Catholic faithful in his message.
“We are in this together to uphold the dignity of every human person, every child of God,” said Archbishop Sample, urging all to “lean on the love that Jesus has for each one of us.","Human dignity comes “not from government, but from our loving God,” Archbishop Alexander K. Sample of Portland, Ore., declared in a Nov. 8 statement regarding recent immigration enforcement activity in that state.

“It does not matter whether some of our brothers and sisters have proper documentation or not,” said Archbishop Sample. “They are our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ.”

The archbishop’s statement — posted in both English and Spanish on the archdiocesan website and the archbishop’s social media platforms, along with a video version of the message — follows months of immigration raids and arrests under President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigrants lacking permanent legal status in the U.S., a group known to be majority Catholic Christians.

“My heart is heavy because of the continued fear and anxiety that runs through the community of our Hispanic brothers and sisters in this archdiocese,” said Archbishop Sample. “This is due to the increased ICE activity within our communities, even now in the vicinity of some of our parishes.”

Oregon has become one of several flashpoints for tensions over the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies, with regular protests taking place outside the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland.

“I want to assure our Hispanic brothers and sisters that the shepherds of the church in the United States are working diligently to advocate for their humane and respectful treatment. We are doing all that we can to alleviate this suffering,” said Archbishop Sample, who noted he is currently attending the annual U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ fall plenary meeting in Baltimore.

Both Portland, Oregon’s largest city, and the state government have codified their sanctuary status, prohibiting their respective law enforcement personnel from assisting any federal agency with immigration enforcement.

In September, Trump federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect the building. The city of Portland and the state of Oregon sued, with U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut — a Trump appointee — temporarily blocking the deployment of the troops in an October order made permanent Nov. 7.

More than 200 individuals residing in Oregon have been detained by ICE officers since Trump took office, said Reyna Lopez, executive director of the farmworker advocacy organization PCUN (Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste), during an Oct. 31 press conference in Portland.

Several North Portland public schools have implemented “secure the perimeter” protocols — locking all exterior doors while continuing learning activities — in response to reported ICE activity. On Nov. 6, some 100 community members surrounded César Chávez School an hour ahead of dismissal to watch out for ICE officers during student pickup.

Catholic social teaching on immigration balances three interrelated principles — the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation’s duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

The Catholic Church’s teaching also makes clear human laws regulating migration are also subject to divine justice, but it has not yet issued teaching exploring the morality of deportation beyond the magisterium of St. John Paul II.

The late pontiff’s 1993 encyclical “Veritatis Splendor” (“Splendor of Truth”) and 1995 encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (“The Gospel of Life”) — both quote the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes,” the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, naming “deportation” among various specific acts “offensive to human dignity” that “are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honor due to the Creator.”

He underscored their moral severity in “Veritatis Splendor” by calling them examples of “intrinsic evil,” explaining that, no matter the motives, these acts are “not capable of being ordered to God and to the good of the person.”

Across the U.S., Christians account for approximately 80 percent of all of those at risk of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort, with the single largest group of affected Christians being Catholics, according to a joint Catholic-Evangelical report published by World Relief.

The report found one in six Catholics (18 percent) are either vulnerable to deportation or live with someone who is.

According to a Pew Research Center data analysis from March 2025, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29 percent) or the children of immigrants (14 percent). But eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics are either born outside the U.S. (58 percent) or are the children of an immigrant (22 percent), while 92 percent of Asian Catholics are either immigrants (78 percent) or are the children of an immigrant (14 percent). Far fewer white Catholics — just 15 percent — share this immigrant experience: only 6 percent were born outside the U.S., with another 9 percent born in the U.S. to at least one immigrant parent.

“As your archbishop and spiritual father, I wish I could remove this cross from you,” Archbishop Sample told the Hispanic Catholic faithful in his message.

The archbishop assured them he was “deeply concerned over what you are experiencing right now, along with all of your local parish priests. I know this is a great burden for them as well, because they feel helpless to take this cross from you. … Please know that I and your pastors stand with you in solidarity during this difficult time.”

Archbishop Sample also addressed priests “who are caring for people during these difficult times,” promising his “support and prayers.

“We are in this together to uphold the dignity of every human person, every child of God,” said Archbishop Sample, urging all to “lean on the love that Jesus has for each one of us.

“He alone is our hope, and in him alone do we trust. He is with you always and will never abandon you,” said the archbishop. “Place yourselves in his hands.”

Archbishop Sample concluded his message with “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” (“Long live Jesus Christ!”) — the battle cry of the Cristeros, who defied the anti-Catholic, secular government of Mexico during the Cristero War of 1926-1929. The Cristeros’ defiant cry was made famous in particular by Blessed Miguel Pro. The Mexican martyr and Jesuit priest extended his arms in the form of a cross and shouted those words before he was executed by firing squad in 1927.

In 2000, St. John Paul II canonized 25 martyrs from the Cristero War. In 2016, Pope Francis canonized the most recent Cristero martyr, St. José Sánchez del Río, a teenager remembered for repeating “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” many times before his own public martyrdom in 1928.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The Senate voted 60-40 on Sunday to move forward toward passing legislation to fund the government and hold a later vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire on January 1. The agreement is a step toward ending the government shutdown, but does not guarantee that the health care subsidies will be extended. Mary Clare Jalonick and Lisa Mascaro report for AP News.

Federal judge Mark L. Wolf warned yesterday of the “existential threat to democracy” posed by the Trump administration, in an essay published in the Atlantic. The essay came two days after an announcement by the Federal District Court for Massachusetts that Wolf was leaving his post. Mattathias Schwartz reports for the New York Times.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told young lawyers on Friday that Justice Department lawyers are “bouncing around this country fighting these activist judges,” adding “we need you, because it is a war, and it’s something we will not win unless we keep on fighting.” Avery Lotz and Andrew Pantazi report for Axios.

Far-right influencers have hinted online that U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Reding Quiñones will pursue charges of a “grand conspiracy” against Trump’s adversaries. The investigation appears to focus in part on a January 2017 intelligence community assessment about Russian interference in the 2016 election, looking particularly at the role played by former CIA director John O. Brennan. Quiñones last week issued more than two dozen subpoenas, according to sources. Glenn Thrush, Alan Feuer, and Charlie Savage report for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Department of Agriculture on Saturday told states to only move ahead with partial SNAP payments following the Supreme Court decision on Friday, according to a USDA memo. The memo instructed states to deliver just 65 percent of benefits during the government shutdown. “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized. Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,” the memo says. Rachel Shin reports for POLITICO.

Trump has pardoned several allies who backed his efforts to subvert the 2020 election, according to Justice Department Pardon Attorney Ed Martin who shared the documents on Sunday night. The pardons are largely symbolic as none of those who were identified in Martin’s post were charged with federal crimes. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

Trump has also approved a pardon for former police officer Michael McMahon who was convicted of acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, conspiracy, and interstate stalking of a family living in New Jersey. Kenneth P. Vogel reports for the New York Times.

Ghislaine Maxwell is preparing a commutation application to be reviewed by the Trump administration, according to a document obtained by the House Judiciary Committee Democrats. If approved, Maxwell’s sentence could be significantly reduced. The Supreme Court already rejected Maxwell’s appeal to her conviction; Trump has not ruled out granting her a pardon. Hailey Fuchs reports for POLITICO.

Cornell University agreed to pay $30 million to the Trump administration to immediately restore millions in federal funding and settle investigations into Cornell’s response to antisemitic incidents on campus. The school has also agreed to invest $30 million on agricultural and farming technology programs; submit undergraduate admissions data to the administration; and comply with foreign funding reporting requirements. Bianca Quilantan reports for POLITICO.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

A 3-year old child died as a boat, carrying 21 migrants, capsized off Panama’s Caribbean coast on Sunday, according to Panamanian officials. An official confirmed that the boat was not traveling northward to the United States but in the direction of Colombia. This is the second known case of a child drowning this year on this ‘new migrant route,’ whereby individuals are returning to South America since the Trump administration closed the U.S. border. Panamanian officials say that since late September 14,000 people have travelled in small boats along the coast to avoid passing through the Darien Gap. Annie Correal reports for the New York Times.

Naomi Seibt, a prominent far-right German activist, has applied for political asylum in the United States. Kate Brady and Aaron Wiener report for the Washington Post.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced yesterday that it would suspend export controls for a year on five critical minerals needed for the manufacture of certain semi-conductors and explosives. On Friday, the Ministry of Commerce suspended export control regulations on rare earth materials as agreed between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of October. Keith Bradsher reports for the New York Times.

U.S. government officials will not attend this year’s G20 summit in South Africa, Trump said on Friday. “Afrikaners… are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,” Trump posted on Social Media, adding that “no U.S. Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue.” Faith Wardwell reports for POLITICO.

More than $5 billion worth of U.S. weapon exports to support NATO allies and Ukraine have been delayed by the government shutdown, according to a State Department estimate shared with Axios. “This is actually really harming both our allies and partners and US industry to actually deliver a lot of these critical capabilities overseas,” a senior official said. Stef W. Kight reports.

The United States on Friday opted out of a regular review of its human rights record at the U.N. Human Rights Council. AP News reports.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Friday condemned the COP30 summit as “essentially a hoax,” adding “It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives.” A White House spokesperson said regarding COP30 that “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.” Derek Gatopoulos, Theodora Tongas, and Mauricio Savarese report for AP News.

GLOBAL AFFAIRS

Thailand today threatened to suspend the ceasefire agreement with Cambodia following the explosion of a land mine in the border area that injured two Thai soldiers. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said that the “hostility towards our national security has not decreased as we thought it would,” adding that all action under the U.S.-brokered truce agreement will be halted until Thailand’s demands are met. There was no immediate response from the Cambodian government. Jintamas Saksornchai reports for AP News.

Malaysian authorities said today that hundreds of migrants who left western Myanmar about two weeks ago were missing at sea, including dozens who were on a boat that capsized over the weekend. The migrants had initially set off in a wooden boat carrying about 300 people, according to the Langkawi District Police, adding that the passengers were then transferred to two other boats on Thursday. One boat, carrying 70 people, capsized on Saturday. The police have recovered seven bodies and 13 survivors. The other boat, carrying about 230 others, is still missing at the time of writing. Zunaira Saieed and Ashley Ahn report for the New York Times.

BBC Director General Tim Davie and CEO Deborah Turness resigned yesterday following a report in the Telegraph last week that the public broadcaster had misleadingly edited a speech by Trump prior to the Jan 6. Capital riot. The Telegraph leaked a BBC internal memo arguing that a BBC Panorama documentary had juxtaposed Trump’s comments in a way that made it sound as though he had explicitly encouraged the attack. Stephen Castle reports for the New York Times.

The Saudi Arabian government has disclosed at least 320 executions so far this year. According to human rights group Reprieve, two-thirds of the executions this year have been related to drug offenses. In court documents reviewed by the New York Times, some of those facing the death penalty are low-level smugglers who say they were coerced into carrying drugs. Ismaeel Naar and Vivian Nereim report.

A Paris appeal court is considering the request for release of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy Nicholas from prison. The ruling is expected this afternoon. The appeal trial is expected to take place in several months, possibly in spring. Vaux-Montagny and Sylvie Corbet report for AP News.

The Serbian Parliament on Friday approved a new law to tear down the former General Staff military complex in Belgrade which was bombed by NATO in 1999 and to replace it with a Trump-branded hotel and apartments. The plans had previously been stalled after Serbian government officials who had endorsed it were charged with fraud. Lara Jakes and Alisa Dogramadzieva report for the New York Times.

Syria carried out nationwide operations targeting Islamic State cells, which involved 61 raids and 71 arrests, a Syrian Interior Ministry spokesperson said on Saturday. Timour Azhari reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Over 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, Gaza health officials said on Saturday. The death toll includes bodies recovered from the rubble in Gaza and Palestinians killed by the Israeli army since the ceasefire began on October 10. Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinians on Saturday who approached troops, the Israeli army said in a statement. Israel on Saturday returned the remains of another 15 Palestinians to Gaza, a day after Hamas returned the remains of the deceased hostage, Lior Rudaeff. Wafaa Shurafa, Sally Abou Aljoud, and Julia Frankel report for AP News.

The U.S.-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre in southern Israel replaced Israel as the overseer of humanitarian aid to Gaza on Friday, but the Israelis are still “part of the conversation,” a U.S. official said. The United States has not yet said which of the Israeli restrictions on aid might be lifted or how the CMCC plans to manage aid operations. A statement from COGAT, the unit within the IDF responsible for facilitating aid to Gaza, said that while “the Americans will take the lead…It should be emphasized that this does not constitute a transfer of authority or responsibility from COGAT.” Karen DeYoung, Claire Parker, Alex Horton, and Cate Brown report for the Washington Post.

The World Bank supports the U.S.-drafted U.N Security Council resolution on Gaza that would authorize a two-year mandate for a ‘Board of Peace’ transitional governance administration, according to a letter, dated Saturday, seen by Reuters. Michelle Nichols reports.

Hamas fighters in Rafah, within the Israeli-controlled area of Gaza, will not surrender to Israel, Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades said yesterday, adding that “the enemy must know that the concept of surrender and handing oneself over does not exist in the dictionary of the Al-Qassam Brigades.” Hamas did not comment directly on continuing U.S.-led talks over the fighters in Rafah. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

The Biden administration last year gathered intelligence that Israeli military lawyers were concerned about the legality of the tactics being used by Israel’s army in the war in Gaza, which could support charges of war crimes against Israel, according to five former U.S. officials. The intelligence prompted an interagency meeting at the National Security Council in late 2024 where officials and lawyers debated how to respond. Three former officials said that U.S.-lawyers concluded that it was still legal for the U.S. to continue supporting Israel with weapons and intelligence because the U.S. had not gathered its own evidence that Israel was violating the law of armed conflict. Erin Banco, Jonathan Landay, and Humeyra Pamuk report for Reuters.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Friday that Israeli settlers carried out at least 264 attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank in October. OCHA added that this amounts to an average of eight incidents per day and marks the biggest monthly total since the U.N. began tracking such incidents in 2006. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

President Donald Trump granted Hungary a one-year exemption from U.S. sanctions on Russian oil, following a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the White House on Friday. Hungary also agreed to buy liquefied natural gas from the United States, according to a State Department fact sheet. Erica L. Green reports for the New York Times.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

Last week, the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary announced it had agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by the United States, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. The Sudanese government’s ambassador to South Africa said on Friday it was too early for his country to agree to the plan, adding “we had many truces at the beginning of the war but every time there was no respect from the [RSF].” Residents in Khartoum told AFP News Agency that they heard the sounds of drones and explosions early on Friday morning.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson on Friday evening temporarily halted a lower court order that would have required the Trump administration to fund SNAP payments in full. Tony Romm and Abbie VanSickle report for the New York Times.

A federal appeals court on Sunday night declined to block an order from a district court judge requiring the Trump administration from paying SNAP payments in full for November. The ruling is on hold due to an earlier order from the Supreme Court on Friday. Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that Trump overstepped his authority when he sought to deploy the National Guard troops to Portland for the stated purpose of protecting the ICE office, issuing a permanent block on troop deployment. Anna Griffin reports for the New York Times.

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Education Department had violated the First Amendment rights of furloughed workers by using their work email accounts to send partisan messages blaming Democratic lawmakers for the government shutdown. Chris Cameron reports for the New York Times.

That’s the question that the U.S. Supreme Court will consider: whether Geo can appeal now.
The Geo Group has filed multiple appeals — including an earlier request to the Supreme Court that was rejected.
The state Supreme Court and a federal appellate court both sided with the detainees.
In an earnings call Thursday, George Zoley, the executive chairman of Geo’s board, said the company had also appealed that decision to the U.S Supreme Court.","The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Monday in a class-action lawsuit against Aurora’s immigration detention center, considering a legal question in the more-than-decade-old case that accuses the facility of enacting a system of forced labor.

Filed on behalf of nine now-former detainees, the 2014 lawsuit accuses the private prison company that runs the facility of forcing random detainees to clean parts of the facility for free. If they refused, the lawsuit alleges, detainees — meaning immigrants without proper legal status — faced solitary confinement.

But the high court’s justices aren’t set to weigh in on the primary allegations in the suit when they convene Monday morning. Instead, they’ll consider a denser legal question. The company that owns the facility, the Geo Group, has tried to argue that it has immunity from the litigation as a government contractor. But a federal judge rejected that defense.

Geo then appealed, but in late 2024, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — the federal appellate court overseeing Colorado — declined to overturn the lower court’s ruling. Its judges wrote that Geo couldn’t appeal the ruling while the broader lawsuit was still underway.

That’s the question that the U.S. Supreme Court will consider: whether Geo can appeal now.

The Geo Group asked the high court to intervene earlier this year, citing conflicting rulings from judges across the country on similar questions. If the Supreme Court sides with the company, the justices then would likely tell the 10th Circuit’s judges to circle back to the immunity question and decide if Geo can argue that it’s innoculated against facing the allegations.

Though complex, Monday’s arguments represent the latest incremental step in an 11-year-old legal saga. So old is the case that four of the Supreme Court’s current justices hadn’t been appointed when it was filed. Nearly 40 attorneys have filed to represent one party or another while the case has been pending. The Geo Group has filed multiple appeals — including an earlier request to the Supreme Court that was rejected.

“We’re looking forward to the opportunity to argue before the Supreme Court,” said David Seligman, a Denver attorney who is one of the lawyers representing detainees. “This case has been going on since 2014, and we and our clients are deeply frustrated by Geo’s efforts to continue delaying this litigation. All we want is the opportunity to have our claims vindicated in court.”

The Geo Group did not respond to an email seeking comment late last week, but its attorneys wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court: “The Tenth Circuit’s decision is the latest addition to a deep division in the circuit courts as to whether a denial of derivative sovereign immunity is an appealable collateral order.”

The Trump administration has asked to participate in the Supreme Court case and will argue on the same side as the detainees’ attorneys, against Geo’s appeal claims.

Immigration policy — and its enforcement — has undergone radical shifts in the country during the course of the litigation. Amid President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation efforts, the Aurora facility’s capacity has expanded to its full potential of more than 1,500 detainees. The Trump administration is also planning to expand its capacity in the state by reopening a private prison northeast of Denver for immigration detention. That facility was previously operated by Geo.

The work policy that the lawsuit challenges is still in place, said Andrea Loya, the executive director of Casa De Paz, a nonprofit group that works with detainees and their families.

“Unfortunately, that is still the same,” she said, adding that some current detainees protested the policy earlier this year.

According to the lawsuit and subsequent legal filings, officers in the Aurora facility have randomly selected six detainees from each of its housing pods every day. Those people have been required to clean the entire pod. If they repeatedly refuse, they “face a range of possible sanctions, including disciplinary transfer, solitary confinement for up to seventy-two hours, suspension of privileges, reprimand, and warning,” Chief Judge Jerome A. Holmes wrote in the 10th Circuit’s ruling last year.

When the case was first filed, the detainees’ lawyers also challenged Geo’s voluntary work program, in which detainees cook, clean, do laundry and maintain the facility’s landscaping for $1 a day. The attorneys argued that the practice violated minimum wage laws.

But U.S. District Court Judge John L. Kane rejected that claim, finding that the detainees weren’t employees and that Geo wasn’t their employer.

Other courts have ruled otherwise. In a separate lawsuit filed in Washington state against another Geo-run immigration detention center, a jury awarded nearly $17.3 million in back wages to detainees who participated in the voluntary work program, and a judge added nearly $6 million more in penalties, according to the Washington State Standard. The state Supreme Court and a federal appellate court both sided with the detainees.

In an earnings call Thursday, George Zoley, the executive chairman of Geo’s board, said the company had also appealed that decision to the U.S Supreme Court.

“No company has ever paid state minimum wages to individuals working in confinement facilities,” he said.

To be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful.” Beneath his usual grimace of performative empathy, Vance exposed the callous truth of this face off between the Democratic Party and Trump’s GOP: workers’ lives are nothing but a bargaining chip for the two imperialist parties.

Left out in the cold by the Democrats and Republicans, the working class and poor are left to sort it out for ourselves. All workers, public sector and private alike, must demand that our unions take the side — not of the representatives of the bosses — but of the workers and oppressed, using their might to force an end to the shutdown, an end to layoffs and full backpay for all those furloughed, full employment and a living wage for all to feed their families, universal healthcare, and an independent, combative plan of action to fight all of Trump’s attacks on the working class.

Trump Is on the Offense Against Workers

Over a month into the longest government shutdown in history, over 700 thousand federal workers have been furloughed without pay since September; another 700 thousand workers deemed “essential” are working without pay. Though the courts have intervened to block permanent layoffs for now, the Trump administration continues to set its sights on cutting the federal workforce, especially in the departments of Education, Health, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The administration is again signaling that it intends to refuse backpay for workers furloughed during the shutdown, flouting a 2019 law that is meant to ensure workers are paid back after a shutdown.

42 million people have not received their SNAP benefits, as tens of thousands of federal workers flock to food pantries and rely on mutual aid to feed their families. Of course banks have been quick to profit off of working people’s hardship, offering short-term loans to workers unable to pay their bills and without the savings to make it through the shutdown.

Flights across the country are being disrupted as airport workers are forced to continue working with severe staffing shortages. Behind the disruption in service and dangerous chaos at airports are the over 11,000 air traffic controllers and other workers who are being forced to work without pay. Many of them are faced with the choice of not showing up to work (risking their jobs), or being exhausted by working additional hours at other jobs just to make ends meet.

The shutdown has been the perfect opportunity for the Trump administration to continue its mission of cutting the federal workforce, forcing hundreds of thousands of people out of their jobs in a second wave of cuts since Elon Musk departed from DOGE. According to some estimations, around two hundred thousand jobs had been cut in the federal administration as of September 23. Those targeted for layoffs during the shutdown show that Trump is not concerned about making the government more “efficient,” but in advancing its chainsaw agenda, dissolving the remaining frayed threads of America’s social safety net and consolidating executive power to attack his enemies.

After all, the shutdown itself is the Democrats’ response to Trump’s attempts to eradicate the limited provisions of Obamacare. The funding package put forward by the Republican Party would send health insurance premiums skyrocketing, effectively cutting off the 24 million people who do not get insurance from a job from access to healthcare. It would also keep in place the cuts to healthcare programs for working and poor people established in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

The Right is using the shutdown to punish its enemies while rewarding its allies. While the administration throws up its hands and once again claims there’s no money to pay federal workers or deliver SNAP benefits, it continues to pay politicians, as well as the military, ICE, and police. Trump enlisted billionaire Timothy Mellon to donate $130 million to the government to pay the military; the administration dipped into emergency funding to continue to pay ICE. And military deployments to the border continue apace to make sure no squabble in Congress affects Trump’s xenophobic war on immigrants. These extraordinary measures are of course due to the essential role these agents play in enforcing Trump’s agenda both domestically in the form of internal repression of immigrants and dissent, and internationally in the form of increasingly aggressive military and federal intervention at the U.S. border and in Venezuela and Latin America.

And as millions more people and families across the country face the fact that they don’t know where their next meal is going to come from, Trump is showing just who he represents. While Trump claims to be on the side of working people, his administration is threatening to starve workers and their families in order to make further cuts to social programs. Of course there is all the money in the world for Gatsby-themed Halloween parties for the ultra-wealthy and political elite, all the money in the world for a corrupt endeavor to construct a vanity wing of the White House with billionaire money in exchange for settled lawsuits.

So far the administration has been able to weather the storm of the shutdown. While federal courts were quick to intervene to cling to some semblance of stability as approval ratings for the government plummet and the capitalists gripe about lost profits, the Supreme Court once again ruled in Trump’s favor on the question of withholding SNAP benefits. It seems likely that the Democratic Party will cave and vote for Trump and the GOP’s funding bill to end the shutdown and stop the potential fallout from a shutdown that proves just how precarious most working-class people are in the richest country in the world.

Nevertheless there are signs that the shutdown may be accelerating anti-Trump sentiment, putting him in a weaker position. Despite divisions in the GOP over healthcare, the fact that the GOP is refusing to cede any ground to Democrats — no matter how much it takes a toll on the administration’s approval ratings — shows that this is Trump’s party through and through. Now Republicans are seeing that this comes at a cost, especially after the rebuke that Trump received at the polls in the most recent national elections and in the streets during the No Kings protest in October.

Democrats Are Mobilizing for the Next Election, Not to Protect Workers

The Democrats refused to fund the government supposedly in an attempt to protect healthcare for millions of working-class people in the United States and stand up to Trump. But this too-little, too-late maneuver is nothing but a play to capitalize on a narrow part of the most unpopular of Trump’s proposals to boost their own decrepit image and improve their chances in the 2026 elections.

The fact that they were ready to cave to the Republicans and accept a year-long extension of healthcare subsidies shows that this was never about ensuring that working people have access to medical care. Now that they have been the beneficiaries of anti-Trump sentiment during November’s elections, the Democrats are seeing this as a moment to project strength. As Senator Bernie Sanders said, Democrats “have got to remain strong” on extending Obamacare provisions, including “a commitment from the speaker of the House that he will support the legislation, and that the president will sign.” But while Democrats remain strong up on Capitol Hill, working people below are suffering each day that the shutdown continues.

But the shutdown is only useful to them until it starts to hurt their approval ratings. And despite their success in the elections, the Democratic Party remains deeply divided even on the question of just how much to stand up to Trump. It is likely that the right-wing of the party will cave without getting anything in return, while the progressive wing is betting that taking a stand now will improve Democrats’ standing in the view of the public. But this political oscillation between two dead end strategies makes clear that the Democrats will not be the ones to stand up to Trump. Until now, they have played by the rules, allowing Trump to move ahead with every single one of his attacks on working people, trans people, people of color, and immigrants. Democrats did not shut down the government to protest Trump’s rampant authoritarianism or attacks on immigrants and working people, but instead chose a safe political battle to score points against republicans toward the midterm elections. Ultimately the shutdown is part of a policy of normalizing Trump’s attacks on democratic rights, including attacks on workers rights and the right to protest.

The Democrats will not be the ones to stand up against Trump’s policies. In fact, they stand in the way of the working class and oppressed, uniting to fight back. Ultimately they have more in common with Trump and the Republicans than they have differences. That’s been true of their support for Genocide in Palestine and war in the Middle East, deportation of immigrants, and economic exploitation of billions of working people across the world. They will end the shutdown on their terms, not in the interests of the working class.

Workers Can Unite to End These Attacks. Unions Need to Take the Lead, Not Bow to Either Party of Capital

The Democrats and Republicans are weaponizing — often and publicly — the suffering of our class during the shutdown. They claim to act in our interest, but this shutdown is about nothing other than their own political jockeying. They may end the shutdown, but this does not repair the damage done to working people or prepare them for the hardships to come after Trump and the GOP’s cuts to social services and what limited government healthcare programs still exist.

The only ones shouldering the burden of this shutdown — even after it ends — are working and poor people. A continuing shutdown means further economic hardship; accepting Republicans’ funding bill means further economic hardship. Workers need to find their own solution, uniting across sectors and organized and unorganized workers to demand better living conditions and an end to Trump’s attacks without anchoring their struggle to either party.

That means a fight by rank-and-file workers with the leaders of the labor movement to carve an independent path. Union leaders have entered the fray of the government shutdown, only to take the side of Republicans or Democrats. Federal workers unions were initially supportive of Democrats’ move to refuse to approve the government funding bill, ready to put up this fight for the entire working class to have access to healthcare. Now as they feel the burden of the shutdown, it’s becoming clear that no politician is coming to save them, including their leaders tied to the Democrats. Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, has called on Republicans to cede to Democrats’ demands and “extend the subsidies and open the government.” Throwing their lot in with the Democratic Party, they tie the futures of working-class people to a losing strategy that will not guarantee anyone healthcare.

Meanwhile, Teamsters president Sean O’Brien continues to throw his support behind Trump. He appeared alongside union leaders and bosses alike in a video for the White House denouncing the shutdown. O’Brien called on Democrats “to make the deal they should have made a long time ago” — a deal that would cut benefits for workers across the country without a real plan to fight to win healthcare and higher wages.

This is not a union leader doing everything in their power to end a shutdown that is harmful to workers; this is a bureaucrat vying for a better seat at the table to negotiate the terms of exploitation for the workers he represents, tying workers’ futures to the political power of a far-right politician who has done nothing in his second term other than fire workers, attack immigrant and Black and Brown workers, and give benefit after benefit to the capitalists and ultra-wealthy. O’Brien is stepping aside to let Trump go on the offense against workers.

The labor movement must organize across the country to demand that their unions mobilize so that workers do not pay the price of this government shutdown or Trump’s attacks. This must go beyond federal workers’ unions to include all organized workers. Millions of workers rely on Medicare and food stamps — this is their fight too; but millions more still struggle to access healthcare. Universal healthcare has been a rallying call of rank-and-file workers — healthcare workers among them — for years. This cannot be a fight to simply extend a healthcare system that doesn’t work, to fight for the devil we know; rather it presents an opportunity to build an independent fight to win universal healthcare for all. We need high quality, state-funded universal health care for everyone living in the country that can’t be taken or negotiated away by the two parties of capital.

But the force to win these kinds of demands is built by uniting the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the Trump administration. From the No Kings march to Trump’s beating in the elections and the resistance to his immigration agenda in Chicago, its clear that there exists deep discontent with Trump and his policies — policies that are not only denying basic rights to immigrants, but also increasing the cost of living and making life harsher for people of color, women, the LGBTQI+ community and all exploited and oppressed people in the United States.

To stop Trump we need working class independence. Labor must join the fight, as did workers in Italy and the Spanish State to demand an end to the genocide in Gaza. Rather than waiting for the Democrats and Republicans to end the shutdown, the labor movement and social movements need to organize the fightback. That means working people taking to the streets, shutting down their workplaces and schools until social services are re-established and every single worker is rehired with full backpay. But it can’t stop there. The Democrats and Republicans are likely to pass this latest funding bill, one that spells disaster for working people. We must unite our struggles to fight for full employment and a living wage for all people regardless of their immigration status, and an independent, combative plan of action to fight all of Trump’s attacks on the working class. This must be united with the struggles against ICE and the National Guard, against the genocide in Gaza, and against Trump’s repressive and Bonapartist policies and his occupations of major cities.",https://www.leftvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/aedb15ec7b8d9057f76beda942cf0b3df299802a-1500x1000-1-e1762736817407.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 12:02:50.454404

That steep falloff in hiring included 76,000 fewer new jobs created in transportation and warehousing, 100,000 fewer in private education and health services, and 115,000 fewer in construction.
And a lot of the kinds of jobs Latino workers are more likely to seek — especially in construction — are the first to disappear in an economic slowdown.
Whether it’s more because of his economic or immigration policies, the fact is that Trump has been bad news for Latino workers.
Once in office, his dumbfounding policies have instead stalled hiring, including prominently in the industries most populated by Latino workers.","Because of historic discrimination and language barriers, Latino workers are more heavily represented in certain industries than in others. Those industries — which include construction, healthcare and hospitality — are also ones that have seen a dramatic slump in hiring in the early Trump administration compared to the last year of Joe Biden’s term.

That’s the finding of a recent report from my organization, Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), which has been taking a closer look at the impact of tax and other fiscal policies on the nation’s Latino community.

ATF estimated in another report last May, for example, that Latino workers would on average lose around $1,500 in 2026 from the combination of Republican tax and service cuts, plus the impact of President Trump’s erratic tariffs.

Our more recent report found that nearly 300,000 net fewer jobs were created in Latino-heavy industries in the first eight months of 2025 — under Trump — than in the first eight months of 2024, under Biden. That steep falloff in hiring included 76,000 fewer new jobs created in transportation and warehousing, 100,000 fewer in private education and health services, and 115,000 fewer in construction.

Businesses are naturally cautious to expand employment amidst the chaos of the Trump administration, which includes a record-long government shutdown, a huge increase in public debt, and an inscrutable tariff policy. And a lot of the kinds of jobs Latino workers are more likely to seek — especially in construction — are the first to disappear in an economic slowdown.

Not considered in the ATF report — since it’s outside our sphere of economics — is another crucial factor in the slowed growth of jobs traditionally and disproportionately held by Latino workers: the Trump administration’s harsh crackdown on immigration. But other reports have found a link.

A study conducted by a California university showed that increased immigration enforcement correlates with a decline in Latino employment in that state — which given its heavy Latino population and the focus it has received from ICE seems like a reasonable proxy for many parts of the country. This report found that over 360,000 fewer Latinos Californians were on the job between May and June of this year, a drop that corresponds to heightened immigration enforcement activity in the state.

A paper published in August noted a decline nationally in employment in agriculture, construction and hospitality — three of the Latino-intensive industries we note in our report — and blamed those losses on Trump’s aggressive deportations.

Whether it’s more because of his economic or immigration policies, the fact is that Trump has been bad news for Latino workers. And few Latinos occupy the rarified income levels that have been most helped by the presidential agenda.

The millions of Latinos making less than $53,000 will actually see their costs increasenext year thanks to GOP fiscal policies. To come out ahead next year after the combination of Republican tax cuts and healthcare-cost increases (caused by the GOP’s refusal to extend ACA premium subsidies), families have to be at least in the middle-income range of $53,000 to $91,000. But those folks on average get only about a dollar a day — a dollar easily swallowed by Trump tariff price hikes.

The real money will flow to those with higher incomes. Households with incomes between roughly $360,000 and $920,000 will pocket a net $5,000 or so on average next year. Households with income of about a million dollars and more will on average net out a $28,000 tax-cut bonanza — with those at the very top sopping up the most gravy per household.

Trump campaigned on creating a strong economy and bringing down costs for average Americans, including Latino families. Once in office, his dumbfounding policies have instead stalled hiring, including prominently in the industries most populated by Latino workers. His harsh immigration policies have made the general economic malaise even worse for Latinos. And his tax-and-spending agenda promises to raise costs for the lowest income 40 percent of households, where almost half of all Latino families can be found.

Polling shows Latino voters, who demonstrated a shift towards the Republican party in 2024, are shifting back towards the Democrats, a phenomenon demonstrated in the recent off-year elections. That makes sense since Donald Trump has delivered the opposite of what he promised.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cp-default-share.png,N,,2025-11-10 14:00:51.220275

While Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of using the government shutdown as leverage to ensure health care access for unauthorized immigrants, such immigrants were never eligible for Medicaid or ACA subsidies.
Connecticut’s state-run Obamacare exchange, for example, is among those that ramped up in-person outreach to immigrants, according to its CEO, James Michel.
While the U.S. has long imposed restrictions on immigrants considered a burden on taxpayers, the Trump administration was the first to designate public health insurance as a form of welfare.
“When you take health care away from one person in a family, the rest of the family is less likely to get the care they need even if they still qualify,” said Cadena.","Democrats, who are preoccupied with getting an extension of the enhanced subsidies, say it will be hard to undo measures in the megabill.

“Once we get the government open maybe we can get them to negotiate on that, but I am not optimistic,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) on Friday.

Immigration advocates worry that the impact of the loss is being underestimated and predict that entire families could lose access, including U.S. citizen spouses and children. The policy could also raise insurance prices for everyone, said Arturo Bustamante, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, since immigrants tend to be younger and use fewer health services than the general population.

“This could potentially trigger some local markets to go into death spirals,” said Bustamante, who focuses on the health impacts of immigration policy. “If you only keep unhealthy people insured, who are expected to have high utilization of services, that essentially makes insurance really expensive.”

The 2010 Affordable Care Act offered insurance subsidies in the form of tax credits to lawfully-present immigrants who earned less than 100 percent of the federal poverty level — roughly $15,000 a year. The policy made it easier for green card holders, asylum seekers and refugees to qualify — some of whom are barred by law from Medicaid coverage for at least 5 years after arriving in the U.S.

The Obamacare tax credits, meant to fill this gap in coverage, will disappear starting next year due to a provision in Republicans’ One Big, Beautiful Bill Act. And in 2027, lawfully-present immigrants who earn more than 100 percent of the poverty level will lose discounted Obamacare rates available to citizens, based on income.

While Republicans have repeatedly accused Democrats of using the government shutdown as leverage to ensure health care access for unauthorized immigrants, such immigrants were never eligible for Medicaid or ACA subsidies.

State action

States and advocacy groups are scrambling to warn immigrants about the impending change and get the word out about their options.

Connecticut’s state-run Obamacare exchange, for example, is among those that ramped up in-person outreach to immigrants, according to its CEO, James Michel.

Advocates are stressing immigrants need to pay attention to the fine print of this open enrollment, which kicked off on Saturday for most states.

“They need to make sure they accurately represent their income, particularly if their income might be higher than the poverty line this year [because] that would make them eligible for tax credits,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior strategist for the National Immigration Law Center.

Some states have stepped in to provide Medicaid coverage for immigrants who don’t qualify yet for the program.

The 2009 Immigrant Children’s Health Improvement Act allows states to waive the five-year waiting period for children and pregnant women. As of April 2025, 37 states and the District of Columbia have taken up this option for children and another 31 for pregnant women, according to an analysis from the health policy research group KFF.

Fourteen states and the District of Columbia offer coverage for children regardless of their immigration status, including unauthorized immigrants, but these states have to use their own funds to pay for it. Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or ACA subsidies.

Since September 2025 seven states — Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and California — have offered Medicaid to anyone whose income qualifies regardless of immigration status. However, California, Minnesota and Illinois are scaling back their programs due to budget concerns, according to KFF.

Uncertain fate

Lawfully-present immigrants are bracing for an additional blow to their health care access: the expected revival of the so-called “public charge rule” from Trump’s first administration — which could penalize immigrants who take advantage of the health insurance programs they remain legally entitled to.

The Department of Homeland Security sent a draft proposal of the regulation to the White House on Monday — typically the final step before it is published for public comment.

The previous version of the policy, which the Biden administration stopped enforcing in 2021 and scrapped in 2022, empowered the government to deny immigrants’ applications for permanent resident status if they had received or were expected to receive food or housing assistance, Medicaid, or other public benefits. While the U.S. has long imposed restrictions on immigrants considered a burden on taxpayers, the Trump administration was the first to designate public health insurance as a form of welfare.

The scope of the new version of the rule is not yet known — which immigrants it will apply to and what kinds of benefits will be implicated — but data has emerged about the impact of the previous iteration that has alarmed advocates for immigrants.

“The public charge rule intensified a lot of people’s existing fears of accessing public benefits,” said Adriana Cadena, executive director of the advocacy group Protecting Immigrant Families. “Bringing it back now would only compound that effect, since there’s already a target on immigrants’ backs, and further erode their trust in government.”

A 2021 study found that the rule led many low-income immigrants to avoid using health services, including more than a quarter of legal permanent residents, who were not subject to the rule. The chilling effect began years before the policy took effect, fueled by rhetoric from federal government officials, the UCLA researchers found, and continued for more than a year after President Joe Biden got rid of the rule.

“When you take health care away from one person in a family, the rest of the family is less likely to get the care they need even if they still qualify,” said Cadena.

Bustamante predicted, based on this and other research, that both a revived public charge rule and the loss of ACA subsidies for legal immigrants will have spillover effects for the entire population. For instance, he said, the policies could burden already stressed hospitals if immigrants without health insurance skip preventive care and end up in the emergency room, and they could make it harder to control outbreaks of infectious diseases by deterring immigrants from seeking testing and treatment.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F09%2Fba%2Fcffa5af94e3197edc8bd9574b64b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2223600329,N,,2025-11-10 08:00:48.240185

During a one-day mission to Budapest on 22 October 2025, partner organisations of the Platform met with journalists, media representatives, legal experts, and representatives of civil society to discuss key issues affecting media freedom, rule of law and free expression. Stakeholders described a severely restricted media environment within which independent journalism operates, while also highlighting the deep political polarisation shaping the run-up to the expected April 2026 elections.

In the past year, the ruling party Fidesz has maintained the most sophisticated system of media capture and control yet seen within the European Union, constructed through sustained dominance over public media, continued consolidation of private outlets under allied ownership, and persistent distortion of the market through control over state advertising, with severe consequences for media pluralism and independent journalism.

While online harassment against independent media has long been documented in Hungary, including campaigns aimed at representatives of the Platform partners, the polarised and divisive nature of the election campaign has increased the severity and nature of the threats. Multiple stakeholders reported targeted harassment and smear campaigns directed at independent journalists and outlets by representatives and supporters of the two most prominent parties and media outlets deemed friendly to the ruling party, many of which are owned by the government-linked KESMA foundation. The partners were alarmed by reports that journalists have been smeared online and in the media as being affiliated with opposing political parties in an attempt to discredit them as trusted and independent sources of public interest information.

The partners also sought to assess the impact that the draft bill on the Transparency in Public Life had on the work of journalists, media outlets, and civil society. If passed, it would have allowed for the blacklisting, financial restriction and potential closure of media outlets receiving foreign funds, having a deeply chilling effect on media. For those able to remain open, they may be forced into exile to be able to continue reporting. The mission heard that the bill remains shelved, with no current indication Fidesz plans to reintroduce it ahead of the 2026 election.

However, the ruling party’s two-thirds parliamentary majority and recent extension of the state of emergency mean the bill could be passed immediately, without public consultation. Many representatives spoke of the uncertainty this proposed bill caused, as well as the resources expended by many to establish contingency plans to ensure they can continue their vital work. With its reintroduction still a possibility, the bill continues to pose an existential threat to what remains of Hungary’s free press.

The Platform further notes that although the foreign funding bill was withdrawn, the Sovereignty Protection Office (SPO), the government office that would be charged with overseeing the proposed law, has spearheaded the attempted delegitimisation of media that receive any form of foreign funding or grant, portraying them as foreign agents and traitors. The SPO’s reports have fed wider online harassment and hate against journalists working for these titles online and on social media, including referring to independent journalists as ‘political pressure groups’. The SPO has also supported campaigns led by the ruling Fidesz party to target journalists and civil society, such as the smearing of leading independent outlets and non-governmental organisations.

The Platform’s partners are also concerned about the rise of legal harassment directed at journalists and media outlets, including abusive claims based on the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or press correction procedures. While we support processes to hold journalists to account and ensure inaccuracies are addressed, we are concerned by reports that this process has been used to target factual if critical reporting. With the capture of Hungary’s courts by the ruling party a persistent issue, such legal harassment can have a disproportionate impact on public interest reporting.

Hungarian authorities have not made any progress in aligning domestic law with the EU’s European Media Freedom Act (EMFA) since its full entry to effect in August 2025. Those we met confirmed the absence of any engagement with media outlets or civil society towards this goal. Instead, the Hungarian government has presented the regulation as an authoritarian dictat from Brussels and has challenged the EMFA before the European Court of Justice, seeking to have it nullified.

Following revelations about the abuse of journalists using zero-click Pegasus spyware carried out by Hungarian intelligence services in 2021, prosecutors’ initial investigations failed to provide answers and, to date, no individual or authority has been held responsible for these attacks on journalistic privacy and source protection. Unjustified national security justifications have been used to shield the responsible state institutions from accountability, resulting in a state of impunity.

Beyond such surveillance, the partners also discussed the threat of Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks, a form of digital censorship that left the websites of more than 40 different media offline for several hours after a spate of attacks in recent years. Although police arrested an individual they claim is responsible earlier this year, it is unclear when the person will face trial and questions remain over whether the cyber-attacks were carried out with external coordination and resources.

The Platform partners note that after the mission ended, the Hungarian portfolio of Ringier, a Swiss media company, which includes the most popular tabloid, Blikk, was purchased by Indamedia, a pro-government media group. The acquisition, made ahead of next year’s election, is yet another example of the consolidation of media under ownership of private business interests close to the government and looks likely to further erode media pluralism in Hungary ahead of the vote.

Despite severe pressures on media freedom, quality and independent journalism continues to exist in Hungary and a cohort of outlets maintain a strong commitment to fact-based, public interest reporting. This is reinforced by high-levels of public support, which has translated to significant subscription funding and solidarity when an outlet is targeted. However, these outlets continue to face sustained economic, political, and legal challenges and their foothold remains extremely fragile.

The platform delegation included representatives from the Platform secretariat, ARTICLE 19, Committee to Protect Journalists, European Broadcasting Union, European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, European Federation of Journalists, Index on Censorship, International Federation of Journalists, International Press Institute, and Reporters Without Borders.

Prior to the commencement of the mission, partners reached out to organise meetings with the Prime Minister and the SPO. On behalf of the Prime Minister, Zoltan Kovacs confirmed that he was unavailable to meet due to prior commitments, while the partners never received a response from the SPO.

Dick Durbin,,,,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ice-chicago-raid-trump-durbin-rcna242614,"Masked, armed and wearing bulletproof vests, federal immigration agents stormed into Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago on Wednesday at 7 a.m.
But in the meantime, under the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s direction, federal agents have conducted ruthless immigration raids across Chicago.
But excessive militarized ICE raids and misuse of the military for immigration enforcement and domestic policing will not make Chicago safer.
I’ve spoken with protestors, just a few of the hundreds of people who have rallied together outside of the ICE facility to push back against federal agents’ actions.
Another ordered federal agents not to indiscriminately deploy tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray on peaceful protestors, journalists and clergy.","Masked, armed and wearing bulletproof vests, federal immigration agents stormed into Rayito de Sol day care in Chicago on Wednesday at 7 a.m. Without presenting a warrant, the agents dragged teacher Diana Galeano out from the day care’s vestibule. Despite her pleas of “I have papers,” urgently delivered in English and Spanish, the agents carted the teacher away as terrified children inside hid and parents outside filmed the arrest.

The arrest of Galeano, who has a valid work permit, is just the latest in a string of reports about the chilling, cruel and chaotic actions by Department of Homeland Security officers in Illinois.

Mr. President: Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles are not “the enemy.”

Thriving on the fear he is cultivating across the country he is supposed to be leading, President Donald Trump has unleashed militarized law enforcement onto the streets of Chicago. There, according to eyewitnesses and local reports, federal officers have zip-tied children, attacked clergymen with tear gas, tackled reporters doing their jobs and temporarily disappeared people based on their ethnicity and regardless of their immigration status.

On the campaign trail, Trump boasted he would be a “dictator” on day one. He has taken the unprecedented, unnecessary and unlawful step of turning the military on American cities to attack what he calls, the “enemy within.”

Mr. President: Chicago, Portland and Los Angeles are not “the enemy.”

Let’s call this what it is: political theater.

Wanting to play a strongman on TV, the president manufactured a crisis. He claimed Chicago needed to be “saved” and tried to deploy 500 members of the National Guard to the city, in a dangerous escalation of tensions he himself created.

That deployment is on hold, thanks to a federal judge’s order that the Trump administration is appealing to the Supreme Court. But in the meantime, under the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s direction, federal agents have conducted ruthless immigration raids across Chicago. They have forcefully arrested anyone — even the elderly, women and terrified children — that they suspect of being an immigrant.

And outside of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois — where many detainees are being held — federal agents have met peaceful protestors, journalists and even local law enforcement with excessive force.

My constituents live in constant fear of arbitrary arrests and detentions.

I have always supported bipartisan, evidence-based ways to reduce violent crime. But excessive militarized ICE raids and misuse of the military for immigration enforcement and domestic policing will not make Chicago safer. The administration’s expansive use of the military across the country to support immigration enforcement activities is a dangerous distraction that hurts military readiness, pulls our Guardsmen and women away from home and wastes precious taxpayer dollars to the tune of up to $2 billion by the end of the year, per Pentagon estimates.

Rather than earnestly addressing crime, the Trump administration has hindered crime control efforts by Illinois leaders and slashed funding for crime prevention programs.

This was never about reducing crime. If it was, President Trump would have bolstered support for crime prevention programs, not cut them to the bone. Instead, the president has chosen to punish the states that did not vote for him.

As a senator and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will use every tool at my disposal to push back against this president’s attack on our democracy.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth and I recently traveled to Broadview to visit the ICE processing facility there. We were denied entry. This was the fourth time I asked to visit the facility in several weeks, and the Trump administration has denied me entry every time. What does DHS have to hide?

Contrary to the Trump administration’s highly produced videos posted online, demonstrations at Broadview have been overwhelmingly peaceful. I’ve spoken with protestors, just a few of the hundreds of people who have rallied together outside of the ICE facility to push back against federal agents’ actions.

Who will protect Illinoisans and all Americans from masked immigration agents and federal troops?

And while the president says he’s deporting the “worst of the worst,” 70% of the people stopped by DHS and accused of violations have no criminal record. ProPublica reports that federal immigration agents detained at least 170 U.S. citizens in the first nine months of President Trump’s second term. And that number is only growing.

In one incident, a U.S. citizen said immigration agents arrested him at his Chicago home, detaining him even after he presented his birth certificate. In another case, federal agents arrested a U.S. citizen service worker on her way home because, as she told the Chicago Tribune, the agents said she didn’t “look like” the name on her passport.

My constituents live in constant fear of arbitrary arrests and detentions. President Trump threatens to unleash military forces to “protect federal buildings and agents.” But who will protect Illinoisans and all Americans from masked immigration agents and federal troops?

A federal judge has limited ICE officers’ use of warrantless arrests. Another ordered federal agents not to indiscriminately deploy tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper spray on peaceful protestors, journalists and clergy. But there are serious questions as to whether immigration agents are obeying.

I’ve called on Secretary Noem to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold her accountable for unlawful actions. And I’m working with other Illinois leaders, including Sen. Duckworth, Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, to halt these clear abuses of power by the president.

President Trump does not want to fight crime. He wants to spread fear. And he is destroying the values that define us as Americans. I will continue to hold this administration accountable for its unlawful actions and to stop the president’s unnecessary and dangerous deployment of our nation’s military to city streets.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251107-ICE-zz-5bf2c3.jpg",N,,2025-11-10 09:18:47.520948

He alleges that IPS is limiting ICE's access to school grounds and prohibiting IPS employees from assisting or sharing information with ICE.
Rokita says these policies are not only illegal but are also making schools ""vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens.""
According to court documents, the district does not allow ICE officers inside school buildings without a warrant.
Rokita alleges that IPS instead connected the student with an immigration attorney and that the father and son missed their deportation flight.","Indianapolis Public Schools is pushing back against Attorney General Todd Rokita's ""silly litigation"" and rhetoric that school officials say has left them ""deeply offended.""

Why it matters: Acting on behalf of the state, Rokita is suing Indiana's largest school district for policies he says make it hard for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to do their jobs.

Driving the news: Rokita filed his lawsuit with the Marion County courts late last week.

He alleges that IPS is limiting ICE's access to school grounds and prohibiting IPS employees from assisting or sharing information with ICE.

Rokita says these policies are not only illegal but are also making schools ""vulnerable to infiltration by criminal illegal aliens.""

""It's happened in many other states — and it is essential that ICE be able to take action when that occurs to help keep our kids safe,"" Rokita said in a news release.

The other side: IPS says it's doing just that — keeping kids safe.

""Indianapolis Public Schools is committed to ensuring safe, supportive and welcoming learning environments for all students,"" the district said in a statement. ""As has always been the case, we will continue to uphold the law while keeping these commitments.""

According to court documents, the district does not allow ICE officers inside school buildings without a warrant.

""While IPS takes all legal obligations seriously, we respectfully hope that all concerned parties will recognize the heavy burden that silly litigation and political posturing places on students, families and taxpayers,"" the district said. ""Every dollar spent on defensive legal posture is a dollar not spent on instructional support, teacher development, student services or enrichment.""

""In this case, Mr. Rokita prefers those dollars go to fight gratuitous political battles, as has too often been the case.""

Zoom in: The lawsuit stems from a January incident in which ICE was attempting to get an IPS student out of school to board a voluntary deportation flight with his father, a Honduran national who was in the country illegally.

Rokita alleges that IPS instead connected the student with an immigration attorney and that the father and son missed their deportation flight.

Rokita says ICE also needs school cooperation in looking for nearly 400,000 unaccompanied minors ""who are vulnerable to exploitation by human traffickers"" and when ""criminal illegal aliens, like MS-13 gang members, infiltrate school locations.""

Flashback: Previous ICE guidance that directed officers to avoid sensitive locations — including schools, hospitals, churches and marches — was scrapped by the Trump administration on his second day in office.

What's next: Rokita is asking the courts to compel IPS to change its policies to be in compliance with state laws that prohibit local government entities from limiting their employees' engagement in activities related to the enforcement of immigration laws.",https://images.axios.com/HPvp7DAK_09h7gUnvVEcXZw61N0=/1366x768/smart/2023/10/26/170803-1698340083087.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:03:38.687514

The operation involved local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the Kenner Police Department, which said the raid was part of a two-month joint investigation.

They’re literally picking up anyone who looks Hispanic and turning them over to ICE.” Taber accused Kenner police of racial profiling, which Conley denied.","KENNER, La. — Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that 13 people are in custody following a multi-agency raid at the Kenner boat launch in the Lake Town area Friday night.

According to a statement by ICE, all 13 detainees are undocumented and in violation of immigration policies. Officials said one person in custody had previously been ordered removed by an immigration judge, and another had already been deported once before.

The operation involved local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, including the Kenner Police Department, which said the raid was part of a two-month joint investigation.

“We’ve always had complaints out there — nuisance crimes, everything from traffic to litter to loud music,” said Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley. “We go out there and police it, but it seemed like the activity was escalating into just lawlessness.”

WWL asked Conley why ICE was involved in the joint operation.

“We brought them in because we knew there was going to be a large amount of Hispanics out there,” he said. “We’ve had ICE assist us with some gang activity or gang affiliations that come through the city.”

That statement drew criticism from Union Migrante, an immigrant advocacy group that said the collaboration puts Hispanic residents at risk.

“People are traumatized,” said Union Migrante volunteer Rachel Taber. “Their loved ones who have been here working for years, with no criminal record, are now in ICE detention. They’re literally picking up anyone who looks Hispanic and turning them over to ICE.”

Taber accused Kenner police of racial profiling, which Conley denied.

“I can assure you they’re not,” Conley said. “If they have a complaint, they’re welcome to contact our internal affairs, the Department of Justice or the FBI. We’re an open book.”

When asked whether any of those detained were in the process of obtaining legal status or visas, an ICE spokesperson said, “Not that I’m aware of.”

The investigation remains ongoing.

Zoom out: President Trump has questioned Mamdani's citizenship (he was naturalized in 2018) and repeatedly claimed that Mamdani is a communist.
The bottom line: Mamdani addressed some of Trump's attacks during his victory speech on Tuesday, promising ""a shining city for all.""
""New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants — and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,"" he said.
""So hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.""","The Trump administration wants to make Zohran Mamdani, the Uganda-born Muslim who'll be New York City's next mayor, the public face for its case against legal immigration.

Why it matters: Republicans aren't just making immigration tougher. They're also sowing fear that Mamdani's popularity will ripple through other American cities with big immigrant populations.

""Import communists, become communists,"" White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted before Tuesday's election. He shared a poll showing Mamdani was winning a majority of foreign-born voters.

""What we don't want to see is more Dearborns,"" said Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, referring to the first Arab-majority city in the U.S. It's represented by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a first-generation Palestinian American.

Republicans also are singling out Minneapolis, where Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a naturalized citizen from Somalia, represents the city in Congress. ""What we don't want to see are more 100% Somalian communities that actually are Islamist and Marxist,"" Roberts told Axios.

The big picture: MAGA's crackdown on legal immigration will ""disproportionately limit people from third world countries, which obviously are not comprised of white people,"" said former Trump Homeland Security official Mike Howell, who now runs the Oversight Project.

Howell said it's time for conservatives to stop fixating on ""legal good and illegal bad"" and start focusing on assimilation.

Zoom in: The U.S. has slashed refugee admissions from 100,000 slots in President Biden's last year to 7,500 (mostly for white South Africans) in 2026.

The citizenship test will be getting more difficult, with stricter enforcement of English language proficiency for immigrants.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is screening for ""good character,"" which now looks for community involvement and contributions to the U.S. and ties to the country, among other factors.

Non-immigrant visas (for temporary travel), particularly from African countries, and H1B visas (for work), primarily awarded to Indians, have become more expensive and harder to get.

Between the lines: The Trump administration is also looking to denaturalize (stripping citizenship) some new Americans, with cases already sent for Justice Department review.

Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) penned a public letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi asking her to investigate Mamdani's citizenship application for possible denaturalization. His charge is echoed by Republican colleague Randy Fine (R-Flo.) and right wing online influencers.

The New York Young Republicans also sold t-shirts that read ""Deport Zohran"" during the campaign.

Zoom out: President Trump has questioned Mamdani's citizenship (he was naturalized in 2018) and repeatedly claimed that Mamdani is a communist. Mamdani is a democratic socialist, not a communist.

Trump used a similar line of attack when he falsely claimed for years that former President Obama wasn't born in the U.S. and was not eligible to be president.

Trump also suggested on numerous occasions that Omar, who became a citizen at 17, should ""go back"" to Somalia.

The bottom line: Mamdani addressed some of Trump's attacks during his victory speech on Tuesday, promising ""a shining city for all.""

""New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants — and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant,"" he said.

Anne Ostapiej, a protester, said, ""We have a lot of different leaders in the community, and we all have different parts that we play."" She added that the group recently went public to join the movement downtown.

""I applaud the people that are standing firm for healthcare,"" said Ostapiej. ""It was promised that healthcare would not be messed with and now you can see that they're really attacking it and people like you and even me, I'm not gonna be able to afford healthcare.""

The protests are organized by a different group called Silence Is Not an Option (SINO) than the No Kings and 50501 protests seen across the Lowcountry.

Axel Pecero was lost.

It was a warm and clear August night, just hours before the sun would rise, and he was wandering an unfamiliar part of Los Angeles with little money and a dead phone.

But the worst was yet to come.

By the next day, Pecero would become one of the thousands of undocumented people swept up in the Trump Administration’s immigration dragnet.

Since Aug. 6, Pecero has been in the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The 25-year-old former foster youth and father, who was brought to the United States from Mexico as a small child, is being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County and faces possible deportation.

Over the past few years, Pecero has worked as an advocate for young people involved in the foster care and juvenile justice systems. Dozens of letters of support for the South L.A. man have been submitted to the court on his behalf.

Pecero hopes the letters and the efforts of his immigration attorney will prevent him from being sent away from the only country he has known as home.

“I’m really hoping that the judge is able to see that I’m working on my education,” Pecero said from Adelanto in a 30-minute phone interview with The Imprint. “I want to be able to stay here with my son and continue living my life.”

He has watched other detainees being shackled and whisked away in the middle of the night by ICE agents, their shirts emblazoned with the word “Deportation.”

In the call, Pecero described the series of missteps and decisions that brought him to a deserted Burbank street on a dark night and placed him in the crosshairs of the nation’s unprecedented crackdown on immigrants.

In the weeks following his detention at Adelanto, a notorious facility known for its poor conditions, Pecero has cycled through feelings of frustration and helplessness, he said. He has watched other detainees being shackled and whisked away in the middle of the night by ICE agents, their shirts emblazoned with the word “Deportation.”

Life was just beginning to click into place for the former foster youth as he settled into his mid-20s. After years of upheaval and instability, he is today a proud father who dons suits to testify for foster youth at the state Capitol. He has earned a reputation as a dedicated advocate. He was in the process of trying to leave his mistakes behind and clear his record.

Now he wonders: Will all of the effort that he’s made in recent years to get off the streets and change his life be undone?

“No matter how much I thought I was American — I wasn’t,” Pecero said. “I really hope I have the opportunity to solidify the foundation for the life that I want to lead.”

His current predicament illustrates how missteps that others might attribute to youth can yield enormous consequences for the undocumented amid the current administration’s aggressive immigration operation.

On Aug 5, the night before he wound up in ICE custody, Pecero went to Hollywood to meet a friend and see a band perform. He had traveled from Burbank, about 16 miles away, where he was attending a work conference on youth with substance and behavioral health issues.

Around 9 p.m. he decided to head back to his Burbank hotel. He had an early morning commitment, he told his friend; he was participating in a training session for organizations serving young people in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.

He rode a bus back to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles where he hoped to take a commuter train to Burbank. But once there, he realized he had miscalculated — he didn’t have enough money for the fare. His only option, he said, was to take several local buses to reach his hotel.

The first bus never arrived. He waited for a different one but it didn’t show up for another hour. It was 3:30 a.m. when he finally arrived at his next stop. Rather than wait for a bus that wasn’t scheduled to come for yet another hour, Pecero decided to walk the rest of the way, he said.

But now he had another problem. His phone battery was running out of power.

“Are you on probation or parole?’’

By the time he made it back to Burbank on foot, Pecero’s phone was dead. Without a navigation app, he had little idea where he was.

He found himself in an industrial part of the city, near the airport, he said. He trudged along San Fernando Boulevard, thinking that everything would turn out all right if he could just make it back to the hotel in time for his morning training session.

He was hopeful. He felt he was getting closer.

Then a bright beam of light sliced through the night and fell on him.

“Are you on probation or parole?” a voice boomed out from the darkness.

Pecero told the men in the police cruiser that he was neither. He told them he was lost. He asked for a ride to his hotel.

The voice demanded his identification, and now, he said, it sounded hostile.

“Am I under arrest?’’ Pecero asked. “Am I being detained?”

The Burbank police officers told him, “No,” so Pecero told them he would keep on walking. He asked for directions to the hotel.

Then it happened. He was pushed against the police car and handcuffed, he said. The officers had run his name and found an outstanding warrant related to an unpaid traffic ticket he received for driving without a license in 2021. The arrest warrant was issued after he didn’t show up for a court date on the matter.

It was a little after 5 a.m. when Pecero arrived at the police station. He was fingerprinted, jailed and promised, he said, that he would be released “soon.’’ Hours later, he walked out of the Burbank jail.

Two Homeland Security officers were waiting for him.

“At that moment, I felt my heart drop,” Pecero said.On the other side

It all felt so surreal.

Days earlier, Pecero had passed several U.S. Marines stationed outside a federal building surrounded by demonstrators protesting the immigration raids and sweeps taking place across the city at schools, Home Depots and worksites.

“No matter how much I thought I was American — I wasn’t.”

— Axel Pecero

Now, he was on the other side of the tempest, awaiting transport to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, a detention facility that lies about a two-hour drive from downtown Los Angeles.

What stung most, Pecero recalled, was the casual banter between the two ICE agents waiting with him. As the seriousness of his predicament pressed more heavily on him with each passing moment, the agents traded wisecracks about the number of people they had picked up that day. They bragged that they were going on another “money run” later that day to detain other immigrants.

“I would hope my life is not like a pawn in somebody’s game or just extra money in somebody’s paycheck,” Pecero told The Imprint.

Meanwhile, back at the Burbank hotel where he’d been staying, Pecero’s colleagues were worried. He hadn’t shown up for his training session. No one knew where he was.

Tasha Norton-James, a trainer with the organization running the event, brought her concerns to hotel staff and asked to enter his room. Inside, they found his possessions, but no sign of Pecero. No one knew what to think until his brother arrived at the hotel later that afternoon with news of the arrest and detention. The brother had come to collect his belongings.

Norton-James is among Pecero’s friends and supporters who find it troubling that Burbank police stopped Pecero in the first place, when he was simply walking on a city street.

And they don’t understand how a man with traffic-related misdemeanors fits the profile of those the federal government has said are the targets of ICE operations — “the murderers, the MS-13 gang members, the pedophiles and rapists,” that Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin referred to in a statement last July.

“They’re supposed to be picking up the ‘worst of the worst’ criminals, but they detained Axel, who’s making this world a better place,” Norton-James said.

A ‘normal’ childhood

Pecero arrived in the U.S. when he was 3, brought to Los Angeles by his grandmother. He lived with an aunt and uncle until his parents arrived from Mexico, he said.

When Pecero was 8, his mother returned to Mexico. He remained in the U.S. with his father, but at 16, moved in with an aunt to escape his father’s abuse, he said.

Pecero never formally entered the county’s child welfare system. Instead, he lived with his aunt under an informal arrangement referred to as “hidden foster care.’’ As an unlicensed caregiver, his aunt wasn’t eligible for county resources and support that other relatives and foster parents receive.

At this point in his life, Pecero says he lived like any other typical teen in the U.S. — attending high school and crazy about basketball. Friends recall that he couldn’t pass by a pickup game without asking to join in.

“Growing up, I always thought I was normal,” he said.

But after graduating in 2018, Pecero went from one unstable housing situation to another. Eventually he wound up living in his car.

Two “cite-and-release” cases during that time continue to have far-reaching repercussions for him. In 2020, a joyriding incident led to four misdemeanor charges, including being in possession of a stolen vehicle, court records show.

In March 2021, Pecero was charged with a misdemeanor for driving without a license. It was a warrant for failing to appear in court for that case that led to his recent arrest.

Both cases are on hold while he is being held in Adelanto, though the latter case has escalated dramatically. Because Pecero was in ICE detention and failed to appear for a court date in late August, his initial $10 bail amount now carries a $100,000 bench warrant.

California State Sen. Caroline Menjivar — who is familiar with Pecero’s case and is advocating for his release — said youthful missteps like this should not lead to imprisonment and possible deportation. In an interview, she said she sees parallels in Pecero’s life experiences to her own. She also had run-ins with the law as a young person.

But she said she believes making mistakes is a normal part of growing up, and noted research showing that the area of the human brain that governs impulse control and decision-making doesn’t mature until well after the teenage years.

“They’re supposed to be picking up the ‘worst of the worst’ criminals, but they detained Axel, who’s making this world a better place.”

— Tasha Norton-James

And traumatic and destabilizing events like family separation and homelessness — both of which Pecero experienced — can disrupt development and narrow choices, Menjivar and his other supporters say.

“I recognize that he missed his court appointment, but he was an unhoused foster youth,” she said. “What do we expect from somebody who we turned our backs on? What do we expect when we do not provide the resources for him?”

Finding family

Learning he was going to become a father is what pushed Pecero to seek stability, he said. He saved $600 to rent a room in a house and move out of his car. He saw a flyer for Los Angeles’ Trade Tech community college and qualified for a scholarship that covered classes and housing there.

While attending college, Pecero learned about the advocacy work being done on behalf of foster youth by California Youth Connection. The nonprofit’s mission and sense of community spoke to him. He decided to join.

“They really just took me in, like the family that I didn’t have,” he said.

Over the past two years, his advocacy has grown to include projects with the Los Angeles County Office of Education — work that has taken him from Sacramento to Washington, D.C. Sometimes he would bring his son, now 4, to community meetings and conferences. He called the boy his inspiration.

“Before my son, I didn’t really have any set goals,” said Pecero. “I’ve really tried my best to change, and to be somebody for my son.” He hopes to become a social worker one day.

Now, roughly 80 miles separate father and son, and Pecero’s future rests in the hands of an immigration judge who will determine whether he will be allowed to stay in the country.

In the meantime, he has found a purpose and a rhythm to his days at Adelanto by helping other detainees. He uses his fluent English and Spanish skills to translate documents for others. He collects commissary money for birthday gifts for detainees — a diverse group that includes people who speak Arabic, Mandarin and Punjabi.

He’s also begun writing as a way to pass time and take his mind off his situation, he said.

The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to Berlin to discuss the issue.
And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Syrians live in Germany under varying legal statuses – some have been granted German citizenship, while others hold permanent residence permits.
Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.","When Germany opened its doors to refugees escaping war in the Middle East, more people arrived from Syria than any other country – finding homes, getting jobs, starting families.

A question mark now hangs over their future, after Germany’s government – which has hardened its stance on immigration amid a surging far right – suggested it could be time for some to return home, voluntarily or not.

Some 1 million Syrians arrived in Germany at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015-2016, under former chancellor Angela Merkel. Approximately 1.3 million live in Germany currently, including 25,000 who were born there.

Now, Chancellor Friedrich Merz and other conservatives in his coalition cabinet are calling for their repatriation.

Merz this week said that Berlin would approach the issue in a “very concrete matter,” as he signaled that there are “no longer any grounds for asylum in Germany, and therefore we can also begin with repatriations.”

While the German government will first and foremost encourage voluntary repatriation, Merz said those who refuse “can, of course, also be deported in the near future,” as he said that the return of Syrians to their homeland would be key to rebuilding the war-torn country.

The German chancellor also revealed he has invited Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa to Berlin to discuss the issue.

What’s changed in Syria is that the Assad government is no more, bringing an end to years of civil war. And in Germany, Merz’s coalition is trying to fend off the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

Despite Merz’s rhetoric, it remains unclear at this stage how wide-reaching deportations would be. Germany has so far only announced plans to deport Syrians with criminal records.

Since the collapse of Assad’s regime, around 1,300 Syrians – or 0.1% - have voluntarily returned to their homeland, according to Germany’s interior ministry.

Syrians live in Germany under varying legal statuses – some have been granted German citizenship, while others hold permanent residence permits. Over 160,000 Syrians had obtained German citizenship by the end of 2023, Deutsche Welle reported. Those who fall into these categories will not need to leave Germany, CDU politicians said during a coalition debate on Tuesday, according to Reuters.

Hundreds of thousands more hold temporary residence permits, which they are granted after receiving a protection status, such as asylum, refugee or subsidiary protection, which applies when neither of the former can be granted and serious harm is threatened in the country of origin.

Temporary residence permits allow foreigners to live and work in Germany, as well as receive government benefits, but mean their ability to remain there is uncertain.

The issue of repatriation is contentious and comes with significant legal hurdles. Meanwhile Syria remains scarred by years of conflict and nationals in Germany are looking on at the debate with mounting worry.

“Merz’s comments are heading in a direction that fuels right-wing desires to deport anyone who doesn’t fit their so-called idea of who belongs in Germany and that’s terrifying,” said Rafif Dawoud, a 33-year-old architect living in Berlin, who migrated from Syria over 12 years ago and is now a German citizen.

Dawoud said that while she knows people who have willingly returned, “talking about sending back people who have been trying to integrate, who see Germany as their second or even first and only home, who actively contribute to this society and economy, well that’s an absolute disgrace.”

Others are concerned about a volatile political situation back home. A retired engineer, who currently lives in Germany but does not hold citizenship, described the overthrow of Assad’s government as a “historical necessity” while questioning its replacement.

“We must ask whether the country is moving toward a state that mirrors European and specifically German values, respecting freedoms and human principles, or whether dictatorship and a new totalitarian religious system are simply being reproduced under a different name,” the man, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN.

Since Assad’s ousting, Syria has seen flare-ups of deadly sectarian violence, with clashes erupting between security forces and those loyal to the former president, including in Syria’s coastal Latakia region in March.

Speaking to CNN, Akram al-Bunni, a Syrian political activist who was jailed under Assad’s regime, said the German government must take into consideration the nature of the country’s new authority, which he believes could expose many Syrians to new persecution. The security situation must also be considered, al-Bunni said, stating that weapons remain “uncontrolled in the hands of extremist factions.”

Johann Wadephul, Germany’s foreign minister and a politician in Merz’s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), hinted at some of the problems awaiting Syrians on a recent visit to Damascus, when he compared the country’s devastation to “images we saw from Germany in 1945 after World War II” and expressed doubt that large numbers of Syrian migrants would return voluntarily.

But after receiving backlash from within his own party over the comments, Wadephul has sought to stress that his overall view remains in alignment with his party.

Other politicians, particularly on Germany’s left, have criticized the plans. In an interview with German news magazine Der Spiegel, Lamya Kaddor, of Germany’s Green Party, said “to believe that mass deportations (to Syria) are now possible underestimates the reality on the ground.”

The Association of German-Syrian Aid Organizations has spoken out against the government’s plans, with its chairman Nahla Osman saying the debate represents a huge blow for Syrians who have integrated into German society, including skilled workers, in a recent interview with Deutschlandfunk radio.

Germany’s health sector, for example, employs over 6,000 Syrian doctors, according to official figures – making them an integral part of the country’s healthcare system. Late last year, then-Interior Minister Nancy Faeser warned “whole areas” in Germany’s healthcare sector would fall away if the Syrians who worked there currently were to leave.

Countering the far right

Despite the opposition, it is clear that the days of “Wilkommenskulture” or “welcoming culture” regarding immigration to Germany under Merkel are gone.

The AfD came second in Germany’s federal election in February, securing an unprecedented number of votes after campaigning on an anti-migration platform and a manifesto that states that “Islam does not belong in Germany.”

Since the collapse of the Assad regime, the AfD has been calling for Syrians in Germany to return to their homeland. Meanwhile, the party has continued to enjoy strong popularity, even temporarily surging ahead of the CDU in some polls, leaving Merz’s government fighting to retain ground.

Merz – who had long been a critic of Merkel’s open-door policies – has taken a tougher stance on migration, in part to counter the AfD.

While his predecessor welcomed migrants into Germany under the slogan “Wir schaffen das” – “We’ll manage it,” Merz and his government announced sweeping revisions to migration policy after taking office.

“We clearly did not manage it. That is exactly why we’re trying to fix it,” he said of the situation.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-507772826.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-09 20:57:49.874528

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Well, the pace of deportations has clearly increased by a lot under Trump, but it's not clear that this half-million figure is accurate. This number comes from a DHS-issued press release, but it did not provide any evidence or additional information. Now, NPR repeatedly requested data from DHS to support that claim, and they have not yet responded.

RASCOE: Is it unusual for administrations to have this kind of lack of transparency on immigration figures?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: So administrations typically provide some evidence to back their deportation numbers, even if it's just annually. Look, ICE collects a lot of data on every person it arrests, detains, transports and deports. But this administration is not releasing all of that information. They have released some detention numbers that show people at a given time in immigration facilities, but they have not released a breakdown of deportation numbers.

I talked to Dara Lind with the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy group. She has compared these latest DHS deportation numbers to data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by the Deportation Data Project at UC Berkeley and UCLA. That data she looked at is through June, and Lind says there is a significant gap.

DARA LIND: They definitely are engaging in more removals in the data that we have toward the end of that period than at the beginning. We're still looking at fewer than 7,500 removals a week. That's a lot of people. It's a lot of people, but it's nowhere near the number that you would need to have gotten to 500,000.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: Even if they have kept up that high rate of 7,500 deportations a week, that would have totaled 300,000 in the first 10 months of this administration. And as Lind says, that's way short of its aggressive goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants every year. The administration also says that more than 1.6 million undocumented immigrants have left the country on their own this year. But again, they have not provided any data to back that up.

RASCOE: The Trump administration regularly claims that the vast majority of those detained - 70% - are criminals charged with or convicted of a crime in the U.S. Here's DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin recently on Fox News.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRICIA MCLAUGHLIN: We have 10,000 new ICE enforcement officers that are going to be hired in the coming days, so we know that we're going to continue to arrest the worst of the worst off of the streets of America's sanctuary cities and across the nation.

RASCOE: So, Sergio, worst of the worst, 70% criminals - is this accurate?

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: No. Not really, Ayesha. According to DHS' own detention data, 53% of immigration detainees had either pending charges or a conviction. The rest had no criminal record. And it's important to note that the 53% includes violations like property theft and traffic violations. One report in June from the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute found that only about 7% of the people booked by ICE had serious or violent convictions. The other 93% either did not have a violent conviction or any convictions at all. Here's Dara Lind again with the American Immigration Council.

LIND: They don't see a particularly strong difference between people who have committed very serious crimes and people who have no contact with the criminal justice system whatsoever but who are in the U.S. without documentation.

MARTÍNEZ-BELTRÁN: For context, two things to keep in mind here - first, entering the country illegally, coming in without documentation, is often a misdemeanor. And once in the U.S., if a migrant gets picked up without papers, that is often a civil offense.

RASCOE: That's NPR's Sergio Martínez-Beltrán. Thank you so much for joining us.

Amid the enforcement, legal policy analysts are divided over whether federal or state governments should control immigration and border security.
He said this understanding of federal power extends to immigration and prohibits states from creating their own immigration restrictions.
“You have things that are non economic but involve crossing borders, whether economically or not, that Congress should regulate if it’s crossing state borders or international borders or tribal borders,” Amar said.
Ezell pointed out examples in Texas’ history where the federal government deferred to the state to handle immigration enforcement.","WASHINGTON D.C. – The second Trump administration has been largely defined by strict immigration enforcement and net zero illegal border crossings. Amid the enforcement, legal policy analysts are divided over whether federal or state governments should control immigration and border security.

The U.S. The Department of Homeland Security reported fewer than 500,000 border encounters so far in 2025 compared to more than two million per year in 2022, 2023 and 2024.

A panel of lawyers spoke at the Federalist Society’s National Lawyers Convention on Friday about whether state governments were granted sovereignty to control immigration and naturalization by founding documents, like the U.S. Constitution.

Gene Hamilton, president of the America First Policy Institute, said the United States’ founders established immigration enforcement as a power of the federal government when it granted sovereignty to the government.

“The executive power would have been thought to have included the inherent authority to prevent the entry of people into the country,” Hamilton said of the founding father’s intentions.

Hamilton said President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order to pursue border security used authorities that belong to the executive branch in securing the sovereignty of a nation.

“I think the president’s position, as expressed in this order, is more consistent with an originalist understanding at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of what the federal government could have done to protect its own borders without requiring necessary implementing legislation from the Congress,” Hamilton said.

Trevor Ezell, general counsel for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and a member of the panel, argued that state governments have often stepped into the role of enforcing immigration throughout the history of the United States.

He pointed out the 1837 Supreme Court case Mayor of New York City v. Milne, which upheld New York’s ability to impose a fine if a ship captain did not list the number of migrants on its boat when entering the state.

“States have the same power as foreign nations to exclude individuals from their territory,” Ezell said.

Akhil Reed Amar, a professor of law at Yale, said state governments should only have control over immigration if the federal government grants that authority.

“There are inherent powers of the federal government and control of the borders would be one of them, and that’s connected to sovereignty and how we interact with foreign nations,” Amar said. “States don’t get to do many of these things unless they’re permitted by the federal government.”

In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down several portions of a law in Arizona that gave state officials broad authority over immigration enforcement, in place of the federal government.

“It is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about the status, safety, and security of their nationals in the United States must be able to confer and communicate on this subject with one national sovereign, not 50 separate states,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the court’s majority opinion.

Amar brought up the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution to defend his argument. The clause gives Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among states and with Indian tribes.

Amar argued that the establishment of federal power over Indian tribes extends to Indian tribe affairs in general, especially when considering the language of the articles of confederation. He said this understanding of federal power extends to immigration and prohibits states from creating their own immigration restrictions.

“You have things that are non economic but involve crossing borders, whether economically or not, that Congress should regulate if it’s crossing state borders or international borders or tribal borders,” Amar said.

Hamilton argued that states should have a role in the protection of its borders when the federal government does not adhere to a responsibility to protect people who come into a certain state. He highlighted that state borders are more strictly defined now than when the constitution was first drafted and, therefore, require more nuanced enforcement measures.

“What happens when the federal government fails, completely fails, completely abdicates its responsibility to prevent people from coming to a state? Does that state not have the inherent power to guard its own borders,” Hamilton asked.

Amar pointed out that the Constitution omits the word “sovereign” when referring to the power of the states. He said this is a pointed omission because the Articles of Confederation, a predecessor document to the U.S. Constitution, provided for state sovereignty.

Ezell pointed out examples in Texas’ history where the federal government deferred to the state to handle immigration enforcement. He said both state and federal governments are sovereign entities that deserve to have the same enforcement measures.

“An exercise of enforcement discretion is in no way preemptive of the other sovereign’s prescription of the same underlying activity,” Ezell said.",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2472/2025/06/22080503/54348746664_8774fee7ff_k-1024x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 20:57:14.022618

Speaking before members of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) accused President Donald Trump’s administration and federal immigration officials of violating the “dignity of all Chicagoans” with violent raids, and he asked the human rights council to hold a special session to discuss “the worsening human rights crisis in the United States.”

“I call on this council to hold the federal government of the United States to the same standards of accountability you apply elsewhere in the world,” Johnson said in the virtual address. “No country should be above international law. Human rights are universal – or they are meaningless.”

Since the Department of Homeland Security launched its “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement operation in the Chicago area in early September, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have descended on worksites, dragged residents through neighborhood streets and used chemical irritants to disperse protesters – tactics that a federal judge said “shocks the conscience.”

On Wednesday, immigration officers arrested a teacher after chasing her onto the grounds of a private preschool. The incident appears to be one of the first instances during Trump’s second administration in which immigration officers entered and made an arrest on school grounds – once considered off limits to enforcement actions. DHS disputed that the woman was arrested inside the school, saying she was detained in a “vestibule.”

In his remarks, Johnson characterized these kinds of incidents as stemming from a “moral failure” on the part of the Trump administration.

In a statement to The Washington Post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin blasted Johnson for “demonizing ICE and CBP law enforcement,” adding that federal officers are facing increasing assaults as they use more aggressive tactics to meet Trump’s deportation goals.

“Mayor Johnson has shown time and time again he does not care about the innocent American lives taken at the hands of gang members, murderers, drug traffickers, and rapists who have no right to be in this country,” McLaughlin said. “Perhaps the United Nations should investigate the ‘human rights crisis’ that is Chicago’s crime rate.”

The White House echoed McLaughlin’s criticisms of Chicago’s crime rate in its own statement.

The enforcement operation is part of the administration’s broader crackdown on “sanctuary cities,” which have long drawn Trump’s ire. Sanctuary city policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

“Operation Midway Blitz” has resulted in the arrests of 3,000 undocumented immigrants throughout Illinois and northern Indiana, according to DHS.

Johnson said the deportation campaign has had a destabilizing effect on the city, and the harms extended beyond immigrant communities.

“In Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood – a proud, predominantly Black community – federal agents carried out what can only be described as a military-style raid designed for social media spectacle,” Johnson said. After the raid, DHS published to social media a video, set to cinematic music, of the operation.

“Helicopters circled overhead. Doors were kicked in. Homes were destroyed. Immigrant residents were detained in one van, while Black families – including young children – were held in another,” Johnson added.

Authorities said that they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Two of the 37 immigrants arrested in that raid were gang members, and dozens of U.S. citizens’ apartments were targeted.

On the city’s West Side, federal agents placed a Black man in a chokehold and forced him to the ground just steps from the doors of the legal nonprofit Westside Center for Justice, Johnson said. Earlier this week, federal agents rammed into the vehicle of Dayanne Figueroa before taking her into custody “for no apparent reason,” he added.

“These are not isolated incidents. They are reminders that the fate of our communities – Black, Brown, immigrant – is bound together,” Johnson said. “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. And in Chicago, we will stand united in defense of our shared dignity, safety and freedom.”

Johnson also sought to draw the U.N. body’s attention to the lapse in federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. In Chicago, roughly 1 in 5 households receive food assistance, according to official state data.

“As someone with first-hand experience, I can tell you how humiliating it is when you open the refrigerator and you have nothing to eat,” Johnson said. “In the wealthiest country in the world, there is no reason why our federal government should allow hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans to go hungry.”

Friday’s address comes after the Trump administration skipped a review of its human rights record, known as the Universal Periodic Review. In February, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council, accusing the body of not living up to its potential.

Established in 2006, the UNHRC is a 47-member body that meets in Geneva each year to discuss human rights issues and adopt resolutions compelling governments to take action. Members can also hold crisis meetings, known as “special sessions.”

In his remarks Friday, Johnson slammed the Trump administration for “fail[ing] to meet even the most basic expectations of transparency and accountability before this council.”

“By refusing to submit its Universal Periodic Review report and declining to appear for its review, this administration seeks to evade scrutiny for its violations of human rights – just as it has sought to evade accountability for its actions in cities like mine,” he said.",https://newsindiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-09-142930.png,N,,2025-11-09 15:16:51.636806

Those include California, Michigan, New Jersey and Wisconsin, where it remained unclear by Saturday how the Supreme Court decision might immediately affect their low-income residents.","Millions of low-income families around the country confronted new delays and disruptions to their food stamp benefits on Saturday, after a late-night Supreme Court order allowed the Trump administration to continue withholding some funding for the nation’s largest anti-hunger program.

Only one day earlier, states including Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Oregon had started sending full benefits to the roughly one in eight Americans who receive aid each month, seeking to put an end to weeks of uncertainty and spare the poorest Americans from severe financial hardship.

But the process appeared to grind to a halt on Friday night. The Supreme Court granted an emergency request by the Trump administration to pause an order issued by a federal judge, who had required the White House to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

The decision once again upended food stamps, which are funded by the federal government and administered by states. It marked the latest turn in a weekslong legal battle waged by local leaders and nonprofits, which have filed multiple lawsuits to ensure that about 42 million low-income Americans would not lose their ability to buy groceries during the federal shutdown.

Throughout the closure, now the longest in history, the White House has refused to tap an ample store of leftover money that would prevent severe interruptions to the nutrition program. While the Supreme Court order was only temporary, it still appeared to freeze some of the work to restart food stamps, particularly in states that had not yet made full payments to all of their residents.

In effect, that meant some of the families that had already gone days without aid faced the prospect of an even longer wait.

In Ohio, state leaders initially told local families on SNAP that they could receive full food stamps by next week, only to have to announce that benefits had been “delayed” shortly after the Supreme Court order.

Others, like Michigan and North Carolina, had intended to make payments swiftly, but had to abandon their effort by the weekend. In Massachusetts, officials said they had managed to send full aid to residents who were owed a payment by Friday. But state leaders said they remained unsure when benefits would reach low-income families that were scheduled to receive their food stamps next week.

In New Jersey, officials expressed fear that the federal government could target the firm that manages the cards used by SNAP recipients to purchase groceries, and potentially prevent the vendor from drawing down federal funds, upending the entire program. In many other states, including Louisiana and Texas, there was no updated information at all.

Even among food stamp recipients who had received their monthly allowances, there emerged early signs of disruption. That included in New York, which announced on Friday — hours before the Supreme Court intervened — that it would furnish long-awaited grocery aid to residents. By Saturday, the state continued to forge ahead, in the hopes of releasing the food stamp money by the end of the weekend.

At the Empire Grocery & Deli on Ninth Avenue, near 25th Street in Manhattan, Duwanna Alford swiped her E.B.T. card that morning, hoping she could use the $298 in her account to buy a breakfast sandwich for her 9-year-old grandson. But when she looked down at the payment screen, Ms. Alford, 58, saw her card had been declined.

A frequent visitor to that deli for more than a decade, she immediately pulled out her phone and called the hotline for SNAP, which administers the E.B.T. cards. Ms. Alford said she got a busy signal.

On the other side of the counter, the cashier, Sanad Ali, 34, shook his head. He said he had seen many failed E.B.T. transactions recently at his store, a lifeline for low-income families in the Chelsea neighborhood, where very few delis accept food stamps. The disruption, he added, had squeezed his business, too.

“You see how it’s quiet? You see how it’s dead?” he said.

The Agriculture Department did not respond to a request for comment.

By its own admission, the Trump administration can access tens of billions in leftover funds to finance SNAP benefits this month, sparing the program from any interruption. But Mr. Trump has declined to use that money, and his aides have claimed they cannot help, despite the fact that they have reworked other parts of the federal budget to sustain their priorities during the shutdown — including to pay officers conducting mass deportations.

Many Democrats have expressed public outrage over what they view as a double standard that ultimately reduced the nation’s work to combat hunger to a bargaining chip during the shutdown.

“President Trump needs to stop trying to force Americans to go hungry and pay full SNAP benefits for everyone,” said Gov. Maura T. Healey of Massachusetts, a Democrat, who added in a statement that her state was assessing the implications of the court’s actions.

The legal wrangling over SNAP began on Thursday, after a federal court in Rhode Island ordered the White House to tap two accounts at the Agriculture Department to fund SNAP benefits in full. Absent that order, which was the second issued by that judge, the government would have provided only partial benefits — with some families receiving nothing this month, and others waiting many weeks for assistance.

The Justice Department immediately challenged that ruling, but the appeals court declined on Friday to block the judge’s order from taking immediate effect. The Trump administration then turned to the Supreme Court, where Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson granted a temporary pause, known as an administrative stay.

The justice, who handles emergency applications from courts in that part of the country, essentially left it to the appeals court to decide what to do. That means the panel of judges must determine whether to halt or preserve the original order requiring the White House to fund SNAP benefits in full this month. A decision is expected quickly.

But the result, in the meantime, was legal whiplash for the families who rely on the food stamp program, even in states that had recently announced they would begin funding benefits in full. Those include California, Michigan, New Jersey and Wisconsin, where it remained unclear by Saturday how the Supreme Court decision might immediately affect their low-income residents.

Many of those states had sued the Trump administration over SNAP funding in a case still being heard in a court in Massachusetts. On Saturday, they asked a judge there to issue an order prohibiting the Agriculture Department from punishing them for their handling of benefits during the shutdown.

“It is downright cruel that the Trump administration is still trying to cut off food benefits from millions of Americans,” Matthew J. Platkin, the attorney general of New Jersey, a Democrat, said in a statement.

He added that it was “unconscionable” that the Agriculture Department had issued conflicting guidance about payments, while promising that New Jersey would “not stop fighting to ensure that full SNAP benefits remain available to our residents.”

In Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said in a statement Saturday that his state had been “working to process” benefits when the Supreme Court ruling came down, and he promised to “work quickly” once a final decision in the case was reached.

Gavin Lesnick, a spokesman for Arkansas’s Department of Human Services, said that SNAP funds there remained on hold while officials awaited guidance from the Agriculture Department. Only then, Mr. Lesnick added, could Arkansas “finalize benefit amounts or an issuance date.”

In a handful of other states that had opted to fund SNAP using their own funds, there were no signs of trouble. In Connecticut, an official said the state planned to provide full benefits to residents by the end of Saturday, while in Vermont, a local lawmaker confirmed that the state had tapped its own money to front aid for the next two weeks.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/08/multimedia/08DC-SNAP-czbm/08DC-SNAP-czbm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 14:56:28.763133

In a survey from NBC News released Nov. 9, two-thirds of registered voters said the Trump administration has not lived up to their expectations on addressing inflation and the cost of living. Many Americans are also unhappy with the way the administration has affected the middle class, with 65% saying Trump has not lived up to their hopes.

President Donald Trump's approval rating in the poll was 43%, a 4-point decrease since the outlet's March survey, while 55% said they disapprove of his job performance.

The numbers align with several recent surveys: The president's average rating across polls is 42% approval and 55% disapproval, according to a New York Times calculation. RealClearPolitics' Nov. 9 average is similar, 43% approval and 54% disapproval.

The survey is the latest to show voters souring on the administration's handling of the economy. It's a frustration Democrats seized on in last week's Nov. 4 election, when the party won key races across the country.

Respondents in the NBC News survey said they preferred Democrats over Republicans to lead the new Congress in 2027 by 8 points, with 50% saying they prefer Democratic control over 42% wanting a GOP-led legislature. It's the largest lead for either party on the congressional ballot in the NBC poll since the 2018 midterms – and a 7-point jump in Democrats' lead since March.

When it comes to the ongoing shutdown, 49% said either Republicans in Congress or Trump are at fault, and 42% said Democrats in Congress are to blame.

However, the survey found it's not an entirely rosy picture for the Democrats. Just 28% of respondents viewed the party positively, compared to Republicans' 37%. On the issues of crime and immigration, Republicans were seen as more capable, while Democrats outranked them on health care and democracy.

And though a majority of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with Republicans over the economy, they still held a one-point advantage over Democrats in the poll on the issue.

More broadly, 61% of survey respondents said the country was moving in the wrong direction, marking a 7-point increase since the pollsters last asked the question in March.

The Universal Periodic Review

The Universal Periodic Review is designed to promote and protect human rights in every UN member country.

The UPR was established in 2006, and occurs every four to five years. Its aim is to review each of the 193 UN member states’ human rights record. The most recent review session took place on Friday, at the Human Rights Council in Geneva. There was no US representative present.

This has shocked the international human rights community and also sparked widespread criticism and concern. The move ends nearly two decades of unbroken US participation, and comes at a time when there has been growing concerns over America’s human rights record. The US absence raises serious questions not only about accountability, but also the undermining of global efforts on human rights.

US Human Rights absence

Amnesty International called the US boycott of its UPR “shocking,” and accused Washington of “walking away from even the impression of caring about the safety and security of people in the US and around the world.”

Human Rights Watch said although the US may avoid this formal scrutiny for a time,

it will only generate international criticism and further erode its place on the world stage.

Larry Krasner, District Attorney of Philadelphia, claimed Trump did not want a report card on “his unceasing violations of human rights”. He said the President “wants to be Adolf Hitler,” and it was unsurprising the “criminal” Trump administration “wants to escape accountability”.

To support the US review, hundreds of organisations had submitted reports on a wide range of human rights violations taking place in the country. These included arbitrary detention, and regression in sexual, reproductive and LGBTQ+ rights. Raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), systemic racial discrimination and the abusive treatment of immigrants were also on the agenda for discussion. So were the excessive use of force during demonstrations, attacks on free speech, and the death penalty.

US has refused to attend its UPR

The US decision to disengage from this review is linked directly to Trump’s administration. It ordered the move following the February 4 executive order to withdraw from several UN agencies. These were the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), along with the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and also the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). In a statement, the White House claimed these UN bodies have “drifted from their mission” and instead:

act contrary to the interests of the United States while attacking our allies and propagating anti-Semitism.

The US Department of State issued another statement on Friday. It framed its withdrawal from the UPR as a rejection of what it sees as the Human Rights Council’s failures to condemn severe human rights violations from UNHRC members such as Venezuela, China, and Sudan. It also stated that the US would not accept lectures about its human rights record from these countries.

Significant and multiple human rights abuses

Recent reports show disturbing human rights abuses in the United States, particularly related to law enforcement practices. As of October 2025, over 1,000 people have been killed by police officers, marking the twelfth consecutive year of exceeding this grim milestone. These killings often involve excessive use of force. They frequently affect unarmed individuals including those who are mentally ill or just in need of help. This persistent pattern highlights systemic issues within US law enforcement agencies.​

Racial minorities in the US face a higher likelihood of being targeted with lethal force. Although Black Americans make up around 12 percent of the US population, they account for an estimated 20% of those fatally shot by police in 2025. The same applies to the Hispanic population in the US. Police misconduct, disproportionate arrests and use of force against minorities are also common US human rights abuses.

Systemic injustice also extends into the US criminal justice system. Around two million people are imprisoned in the country, and there is an overrepresentation of racial minorities. ICE are conducting violent raids against immigrants, who are then systematically detained for prolonged period, seriously abused, and deported.

America ‘claims’ to uphold human rights

The continuation of the death penalty is also a stain on the US’s human rights record. Several states maintain use of the death penalty, sometimes employing methods such as nitrogen hypoxia criticized internationally as cruel and inhumane. In addition, places such as Guantanamo Bay continue to indefinitely detain individuals, without trial, violating international law. Environmental justice, violence against Indigenous peoples, and the LGBTQ community should also have been brought up in the UPR, if the US had attended, to push for necessary reforms.

The UN Universal Periodic Review is designed to hold all UN member states accountable, regardless of their global power. The US decision not to participate signals its clear refusal to accept external scrutiny. It raises serious questions about its commitment to human rights.

By withdrawing from the UPR, the US also gives other countries with human rights abuses an excuse to follow suit.

The UN Human Rights Council has postponed the US review until November 2026. The Council warned it may take further action if the US continues to refuse cooperation.​",https://www.thecanary.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/US-Human-Rights.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 12:56:45.532292

On November 7, the United States failed to participate in its UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a process where the human rights record of every member state is reviewed by other states, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported. No UN member state has failed to be reviewed since its creation in 2006.

The US decision to disengage from this vital process is particularly concerning given the deteriorating human rights situation in the country. Since the beginning of its term, the Trump administration has implemented policies that pose significant risks to the human rights of people in the US and around the world.

Recent unlawful attacks on vessels the administration claims are trafficking drugs, the violent campaign of raids and detentions conducted by Immigration and Customs and Enforcement (ICE) officials, and the use of excessive force during demonstrations are just some examples of the Trump administration’s blatant violations of international human rights law.

The UN Human Rights Council reacted to the US disengagement by postponing the review until November 2026 and saying it will consider any appropriate action if the US continues to not cooperate.

The UPR was created with the clear purpose of ensuring that every UN member state, regardless of its power and size, undergoes a peer review of its human rights record. It is also a key opportunity for civil society groups to voice their concerns on the international stage, especially where repressive governments undermine freedom of expression and independent monitoring of human rights at the national level.

To support the US peer review, hundreds of US and international civil society organisations, including Human RightsWatch, submitted reports on a wide range of human rights violations, such as: arbitrary detention, abusive treatment of immigrants, regression in sexual and reproductive rights and LGBT rights, systemic racial discrimination, and attacks on fundamental rights and the rule of law. Civil society groups and US local and regional government officials organized several events at the UN to discuss the country’s human rights situation.

According to HRW, the US government seems to think it is an exception and that the universal review process should not apply to it. But if it considers itself a rights-respecting government, international scrutiny aimed at improving the national human rights situation should be considered vital. The Trump administration may avoid this formal scrutiny process for a time, but doing so will only generate international criticism and further erode its place on the world stage.",,N,,2025-11-09 20:57:54.616380

CHICAGO (WGN) – Shots were reportedly fired at U.S. Border Patrol agents during immigration enforcement operations in the Little Village neighborhood of Chicago Saturday afternoon.

The Department of Homeland Security claims agents were conducting immigration enforcement operations near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue when an unknown man driving a black Jeep fired shots at agents and drove off.

DHS further alleges a group of people also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicle.

The Chicago Police Department was called in for help and cleared the scene.

CPD said their officers were sent to the area for reports of shots fired at federal agents. Officers secured the scene and there are no reports of anyone hit by gunfire.

One police officer, however, was accidentally hit by a GMC pickup truck driven by a 20-year-old woman. The officer suffered minor injuries and was taken to an area hospital in good condition, while the woman was issued two citations, according to CPD.

The suspect who reportedly fired shots at the agents and the Jeep he was driving have not been found.

Those who live in the area, however, are accusing federal agents of being aggressive.

Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward) said he asked agents for warrants and identification after hearing they tried to detain a man in a vehicle.

“When we arrived here, there was an 11-year-old little girl dragged by these masked individuals and the neighbors are trying to surround to make sure that they didn’t take her,” he said.

Sigcho-Lopez added that witnesses told him agents broke the window of a car.

“Look at what they’ve done to our community. Since 10 a.m. then and this is sadness. This is outrageous,” he said.

Nexstar’s WGN-TV has reached out to DHS on the incident involving an 11-year-old girl and is awaiting a response.

Once federal agents cleared the area, protesters turned their attention to remaining CPD officer conducting crowd control, yelling “shame” in their direction.

“This incident is not isolated and reflects a growing and dangerous trend of violence and obstruction. Over the past two months, we’ve seen an increase in assaults and obstruction targeting federal law enforcement during operations. These confrontations highlight the dangers our agents face daily and the escalating aggression toward law enforcement. The violence must end,” DHS said.

It’s been two months since the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz. Those who live in the area said they’ve had enough.

“I’m asking them to de-escalate. Ilive here. My daughter goes to school here. We went shopping. We’re trying to go shopping. I went to Walgreens. Ridiculous, it’s enough already. This needs to stop,” one protester said.

It’s unclear how many people were detained Saturday.

They quickly detained nine people working outside during the raid, including six women, while kids inside the car wash watched as their mother was taken away. Workers were not allowed to go inside to retrieve their work permits or identification, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made no effort to enter the facility to identify anyone they were arresting. These workers were kidnapped and whisked away in one of the largest workplace ICE raids Massachusetts has ever seen.

Boston is the latest of major cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, targeted by the Trump administration with brutal repression and anti-immigrant crackdowns. Somerville, a small city within the Boston metropolitan area, was the site of the arrest of Rumeysa Ozturk in March, and Boston mayor Michelle Wu was brought to Congress around the same time to testify on its immigration policies. However, the Trump administration started planning a new phase of immigration repression in late August, and ICE arrested over 1,400 people across Massachusetts in September. With the escalation of attacks on different cities and the Supreme Court authorizing the racial profiling of ICE victims, this is sure to continue.

Victims of the car wash kidnapping were taken to an ICE facility in Burlington, MA, where an immigration office building has been turned into an impromptu prison. ICE has denied victims lawyer visits, while failing to provide beds, sinks, or showers to the people they are holding. In addition, only seven of the nine workers kidnapped have been located, and two of the workers say they were denied food and phone calls for over two days.

These abhorrent attacks on the immigrant community are deliberate. The Allston-Brighton neighborhood of Boston is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the city, with 30 to 50 percent of the population born outside of the United States. ICE is clearly sowing the seeds of intimidation in the city, and chose to target these workers without having access to any warrants or identification.

Despite Boston being a sanctuary city, ICE has been allowed to operate within its borders and has met little to no resistance from local Democratic officials. Congressional representatives have only offered legal assistance to individual victims, an insufficient response given the scale of the repression.

However, over 100 people attended a vigil for the kidnapped workers, organized by local activists affiliated with LUCE, an immigrant justice network with a defense hotline for ICE sightings. While hotlines are crucial to report sightings and document arrests in real time, it’s crucial that we also begin self-organizing independent of Democrats and failed legal strategies in the face of mounting repression.

Coinbase said in a statement that it supported the Trump administration’s approach to the regulations for administering the minimum tax.","With little public scrutiny, the Trump administration is handing out hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to some of the country’s most profitable companies and wealthiest investors.

The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service, through a series of new notices and proposed regulations, are giving breaks to giant private equity firms, crypto companies, foreign real estate investors, insurance providers and a variety of multinational corporations.

The primary target: The administration is rapidly gutting a 2022 law intended to ensure that a sliver of the country’s most profitable corporations pay at least some federal income tax. The provision, the corporate alternative minimum tax, was passed by Democrats and signed into law by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. It sought to stop corporations like Microsoft, Amazon and Johnson & Johnson from being able to report big profits to shareholders yet low tax liabilities to the federal government. It was projected to raise $222 billion over a decade.

But the succession of notices the Treasury and I.R.S. have issued beginning this summer means the tax could bring in a fraction of that.

These breaks come in addition to the roughly $4 trillion package of tax cuts that President Trump signed into law in July. The legislation, passed entirely by Republicans, heavily benefits businesses and the ultrawealthy. It is projected to add trillions of dollars to the federal deficit and came with steep cuts to health care for the elderly and food stamps for the poorest Americans.

With its various tax relief provisions, the administration is now effectively adding hundreds of billions of dollars in new breaks for big businesses and investors. The Treasury is empowered to write rules to help the I.R.S. carry out tax laws passed by Congress. But the aggressive actions of the Trump administration raise questions about whether it is exceeding its legal authority.

Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have attacked federal workers as instruments of the “deep state,” exercising power beyond anything authorized by the law. Now the administration is doing the same thing, several tax experts said, undermining laws that hit the ultrawealthy and big companies.

“Treasury has clearly been enacting unlegislated tax cuts,” said Kyle Pomerleau, a tax economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. “Congress determines tax law. Treasury undermines this constitutional principle when it asserts more authority over the structure of the tax code than Congress provides it.”

The alternative minimum tax isn’t the administration’s only effort to roll back taxes on large businesses and wealthy individuals. Last month, the Treasury and I.R.S. granted new tax relief to foreign investors in U.S. real estate. In August, they withdrew regulations to prevent multinationals from avoiding taxes by claiming duplicate losses in multiple countries at once. And, as The New York Times previously reported, the Treasury and I.R.S. have rolled back a crackdown on an aggressive tax shelter used by big companies, including Occidental Petroleum and AT&T. That amounts to another $100 billion in cuts — and likely far more, according to tax advisers.

Changes like these are not widely publicized by the Treasury, but are closely followed by tax planners for the country’s biggest corporations — who are applauding the new guidelines. In notes to clients, advisers at KPMG celebrated the new “array of choices” available for investors seeking to avoid the corporate alternative minimum tax. They noted that the Treasury’s moves provided “significant flexibility” for clients to trim their bills, allowing them to “cherry-pick” the rules that best suit their needs.

A Treasury spokesman said the new moves were “a practical approach that supports American investment and competitiveness” and were meant to replace the Biden administration’s “compliance maze that would have buried taxpayers in red tape.” The spokesman did not address the issue of whether the Treasury was exceeding its legal authority.

The Treasury’s actions are probably contributing hundreds of billions of dollars to the federal deficit, tax experts said. That is on top of the trillions that the legislation signed by Mr. Trump in July is already adding to the deficit. Yet unlike laws passed by Congress, Treasury is under no obligation to publicly account for revenue lost by its actions — such as cutting spending to offset the money no longer being collected.

Doing it through the Treasury means “you can just give away the goodies to one group, without having to take back anything from another,” said Daniel Hemel, a law professor at New York University. This loophole, he said, is one “that previous administrations have exploited and which the Trump administration is exploiting more aggressively.”

The actions by Treasury over the past few months are an accelerated version of what the agency did during the first Trump administration: Regulators killed off efforts to crack down on a lucrative estate tax avoidance strategy, and watered down new taxes on multinational companies in the 2017 Republican tax package.

Big companies effectively keep two sets of books — one for investors and another for the I.R.S. The profits they report to the I.R.S. permit various deductions that can bring a firm’s tax rate far below the 21 percent corporate tax rate.

A holy grail of tax planning is figuring out a deduction that businesses can claim on their tax return — but one that they don’t report to investors, which would dent their profits, potentially hurt their stock price and thus depress compensation paid to executives. In 2021, the Biden administration was unable to get Congress to sign on to an international plan to tax multinational corporations. So the Democratic-led Congress revived an old idea to potentially achieve similar results by imposing a tax on the same profits that corporations report to their investors.

That alternative minimum tax was part of a 2022 domestic policy law called the Inflation Reduction Act. The new tax would apply to big corporations with an effective tax rate below 15 percent.

Not everyone viewed the new tax positively. “But it’s a thing that they were able to do at that moment in time,” said Kimberly Clausing, a top Biden administration Treasury tax official, and now a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The original proposal was relatively simple. Limited to a tiny group of corporations averaging profits of more than $1 billion a year, it would require I.R.S. auditors to look at the income reported to shareholders. If the companies paid taxes at a rate of less than 15 percent on those earnings, the new tax would kick in. It would hit as few as 80 corporations, according to one study.

Industry lobbyists swung into action, and Democrats in Congress began carving out enormous exceptions, permitting deductions for, say, businesses investing in heavy machinery and wireless spectrum used by the likes of T-Mobile and Verizon.

As a result of changes like these, the new tax’s projected revenue dropped to $222 billion from $319 billion, according to congressional estimates.

The amount of revenue is expected to shrink even more, in part because of the Treasury’s actions.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that Mr. Trump signed into law in July provided well over $1 trillion in relief for big companies when they calculate their income tax bills. But those breaks didn’t extend to the separate calculation that corporations must make for their alternative minimum tax bill. As a result, the regular tax bills of many businesses promise to drop so sharply — below 15 percent — that they could be newly subject to the alternative minimum tax.

The new law could have swept in two of the biggest crypto firms, Coinbase and Strategy. In response, they sought rule changes for calculating the minimum tax. Three high-powered legal advisers — Michael Desmond, who served as the I.R.S. chief counsel in the first Trump administration; Andrew Strelka, formerly senior tax counsel in the Biden administration; and Eugene Scalia, the labor secretary in the first Trump administration — pushed to exempt “mark to market” gains reported to investors. Those gains reflect the increase in value of the investments held by companies that haven’t been sold yet.

On Sept. 30, the I.R.S. granted their request, explicitly citing “digital assets.” Big crypto companies “have been granted a reprieve,” lawyers at Vedder Price wrote.

Strategy declared within hours that it “no longer expects to become subject to” the minimum tax, after previously disclosing a potential multibillion-dollar bill under the new tax.

Coinbase said in a statement that it supported the Trump administration’s approach to the regulations for administering the minimum tax. Strategy did not respond to a request for comment.

The crypto companies “owe tax and they’re not happy about it, so they’re going to the Trump administration for a special carve-out,” complained Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee.

Some energy firms are already benefiting, too. Cheniere Energy, the giant natural gas exporter, disclosed in a securities filing last month that, thanks to the most recent Treasury notice, it was entitled to a refund of $380 million of previously paid alternative minimum tax.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/02/multimedia/02biz-trump-taxcuts-01-jptw/02biz-trump-taxcuts-01-jptw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 11:17:04.555532

Sign up for their newsletter here.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and staff have administered what experts say was shoddy medical treatment to at least a dozen detainees at its Batavia facility in the past two years, Investigative Post has found.

Serious injuries went untreated, medications were denied or scaled back, and needed medical appointments were delayed at the ICE detention center.

In one case, a Nigerian migrant arrived in February at the detention facility suffering frostbite. A doctor who provided emergency care ordered that he see a specialist within a week before releasing him into immigration custody. Agents in Batavia never took him to the appointment. By the time he saw a doctor, it was too late to save his fingers; parts of six were later amputated.

In another case, a Gambian man with numerous heart issues was detained by ICE in February after he showed up for a routine check-in appointment. The man went two weeks without his medications. He suffered a stroke-like syndrome as a result, according to a doctor.

Attorneys and other detainee advocates told Investigative Post that the cases documented by this reporting are indicative of a wider problem. And a 2023 investigation by NPR found similar problems across ICE’s network of detention centers.

Sophie Dalsimer, an attorney with New York Lawyers for the Public Interest who has studied medical treatment in ICE facilities in New York, said the agency’s treatment of detainees amounts to “medical neglect in a legal sense.”

“The lack of medical care, and with ICE being deliberately indifferent to people’s medical needs, could, in many of these instances, rise to the level of a constitutional violation,” she said. “It certainly appears to be a violation of ICE’s own detention standards.”

Those standards include providing prescribed medications, timely responses to medical complaints, and hospitalization as needed.

The Batavia facility lacks a doctor and dentist working on-site. That’s for a 650-bed detention center that’s been overcapacity for months due to the Trump administration’s crackdown on migrants.

A Department of Homeland Security inspector general report published in June noted that “staffing shortages caused delays in dental and off-site specialty care.” Between September 2024 and February 2025, the report said, ICE had a 150-person backlog of detainees who required outside medical treatment and were waiting for appointments.

That problem was noted previously in a 2018 Civil Rights and Civil Liberties investigation into medical care at Batavia. That audit gave the facility a passing grade but also found “several examples of detainees waiting for various specialty health care services for more than a month.” In one case, a detainee waited 168 days for an endocrinology appointment. In another case, the auditor found that a detainee requested an outside doctor appointment for blood in his stool, but that ICE deleted the request from its internal system.

“It’s just freak luck that no one has died in Batavia in the last two years,” said Aaron Krupp, the regional coordinator at Justice for Migrant Families. “But the way that they have treated people, people really easily could have died.”

This story is based on a review of nearly 600 pages of court filings from seven lawsuits, medical records, and other documents, as well as interviews with a dozen people including detainees, attorneys and other experts. Neither ICE nor DHS, its parent agency, responded to detailed questions and requests about each case in this story.

Injuries Go Untreated

Chidi Nwagbo moved from Nigeria to the U.S. in 1988, living for 37 years as a “model resident” with no criminal history, according to his attorney. When Donald Trump took office in January, he said in a July interview, “things just went helter-skelter, like raids everywhere, and I didn’t know what to do.”

He made a plan to move to Canada to live with his brother and paid a smuggler $2,000 to shepherd him and three other migrants into Quebec. The final leg of the journey required them to cross the border on foot, but Nwagbo said he was unprepared for freezing temperatures and waist-deep snow. He and a woman in his party eventually called the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to rescue them.

After a hospital stint, he was released into federal immigration custody on February 10 with orders from a doctor that he see a specialist at Kessler Burn and Trauma Center in Rochester to treat his frostbitten fingers within a week. ICE never took him to the appointment, according to Nwagbo’s medical records, which he shared with Investigative Post. By the time he saw a different doctor at a different practice 16 days later, his fingers were too far gone. Amputations would be necessary, the doctor told him. He’s now missing portions of six fingers.

“I shouldn’t have lost my fingers,” he said.

The case of Tim, another Nigerian, is similar.

In April this year, Tim, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution against his family, was days away from finishing a federal prison sentence for a fraud conviction when he fell down a set of stairs. He suffered a major concussion and was taken to a Massachusetts hospital. Upon discharge, he was prescribed nine drugs, ordered to attend in-patient physical therapy, and transferred to the Batavia detention center. Once at the detention center, he went at least a month without medication and received only two physical therapy sessions before being deported this summer. By that point, Tim required a walker.

“I’m very traumatized at the moment,” he said during an interview with Investigative Post in May, several weeks after his injury. “I suffer a lot of mental health issues. I cannot sleep. I am on zero medications.”

Reached recently by email, Tim said his condition has only deteriorated since his return to Nigeria.

He wrote, “I am dire need of a comprehensive mental health/neurological treatment in order to get my life back to where it used to be before my detention in the United States.”

Medications denied

ICE, in some cases, denied detainees access to needed medications. In other cases, the agency allowed lapses in their medication schedules.

That was the case with Sering Ceesay, the Gambian man with heart conditions. He was detained by ICE in New York City on February 19 after what he expected to be a routine immigration appointment.

Instead, ICE placed him in shackles and chains and transported him to Batavia. He went two weeks without his medications. On March 4, he attended a legal clinic hosted by attorneys from the legal advocates at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, who quickly realized Ceesay needed medical attention, according to court filings.

“I was feeling very weak, and my entire body just hurt,” Ceesay said in a filing. “I felt like when I had my heart attacks.”

U.S. District Judge Lawrence Vilardo later ordered Ceesay released, but not before he was diagnosed with a stroke-like syndrome because he had missed so many days of his medicine.

“Without … strict adherence to these medications, [Ceesay] is likely to suffer from recurrent heart attacks, worsening peripheral artery disease and strokes and increasing his risk of further disability and avoidable premature death,” Dr. Joseph Shin, a physician and professor with Weill Cornell Medicine, wrote in a letter submitted as part of Ceesay’s lawsuit.

In Owen Simms’s case, ICE provided him with medication but lowered his dosages, he said, leaving him at risk of a seizure.

An extensive immigration and criminal history landed Simms in the Batavia detention center last March, where he remained until he was transferred to an out-of-state ICE facility in October. During a previous deportation to his home country, Jamaica, Simms was struck in the head with a machete, he and his wife testified in immigration court filings, which left him suffering from seizures. An immigration judge later ruled that he should not be deported due to the likelihood he’d be attacked again if he returned to Jamaica.

In an interview, Simms said his detention by ICE caused him to miss several days of his anti-seizure medication. He said the agency then lowered his daily dosage from 1,500 mg to 1,000 mg. He now worries he’ll suffer another seizure, which in the past has put him in a coma.

“My seizures come on to me when I’m sleeping, and if you’re not next to me, you can’t even know that I am having a seizure,” he said. “It’s scary, like it’s really scary.”

Five other detainees have claimed that ICE denied or delayed them receiving prescribed medication. ICE’s standards call for all detainees to be provided prescribed medications, including a week’s supply before a deportation.

In March 2024, an ICE transfer from Florida to Batavia caused Raheem Fulton, a Jamaican immigrant suffering from end-stage renal disease, to miss a regularly scheduled dialysis appointment. He went five days without the treatment and had to be rushed to the Erie County Medical Center. A spokesperson for RFK Human Rights said ICE caused additional lapses in his dialysis treatment in the past and delayed other medical appointments too. Attorneys for the group are currently suing ICE and have alleged the agency has delayed other treatments Fulton needs, including a cardiology appointment. (Fulton’s lawyers are appealing to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after a Buffalo judge dismissed it in January, agreeing with the government’s argument that the court lacked jurisdiction.)

In October 2024, ICE attempted, unsuccessfully, to deport Naim Qasemi to his native Afghanistan. Against its protocols, ICE failed to provide Qasemi with medications for his diagnosed bipolar disorder, his attorneys allege in a lawsuit to stop his deportation. Qasemi, they wrote, “was unmedicated and was not receiving any kind of therapeutic treatment in advance of his removal.” In court filings, Justice Department officials did not address Qasemi’s claim. A judge dismissed the case last month after Afghanistan cleared Qasemi’s return, paving the way for his deportation.

In a July letter to ICE officials in Batavia, advocates with Justice for Migrant Families wrote that a Honduran man was not receiving a prescribed medical cream to treat a skin condition. The man also suffers from chronic pain, and ibuprofen was no longer working, Jennifer Connor, the organization’s executive director, and Krupp wrote. They demanded ICE take the man to a specialist and administer a different pain medication. Krupp said that hasn’t happened.

Arzou Hami, an Iranian woman suffering from “serious mental health issues” was detained in June, as part of a sweep of Iranian migrants shortly after the U.S. bombed Iran. Matthew Borowski, her attorney, alleged in court filings that her detention has prevented her from receiving medications. She was detained by Buffalo ICE agents at the Niagara County Jail before being transferred to Texas where “she is being denied adequate mental health care,” Borowski wrote in a court filing. In an interview, he said his client has now gotten “some medication, but it’s not the same thing that she was on before.” Officials have not responded to those claims in court yet; the case was transferred to Texas last month.

In a fifth case, a detainee known only as K.U. in court filings alleged he has not received proper medical care for “numerous life-threatening health conditions.” His lawsuit states an independent physician reviewed the man’s case and “expressed extreme concern that he is ‘not receiving the standard of appropriate medical care.’” Officials have yet to address his medical claims in court, and a judge ordered him released in August.

In yet another case, a Jordanian named Mohammed Saleh had treatment for a massive brain tumor and a chronic eye condition delayed by ICE between the fall of 2023 and his deportation later that year

He arrived in Batavia in September 2023 following a federal prison sentence for his involvement in a failed bombing plot in the 1990s and began complaining of “tingling sensations in his fingers and toes” several weeks later. An MRI and a CT scan revealed the tumor. Krupp, of Justice for Migrant Families, said Saleh eventually attended follow-up appointments for his tumor but was only given ibuprofen and Tylenol as treatment. Saleh also had a prescribed injection for his eye condition delayed by three months.

Harmed While in Custody

Some detainees were not properly treated for an injury or illness they suffered while detained.

Lansine Sidibe, a Malian man, alleged he was beaten by seven guards at the Batavia facility in February 2024 after he refused to sign some paperwork. According to a human rights complaint his attorneys filed with the Department of Homeland Security’s office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in December, he alleged the guards broke his fingers, a claim an ICE doctor denied, according to the complaint. Nonetheless, it took a month before the agency agreed to X-ray his fingers.

Renny Arcaya-Ventura, a Venezuelan man, said in an interview that he suffered a severe allergic reaction and body pains after he was booked into the ICE facility and didn’t receive adequate medical care.

“I am in intense pain every day,” he said. “Every day I have a fever, pains in my body [and] I can’t even walk. I have even lost a lot of weight.”

His attorney, Guanlin Yang, shared photos of Arcaya-Ventura that appear to show swelling in his hands and rashes on his arms.

Arcaya-Ventura was deported in August.

Dalsimer, of New York Lawyers for the Public Interest, has studied medical care at the Orange County Jail — the second largest ICE detention facility in New York. Through her research and legal work, she’s concluded that medical care offered by ICE is “almost always subpar.”

“The abuses are consistent,” she said, “across all the facilities.”",https://centralcurrent.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/batavia2-scaled-1.webp,N,,2025-11-09 10:17:33.830427

The line between immigration enforcement and racial policing has vanished.","When President Donald Trump invoked an 18th-century wartime law to deport 252 Venezuelan men to a Salvadoran mega-prison, the images of rows of shackled migrants shaved bald and forced to kneel were meant to project control and dominance.

His administration called it a national-security triumph. In truth, it was a chilling statement of values: that people’s lives can be upended and destroyed without a shred of evidence that they pose any threat to the nation.

It revealed a government willing to tear families apart and ship people across borders not because of what they had done, but because of what they symbolized — a convenient target for political theater.

The deportations were not about danger or security; they were about power, and the ease with which it can be exercised over those deemed expendable.

The men deported to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center were accused of being gang members in “irregular warfare” against the United States, yet The New York Times found that most had no serious criminal record.

Their testimonies of beatings, sexual assault, and simulated drownings, verified by forensic experts as credible evidence of torture, revealed how far the administration was willing to go in the name of deterrence. This was not about public safety. It was about redefining immigration itself as a crime—and, by extension, treating entire communities as suspects.

The cruelty was not confined to that prison.

Days after the Times report, The Washington Post described another mass rupture: more than 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States lost their Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Overnight, people who had built stable lives—who worked, paid taxes, raised children, and contributed to their neighborhoods—became deportable. They lost work permits, driver’s licenses, and access to health care. Activist Adelys Ferro called it “the largest mass illegalization of a group in this country’s history.”

Together, these stories capture a core truth about the Trump era’s immigration strategy: it is not only a campaign against undocumented immigrants. It is a campaign against immigrant belonging itself. It weaponizes uncertainty, turns lawful presence into temporary privilege, and sends the message that no immigrant—regardless of status—is truly safe.

Trump’s immigration agenda has always relied on performance. The mass raids, the footage of families separated at the border, the declarations of “invasions” from Latin America—all serve to create an atmosphere of siege. The Salvadoran prison operation and the revocation of TPS for Venezuelans are extensions of the same logic. They transform policy into theater, where punishment substitutes for problem-solving and fear itself becomes the instrument of control.

For millions of immigrants—documented and undocumented alike—the impact has been pervasive and personal.

Families that once felt secure under TPS or DACA now live in limbo, rechecking expiration dates on work permits and scanning headlines for the next legal reversal. Green-card holders wonder whether their relatives will ever be allowed to join them.

Even naturalized citizens feel the stigma: they are stopped, profiled, and questioned more aggressively at airports, or told to “go back” in the towns where they’ve lived for decades.

This climate has eroded basic civic participation.

Parents skip parent-teacher conferences for fear of encountering law enforcement. Workers avoid reporting wage theft or unsafe conditions, knowing that retaliation could come in the form of a call to ICE. Domestic-violence survivors hesitate to seek protection orders because court buildings have become de facto immigration checkpoints.

Public health officials report that vaccination rates and prenatal care visits have dropped in immigrant neighborhoods since 2024, as families withdraw from every system that keeps them visible.

Fear works not only on the undocumented. It seeps outward, marking every brown or Black body as potentially foreign. Immigration enforcement has become inseparable from over-policing in communities of color.

Federal task forces and local police collaborations blur the line between immigration law and criminal law, subjecting Latino and Black residents to pretextual stops, raids, and warrantless detentions.

A person’s accent, skin tone, or zip code can now determine whether they are treated as neighbor or threat.

At its core, immigration policy is about who is recognized as part of “the people.”

When that recognition becomes conditional—dependent on paperwork, politics, or presidential whim—trust in government dissolves. Communities that once sought partnership with local police or city officials now feel hunted by them.

Faith leaders in Texas, California, and Illinois describe congregants too afraid to attend services because ICE vehicles park nearby. Social-service providers in Florida say families are disappearing overnight, leaving apartments unlocked and paychecks uncollected.

This collapse of trust has consequences far beyond immigration. Law enforcement depends on witnesses willing to come forward. Public health depends on patients seeking care. Schools depend on parent engagement.

When people are driven underground, everyone’s safety suffers. Crimes go unreported, outbreaks spread unchecked, and classrooms lose students whose parents have fled.

The administration’s claim that ending TPS will restore order ignores the reality that TPS recipients were order: they were legal workers filling essential jobs, taxpayers sustaining local economies, and volunteers anchoring civic life. Removing that foundation destabilizes the very communities that politicians claim to protect.

What we are witnessing is not just an immigration crackdown—it is a racial project. The administration’s rhetoric about “invasions,” “criminal aliens,” and “foreign terrorists” resurrects an old hierarchy in which whiteness defines Americanness. By casting entire nationalities as security threats, Trump revives the logic of the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese internment, and Operation Wetback. The Salvadoran prison images evoke a colonial tableau: brown bodies disciplined into submission for the comfort of a domestic audience.

This racialized spectacle reinforces other hierarchies. In Memphis and Chicago, federal “safe-city” task forces have targeted Black neighborhoods under the guise of crime control, using the same militarized tactics honed at the border. In Los Angeles, ICE raids on Latino workplaces and day-laborer sites have led families to skip doctor visits and school events. The line between immigration enforcement and racial policing has vanished. Communities of color are treated as testing grounds for policies that erode constitutional rights for everyone.

Perhaps the most disturbing element of the Trump approach is its contempt for due process. The Venezuelans deported to El Salvador were given little or no hearing before being branded as “terrorists.” TPS was terminated despite clear statutory and humanitarian grounds for extension. Immigration courts are buried under more than four million pending cases, with many respondents unrepresented and proceedings held by video in makeshift facilities. Detention centers overflow, their conditions described by federal judges as “obviously unconstitutional.”

This erosion of procedure undermines the rule of law itself. When the state can deport without hearing, detain without charge, and torture without accountability, it ceases to act as a lawful government and begins to act as an occupying force. And when these tactics are normalized against immigrants, they set a precedent that can be used against anyone. The border is not a fixed place—it is an idea that can expand inward.

Yet amid the fear, there is resilience. Cities like Bridgeport, Connecticut, have passed resolutions demanding transparency from ICE and pledging to protect immigrant residents. Legal-aid groups are mounting challenges to the misuse of the Alien Enemies Act and to the termination of TPS. Churches are offering sanctuary again, reviving an old moral tradition of civil disobedience. These acts of resistance remind us that immigration policy is not an abstraction—it is the sum of choices made at every level of government, from the courthouse to the city council.

But local resistance alone cannot fix what is fundamentally a federal moral failure. Congress must codify pathways to permanence for TPS and DACA holders, fund independent oversight of detention facilities, and prohibit the use of foreign prisons in immigration enforcement. Courts must reassert that wartime powers cannot be repurposed to bypass asylum law. And civil society—from journalists to educators—must continue exposing the human cost of policies that hide behind bureaucratic euphemisms.

For those who believe these policies affect only “illegal immigrants,” the lesson of history is clear: rights denied to one group rarely stop there. Every expansion of executive power to detain, surveil, or deport without trial eventually ensnares others. The Patriot Act was sold as a counter-terrorism tool; it ended up monitoring millions of citizens. Today’s mass deportations and foreign detentions could become tomorrow’s template for domestic dissent.

Communities of color understand this intimately because they have lived it before. From COINTELPRO to stop-and-frisk, the pattern is familiar: fear is invoked, exceptions are carved out, and the exceptions become the rule. Immigrants are simply the current frontier of that project.

If America continues down this path, it risks more than its moral standing—it risks the integrity of its democracy. A society that governs by humiliation cannot sustain equal justice. A government that builds legitimacy through cruelty cannot command consent. When law becomes a weapon against the vulnerable, it loses its authority over the powerful.

The alternative is not naïve idealism. It is pragmatic decency. Enforcement can exist within bounds that respect dignity and the rule of law. The United States has the capacity to process asylum claims efficiently, to renew TPS when conditions demand it, and to integrate newcomers who strengthen communities rather than destabilize them. What is missing is political courage—the will to replace spectacle with substance.

We should remember that every immigrant policy sends two messages: one to those arriving, and another to those already here. The first declares what kind of country we are; the second declares what kind of citizens we will be. When cruelty becomes normalized, it shapes not only how we treat others but how we imagine ourselves.

Trump’s immigration policies have inflicted fear and trauma far beyond the border. They have hollowed trust, divided neighbors, and licensed racial scapegoating as governance. But they have also forced a reckoning. The question is no longer whether we can secure the border. It is whether we can secure our conscience.

America’s strength has never been measured by its ability to punish the desperate. It has been measured by its capacity for fairness—by the courage to uphold rights even when fear is loudest. The Venezuelans sent to a foreign prison, the families losing TPS, the communities raided in Chicago and Los Angeles—they are not outsiders to the American story. They are its test.

The measure of a democracy is not the power to deport, but the power to protect. And right now, that measure is failing.

,Human Rights,2025-11-09 12:01:19+00:00,CBC,Advocates concerned temporary immigration cuts don't address systemic issues - CBC,"Matthew Robertson, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/impacts-federal-government-carney-temporary-immigration-9.6971297,"The cuts are being made to the temporary foreign worker program and the international student program.
The TFW program allows employers to hire foreign workers to fill positions that are unable to be filled by Canadians.
The program also prevents temporary foreign workers from pursuing permanent residency because they are seen as “low-skilled,” she said.
Last year, after the federal government placed a cap on international students, institutions struggled to fill the financial gap.
“Targeting international students without addressing the real issue of funding in post-secondary is a short-sighted approach,” said Fairweather.","The Carney government’s first budget will significantly reduce the number of temporary immigrants it admits to Canada over the next three years.

The cuts are being made to the temporary foreign worker program and the international student program. The 2026 target for temporary foreign worker (TFW) arrivals is now 60,000, down from the 82,000 the government announced last year, and the international student target is now 150,000, down from 305,900.

The move aligns with the tougher stance the Carney government has made on immigration compared to his predecessor, Justin Trudeau.

During a conversation at the Canadian Club in Toronto on Friday, Carney mentioned that in 2018 temporary residents were about three per cent of Canada's population, and by the time he became prime minister they made up 7.5 per cent.

“That is an enormous shift in a very short period of time, and far exceeded our ability to welcome people and make sure that they had good housing and services,” said Carney.

The TFW program allows employers to hire foreign workers to fill positions that are unable to be filled by Canadians.

Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has said he wants the federal government to scrap the program entirely, saying it has led to increased youth unemployment by importing cheap labour.

""The Liberals have to answer: Why is it that they are shutting our own youth out of jobs and replacing them with low-wage, temporary foreign workers from poor countries who are ultimately being exploited?"" he said in September.

But Lynn Bueckert, the secretary business manager for the Hospital Employees' Union in B.C., said in a statement that foreign workers are filling critical positions — “sustaining the system, not draining it.”

Marisa Berry Mendez, a campaigner with the francophone wing of Amnesty International Canada, said the TFW cuts do not address the exploitative nature of the program.

A report from Amnesty International called on the federal government to overhaul the TFW program and Tomoya Obokata, a special rapporteur for the UN Human Rights Office, called the program “a breeding ground for contemporary forms of slavery.”

The top occupations for temporary foreign workers are in agriculture, often as general farm workers or harvesting labourers.

Berry Mendez said the root of the problem is that the TFW visa ties the worker to their employer. The program also prevents temporary foreign workers from pursuing permanent residency because they are seen as “low-skilled,” she said.

“If they’re in a situation of abuse then they’re pretty much trapped,” she said.

During the process of assembling the Amnesty International report, Berry Mendez said she heard stories of wage theft, unsafe living and working conditions, verbal abuse, sexual abuse and violence.

Bueckert wants to see a “federal pathway to permanent residency for health-care workers,” and Berry Mendez said permanent immigration should be used to meet the “vast majority of labour market demands.”

The cuts to international students could have a significant impact on the resources of post-secondary institutions, said Annabree Fairweather, the executive director of the Confederation of University Faculty Associations of B.C.

In Canada, undergraduate international students were expected to pay an average of $41,746 in tuition this school year, compared with $7,734 for domestic students.

Universities and colleges across the country have increasingly relied upon international students for funding. Provincial funding to universities fell from 60.7 per cent in 2008-09 to 44.8 per cent in 2022-23. The average was weighed down by Ontario, whose public funding fell from 54.3 per cent in 2008-09 to 32.5 per cent in 2022-23.

Last year, after the federal government placed a cap on international students, institutions struggled to fill the financial gap. The Council of Ontario Universities projected a financial loss of $300 million for last school year, and worsening losses in the years following.

Post-secondary institutions have had to reduce costs by cutting programs and teaching positions. Conestoga College, based in Kitchener, Ont., cut several programs days before the start of the school year, and said it will axe around 80 programs before next fall.

Wasiimah Joomun, the executive director of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, said cuts are widespread in post-secondary education.

“At the institution level, even at the student union level, they are now having conversations about what are the core services that we do absolutely need to provide and what are the core services we can let go,” said Joomun.

Fairweather said the reduction in resources has negative effects on both students and faculty. Cuts to staff mean larger class sizes and less administrative support, causing work to be downloaded on remaining instructors.

“That work distribution is contributing to, honestly, a real crisis of burnout and the faculty being unable to deliver the kinds of quality education that they have traditionally been able to offer students,” said Fairweather.

Both Fairweather and Joomun said federal and provincial governments need to reassess how they fund education in order to make up for the shortfall the reduction of international student tuition causes.

“Targeting international students without addressing the real issue of funding in post-secondary is a short-sighted approach,” said Fairweather.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/0c4da258-0e4d-4b45-a94b-08072f98e7bb,1762461433755/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C322%2C7972%2C4484%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-09 07:17:08.514905

Lawsuits against private prison operators could discourage companies from helping Trump carry out his policies, amounting to “judicial gum in the works of democracy,” Geo says.
The Supreme Court will hear oral argument in the case, The Geo Group v. Menocal, on Monday.
Geo is America’s largest private prison operator and the biggest jailer of immigrants for ICE.
Now, a range of similar lawsuits are pending against Geo and its main competitor in the private prison business, CoreCivic.","At a for-profit immigrant prison in Colorado, prisoners say they were threatened with solitary confinement if they refused to work as unpaid janitors, cleaning common areas of the facility for free. Rather than hiring—and paying—regular employees to do the work, the company allegedly boosted its profits by making the immigrants do it instead.

“We are not slaves. We are detainees. And we should not be forced to clean. That’s wrong,” Alejandro Menocal, an immigrant who was held in the Aurora, Colorado, facility and is now suing the prison company, testified in a deposition.

Across the country, for-profit prison companies are facing similar lawsuits, alleging that they violate the federal law banning forced labor, as well as state minimum-wage laws, by coercing immigrant prisoners to work either for free or for just a dollar a day.

Now the company that runs that Colorado prison, the Geo Group, is asking the Supreme Court for help. It says it needs immunity from lawsuits like Menocal’s. Much as the government enjoys sovereign immunity from some suits, Geo believes it is similarly entitled to immunity as a government contractor.

If the company does not have protection from these lawsuits, Geo argues, opponents of the Trump administration’s immigration policies could wage a “proxy war” against it. Lawsuits against private prison operators could discourage companies from helping Trump carry out his policies, amounting to “judicial gum in the works of democracy,” Geo says.

The Supreme Court will hear oral argument in the case, The Geo Group v. Menocal, on Monday. Lined up against Geo are some unusual allies, including a major public-sector union, the conservative think-tank Cato Institute, the good-government group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington—and the Trump administration itself, which argues that private prison companies may deserve immunity but this case isn’t the right way to give it to them.

The Supreme Court’s decision could not only determine whether the immigrant prisoners will ever get their day in court, it could make it harder for anyone to sue government contractors—creating a category of companies that, opponents fear, would be above the law.

The case against the Geo Group stretches back more than a decade, when a group of immigrants who had been locked up at the company’s Aurora facility claimed that Geo’s requirement for them to clean the prison’s common areas—in addition to cleaning their personal spaces, which they didn’t object to—amounted to unlawful forced labor.

Geo is America’s largest private prison operator and the biggest jailer of immigrants for ICE. It operates both traditional prisons, which hold people accused or convicted of crimes, and immigrant prisons, holding people not because they are accused of any crime but because they are waiting for their immigration cases to be resolved. After President Trump’s election, Geo’s stock rocketed up by 65 percent. The company is in line for billions of dollars in new contracts as ICE’s budget balloons under the Trump administration.

ICE pays Geo millions of dollars a year to run the Aurora prison. “But GEO didn’t perform the work itself: It required those detained in its facility to do it,” the immigrant plaintiffs wrote in their Supreme Court filing. “The company forced every person detained at Aurora to perform unpaid janitorial work, sending them to ‘the hole’—solitary confinement—if they refused.”

The plaintiffs say that, inside the prison, immigrants were well aware of Geo’s for-profit status and how they were being used to boost the company’s bottom line. But with the threat of solitary confinement forever looming, they felt they didn’t have much choice but to do the free labor.

“I was scared of going to the hole. Being in detention is already scary, and the hole is so much worse,” Olga Alexakhina, one of those held at the Aurora prison, testified.

Another former prisoner, Hugo Hernandez-Ceren, said that people returning from solitary seemed shattered. “They were really skinny; they had lost a lot of weight. They wouldn’t talk to other people anymore. They seemed afraid. They—they became antisocial,” he said in a deposition.

With the consequences for dissent so severe, prisoners often relented to the guards’ demands that they clean, despite their objections to doing free work for their for-profit jailer. Hernandez-Ceren said he saw one prisoner tell a guard “that he was going to not clean because he was no janitor and that he was not being paid for that type of job and that they had to hire someone to do that.” In response, according to Hernandez-Ceren, the guard took out a bag and said, “Just pack your stuff because you’re going to go to the hole.” That was enough of a threat. The prisoner “started cleaning right away,” Hernandez-Ceren said.

The plaintiffs argue that this violates a federal law that prohibits obtaining a person’s labor by means of force or certain threats of harm. Geo denies it has done anything wrong, and it says it carefully follows the requirements of its contracts with ICE.

The company did not respond to a request for comment.

In addition to requiring prisoners to clean common areas for free, the company also employs prisoners, usually for a dollar a day, to do a variety of other work in its prisons. “We ran the facility—the landscape, the laundry, the kitchen, we washed the floor,” Menocal said in court filings. And while these dollar-a-day jobs were voluntary—prisoners were not sent to solitary if they refused—the litigants argue they were still coerced into doing the work. The food that Geo provided was inadequate, leaving them “chronically hungry,” they say, and giving them no choice but to buy more from the commissary. And to buy food, they needed money. So they worked for whatever Geo would pay them.

“They were using us like slaves. One dollar a day. Unfair. Treating us like dirt,” Menocal said.

These dollar-a-day work programs are widespread and have “subsidized the private prison industry model,” according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council. With prisoners working for so little, “they don’t have to have to hire as many people to staff the facility,” he said.

Now, a range of similar lawsuits are pending against Geo and its main competitor in the private prison business, CoreCivic.

In Washington State, immigrants who had worked for a dollar a day in a Geo Group facility sued the company for violating the state’s minimum-wage law. They went to trial and won, with a jury ordering Geo to pay more than $17 million in back pay and a court docking the company another $5.9 million in unjust enrichment. An appeals court upheld the judgment, explaining that because of the dollar-a-day workers, “Geo operated its facility with just a handful of full-time staff hired from the local area, thereby saving millions of dollars that it would otherwise have spent on payroll.”

At the Supreme Court on Monday, the issue is not whether these work programs violate forced labor or minimum-wage laws—in most of the cases, that is still to be decided by lower courts—but instead a narrower legal question that could have wide-ranging implications: What kind of immunity does a contractor like the Geo Group have, and when can Geo raise it in court?

Geo argues that it should be able to assert immunity right away and get out of the lawsuit at the earliest possible moment. It believes that as long as it properly followed the instructions of the federal government, it cannot be sued for its actions.

Geo’s argument rests on the idea of “derivative sovereign immunity.” Sovereign immunity is the rule, dating back to the British monarchy, that the government cannot be sued without its consent. Congress has passed laws that allow for lawsuits against the federal government in some circumstances but not others. Derivative sovereign immunity is similar. The idea is that if the government was legally entitled to pursue some action without the threat of a lawsuit, that immunity should extend to any outside contractor hired to pursue the same action on the government’s behalf.

“While the government’s sovereign immunity prevents those who disagree with federal immigration policy from suing the government directly, contractors like Geo are regularly subject to suits that drive up their costs,” Geo told the Supreme Court.

The lower court denied Geo’s claim of immunity. The company appealed, but the appellate court decided that it was too soon for Geo to raise the immunity issue, saying that it would have to wait until the final resolution of the case to appeal. Now, at the Supreme Court, Geo argues that waiting until then would defeat the point of having immunity in the first place.

Geo’s opponents say that private companies don’t get the government’s immunity from being sued. Instead, they say that if contractors act legally and follow the government’s instructions properly, they can raise that as a defense. The difference between an immunity and a defense is key: An immunity would mean that contractors could avoid lawsuits entirely—if someone sues them, they could get out of it right away—while a defense would usually mean that the contractor, like anyone else, could be sued and would have to go through litigation, possibly including discovery and a trial, before a court would ultimately decide whether its defense would win the day. If the contractor only has a defense rather than immunity, then the plaintiffs could still make their case in court.

Geo’s opponents argue that giving contractors immunity misses the point of immunity in the first place—which, according to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, is to let the government do what it believes is in the public interest without being constantly hauled into court. But a for-profit company acts in its private interest, not in the public interest. Geo’s “drastic expansion of sovereign immunity,” the group wrote in a court filing, is “contrary to the public’s interest in a responsive and efficient government animated solely by the need to serve the American people.”

Even the Trump administration has come out against Geo, although in a more limited way. It argues that contractor immunity should be decided by Congress or a special rulemaking body, not in a court decision.

The outcome of the Supreme Court case will likely affect more than only the forced labor and minimum-wage lawsuits against Geo. One brief in support of the immigrants warned that Geo’s theory would “weaken accountability for violations of individual liberties,” making it harder, if not impossible, for people whose rights were violated by private contractors to hold those companies accountable.

That includes any kind of contractor, not just prison operators. “Insulating private government contractors from liability to those they have harmed will only erode accountability,” a public employee union said in a brief supporting the immigrants. The Supreme Court’s decision in the case is expected by July.",https://images.newrepublic.com/8742572062a6c4d95d9306e739170e623606e2f4.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-11-09 10:56:31.771264

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: “Someone tell Keir Starmer it is illegal to cross the Channel illegally. These figures lay bare the collapse of border enforcement under Labour.

“Even more staggering, not a single person was convicted under Section 25 for facilitating illegal entry, the law designed to target smugglers. Meanwhile, convicted offenders from countries like Albania, Sudan, Iraq, and Iran are still being housed at taxpayers’ expense instead of being deported.

“This is what happens when you put human rights lawyers in charge of border control. The British people deserve a system that actually enforces the law.”

Of the 30 convicted pilots, 11 were from Sudan; four were from Iran and three were Palestinian. And of the 38 passengers, the greatest number were from Albania (seven), followed by Iraq (five) and Afghanistan and Vietnam (both four). The figures do not take account of the work of the National Crime Agency.

Setting out how he would tackle small boats crisis, Mr Philp said the Tories would “leave the ECHR, remove all illegal immigrants within a week of arrival” and “end the merry-go-round of appeals”. He claimed the Prime Minister “doesn’t have the backbone to do this”.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The information set out in the FOI relates only to convictions obtained by Immigration Enforcement in the first six months of this year and does not represent the activity taken across law enforcement to tackle this threat. We are taking decisive action to dismantle the organised criminal networks behind small boat crossings which danger lives and compromise UK border security.”

But while crossings have slowed, border advocates say the human toll of migration has not.

According to CBP, illegal crossings in September fell to 26,002 nationwide, marking a 93% decrease from the peak of President Joe Biden's administration. Officials also reported zero parole releases for the fifth consecutive month, crediting enforcement measures for what they called “the most secure border in American history.”

Despite the progress federal officials describe, members of the Border Network for Human Rights (BNHR) in El Paso are using the Day of the Dead season to remind the public of those who have lost their lives seeking safety or opportunity in the United States.

“What we are doing here in our community is remembering the people who have died along the U.S.-México border,” said Alan Lizárraga, a spokesperson for BNHR.

The organization built a series of small altars this week to honor migrants who died during their journeys north. While CBP has not yet released an official figure for migrant deaths this fiscal year, hundreds have died in recent years, often due to heat exposure and dehydration in remote desert areas.

Lizárraga says that even as migration slows, the dangers persist and may even increase due to stricter enforcement policies.

“We believe that migrant deaths and the policies that we have have a direct correlation,” he said. “We are seeing policies pushing people to take alternative routes that are dangerous because of the terrain and conditions they go through.”

The BNHR also highlights concerns over deaths of those in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, 18 people have died in ICE custody over the past year, twelve of them between December 2023 and September 2024, with causes ranging from leukemia and strokes to suicide.

“Regardless of whether migration is high or low, we still have a system that doesn’t care about their lives,” Lizárraga said. “We are spending so much money militarizing the border instead of fixing a broken immigration and asylum system.”

For now, CBP officials say their focus remains on maintaining control of the border, while advocates continue calling for reforms they believe would make the journey safer for those who still decide to take it.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/AP22103751696259_crop,N,,2025-11-09 07:17:50.688048

The archbishop’s statement — posted in both English and Spanish on the archdiocesan website and the archbishop’s social media platforms, along with a video version of the message — follows months of immigration raids and arrests under President Donald Trump‘s crackdown on immigrants lacking permanent legal status in the U.S., a group known to be majority Catholic Christians.

“My heart is heavy because of the continued fear and anxiety that runs through the community of our Hispanic brothers and sisters in this archdiocese,” said Archbishop Sample. “This is due to the increased ICE activity within our communities, even now in the vicinity of some of our parishes.”

Upheaval in Portland amid ICE activity

Oregon has become one of several flashpoints for tensions over the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policies, with regular protests taking place outside the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland.

“I want to assure our Hispanic brothers and sisters that the shepherds of the church in the United States are working diligently to advocate for their humane and respectful treatment. We are doing all that we can to alleviate this suffering,” said Archbishop Sample, who noted he is currently attending the annual U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops‘ fall plenary meeting in Baltimore.

Both Portland, Oregon’s largest city, and the state government have codified their sanctuary status, prohibiting their respective law enforcement personnel from assisting any federal agency with immigration enforcement.

In September, Trump federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect the building. The city of Portland and the state of Oregon sued, with U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut — a Trump appointee — temporarily blocking the deployment of the troops in an October order made permanent Nov. 7.

More than 200 individuals residing in Oregon have been detained by ICE officers since Trump took office, said Reyna Lopez, executive director of the farmworker advocacy organization PCUN (Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste), during an Oct. 31 press conference in Portland.

Several North Portland public schools have implemented “secure the perimeter” protocols — locking all exterior doors while continuing learning activities — in response to reported ICE activity. On Nov. 6, some 100 community members surrounded César Chávez School an hour ahead of dismissal to watch out for ICE officers during student pickup.

Catholic teaching on immigration, deportation

Catholic social teaching on immigration balances three interrelated principles — the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation’s duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

The Catholic Church’s teaching also makes clear human laws regulating migration are also subject to divine justice, but it has not yet issued teaching exploring the morality of deportation beyond the magisterium of St. John Paul II.

The late pontiff’s 1993 encyclical “Veritatis Splendor” (“Splendor of Truth”) and 1995 encyclical “Evangelium Vitae” (“The Gospel of Life”) — both quote the Second Vatican Council’s teaching in “Gaudium et Spes,” the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, naming “deportation” among various specific acts “offensive to human dignity” that “are a disgrace, and so long as they infect human civilization they contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer injustice, and they are a negation of the honor due to the Creator.”

He underscored their moral severity in “Veritatis Splendor” by calling them examples of “intrinsic evil,” explaining that, no matter the motives, these acts are “not capable of being ordered to God and to the good of the person.”

Across the U.S., Christians account for approximately 80% of all of those at risk of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort, with the single largest group of affected Christians being Catholics, according to a joint Catholic-Evangelical report published by World Relief.

Nationwide: 1 in 6 Catholics potentially directly affected by ICE activity

The report found one in six Catholics (18%) are either vulnerable to deportation or live with someone who is.

According to a Pew Research Center data analysis from March 2025, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29%) or the children of immigrants (14%). But eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics are either born outside the U.S. (58%) or are the children of an immigrant (22%), while 92% of Asian Catholics are either immigrants (78%) or are the children of an immigrant (14%). Far fewer white Catholics — just 15% — share this immigrant experience: only 6% were born outside the U.S., with another 9% born in the U.S. to at least one immigrant parent.

“As your archbishop and spiritual father, I wish I could remove this cross from you,” Archbishop Sample told the Hispanic Catholic faithful in his message.

The archbishop assured them he was “deeply concerned over what you are experiencing right now, along with all of your local parish priests. I know this is a great burden for them as well, because they feel helpless to take this cross from you. … Please know that I and your pastors stand with you in solidarity during this difficult time.”

Archbishop Sample also addressed priests “who are caring for people during these difficult times,” promising his “support and prayers.”

“We are in this together to uphold the dignity of every human person, every child of God,” said Archbishop Sample, urging all to “lean on the love that Jesus has for each one of us.

“He alone is our hope, and in him alone do we trust. He is with you always and will never abandon you,” said the archbishop. “Place yourselves in his hands.”

Portland archbishop’s message concludes with ‘Viva Cristo Rey’

Archbishop Sample concluded his message with “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” (“Long live Jesus Christ!”) — the battle cry of the Cristeros, who defied the anti-Catholic, secular government of Mexico during the Cristero War of 1926-1929. The Cristeros’ defiant cry was made famous in particular by Blessed Miguel Pro. The Mexican martyr and Jesuit priest extended his arms in the form of a cross and shouted those words before he was executed by firing squad in 1927.

In 2000, St. John Paul II canonized 25 martyrs from the Cristero War. In 2016, Pope Francis canonized the most recent Cristero martyr, St. José Sánchez del Río, a teenager remembered for repeating “¡Viva Cristo Rey!” many times before his own public martyrdom in 1928.

The high court in Johannesburg has ordered an anti-migrant vigilante group to stop blocking foreigners from entering government health facilities and schools, actions it said were unconstitutional.

The group, named Operation Dudula from the Zulu for “force out”, was founded in 2021. Its self-described mandate is to remove African migrants – by force, if necessary – from the country. It blames them for South Africa’s rampant crime, inequality and unemployment.

Some politicians have capitalised on and stoked xenophobia in the country, which has a history of extreme violence towards black African foreigners.

Judge Leicester Adams ruled that Dudula must stop spreading hate speech and stop evicting foreign nationals from their homes or stalls. He also said the police cannot search foreigners’ homes without a warrant, and must have a clear reason to believe someone is in the country illegally before asking for identification.

In two of South Africa’s provinces, Dudula members stopped people they suspected of being foreign nationals from accessing hospitals, demanding they produce identification.

In response, rights groups including Kopanang Africa Against Xenophobia and Abahlali baseMjondolo took the group to court in 2023.

The national immigration and police departments, who have been accused of aiding Operation Dudula, were also named as respondents. Dudula did not oppose the court application. The judge noted that “they were aware of it and decided to ignore the court proceedings”.

Abahlali’s Mqapheli Bonono told The Continent what Dudula was doing was clearly illegal. But they weren’t stopped by police, private security or hospital management, who Bonono said were complicit. Kopanang’s media organiser Mike Ndlovu said the ruling “sets a crucial precedent that the rule of law, not mob justice, protects everyone in South Africa regardless of nationality”.

The group of “suburban moms,” several reportedly from Oak Park, were arrested after they hopped barricades and sat down in a circle together in the middle of the Beach Street driveway leading into the federal facility. The women were arrested by Cook County Sheriff’s deputies less than a minute later, according to the sheriff’s office.

The agency said that 15 women ages 23 to 59 were arrested in total, with all of them now facing charges of disorderly conduct and obstruction.

The protestors had set out “to demand an end to the unjust separation of families, as well as the campaign of chaos and intimidation by federal agents in the Chicago area,” according to a statement from protest organizers provided to Wednesday Journal.

“We have all seen the power of parents connecting together to care for everyone’s children and to keep each other safe. We know that community is the key to holding our government agencies accountable for their actions,” said Nikki Kidd, one of the mothers who participated in the protest. “We cannot continue to let our government traumatize children, neighbors, teachers, laborers, and anyone else in our community who is now on constant high alert. If they will drag a teacher out of a daycare, what is next?”

The group includes some of the latest Oak Park residents to be arrested at protests at the facility, which was the subject of several court orders issued by a federal judge on Wednesday concerning the reported inhumane treatment of detainees.

Last year “it wasn’t Latino voters turning out for the Republican Party, it was Latino voters turning out for President Trump,” he said.
“The job of the Democratic Party is now to reach out to Latino voters in ways that are more than just symbolic.”","Washington – President Donald Trump made historic gains with Latinos when he won reelection last year, boosting Republicans’ confidence that their economic message was helping them make inroads with a group of voters who had long leaned toward Democrats.

But in this week’s election, Democrats in key states were able to disrupt that rightward shift by gaining back Latino support, exit polls showed.

In New Jersey and Virginia, the Democrats running for governor made gains in counties with large Latino populations, and overall won two-thirds of the Latino vote in their states, according to an NBC News poll.

And in California, a CNN exit poll showed about 70% of Latinos voting in favor of Proposition 50, a Democratic redistricting initiative designed to counter Trump’s plans to reshape congressional maps in an effort to keep GOP control of the House.

The results mark the first concrete example at the ballot box of Latino voters turning away from the GOP – a shift foreshadowed by recent polling as their concerns about the economy and immigration raids have grown.

If the trend continues, it could spell trouble for Republicans in next year’s midterm elections, said Gary Segura, a professor of public policy, political science and Chicana/o studies at UCLA. This could be especially true in California and Texas, where both parties are banking on Latino voters to help them pick up seats in the House, Segura said.

“A year is a long time in politics, but certainly the vote on Prop. 50 is a very, very good sign for the Democrats’ ability to pick up the newly drawn congressional districts,” Segura said. “I think Latino voters will be really instrumental in the outcome.”

Democrats, meanwhile, are feeling optimistic that their warnings about Trump’s immigration crackdown and a bad economy are resonating with Latinos.

Republicans are wondering to what degree the party can maintain support among Latinos without Trump on the ticket. In 2024, Trump won roughly 48% of the Latino vote nationally– a record for any Republican presidential candidate.

Some Republicans saw this week’s trends among Latino voters as a “wake-up call.”

“The Hispanic vote is not guaranteed. Hispanics married President Donald Trump but are only dating the GOP,” Republican Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida said in a social media video the day after the election. “I’ve been warning it: If the GOP does not deliver, we will lose the Hispanic vote all over the country.”

Economic issues a main driver

Last year Trump was able to leverage widespread frustration with the economy to win the support of Latinos. He promised to create jobs and lower the costs of living.

But polling shows that a majority of Latino voters now disapprove of how Trump and the Republicans in control of Congress are handling the economy. Half of Latinos said they expected Trump’s economic policies to leave them worse off a year from now in a Unidos poll released last week.

In New Jersey, that sentiment was exemplified by voters like Rumaldo Gomez. He told MSNBC he voted for Trump last year but this week went for the Democratic candidate for governor, Rep. Mikie Sherrill.

“Now, I look at Trump different,” Gomez said. “The economy does not look good.”

Gomez added he is “very sad” about immigration raids led by the Trump administration that have split up hardworking families.

While Latino voters fear being affected by immigration enforcement actions, polling suggests they are more concerned about cost of living, jobs and housing. The Unidos poll showed immigration ranking fifth on the list of concerns.

In New Jersey and Virginia, Democrats’ double-digit victories were built on promises to reduce the cost of living, while blaming Trump for their economic pain.

Marcus Robinson, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said Democrats “expanded margins and flipped key counties by earning back Latino voters who know Trump’s economy leaves them behind.”

“These results show that Latino communities want progress, not a return to chaos and broken promises,” he said.

Republicans see a different Trump issue

GOP strategist Matt Terrill, who was chief of staff for then-Sen. Marco Rubio’s 2016 presidential campaign, said the election results are not a referendum on Trump.

Latino voters swung left because Trump wasn’t on the ballot, he said.

Last year “it wasn’t Latino voters turning out for the Republican Party, it was Latino voters turning out for President Trump,” he said. “Like him or not, he’s able to fire up voters that the Republican Party traditionally does not get.”

With Trump barred by the Constitution from running for a third term, Republicans are left to wonder if they can get the Latino vote back when he is not on the ballot. Terrill believes Republicans need to hammer on the issue of affordability as a top priority.

Mike Madrid, a “never Trump” Republican and former political director of the California Republican Party, has a different theory.

“They’re abandoning both parties,” Madrid said of Latinos. “They abandoned the Republican Party for the same reasons they abandoned the Democratic Party in November: not addressing economic concerns.”

The economy has long been the top concern for Latinos, Madrid said, yet both parties continue to frame the Latino political agenda around immigration.

“Latinos aren’t voting for Democrats or Republicans – they’re voting against Democrats and against Republicans,” Madrid said. “It’s a very big difference. The partisans are all looking at us as if we’re this peculiar exotic little creature.”

The work ahead

Democrat Abigail Spanberger was elected governor in Virginia in part because of big gains in Latino-heavy communities. One of the biggest gains was in Manassas Park, where more than 40% of residents are Latino. She won the city by 42 points, doubling the Democrats’ performance there in last year’s election.

The shift toward Democrats happened because Latinos believed Trump when he promised to bring down high costs of living and that he would only go after violent criminals in immigration raids, said Democratic strategist Maria Cardona, who worked with Spanberger’s campaign on outreach to Spanish-language media.

Instead, she argued, Trump betrayed them.

Cardona said Medicaid cuts under Trump’s massive spending package this year, along with the reduction of supplemental nutrition assistance amid the government shutdown, have Latinos families panicking.

“What Republicans misguidedly and mistakenly thought was a realignment of Latino voters just turned out to be a blip,” she said. “Latinos should never be considered a base vote.”

Political scientists caution that the election outcomes this week are not necessarily indicative of how races will play out a year from now.

“It’s just one election, but certainly the seeds have been planted for strong Latino Democratic turnouts in 2026,” said Brad Jones, a political science professor at UC Davis.

Now, both parties need to explain how they expect to carry out their promises if elected.

“They can’t sit on their laurels and say, ‘well surely the Latinos are coming back because the economy is bad and immigration enforcement is bad,’” Jones said. “The job of the Democratic Party is now to reach out to Latino voters in ways that are more than just symbolic.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/08/PDTN/87170102007-ap-23059076751012.jpg?crop=5611,3157,x0,y104&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-09 11:17:07.707453

Snopes readers wrote in looking for more information about the situation. We reached out to Jimenez's lawyer and the Department of Homeland Security looking for more details, but had not heard back at time of publication.

According to The New York Times, Jimenez, who is a U.S. citizen, was on his way to his job at a food bank in Ontario, California, when he noticed ICE agents blocking traffic near a bus stop where children would soon be gathering on their way to school. He pulled over his car to ask immigration officers to clear the street and move away from the bus stop, the Times reported.

So far, there has been no video evidence documenting what happened next, and DHS and Jimenez have provided conflicting accounts. (It's worth noting that The New York Times previously investigated a case in which an ICE agent fatally shot a man in Chicago, and found discrepancies in the official DHS account. )

According to a court document filed against Jimenez, who was charged with assaulting a federal officer, one of the officers — gun in hand — approached Jimenez and told him to leave, then took out a canister of pepper spray. Jimenez briefly drove forward and away from the incident before ""rapidly"" reversing back towards a second officer, the criminal complaint says.

The officer with the pepper spray then shot Jimenez in the shoulder through the back window, according to the document. Trisha McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, told ABC News that ""the subject fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle."" Jimenez later checked himself into a hospital, where, after treatment, he was arrested by federal officers before being released on bond.

Statements Jimenez's lawyer provided the LA Times, The New York Times, ABC News and the news radio station KPCC agreed with some details — the agent approached Jimenez with a gun in hand and took out his pepper spray, while Jimenez quickly reversed his vehicle.

They disagreed with other details, though — according to the lawyers, Jimenez, who was afraid, had to back up in order to leave, he said, because the agent's cars were blocking a lane of traffic. The lawyers claimed that the agent fired at Jimenez while he was driving away.

ICE and Homeland Security Investigations agents took up to 15 people into custody after the raid, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said in a video posted Saturday on social media. Conley said the raid stemmed from ""nuisance"" complaints at the Kenner boat launch, adding that his agency worked with Louisiana State Police and federal agencies including the FBI, ICE, DEA and HSI on the joint operation.

Few details of the operation were available Saturday. Authorities have not identified the people who were detained, nor have they said what, if any, criminal charges or immigration laws they are accused of violating.

Mark McCormick, a Kenner Police spokesperson, in a text message said Kenner Police ""did not arrest or charge any individuals.""

""These individuals were placed in the custody of ICE officers and any questions regarding charges or status should be directed to ICE officials,"" he said. A State Police spokesman, Capt. Nick Manale, also referred questions to ICE.

Spokespeople for ICE, HSI and the FBI did not respond to requests for the identities of those detained in the operation and information about what wrongdoing authorities may have accused them of.

The operation marks one of the largest immigration raids of President Donald Trump's second term in the New Orleans area, immigrant rights advocates and attorneys say — second only to a raid at a New Orleans flood mitigation construction site in May in which between 15 and 24 people were detained.

Conley said the operation followed a need to get tougher on ""lawlessness"" and ""nuisance crimes"" he said have been occurring along the Lake Pontchartrain lakefront.

""Citizens were getting harassed, bullied,"" he said in the video.

Law enforcement arrived at the lakefront and ""interviewed a lot of people,"" Conley said, adding that HSI and ICE and took ""13 or 15 people into custody for further investigation.""

Union Migrante, an immigrant advocacy group whose members investigate and fact-check reports of immigration raids in the New Orleans area, shared video of the operation on its Facebook page, urging residents in Kenner, which has a large Hispanic community, to avoid the area.

The group said the operation was underway at around 10:15 p.m. Friday and that a helicopter was involved.

The video shows ICE agents leading men with hands bound behind their backs to a row of what appear to be Louisiana State Police cruisers.

Amid President Trump's immigration crackdown, Louisiana State Police and Kenner Police have both entered controversial 287(g) agreements, which empower local police officers to enforce federal immigration laws.

The other is a ""task force model"" agreement which gives local officers a wider array of authorities to perform immigration enforcement actions.

Louisiana State Police, too, have entered a task force model agreement, records show.

Federal agencies which previously played little role in immigration enforcement, including the DEA and FBI, have seen agents redirected to such operations under the Trump administration.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/c8/cc8b0c24-1f4a-4fb6-88c1-8189981d4e2a/62a358ee7ad45.image.jpg?crop=1613%2C848%2C0%2C192&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-09 03:17:28.328604

The Department of Homeland Security said agents were conducting immigration enforcement operations near 26th Street and Kedzie Avenue when an unknown man driving a black Jeep fired shots at agents and drove off.

DHS further alleges a group of people also threw a paint can and bricks at Border Patrol’s vehicle.

Cell phone video shows agents get out of their vehicle on Kedzie Avenue. Employees of a nearby business told WGN-TV they sheltered indoors after hearing gunfire and a crash.

The Chicago Police Department was called in for help and cleared the scene.

CPD said their officers were sent to the 2500 block of South Kedzie Avenue for reports of shots fired at federal agents. Officers secured the scene and there are no reports of anyone hit by gunfire.

One police officer, however, was accidentally hit by a GMC pickup truck driven by a 20-year-old woman. The officer suffered minor injuries and was taken to an area hospital in good condition, while the woman was issued two citations, according to CPD.

The suspect who reportedly fired shots at the agents and the Jeep he was driving have not been found.

Those who live in the area, however, are accusing federal agents of being aggressive.

Ald. Byron Sigcho-Lopez (25th Ward) said he asked agents for warrants and identification after hearing they tried to detain a man in a vehicle with a child inside.

“When we arrived here, there was an 11-year-old little girl dragged by these masked individuals and the neighbors are trying to surround to make sure that they didn’t take her,” he said.

Sigcho-Lopez added that witnesses told him agents broke the window of a car.

“Look at what they’ve done to our community. Since 10 a.m. then and this is sadness. This is outrageous,” he said.

WGN-TV has reached out to DHS on the incident involving an 11-year-old girl and is awaiting a response.

Once federal agents cleared the area, protesters turned their attention to remaining CPD officer conducting crowd control, yelling “shame” in their direction.

“This incident is not isolated and reflects a growing and dangerous trend of violence and obstruction. Over the past two months, we’ve seen an increase in assaults and obstruction targeting federal law enforcement during operations. These confrontations highlight the dangers our agents face daily and the escalating aggression toward law enforcement. The violence must end,” DHS said.

It’s been two months since the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz. Those who live in the area said they’ve had enough.

“I’m asking them to de-escalate. Ilive here. My daughter goes to school here. We went shopping. We’re trying to go shopping. I went to Walgreens. Ridiculous, it’s enough already. This needs to stop,” one protester said.

It’s unclear how many people were detained Saturday.

Carballo added that many applicants arrive without documentation, complicating verification of their status and rights. ""When families and foreigners arrive in Mexico, many don't have their documents, this makes them more vulnerable to red tape and delays,"" she said. She also pointed to U.S. policies that require Mexico to accept deported migrants, adding strain on the country's system and complicating efforts to distinguish who is seeking asylum locally.

The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported 78,906 asylum applications in Mexico last year. Of 31,922 initial decisions, 78 percent were approved. Although figures for 2025 have not been released, UNHCR representative Giovanni Lepri estimated in June that Mexico receives roughly 250 new asylum and refugee requests daily — about 100 in Chiapas, another 100 in Naucalpan, and 50 elsewhere.

Lepri said at the time that the caseload remains high despite declining financial support, leaving the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) under-resourced. He also noted that COMAR handled just a few thousand cases annually in 2016–2017 but now processes close to 100,000 per year and that the agency needs to ""strengthen"" capacity, especially as UNHCR has begun reducing personnel and external support by about 20%.",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/584950/border-before-migrants-arrive-el-ceibo-guatemala.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 07:18:06.726912

The incident later spilled over to West 23rd Street and Sawyer Avenue. Chicago police officers could be seen trying to disperse the crowd. Neighbors said they heard the commotion and went outside to check and saw federal agents walking a young girl in the alley.

The girl's family told Telemundo Chicago that federal agents were looking for her father. The girl's grandmother and another neighbor said, at one point, they tried to search their building.

The U.S. Supreme Court will return Monday for a short week of arguments, in which the justices will consider whether state and local government officials can be held personally liable for alleged religious rights violations and whether government contractors are entitled to immediately appeal denials of derivative sovereign immunity.

The justices will also hear two cases involving the First Step Act's compassionate release provision, 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c), and what factors district courts can consider when entertaining motions for sentence reductions.

The court will also release orders on Monday, and close Tuesday for Veterans Day.

Forced Haircut Liability

On Monday, the Supreme Court will debate whether state and local government officials can be held personally liable for alleged religious rights violations.

Louisiana man Damon Landor has asked the justices to overturn a Fifth Circuit decision affirming the dismissal of his Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, or RLUIPA, lawsuit against guards at the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Cottonport, Louisiana, who allegedly violated his religious rights by forcibly shaving his head in 2020. Landor, a devout Rastafarian who follows the Nazarite Vow against cutting one's hair, claims the guards handcuffed him to a chair and shaved off his dreadlocks despite his invocation of a previous Fifth Circuit decision that found the Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety's prohibition on inmates having dreadlocks was unlawfully burdensome under the act.

An unanimous three-judge panel ""emphatically"" condemned Landor's treatment, but found that circuit precedent from 2009 required dismissal of his claims seeking monetary damages against the guards in their individual capacities. U.S. Congress enacted RLUIPA under its spending clause power, the panel held, which means only the recipient of federal funding – Louisiana in this case – can be held liable for violating the act.

Landor, however, contends RLUIPA unambiguously authorizes lawsuits like his. The act allows a person to ""assert a violation of this chapter as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government,"" which is defined to include ""any other person acting under color of state law."" Landor claims the Supreme Court's 2020 decision in Tanzin v. Tanvir, which held that nearly identical language in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act allows suits against federal officials in their individual capacities, settles this case. The two acts have long been described as twin statutes and should be read the same way, he said. If RLUIPA prohibits plaintiffs from seeking monetary damages from state officials, then the statute loses a significant deterrent factor, Landor adds. Courts have consistently held that prisoners' claims for prospective relief under the act become moot once they're transferred or released from a facility, so the only viable remedy for past wrongs is monetary damages against officials in their individual capacities, he said.

The federal government agrees, noting that Landor's suggested interpretation follows Congress' policy determination that private lawsuits are important mechanisms for enforcing RLUIPA. Federal lawmakers have broad discretion when it comes to setting conditions for federal funding, the government said, and they often require state and local officials to honor certain rights and statutes as a way to ensure that federal funds are used appropriately. Additionally, nothing in the U.S. Constitution bars Congress from imposing liability on parties other than the named funding recipient, the government claims.

Louisiana counters that legislation like RLUIPA that's enacted under the Constitution's spending clause operates more like a contract, and, therefore, only the named parties can be held liable for any alleged violations. Nonparties like individual officials cannot be bound by terms of a contract they didn't agree to, the state said. The statute also doesn't clearly and unambiguously allow for suits against officials in their individual capacities or for monetary damages. While courts have held that RFRA's language allows plaintiffs to sue federal officials in their individual capacity, the fact that RLUIPA is aimed at states requires a different analysis of the language due to sovereign immunity concerns, Louisiana said.

Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP partner Zachary D. Tripp will argue for Landor, Libby A. Baird, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government in favor of Landor, and Louisiana Solicitor General J. Benjamin Aguiñaga will argue for the state.

The case is Landor v. Louisiana Department of Corrections and Public Safety et al., case number 23-1197.

Derivate Immunity Appeals

Also on Monday, the justices will consider whether court orders denying government contractors derivative sovereign immunity should be immediately appealable.

The GEO Group Inc., which operates a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora, Colorado, has petitioned the high court to review the Tenth Circuit's dismissal of an interlocutory appeal of a district court's finding that the contractor must face claims of unjust enrichment and allegations that it violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Alejandro Menocal claims in a class action that GEO forced detainees to conduct housekeeping work with threats of solitary confinement for noncompliance and underpaid participants in a voluntary work program.

A three-judge panel dismissed GEO's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the district court's derivative sovereign immunity ruling wasn't a collateral order eligible for immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. Section 1291. The questions of whether GEO is entitled to derivative sovereign immunity and whether the contractor is liable for the alleged allegations are based on similar fact patterns, namely whether the challenged actions were ordered by the government or not, the panel said.

GEO argues the Tenth Circuit is wrong and that decisions on derivative sovereign immunity are ""final decisions"" under Section 1291 and subject to an interlocutory appeal exception. District court orders denying similar Immunities, such as absolute immunity, qualified immunity and Eleventh Amendment immunity, are immediately appealable because they effect whether a dispute can continue to the merits. Derivative sovereign immunity is similarly dispositive, GEO said, and can't be effectively reviewed on appeal after final judgment. Even if there is some overlap between the facts that help determine immunity and liability questions, the Supreme Court has in the past said the questions are distinct enough to trigger Section 1291's exception, the contractor said.

Menocal, on the other hand, claims GEO's interpretation would lead to piecemeal and costly litigation. Derivative sovereign immunity, despite its name, is not an immunity from liability but a defense to liability, he said, so the question of whether it applies in a particular dispute are usually fact-based ones decided by juries. In virtually every case, derivative sovereign immunity will be intertwined with the dispute's merits, making appeals of final judgments the best avenue to challenge adverse rulings, Menocal said.

The federal government mostly agrees with Menocal, but warns the Supreme Court against issuing a categorical rule. In most situations, it said, decisions on whether contractors are entitled to derivative sovereign immunity will be fact-based defenses that can be vindicated on appeal with a reversal of a final judgment. But there are certain, rare situations in which such decisions may require interlocutory appeals. The Supreme Court could rule against GEO in this case while still leaving some room for interlocutory appeals in those certain situations, the government said.

Greenberg Traurig LLP shareholder Dominic E. Draye will argue for GEO Group, Gupta Wessler LLP principal Jennifer D. Bennett will argue for Menocal, and Sopan Joshi, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government in favor of Menocal.

The case is The GEO Group Inc. v. Menocal et al., case number 24-758.

Sentence Reduction Challenges

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will debate defendants can meet the First Step Act's compassionate release provision's ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" requirement for sentence reduction by alleging grounds typically used for habeas corpus relief.

New York defendant Joe Fernandez, who is currently serving a life sentence in relation to the 2000 murders of two drug cartel members, has asked the justices to review a Second Circuit decision reversing a reduction in his sentence under the compassionate release provision. A Southern District of New York judge reduced Fernandez's sentence to 11 years of time served in 2021 after finding major issues with the sufficiency and reliability of evidence presented against the defendant at trial, including eyewitness testimony, and due to the disparities between the length of Fernandez's sentence and those of his co-defendants.

A three-judge panel reinstated Fernandez's life sentence after finding that none of those reasons rose to the level of ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" required under Section 1291. Fernandez had also previously raised similar challenges under 28 U.S.C. Section 2255, which allows for federal inmates to vacate constitutionally or statutorily defective sentences.

Fernandez claims the Second Circuit impermissibly limited the range of considerations that district courts can take review when deciding whether to reduce a sentence under the First Step Act. The statute's plain language, he said, imposes no ""categorical"" restrictions on what factors courts can review, respecting the historic tradition of granting courts wide discretion in sentencing. Fernandez said he can properly argue that the same reasons that in certain cases may warrant invalidation of a sentence under the habeas corpus statute, warrant a reduction of his sentence in this case. As long as defendants don't use the compassionate relief provision to argue for invalidation of his conviction or sentence, they are free to argue that similar grounds warrant a reduced sentence.

The federal government counters that Fernandez's interpretation of the First Step Act's compassionate release provision would allow defendants to end run the habeas corpus statute. The plain meaning of the compassionate release provision requires a defendant's reasons to be highly unique and often unforeseen. Since Congress predicted that defendants would lodge challenges to their convictions and sentences based on allegedly constitutional violations, abuse of discretion or ineffective assistance of counsel, those reasons don't amount to the ""extraordinary and compelling"" ones contemplated by the compassionate release provision, the government said.

Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP partner Benjamin Gruenstein will argue for Fernandez, and Eric J. Feigin, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government.

The case is Fernandez v. United States, case number 24-556.

Sentence Reduction Reasons

Also on Wednesday, the justices will consider if district court's can consider disparities created by prospective changes in sentencing laws as ""extraordinary and compelling reasons"" that warrant a sentence reduction under the First Step Act.

Defendants Daniel Rutherford and Johnnie M. Carter have petitioned the high court in consolidated cases to review the Third Circuit's determination that a 2023 rule issued by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which states that defendants serving ""unusually long"" sentences who would be subject to much shorter sentences under current law, creates an ""extraordinary and compelling"" reason to reduce an individual's sentence under the First Step Act's compassionate relief provision. Rutherford and Carter are currently serving more than 42 years and 70 years in prison, respectively, under now-defunct mandatory minimum statutes for armed bank robberies.

Both men challenged their sentences as unusually long and grossly disparate under the Sentencing Commission's sentence, but the Third Circuit ruled that the guidelines didn't change the fact that the First Step Act's compassionate release provision specifically forbids courts from deeming prospective changes in law as an ""extraordinary or compelling"" reason prompting a sentence reduction.

Rutherford argues the Third Circuit's decision contradicts a long history of giving district courts wide discretion to consider all relevant information when sentencing a defendant. What constitutes an ""extraordinary and compelling"" reason for sentence reduction is a case-specific inquiry that, under the plain text of the compassionate release provision, must consider a sentence's length and what would be available under present law. Congress enacted the compassionate release provision with the exact aim of alleviating unusually long sentences, he said, and the Supreme Court should not allow courts to undermine the statute's purpose.

Carter adds that Congress purposefully delegated power to the Sentencing Commission to define what types of ""extraordinary and compelling"" reasons would require sentence reductions. The commission's 2023 decision to allow district courts to consider prospective changes in law was well within its discretion and should receive some deference from the Supreme Court, he said.

Meanwhile, the federal government, claims guidance from the Sentencing Commission can not change the fact that Congress made sentencing reforms explicitly prospective. Lawmakers had the option to apply reforms retroactively to defendants like Rutherford and Carter, but it decided against that. The courts and the commission should respect that policy choice, the government said. Additionally, the commission's limited role is to describe what subsets of potential reasons might warrant a sentence reduction and the 2023 guidelines clearly exceed the boundaries of its delegate power.

Defendants Daniel Rutherford and Johnnie M. Carter have petitioned the high court in consolidated cases to review the Third Circuit's determination that a U.S. Sentencing Commission rule issued in 2023 state that defendants serving ""unusually long"" sentences

David C. Frederick, a Kellogg Hansen Todd Figel & Frederick PLLC partner, will argue for Rutherford, Debevoise & Plimpton LLP partner David A. O'Neil will argue for Carter, and Eric J. Feigin, of the U.S. Solicitor General's Office, will argue for the federal government.

The consolidated cases are Rutherford v. United States, case number 24-820, and Carter v. United States, case number 24-860.

Ojeda-Montoya was wanted on an arrest warrant for allegedly stabbing a coworker with a pair of scissors in the hand and throwing a trash can at them.

She was transported to Cumberland County Jail in Scarborough, Maine, where she will remain in custody pending removal proceedings.

Squailia also encouraged community members to keep documenting ICE encounters in the city to hold the agency accountable.

""Keep showing up for one another, keep documenting, keep speaking,"" she said.

The doors to some of Chicago’s most authentic Mexican restaurants have remained locked for fear of federal agents.","Baltazar Enriquez began wearing his whistle in June, when the threat of the Trump administration’s immigration raids was more focused and the fear perhaps less widespread in Chicago. The whistle — green plastic, attached to an orange lanyard — was at first a small gesture of preparedness. It has since become a symbol of resistance.

In the beginning, the sight of it around Enriquez’s neck prompted questions and confusion in Little Village, one of Chicago’s proudest Latino neighborhoods. He remembers people asking him, perplexed: “What is a whistle gonna do?”

“And we said, ‘Well, the whistle is in case immigration is around, and you start blowing. The whistle is for people who are undocumented to go away, to lock their doors, lock their gates and not open the door.’

“And it grew like wildfire. Now everybody’s using it.”

For the past two months of President Donald Trump’s so-called Operation Midway Blitz, federal agents have engaged in a norm-defying assault on the Chicago area. In Little Village, where Enriquez is president of the community council, restaurant doors have remained locked and business along 26th Street has slowed.

The resistance born there, though, has spread. A movement that began in Chicago’s Latino enclaves has arrived in neighborhoods everywhere, breaking through segregation and boundaries long defined by race and socioeconomic status. A city known for its resilience and a take-no-nonsense attitude has found another reason to unite

And in its unity, the city has made a statement, an unmistakable message akin to the one a woman packing whistles at a recent “Whistlemania” event on the Northwest Side hoped to send.

“Show ’em that you don’t (expletive) with Chicago,” she said.

The whistles have become part of the city’s soundtrack, the sight of them around people’s necks as common as Bears jerseys. But the resistance to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents, often dressed in tactical gear, toting weapons built for war through city neighborhoods and suburban subdivisions, has taken many forms. A movement has grown through acts large and small.

Resistance is a woman documenting the deployment of tear gas in Broadview. It’s neighbors coming together to grab one of their own from the grasp of federal agents in Old Irving Park. It’s a white suburban mom rushing from her house in Mount Prospect, phone camera in hand, to scream at federal agents to get out of her village.

It’s a 24-year-old man, the son of Mexican migrants, who alerted dozens of day laborers of the presence of ICE during a recent raid in the northwest suburbs, and then sheltered and protected them. It’s a young Black man on the South Side recording the detainment of several U.S. citizens following an apparently warrantless raid and sharing that video with the world.

And it’s hundreds of high school students who walked out of their classes and into the streets of Little Village, carrying flags and signs and blowing whistles, literally and figuratively.

In Little Village alone, Enriquez said, he and his colleagues on the community council have distributed almost 10,000 whistles. In the earliest days of the Chicago resistance, he said ICE and Border Patrol officers responded with bewilderment when people began blowing them in their presence. Enriquez can remember one agent who smirked and laughed at the sound.

“But he didn’t, once he saw people locking their doors and getting away,” he said.

The movement, like the noise, has only grown more intense.

‘No longtime activist’

She resisted because others inspired her to resist. Because for weeks she’d watched videos of protests at an ICE detention facility in Broadview and of standoffs between Chicagoans and federal agents in Brighton Park and the East Side and everywhere else. Videos that, at times, showed the targets of the raids “literally fighting for their lives.”

She resisted, ultimately, because agents showed up on her street on a random Sunday afternoon in October. Outside her door. On her quiet block in Mount Prospect. That’s when Lisa Porter ran outside.

“It was sort of like I was finally able to find a place to put my rage,” she said later, “and try to be a little productive instead of feeling so helpless.”

Porter, 53, had never been all that politically active. She’d never been much of a protester. She’s a suburban mother of three — a 13-year-old daughter and twins who are 11. “I’m no longtime activist,” she said.

Her resistance began that day “by running out and screaming at people.”

“Now, granted,” she said, “I recognize that that’s not necessarily a tactic that everyone thinks is terribly effective. (But) I had been seeing a lot of it on those videos, and really it seemed to be the thing that got them to back down.”

There were agents in two SUVs down her street that day, and others circling nearby blocks in four or five more vehicles. She remembers their masks. About 20 of her neighbors had gathered outside to bear witness, with some of them, like Porter, rushing to protect anyone who might be targeted. Rumors swirled up and down the street and in the aftermath: that it was a cartel member they were after.

Or a sex offender. Or a murderer. Or someone who was all three?

The “worst of the worst,” as the Trump administration has often put it.

“There were several different stories that they told,” Porter said, but she knows that at “no point did they say, ‘Stay in your houses. There’s a dangerous criminal on the loose.’”

She cannot be sure whether the agents ultimately apprehended anyone. If they did, she didn’t see it, which leads her to believe it didn’t happen. She was, after all, trailing the vehicles — confronting the agents inside, screaming at them. A Tribune photographer captured Porter in mid-scream, her face twisted in rage, the masked agents on the other end of her ire avoiding eye contact.

The one in the driver’s seat is looking away from her. The other straight ahead.

She was yelling “a lot of not-safe-for-work things,” she said.

She remembers one interaction, when an agent that day asked her if she was “OK with criminals in the neighborhood.”

“You’re the criminals,” she told them. “You’re the ones kidnapping people off the street.”

About two weeks later, Porter received a text from a neighbor. ICE was back. Porter made her way to her neighbor’s house but by the time she arrived the agents were gone. It left locals feeling uneasy and angry again. On the way home, Porter noticed a young man mowing a nearby lawn. She flagged him down and offered a warning:

“I just want you to be safe,” she told him. “ICE is in the area.”

But he already knew. What he said in response has lingered in Porter’s mind.

She can still hear him saying it:

“They came and took my dad 10 minutes ago.”

‘These are my people’

He resisted because he identifies with those who’ve been targeted and deported. Because he has never forgotten the sacrifices his parents made or their journey from Michoacán, Mexico, to West Englewood, where he “didn’t grow up in one of the best neighborhoods,” but where he found opportunity, nonetheless.

He resisted, ultimately, because “these are my people.” That was one of Efrain Cuevas’ first thoughts when he noticed the caravan of Ford Explorers with Texas plates last month. And there was a moment, however brief, when his mind offered an alternative to what he was seeing.

“I guess people from Texas are visiting,” he said to himself. But at the same time he knew. He knew those vehicles carried federal agents and he saw them as they came closer. That was when Cuevas began shouting. Began screaming, with as much force as he could muster:

“La Migra! La Migra!”

“Which is ICE, in Spanish,” he said. “Everybody just started running.”

“It was everybody for themselves.”

Cuevas, 24, is an American citizen and Chicago native. He attended Chicago Bulls College Prep on the Near West Side. He said he served in the Marines. Now he works in maintenance at an apartment complex in northwest suburban Hoffman Estates. The apartments needed new windows and so the management company hired a crew.

Dozens of laborers arrived. Cuevas estimates that about 40 of them were in the U.S without legal permission.

In a way, they reminded him of his parents. They’d come to this area seeking opportunity. The only difference, as Cuevas saw it, was that he happened to be born here and they didn’t. But he wondered: “Why can’t we all just be human?”

“We all bleed red,” he said. “But, you know, I guess people just don’t like specific skin colors.”

When he started shouting upon the arrival of the agents, the workers began to scramble. It was “chaos,” Cuevas said, “and I’ll always see people just running in different directions.” They’d been there to install windows but now there was panic. Some of the crew members found their way into the buildings they were working on. Cuevas opened doors to unoccupied units where workers hid.

He tried to interrupt detainments in progress and asked for search warrants. One of the agents, he said, asked him if he was a U.S. citizen.

“Yes, sir,” Cuevas responded, and again asked to see a search warrant.

“But these agents are like — the Constitution? They don’t even care about it,” he said.

It was only after everything quieted down that Cuevas realized that agents detained at least three workers. Dozens of others remained hidden until the agents left. Some of the workers had their car keys taken, Cuevas said. The agents swiped them out of the ignition through open windows so that the owners of those cars wouldn’t be able to drive away.

Cuevas tried to facilitate safe exits when the time came and, for days after, everything played over in his mind: the sight of the SUVs, the workers running, the agents giving chase.

“I’m still in shock,” he said.

A week later, the new windows and the equipment to install them were still scattered about the property, a job left unfinished. Cars remained parked on the grass, left behind by people taken away, or ones who escaped and were too afraid to come back. The scene offers constant reminders. Cuevas has thought a lot about his parents, who “wanted to give their kids an American dream.”

He suspects it wasn’t much different for the workers.

“I saw this and it really did hit home for me,” he said. “And I was like, I have to protect these people …

“Who’s gonna look after them?”

‘Chicago isn’t playing around’

Resistance is as much a part of Chicago’s history as resilience, and in a lot of ways one can’t exist without the other. This is a city that rose from the ashes of a fire and rebuilt itself 150 years ago. The Haymarket Riot of the 1880s, when the working class fought for an eight-hour work day, remains one of the most important labor movements in American history.

In 1968, the turmoil surrounding the Democratic National Convention — where Mayor Richard J. Daley’s police force met anti-Vietnam war activists with brute and bloody force — underscored a greater American unrest. One speaker, Connecticut Sen. Abraham Ribicoff, lambasted Daley for his “gestapo tactics” against protesters.

Almost 60 years later, little has changed about the city’s spirit. The difference, though, is that those resisting now aren’t doing so in opposition to war in a faraway place. They’re resisting, instead, what they consider to be an invasion of their city and their neighborhoods. They’re resisting the presence of federal agents who look more like soldiers, and immigration raids that feel like attacks.

The deeds of resistance, themselves, can be wide-ranging. They don’t fit neatly into boxes. They can be, as one viral social media post detailed, as simple as a middle schooler handing out whistle packets with a know-your-rights card on a city street. They can be the profane messages, written on the street in chalk, against ICE outside of its facility in Broadview, or the 14 suburban women who were arrested Friday after they hopped the concrete barricades that have proliferated around the processing center, sat down in the middle of the street and held hands in a organized display of civil disobedience.

They can be marches. Or walkouts. Or a local ironworker and union board member who spread the word in a video on Tik-Tok — seen more than 32,000 times as of Friday evening — that “Chicago isn’t playing around.”

“We’ve been standing up to government since the 1800s,” Paul Goodrich of Iron Workers Local #63, says into the camera. He wears his hard hat and a short beard. And, as a white man who works “a hard job,” as he put it, he has the look of the kind of person President Donald Trump most tries to appeal to. But Goodrich isn’t having it.

“If Donald Trump thinks that he could come in here and send his police force to hold us down, he’s wrong,” he said. “The whistles are everywhere … this is what we do. The best thing we do in Chicago is organize. So good luck.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment for this story. In previous statements, its spokespeople have labeled residents opposed to their enforcement as “rioters, gangbangers and terrorists.”

In Chicago, some moments of recent resistance have received national attention. Not long after the formal announcement of Operation Midway Blitz, there was the viral video of a man on a bike eluding federal agents downtown. Scenes of the protests in Broadview have been broadcast to the rest of the country.

But resistance often comes in quieter forms, in the shadows.

In the days after the late September nighttime raid of an apartment building in South Shore, in a predominantly Black neighborhood, residents spoke out against the militarized invasion of their community — one in which some federal agents rappelled from helicopters.

Someone placed a small memorial on a fence near the place where 37 people had been taken into custody. There was a hula-hoop. A pink stuffed animal. A hopeful message:

“This too will pass … Protect South Shore. Protect Chicago.”

Resistance can be a lot of things but they always come in the form of “an oppositional action,” said Rachel Einwohner, a Purdue University political sociologist who has studied resistance movements for nearly 30 years.

“It could be posting on social media,” she said. “It could be participating in a march. It could be giving shelter to somebody who, you know — you hear the whistle and you’re like, ‘Oh, my God, ICE is coming,’ and you see somebody running, and you let them into your house.”

Chicago’s history of taking stands “is absolutely important” in shaping this current moment of resistance, Einwohner said, but resistance movements are not limited by ideology or political leaning. She noted that one “could say MAGA was a whole resistance movement” of its own, one that spawned Midway Blitz, but now Chicagoans find themselves pushing back.

“In this particular moment, the city of Chicago is absolutely being targeted because of its history, because of its politics, because of the Trump administration and how they’re kind of seeing things,” Einwohner said.

To stand in opposition requires very little. The challenge for scholars in her line of work, Einwohner said, is quantifying the difference any of it makes.

How does one measure the effectiveness of a social media post? Or the blowing of a whistle?

Or a march or a walkout? It can be difficult to answer.

“But small acts have huge consequences,” Einwohner said, and she thought of the person who thought to take video of George Floyd’s murder. “If she hadn’t done that, then things would be a lot different. So (resistance can be) just kind of saying, ‘I’m going to be a witness to this,’ and I’m going to say, ‘No, this is not right.’”

Whistlemania

They resisted because they believe this is not right. Because they felt like they had to do something, even if it was small.

Wednesday evenings are usually quiet at Illuminated Brew Works in Norwood Park, but the place was almost full a little after 6 p.m. on a recent Wednesday. By 6:30, it was at capacity — not a spot at the bar or any of the tables organizers brought in just for the night.

The brewery is tucked into a small industrial space off of Northwest Highway, not far from O’Hare International Airport, in Chicago’s far northwest corner. It’s a part of the city’s 41st Ward — one of the few in Chicago where Trump found success in the 2024 election. Norwood Park is not necessarily a bastion of progressivism. It is instead something of a reddish or purple island in a deep blue city.

And yet even here, where Trump won several nearby precincts, organizers of a Whistlemania event, one of several throughout Chicago in recent weeks, did not bring enough whistles. Or know-your-rights cards. Or any of the other supplies that would’ve met demand.

Agnes Guerra, one of those organizers, was not sure what to expect. She feared low turnout, and worried that a whistle-packing event in one of Chicago’s most conservative-leaning neighborhoods might come and go unnoticed.

“This ward is very red,” she said, but over the past two months she found herself “doing something every day to keep myself sane.” Sometimes that meant protesting in Broadview. Sometimes it meant spending money to support businesses that had been affected by the raids. She said she was among the early wave of protesters in Broadview when agents reacted with force.

“My joke is how do you radicalize middle-aged white women?” she asked.

“You throw tear gas at them.”

She met another neighborhood organizer, Virginia Jimenez, online, and the planning began for Whistlemania at the brewery. They thought they needed enough whistles and information packets for 1,000 people. That seemed like a lofty goal. But they could’ve used twice as many. The sight of so many people coming into the brewery to fold informational flyers into small booklets, and pack them into little bags with plastic whistles, made Guerra and Jimenez emotional.

It was especially personal for Jimenez, who recounted her personal history of arriving in the United States from Guatemala when she was 5-years-old.

“I’m very passionate about our rights, just as humans,” she said. In recent weeks she has spent a lot of time driving children of migrants around the city, to and from school or to appointments or to the grocery store, because their parents are too afraid to leave home. Too afraid of walking through their door and never returning again.

Jimenez and Guerra hoped the whistle packs they collected that night might make a small difference.

They could offer a warning. Maybe help slow a pursuit. Perhaps tell someone to run.

About 20 minutes after Whistlemania began, Guerra grabbed a microphone and said they were running low on supplies. Not long after that, she announced that they’d run out. The 1,000 whistles they had packed were destined for churches and little free libraries on street corners.

And, eventually, around people’s necks, waiting to be heard.

‘We had to fight’

They sounded the alarm in the distance down 26th Street in Little Village on a recent Tuesday morning, the shrill growing louder along with that of the chants that accompanied it. By then, students at Social Justice High had walked out of class. They’d grabbed their signs and flags and marched toward the arch at the neighborhood’s eastern edge.

The arch is the community’s most prominent landmark, and the words that stretch across it, in large letters, offer a warm greeting: “Bienvenidos a Little Village.” Lately, though, the place hasn’t felt all that inviting. The doors to some of Chicago’s most authentic Mexican restaurants have remained locked for fear of federal agents.

Along the usually busy 26th, which is Little Village’s version of Main Street, foot traffic has slowed outside of the quinceañera boutiques and other local establishments. Parking is easy to come by. Small signs taped to windows are common, ones that read: “ICE/CBP agents DO NOT have consent to enter this business/restaurant unless they have a valid judicial warrant.”

Anxiety has run high here ever since Trump’s second inauguration 10 months ago. Yet it has been especially tense since the start of the blitz and even more so since federal agents, accompanied by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Cmdr. Greg Bovino, showed up in Little Village on Oct. 23. A confrontation ensued and the agents dispersed tear gas.

The community felt attacked. Wounded. The students marched because they wanted to heal.

One of them, Lia Sophia Lopez, helped lead the march down 26th. She carried a bullhorn and led chants, her voice cracking at times with emotion. She addressed the crowd upon its arrival under the arch, and preached a message of unity and resilience and resistance.

“When they attacked our community, it hurt,” she said. “We had to fight. We had to protect our people. Because people are scared to leave their homes.

“People are scared to even walk across the street. … We’re doing this to protect the people’s peace so people are not scared of leaving and people are not scared to fight back.”

She began to head back toward school, with more than a hundred others who’d walked out, and the route took the students past the locked restaurants and quiet storefronts, through a wary neighborhood that refuses to give in. Days later, Baltazar Enriquez, president of the community council, stepped out of his office and into Don Pepe, the restaurant right next door.

He took a look around at the empty tables and said, “This restaurant used to be full at this time.” For months, Enriquez has tried to comfort and lead neighbors while his community — home to the city’s largest Mexican American population — became a focal point of the raids. Now it was the afternoon of Halloween and an eerie quiet hung over 26th Street. Enriquez grappled with a new question that had been facing his community:

Should it cancel its annual Halloween parade? Or should it encourage a community gathering in a time of constant unease, one in which “we’ve got ICE everywhere,” Enriquez said. He thought of children yearning to wear their costumes and march carefree down the street. He thought of parents who’d been too afraid to leave home but who needed a small taste of normalcy. Of belonging.

He came to think it wasn’t much of a decision at all.

And so the parade would go on. It had to go on.

Enriquez solicited dozens of volunteers. They planned to protect children in the case of a raid. To make a human circle, if the need arose, to block federal agents.

In the end, none of it was needed. But the resistance had been ready. To protect each other. To make noise.

They didn’t have tear gas or guns. But they had each other. And the little pieces of plastic Enriquez and thousands of other Chicagoans keep around their necks.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CTC-L-Little-Village-ICE04.jpg?w=1024&h=697,N,,2025-11-08 22:16:45.595294

“We’ve received reports of possible ICE activity today in Clatsop and Tillamook counties including the Astoria, Warrenton, Seaside, and Tillamook areas.","Seaside detentions

The Portland Immigration Rights Coalition said there were five confirmed detentions in the Seaside area on Saturday.

“Through hotline calls and through our community partners as part of the Oregon for All coalition, PIRC has received information for five community members who were detained in the Seaside area on Nov. 8,” said PIRC spokesperson Natalie Lerner. “We have heard there may be additional detentions and want the community to know we are here for them as a connection to resources. As with all of the currently-escalating immigration enforcement in our state, we condemn today’s detentions — those abducted are believed family, friends, and community members. Immigration agents only serve to sow panic and trauma in our state, and we are proud to be part of the strong community response to support our neighbors. Our hotline is here 24/7 for anyone across the state who has had their family or friends taken or who believes they have witnessed ICE activity.”

According to a KMUN news report about the activity, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began running license plates and pulling people over and taking them into custody around 8 a.m.

Prior to Saturday, the last time a local ICE presence was reported was through Facebook in Depoe Bay in May and one arrest was reported in Newport in September.

The Seaside detentions come as the Trump administration ramps up ICE activity nationwide.

The Facebook posts, many anonymous, began popping up mid-morning: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was observed and reported apprehending people in Seaside.

Photos and videos were posted of ICE vehicles outside of Beach Books in Seaside and reports said “two to seven” people were taken into custody.

Beach Books store employee Hilary Weigel said she had seen the posts on Facebook but did not see anything at the store.

“I believe it happened before the store opened (at 10 a.m.),” Weigel said.

Jenny Pool Radway told KMUN reporter Katie Frankowicz that all five of the people detained in Seaside were on their way to jobs in the area. Pool Radway is the executive director of the Astoria-based nonprofit Consejo Hispano that provides servised to the Latine communities on Oregon’s North Coast. She likened Saturday’s operation to “a fishing expedition.”

“You’re not picking up someone who is a danger to the community,” Pool Radway said. “These are our friends, our neighbors, just regular tax-paying community members who are being hunted down.”

Seaside police dispatch, the Clatsop County Sheriff’s Office and Sgt. Litwin at the Astoria Police Department all reported that their offices were not involved in any ICE activity and they had not been contacted by the agency.

The Facebook posts ramped up throughout the morning and into the afternoon, reporting sightings of ICE vehicles moving up from Cannon Beach to Astoria, however, the only known apprehensions occurred in Seaside.

One post came from North Coast State Rep. Cyrus Javadi.

There was affordability, the 34-year-old democratic socialist said in his first news conference since winning the election the night before. Then there was what he called “an authoritarian administration” under President Donald Trump.

""It'll be my job to deliver on both,"" Mamdani said. ""It will be my job to stand up for the city.""

Trump, a Queens native, has loomed over the election in his hometown, and he has threatened to punish New York with measures such as cutting the city's funds if voters elected Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens. If Mamdani became mayor, Trump recently said it would be hard for him to give ""a lot of money"" to New York, adding Mamdani would waste the money with his left-leaning politics.

Mamdani has vowed to fight back in court when he takes office in January.

Here’s a rundown of what Trump could do to the nation’s largest city, and what Mamdani can do in response to − as his campaign platform promised − “Trump-proof” New York.

Deploy National Guard

In contrast to some of the other largest cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, New York has been untouched by the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard. Trump could try deploying troops to city streets.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat, has had National Guard at subway stations to reduce transit crime, but has reportedly been preparing to push back on Trump deploying troops into the city.

Lame-duck Mayor Eric Adams forged a bond with Trump after the Justice Department dropped federal corruption charges against Adams so he could help with Trump’s immigration crackdown.

In contrast, Mamdani has discussed forming a coalition with state officials, including Trump’s nemesis, New York Attorney General Letitia James, to sue the federal government if troops get sent. He’s cited the success by LA Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom in lawsuits that blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in California.

Large-scale immigration raids

Other Democratic cities such as Chicago, LA and Boston have seen sweeping immigration raids on streets, construction sites and businesses.

New York had highly publicized immigration enforcement operations shortly after Trump's return to office, but has not had the same scale of enforcement. There was a recent chaotic immigration raid by federal agents on street vendors allegedly selling counterfeit merchandise in lower Manhattan.

Federal agents have targeted people attending immigration court or Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins at a Manhattan federal building. The federal actions have sometimes resulted in violence against migrants, including one woman thrown to the ground by an agent.

Mamdani said he’d hold federal agents carrying out Trump’s immigration enforcement to the same legal standard as anyone else, implying that ICE agents could be arrested for assaulting New Yorkers.

“If you violate the law, you must be held accountable,” he said. “And there is sadly a sense that is growing across this country that certain people are allowed to violate that law, whether they be the president or whether they be the agents themselves.”

Mamdani has vowed to make New York the nation’s strongest sanctuary city, which broadly means limiting local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Mamdani has also called to invest $165 million to fund immigration legal defense services. He’s said his administration would survey every city system to protect sensitive data of undocumented people and others.

Behind the scenes, state officials and business leaders are reportedly trying to prevent raids. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie in October successfully persuaded the Trump administration not to conduct enforcement in the California city.

Cut federal funds to NYC

Early in Trump’s second term, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency revoked $80 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Adams’ City Hall has sued the administration for the funding.

Months later, the federal Department of Transportation said it was halting funds to the nation’s largest infrastructure project, which would bolster the busiest U.S. rail corridor underneath the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan, as well as the Second Avenue Subway, also in Manhattan. Withholding about $18 billion, federal officials cited the New York City’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation by racial minorities in federally assisted contracts.

Trump has threatened to slash even more federal funds to the city if Mamdani was elected. In a Nov. 3 Truth Social post, Trump said, ""it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.""

Like other Democratic cities and states that have faced cuts to federal benefits, Mamdani has said the city could mount legal challenges to the cuts to recoup lost funds. Some cities and states have seen some success, such as Fresno, California, and North Carolina.

Arrest America’s mayor

Even before Mamdani won the mayoralty, Trump suggested arresting Mamdani and stripping him of his citizenship if Mamdani didn't assist on federal immigration enforcement. Mamdani, born in Uganda, moved to the United States as a child and was raised in Manhattan’s Morningside Heights. He became a naturalized citizen in 2018.

Some right-wing members of Trump's party have called to review Mamdani’s citizenship process in an effort to denaturalize and deport him. Trump has threatened to arrest Democratic elected officials before.

After Mamdani won the election on Nov. 4, he spoke directly to Trump.

""New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,"" he said. ""So, hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.""

Mamdani's line drew perhaps the loudest roar throughout the night.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/03/USAT/87065195007-mamdani-trump.jpg?crop=3577,2012,x0,y335&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 18:56:54.343487

Issued via State Department cable, the rules dramatically expand longstanding public charge criteria and have prompted concern over fairness, discrimination, and broader impacts on global mobility.

Advocates and health experts warn that the move risks bias while supporters argue it protects American taxpayers and ensures self-sufficiency among newcomers.​

Broader Health Scrutiny Fuels New Exclusions

The new guidance, circulated by the State Department to US embassies and consulates worldwide in early November 2025, directs consular officers to consider whether chronic medical conditions-ranging from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological and mental health issues, and obesity-would require “hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth” of care, potentially justifying denial of US visas.

The directive lists specific conditions, yet signals that the list is not exhaustive, paving the way for even wider officer discretion. Obesity is flagged, with the memo noting its potential complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and hypertension.

Dependents’ health status now receives scrutiny as well, with visa officers urged to evaluate family members’ likelihood of creating future financial burden for US healthcare systems.​

Officials maintain the change is meant to “safeguard US resources,” targeting applicants deemed at risk of becoming a “public charge”-a historic category under American immigration law for those who may rely on government-funded support.

A Department of State spokesperson, speaking to Fox News, said, “The Trump administration has brought an end to the era of mass immigration… We continue to prioritise applicants who can demonstrate self-sufficiency.” Visa officers must now evaluate whether applicants have adequate means to pay for any future medical care over their expected lifetimes, without recourse to US public assistance.​

Expert, Advocacy, and Community Concerns

While health screening has always formed part of immigration processing-screening for communicable diseases and vaccination records-the new guidance marks a significant expansion. Immigration attorneys, including Charles Wheeler at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, question the subjective power given to individual officers, stating, “These decisions shouldn’t be based on personal bias or speculation, especially when officers aren’t medically trained.”

Wheeler also highlights a contradiction with the State Department’s own Foreign Affairs Manual, which prohibits denials based on hypothetical scenarios.​

Sophia Genovese, an attorney at Georgetown University, argues this “goes well beyond the traditional medical exam,” and that such criteria could exclude millions globally living with common chronic illnesses.

About one in ten people worldwide has diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases remain leading causes of death-a context that the new policy fails to address equitably.

Public health experts assert that many such conditions are treatable and should not justify immigration exclusion. Instead, the rules appear to favour young, wealthy, and healthy immigrants, threatening the US’s position as a destination for diverse talent, including international students, professionals, and family reunification.​

Immigration advocates, such as United We Dream and the American Immigration Council, have warned that the expanded “public charge” exclusion will disproportionately impact older applicants and those from lower-income backgrounds.

The cable encourages officers to consider projected medical costs and an applicant’s ability to pay these privately, further raising the bar for entry.

Critics also point to risks of discrimination unrelated to applicants’ actual ability to contribute to society, and challenge the ethical basis of denying entry for treatable health issues.​

Recent news reports and fact-checkers emphasise that while the US government retains authority to set entry conditions, abrupt expansion of these criteria under Trump could result in more rejections for reasons that intersect health, age, and financial status, not just merit or security.​

Immigration Context Under Trump: The Crackdown Deepens

This directive is only the latest in a series of immigration restrictions issued since Donald Trump’s second term began. The administration has tightened refugee admissions, raised H-1B and Green Card fees, and expanded enforcement actions targeting undocumented migrants.

Trump’s stated policy priority has included “restoring law and order” and “putting Americans first,” with a renewed push to reduce legal migration and overhaul pathways to citizenship.​

Prior measures include aggressive deportations, the infamous family separation policy at the Mexican border, bans on refugees from several countries, and substantial slowdowns or increases in scrutiny for highly skilled worker visas.

The expansion of public charge-related exclusions echoes previous attempts by Trump officials between 2018 and 2020 to amend how health, income, and reliance on public programs were evaluated in visa and Green Card cases.

Those earlier rules-which faced heavy legal challenges and public pushback-were subject to ongoing court battles and partial rollbacks, but the 2025 directive signals a fresh, more comprehensive crackdown.​

Legal experts note that while health has always been a component in visa processing, including communicable and vaccine-preventable diseases, no prior administration gave this level of discretionary power to consular staff, nor explicitly listed chronic, non-infectious conditions as grounds for visa denial.

The broader context reveals a systematic trend towards “merit-based” immigration and prioritising applicants who can demonstrate both immediate economic value and minimal long-term risk to welfare systems.​

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

The Logical Indian believes that nations have a legitimate interest in protecting public health and managing resources, but blanket exclusions for treatable or common conditions undermine core values of fairness, empathy, and diversity.

Such policy risks stigmatizing those with chronic or age-related health issues, and could erode the principle of equal opportunity long associated with the American dream. Instead, immigration reform should balance fiscal responsibility with compassion and inclusion.

We urge policymakers to seek innovative solutions-such as insurance requirements, healthcare cooperation agreements, or tailored screening protocols-that allow for public interest protection without resorting to outright exclusion and bias.",https://thelogicalindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-Social-Thumbnail-Template-20-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 03:17:16.413603

Department of Homeland Security officials accused him of faking the medical emergency to keep agents from arresting his wife, who was wanted for allegedly stabbing a co-worker with scissors.

“I wasn’t letting go of my wife because they wanted to take her away,” Carlos Zapata, 24, told The Boston Globe in Spanish. He spoke to the newspaper on Friday, a day after his wife was detained in a chaotic traffic stop.

Bystanders shouted and recorded the confrontation as Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers surrounded the family's car Thursday morning in Fitchburg, a city about 40 miles (65 kilometers) northwest of Boston. Agents were seeking Juliana Milena Ojeda-Montoya, who was inside the vehicle with her husband and 1 ½-year-old daughter, according to a Homeland Security news release.

Widely circulated video shows Zapata behind the wheel, his body shaking and the whites of his eyes visible as masked agents reach into the car.

“He's having a seizure!” bystanders can be heard shouting.

Zapata told the newspaper that agents were pushing him and his wife together with the child between them, and that he blacked out after agents pressed on his neck.

“I had convulsions or something. I don’t know what they did to me,” he said. When he regained consciousness, he said, agents were handcuffing him.

Zapata said he and his wife are from Ecuador and entered the country unlawfully several years ago. They have since applied for asylum in a case that is pending and are authorized to work, he said. He was driving his wife to her job at Burger King when they were stopped, he said.

That was, until a massive immigration raid at the battery plant two months ago left Lee stunned and his business reeling. Federal agents handcuffed, chained and detained more than 300 Korean workers in an operation President Donald Trump later said he fully opposed.

The workers were flown home after a few days in immigration detention, but the effects of the raid continue to ripple out – from the tables at Lee's restaurant, to Hyundai headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, to Trump's White House.

The high-profile raid of a major global Fortune 500 company that had been aggressively recruited to Georgia infuriated many Korean Americans. According to Pew Research, some 1.8 million people in the United States trace their roots to South Korea, a nation that had long thought of itself as America's equal.

And it raised existential questions for Lee's business and for Korean Americans nationwide who didn't imagine that people here lawfully would be targeted by ICE, or that the Trump administration would pick a fight with a country that had invested billions in the U.S. economy.

Born in Philadelphia to Korean parents, Lee himself had worked 15 years for Hyundai before he launched his eatery, one of a dozen businesses in this Savannah suburb that opened to serve the Koreans and Korean Americans who came to work at the plant.

""I thought America was like my mother country, and Korea was like my father country,"" Lee said. ""So it's like my parents are fighting.""

Biggest raid in ICE history

A majority of the 300 Korean workers were present legally, on B-1 visas or under a visa waiver, that allowed them to perform equipment installation and to train American workers, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who represented a dozen of the workers.

However, some workers had worried their visas might not allow them to do the jobs they were assigned, given the increased enforcement under Trump, according to the Reuters news agency.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided the plant on a warrant to target four Hispanic workers they suspected might be in the United States illegally. They detained 475 people there on September 4, in what officials initially touted as the largest single-site raid in ICE history.

ICE had a judge's permission to search the plant for records related to employing or harboring undocumented immigrants, according to the warrant obtained by USA TODAY. Prosecutors have yet to bring criminal charges in connection with the raid, according to a search of federal court records.

""ICE knew they screwed up,"" Kuck said. ""Within 24 hours ICE stopped speaking to the press about the biggest raid in its history. It definitely is still roiling the companies because I've been told none of (the workers) want to come back.""

The Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America is the company's first mass-production plant for electric vehicles and is slated to produce half a million vehicles annually. It's an $8 billion campus that is expected to generate 8,500 jobs in the region.

The raid specifically hit a Hyundai-LG Energy Solutions partnership: a plant under construction to make EV batteries for the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 electric SUVs.

That plant was scheduled to open by early 2026, but the arrests of hundreds of workers will delay its opening at least two to three months, Hyundai Chief Executive José Muñoz has said.

In late October, Trump traveled to Asia, looking to negotiate new trade deals and mend fences with the Koreans. Speaking from Air Force One en route, Trump said he was ""very much opposed"" to the Hyundai raid.

""Some of these factories make very, very complex, very highly sophisticated equipment,"" he told reporters. ""They've got to bring people in with them for a period of time.""

After the raid, Trump offered to let the workers remain in the U.S., but only one accepted.

A longtime strategic relationship

Trump has good reason to want to smooth over relations with South Korea. Decades of business and cultural ties are at stake, along with billions of dollars in investment and tens of thousands of jobs.

Korea ranks as the United States' eighth-largest trading partner, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

""South Korea has been a rising global power over the last two or three decades,"" said Chris Suh, associate professor of history at Emory University in Atlanta. ""Korean Americans feel that Korea finally made it.""

Seoul-based Hyundai was eager to show its commitment to the United States despite the raid.

Hyundai held its annual investor conference outside of Korea for the first time ever this year, opting for New York.

Muñoz, the CEO, opened Hyundai's September investor day with a message of ""sincere empathy"" for the workers who were detained. He underscored the company's investments and urged the United States and Korea to ""work on mutually beneficial solutions"" for foreign workers.

""Hyundai has been part of the fabric of the U.S. for nearly 40 years and has operated in Georgia for more than 15 years,"" he told investors, adding that the new battery plant ""is helping transform the region with long-term economic benefits for thousands of families.""

That's in part why the questioning and arrest of hundreds of workers who looked Asian dismayed many Korean Americans, said Mark Keam, president of the Korean American Institute.

""To say there is a sense of betrayal is an understatement,"" he said.

Keam, a naturalized U.S. citizen, has lived in the United States for 45 years, served as an elected state representative in Virginia and worked for the Biden and Clinton administrations. Korean Americans, like other Asian Americans, often deal with what he calls ""perpetual foreigner syndrome"" – the creeping feeling that, no matter their citizenship or background, they'll always be perceived by other Americans as foreign.

The raid ""has become the trigger that raised concerns that were just below the surface,"" said Keam, who travels the country in his role and recently visited Seattle, Chicago and New York City. ""In every one of those places, when I was with Korean American people, it was the biggest topic that comes up.""

Business is 'not recovering at all'

Tables at Lee's 92 Chicken franchise are emptier than they were before the raid. Lee estimates he lost a fifth of his business in its wake.

""It dropped dramatically,"" said Lee. ""It's not recovering at all.""

The city of Pooler lies between artsy Savannah and rural Ellabell, where Hyundai built its Metaplant campus. The fast-growing suburb sprawls over roughly 30 square miles, bursting with traffic and development.

""To be in the midst of Pooler to see all this growth, I was the only Korean woman and now I go to Costco and Publix and I hear my own language,"" said Kay Heritage, a longtime Korean American resident and owner of Big Bon Bodega restaurant in Pooler, which, among other things, serves a pizza topped with pickled Korean kimchi.

As Koreans and Korean-Americans flocked to the suburb, new restaurants blossomed to serve them, as did other businesses from estheticians and physical therapists to grocers and realtors, she said.

The community's loss of so many Koreans at once has hit hard.

""Especially the Korean restaurants felt the impact,"" she said.

The Hyundai campus promised a continuous flow of people and capital from Korea, said Suh, the professor at Emory.

""If these folks stop coming or are hesitant to come, that means less business, fewer people to participate in the Korean American community, fewer people going to church, buying food,"" he said. ""I think it's going to take awhile for people to feel the same way they did before the raid.""

In the kitchen of his restaurant, Lee makes Korean-style fried chicken by battering thighs and drumsticks, then brushing on a soy-garlic, sweet chili or spicy gochujang sauce, topped with green onions. He leaves plastic gloves on the tables for diners who don't want to get messy.

Now Lee is revamping his menu, looking to Americanize his fried chicken to mimic the Southern recipe, he said.

""Local people like it more, a little more saltier, and a little more sweeter,"" Lee said. ""We're gonna have to make things a little less spicy on the menu.""

He isn't angry about the raid, he said; but he is resolved.

""I can't do anything [about] the decision makers,"" he said. ""I've got to diversify my menus.""

""I stick up for Viktor Orban. Not a lot of people do, because they're, in many cases they're jealous. They wish they did what he did. They would have no problems if they did what he did,"" Trump said at a Nov. 7 White House meeting.

Trump said he's told European leaders they can learn from Orban's approach. Orban is a hero in the MAGA movement and Trump's critics have compared his second-term agenda to the playbook the Hungarian leader has used consolidate power in his country.

Orban has fought with the European Union over its support for Ukraine and his crackdown on independent institutions, in addition to the issue of immigration.

Trump said he gets along well with European leaders, but when it comes to border controls he agrees with Orban. European nations have made ""tremendous mistakes"" when it comes to taking in foreign nationals, he said.

""I happen to think he was right, because their whole fabric has changed,"" Trump said. ""I mean you go to some of the countries, they're unrecognizable now, because of what they've done. And Hungary is very recognizable.""

Trump said the autocrat had done a ""fantastic job"" and was a ""very powerful man within his country"" who's ""beloved"" by people who know him.

“Hungary’s government is systematically dismantling the rule of law and suppressing dissent under the guise of protecting national sovereignty,” Iskra Kirova, Europe and Central Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, wrote last month.

Orban said he was at the White House to ""open a new chapter"" and repair chilly relations. The Hungarian hard-liner spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2022 and attended the NATO summit in Washington in 2024 but was never received at the White House by former President Joe Biden.

Trump acknowledged that Orban is a controversial figure, as he hosted the leader who's taken steps to limit press freedom and political opposition.

""He's respected by everybody, he's liked by some,"" Trump said.

Trump said he was considering an exemption for Orban's government to the sanctions the United States has put on Russian energy companies and that the war with Ukraine would be a topic of their discussion. Hungary is one of the largest remaining importers of Russian oil and gas in Europe and has come under fierce criticism by backers of Ukraine for his relationship with Vladimir Putin.

So once they are brought to South Sudan, that means that criminal activities will also increase,"" Martin Mawut Ochalla, a 28-year-old from Juba, told AP.","Deeply insecure and teetering on the brink of another civil war, South Sudan is frequently described as the most fragile state in the world.

Now the US, a global superpower, has tapped this young state as a destination for expelled foreign migrants, some of whom are violent criminals.

Washington began third-country deportations earlier this year, sending undocumented migrants to countries they are neither citizens of nor have any connections to.

While Central and South America have taken in the vast majority of those deportees, the program was also expanded to Africa, where some say Donald Trump is ""dumping"" people.

Experts now warn South Sudan, whose inability to deliver basic services as a state has already been compounded by sweeping USAID cuts, may be ""importing instability"" in a bid to appease its powerful ally.

World's poorest carrying burden

South Sudan, which is among five African nations taking in US deportees, was the poorest country in the world as of November in terms of GDP per capita.

Measured in net household wealth, the United States is the richest in 2025.

In July, South Sudan took in eight deportees from the US, saying it had ""responded positively"" to Washington's request as a ""gesture of goodwill, humanitarian cooperation and commitment to mutual interests"".

South Sudan's government, based in Juba, did not divulge details about what it would receive in return.

However, it has been reported that political concessions, including the removal of sanctions on ruling party members, and a chance to improve ties with the US were on offer.

Daniel Akech, a senior analyst for South Sudan at the International Crisis Group, said being in a protracted state of humanitarian and financial distress made the country particularly vulnerable to strong-arming by foreign actors.

""However, Juba's leadership also made a pragmatic, if reluctant, choice to use the deal as a potential pathway to ease crippling sanctions and begin rebuilding diplomatic relationship with the US,"" he told the ABC.

Since its formation in 2011, South Sudan has continually grappled with internal unrest, economic breakdown, and the spillover effect of the war in Sudan.

With more than 90 per cent of its 12 million population living in extreme poverty, it is heavily dependent on international partners for its developmental and humanitarian needs.

""By accepting this deal, the South Sudan government risks trading a potential diplomatic gain for a definite social loss,"" Mr Akech said.

""This situation adds further complexity to South Sudan's already fragile status, illustrating how external powers may exploit the country's internal vulnerabilities to advance their strategic objectives.""

Due to the large outflow of people from war-stricken neighbouring Sudan, South Sudan already hosts more refugees than it can handle, in addition to the 2.6 million of its own people who remain internally displaced.

According to the World Bank Group, South Sudan was hosting an estimated 900,000 refugees and asylum seekers from Sudan as of October, with 337,000 more expected to arrive before the end of the year.

Conditions in the refugee camps are squalid, with poor sanitation, outbreaks of diseases and severe malnutrition rife.

An 'equally agenda-motivated' government

Corruption is entrenched in the South Sudanese political sphere and has been a significant driver of the country's humanitarian challenges.

The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranked South Sudan as the most corrupt country in the world in 2025.

A recent United Nations investigation documented how government-affiliated elitists had plundered its resources in an ongoing pursuit of ""partisan political ends"".

""The country has been captured by a predatory elite that has institutionalised the systematic looting of the nation's wealth for private gain,"" the report said.

Juba's acceptance of the US's third-country deportations is also likely to have been ""agenda-motivated"", Edmund Yakani, head of the civil society organisation CEPO, told the ABC.

""They viewed the deal on the deportees as a means to give them the opportunity of winning some gains from the US government.""

Unlike other African nations, such as Rwanda and Eswatini, the US did not make South Sudan a cash proposal — money, which if offered, could have been used to bolster the local economy and improve living standards.

Instead, Juba's chief demands included lifting US-imposed sanctions on South Sudan's Vice President Benjamin Bol Mel and his companies, sources have told Reuters.

Mr Bol Mel was planted into the vice-presidency this year after his predecessor, Riek Machar, was placed under house arrest by the government of Salva Kiir, the only president South Sudan has had.

""Interest in accepting the deportees [forms part of South Sudan's efforts] to drive the US administration on non-interference in Riek Machar's trial,"" Mr Yakani said.

In April, Washington also announced it was revoking US visas for all South Sudanese passport holders.

Reversing those visa revocations, reactivating a bank account at the New York Federal Reserve, and support for Mr Machar's prosecution were Juba's other demands, according to POLITICO, though the US has not agreed to any of them on paper.

Longer-term repercussions

The Trump administration has stated it aims to deport 1 million people annually, but analysis from the Migration Policy Institute suggests it will meet just half that target.

Mr Yakani said efforts to cover that shortfall could likely see Africa become more of a ""dropping ground"" for US deportees if African governments saw even part of their demands being met.

While South Sudan has so far taken in just eight migrants — one of whom is its own national — an influx of people would increase pressure on state institutions and essential services sectors.

Recent bilateral engagements between the White House and African leaders have hinged on the migration issue, reflecting what observers say is an attempt to transform Africa into a regional network for offloading people.

Increasing migrant numbers could have ramifications for African host countries' security, social stability and international reputation, according to Iman Al-Shaarawy from the UAE-based think tank the Future for Advanced Research and Studies (FARS).

Those include the ""division of the African stance"", deepening public anger, more resource scarcity, criminality, the perception that national sovereignty is being infringed upon, human rights criticism, and a ""re-creation of the narrative of Western dominance"" in a form akin to neocolonialism, she said.

Ms Al-Shaarawy also noted the White House's immigration-heavy focus on Africa risked creating an unequal relationship where ""certain nations serve as mere instruments to implement US domestic policy, with little regard for their local situations or their people's interests"".

Those deported to South Sudan so far have been described by the US as ""uniquely barbaric monsters"" and the ""worst of the worst"" criminals, including murderers, rapists and paedophiles.

""Some of them are criminals, they have been involved in crimes. So once they are brought to South Sudan, that means that criminal activities will also increase,"" Martin Mawut Ochalla, a 28-year-old from Juba, told AP.

Some could 'afford to' turn down overtures

The African nations of Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda and Eswatini have also agreed to take in US deportees, but some others have rejected the Trump administration's overtures.

Burkina Faso, a country long marred by terrorism and insurgency, as well as a close Russian ally, said last month it had refused the ""indecent"" request, which it called ""completely contrary to the principle of dignity"".

""Is this a way to put pressure on us? Is this blackmail? Whatever it is … Burkina Faso is a place of dignity, a destination, not a place of expulsion,"" its foreign minister then told local media.

Similarly, Nigeria said in July it would not cave in to pressure to accept undocumented foreign nationals, saying: ""We have enough problems of our own … we already have 230 million people.""

The US has reportedly also courted Liberia, Senegal, Mauritania, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Benin, Libya, Angola and Equatorial Guinea.

""Some countries can afford to say no more easily than others,"" Mr Akech said.

The motivations of the five countries that have agreed to receive deportees vary.

While details of the individual deals the US has struck with them remain shrouded in secrecy and legally ambiguous, here is what we know:

The human cost

The welfare of those being deported has also been raised as a key concern by international organisations and rights groups.

In September, a coalition of more than 50 organisations penned a letter to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights calling for urgent action to protect migrants' rights:

""Forcible expulsions from the United States and transfer of migrants to countries in which they are not citizens or nationals, nor habitual residents, particularly without adequate due process or consideration of international protection claims, and including in circumstances in which they are transferred to situations of prolonged detention on unclear legal bases and in poor conditions, all constitute serious violations of international and African law and standards.""

The UN has said deportations of foreign nationals to third countries — many with troubling rights records, such as Eswatini — put them at risk of violations, including torture, arbitrary deprivation of life, and enforced disappearances, in the absence of legal avenues for those in need to seek.

While some African host nations have successfully negotiated the repatriation of migrants, Mr Akech said the main focus for weaker states such as South Sudan was fulfilling their diplomatic bargains with the US.

""What happens to [the migrants] afterward is largely a secondary concern that the state is unequipped to manage effectively.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5dc4b1413ee81c3212dfc78ce0a53a0a?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1901&cropW=3380&xPos=0&yPos=176&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-08 15:17:40.547836

(Amaya Edwards — Santa Cruz Local/CatchLight Local)

CAPITOLA>> Throughout 2024 and early 2025, federal and out-of-state law enforcement agencies searched Capitola Police Department’s database of automatic license plate readers more than three million times, violating multiple laws. At least 190 were done by sheriffs offices and police departments running searches on behalf of U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Capitola Police have confirmed that they violated state law in sharing data with out-of-state agencies, and said the violations were unintentional. Now, the department is increasing its oversight into how other agencies use its data.

“The City remains committed to transparency, accountability, and maintaining the trust of our community,” Capitola Police Chief Sarah Ryan wrote in a Nov. 7 email.

Capitola Police “does not assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in enforcing civil immigration law violations,” she said.

Capitola police lease 10 cameras from security company Flock Safety that capture license plates of passing vehicles. The data is stored on a Flock-administrated online database for 30 days. That database can be searched by Capitola Police officers and other law enforcement agencies, primarily to locate stolen cars or track down suspects.

Legally, Capitola Police can only share data with other law enforcement agencies within California. But the department had opted into a tool offered by Flock that allowed Capitola Police to search license plate data nationwide —- and allowed out-of-state searches of Capitola’s own data, a Flock spokesperson said in a Nov. 7 email.

Those searches violated California laws that forbid local and state law enforcement from sharing license plate camera data information with any out-of-state agency. Although ICE officials did not directly search Capitola’s data, public records suggest that out-of-state agencies performed searches on behalf of ICE.

Flock disabled nationwide sharing for public agencies in California in February to ensure compliance with state law, the Flock spokesperson said. But Capitola Police didn’t realize the data had been available to out-of-state agencies until a whistleblower alerted them in late October.

The violations of state law “were inadvertent and were not the result of any deliberate attempt by City staff to circumvent California law,” Ryan said by email. Ryan was sworn in as chief in December 2024, nine months after the Capitola City Council voted to lease the license plate cameras.

To ensure ongoing compliance with state law, Ryan has ordered a monthly audit of searches other agencies have conducted of Capitola’s data, she wrote.

Search records

The out-of-state searches were first identified by a retired security network analyst who lives in Santa Cruz County, after he started noticing the cameras around the area in April. “I was then immediately concerned about, okay, how are they storing the data?” recalled D., the security analyst, who asked only to be identified by his last initial out of fear of retaliation from law enforcement or Flock. He has worked in network security for 10 years.

“Especially given that they are a startup,” he added. “I’ve done security for startups, and I know that a lot of times, security is not as strong as it should be.”

The Atlanta, Georgia-based surveillance company Flock Safety says over 5,000 agencies in 49 states use its automated license plate reader. The cities of Capitola, Santa Cruz and Watsonville all operate Flock license plate cameras. Police chiefs have praised the cameras as an effective way to track down suspects of serious crimes and recover stolen vehicles.

But amid the increasing surveillance, arrest and deportation of unauthorized immigrants, city contracts with Flock have sparked pushback from activists, academics and state legislators.

In October, D. submitted a public records request to the Capitola Police for its network audit, a document that logs times other agencies have searched Capitola’s data, for 2024 and 2025. Those searches scoured databases of thousands of agencies across the country.

The logs Capitola provided D. left off the reasons out-of-state officers conducted each license plate search. But by looking at unredacted search logs from other police departments, D. was able to identify dozens of cases where out-of-state agencies searched Capitola data for immigration enforcement purposes.

For example, on Dec. 19, 2024, the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office in Georgia searched data from 5,770 agencies, including Capitola Police Department, and listed the reason as “ICE.” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has tapped local law enforcement agencies to search license plate data in pursuit of unauthorized immigrants, 404 Media reported in May. 404 Media is a digital publication reporting primarily on cybersecurity, technology and surveillance.

A Santa Cruz Local analysis of data from the City of Capitola and two other cities showed more than 200 immigration-related searches of Capitola’s data from dozens of state agencies from January 2024 to February 2025.

On at least one occasion, a federal agency — the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms — searched Capitola’s license plate camera data from a field division in Nashville, Tenn. The reason was listed at “Federal ERO Assist” — ERO likely referring to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

California’s SB 54, the 2018 California Values Act, prohibits local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Another law, SB 34, places limits on data collection from license plate cameras, and requires agencies to notify the public if their data has been breached.

License plate camera data may only be shared with other public agencies within California, according to legal guidance from California Attorney General Rob Bonta published October 2023.

But some law enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, continued to conduct searches on behalf of ICE, Calmatters reported in June 2025.

For members of Get the Flock Out, a local anti-Flock group, the records from Capitola underscore long-running concerns about local use of license plate cameras.

Local police “may be trying to handle the data well, but we’re seeing from these public releases that actually they’re not handling the data well,” said Get the Flock Out member Ami Chen Mills. “I think this is beyond the capacity of our small communities to handle.”

Even if California police departments are prohibited from sharing data out of state, Get the Flock Out has ongoing concerns about Flock’s ability to access the data and its history of collaboration with immigration enforcement. When determining the trustworthiness of license plate camera programs, “we can’t just look at our communities and our police departments,” Chen Mills said.

Local police say the cameras help public safety. But as people are “being abducted and detained against our Constitution,” Chen Mills said, “who do we want to keep safe?”",https://santacruzlocal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251106flockcapJK_0001.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 17:17:20.188613

The recent ICE raids across the country and in Southwestern Pennsylvania, along with immigration enforcement agents in the city of Washington in recent weeks, have sparked fear among immigrants in the area.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Philadelphia office confirmed in an email on Friday that ICE operations have been taking place in the city of Washington.
City of Washington police and Washington County Sheriff’s office said they were not notified of ICE presence.
“Then he called Saturday to tell her he was detained by ICE,” said Karamcheti.","UPDATE: This story was updated on Nov. 8 to reflect confirmation of ICE raids.

The recent ICE raids across the country and in Southwestern Pennsylvania, along with immigration enforcement agents in the city of Washington in recent weeks, have sparked fear among immigrants in the area.

“Around last October, the fear level from 0 to 10 was at a 2. I’d say it’s now at an 8 or 9. It’s awful. People are frightened,” said the Rev. Jay Donahue, parochial vicar at St. Oscar Romero Parish in Washington. The parish includes Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church in Meadow Lands, where Donahue conducts a weekly Mass in Spanish for the church’s large Latino community.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Philadelphia office confirmed in an email on Friday that ICE operations have been taking place in the city of Washington.

Since Oct. 20, as many as 23 immigrants have been detained in the city of Washington and nearby communities, according to Erenia Karamcheti, director of social services at St. Oscar Romero Parish.

In one incident, three immigrants who work in construction were detained last week while stopping for breakfast at a restaurant on Jefferson Avenue.

Families of those who have been detained have turned to Karamcheti for help to locate where their loved ones are being detained, and when and if they will be given a fair hearing.

Karamcheti said a brother of one of the construction workers who was detained told her his brother, who speaks limited English, unintentionally signed a self-deportation letter and is being sent back to Guatemala.

“There’s been a very, very sharp uptick in enforcement around Pittsburgh,” said Joe Murphy, an immigration attorney with Allegheny Immigration Group. “People are being grabbed at courthouses – in one case, right in front of me – and you see people detained going to hearings, to Social Security offices and other government offices.”

ICE arrests have soared across the country since President Donald Trump’s second term began in January and the government launched a massive crackdown on immigrants.

Nationwide, ICE raids have occurred at farms, construction sites and other businesses, and near schools and other “sensitive locations” that, Murphy said, “has intentionally created an atmosphere of fear.”

Karamcheti has been using ICE’s online detainee locator system in an attempt to find where local detainees have been transported. She has tracked some to locations including Cambria County Prison and Moshannon Valley Processing Center.

City of Washington police and Washington County Sheriff’s office said they were not notified of ICE presence.

ICE operations are federal, and the agency isn’t required to notify local police of enforcement actions.

The sheriff’s office – which has a 287(g) agreement with ICE to perform some immigration enforcement duties – said its agency has received no request for assistance from ICE.

Concern over ICE activity has left families afraid to do everyday activities, said Monica Ruiz, executive director of Casa San Jose, a nonprofit support organization for Latino immigrants that has built a Rapid Response Network of trained volunteers who monitor and document ICE activity across Allegheny County and neighboring areas.

“They’re afraid to go to work, they’re afraid to send their kids to school or take them to school, and they’re scared to go to the store,” said Ruiz, noting detainments in Southwestern Pennsylvania have increased 250% since this time last year. “It has made it difficult for people to function and it obviously takes a toll on their financial stability, but it also takes a toll on their mental health.”

Karamcheti has shopped for groceries, cooked meals, and picked up prescriptions for those who prefer not to leave home, and she and others have arranged transportation for school students whose parents are afraid to drive them.

On a recent morning, Karamcheti stopped by the home of a woman whose husband, from Guatemala, has been detained at Cambria County Prison. The couple have a toddler, and she is fearful that her husband will be deported.

Earlier that week, she got a phone call from a mother whose son left for work on a Friday but didn’t show up.

“Then he called Saturday to tell her he was detained by ICE,” said Karamcheti.

Attendance at the church’s regular health, dental, and legal clinics has dropped. Donahue said 15 people had signed up to attend a health clinic operated by volunteer doctors earlier this week, but only three showed up.

Karamcheti said she had thought the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies would be aimed at violent criminals, and is alarmed that people without criminal records are being swept up.

“They are not taking criminals. They are taking hard-working people,” said Karamcheti. “These are good people, without any criminal record, who just want to work and take care of their families.”

Ruiz agreed.

“What’s important for people to understand is that this was supposed to be about detaining criminals, and what we’re seeing is that’s not what’s happening,” she said.

According to statistics from the Cato Institute, about 65% of those detained had no criminal convictions and 93% had no violent convictions, and most convictions among those with a record fell into minor offenses such as immigration or traffic violations.

Donahue said attendance at Mass at Miraculous Medal has remained steady, but noted it has dropped at other churches in the Diocese of Pittsburgh and other congregations serving the Latino community.

On Sunday, about 200 people filled the pews at a Mass that acknowledged Dia de los Muertos, a celebration of life that honors and remembers deceased loved ones.

“It was one of the biggest church services we’ve ever had,” said Donahue, who was delighted at the turnout and a celebration held later, where church members filled an altar with photos of deceased loved ones, marigolds, glowing candles, salt, and offerings of favorite food and drink. “Luckily, Mass attendance has not died down, but people are not showing up at events like they used to.”

The Catholic Church steadfastly defends the rights of immigrants.

In an email statement, Bishop Mark Eckman, bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, said

“As the Catholic Church teaches, every person has dignity and worth as a child of God. The Church supports the right of nations to protect their borders while also affirming the fundamental rights of migrants and refugees to safety, family unity, and the opportunity for a dignified life. Our parishes continue to accompany those in need through prayer, pastoral care, and acts of compassion.”

Donahue, who regularly writes letters to congressional representatives and senators decrying the current U.S. anti-immigration policies, has accompanied congregants to immigration court and lobbied for the release of a church member who had been detained in Moshannon for 3 1⁄2 months before he was released.

Earlier this week, Donahue served as a translator at the immigration hearing of a parishioner from Mexico who faced deportation and a re-entry ban after her visa expired. The woman, who is engaged to a U.S. citizen and is planning a 2026 wedding, won her case.

The parish also is serving as caregiver for two children whose mother was detained and deported to Mexico, he said.

At St. Oscar Romero, a parish group launched a GoFundMe this summer to raise money for rent, food and bills for families who have lost financial resources, including its immigrant church members.

Donahue worries that the human rights and dignity of immigrants are being ignored.

“What are we doing here? The key is to see that these are human faces, not bunk bed numbers,” said Donahue, referring to a church member who was detained at Moshannon and was called “Up 25” for 3 ½ months because he occupied the top bunk of bed 25 in a 38-bed unit. “It’s dehumanizing.”

Ruiz said immigrants, who pay taxes, “bring a lot of economic value to our community.”

“Think about places in Washington County where immigrants have worked on farms and in other occupations. They’re ingrained into that community. Let’s be honest, they’re not getting any free things, they’re contributing,” she said.

Ruiz, too, is dismayed by what she calls the “inhumane” treatment of documented and undocumented immigrants who are being picked up every day in Southwestern Pennsylvania.

“This is not who we are. I don’t want this to be who we are,” said Ruiz. “We have to be better than this.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/washington.ogdennews.com/images/sites/3/2025/11/08073437/Image-5-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 17:17:12.236907

The Department of Homeland Security says agents have arrested more than 3,000 people in Chicago since immigration enforcement actions began there in early September. Immigrants have been changing their routines because of the crackdown, sometimes missing work or school. And as Adora Namigadde and Aleja Hertzler-McCain of Religion News Service report, some people are also staying home from church.

ALEJA HERTZLER-MCCAIN: Three men sit on plastic chairs in a basement in Chicago.

ADORA NAMIGADDE: They say Mass at their parish feels like home in Guatemala, but now they're too afraid of being detained by ICE if they go to church.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) We decided to stay home, go to work and rest. And on Sundays, it's better to stay at home because we have these dreams.

NAMIGADDE: Dreams of making sure his daughter back home gets a good education.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: These men agreed to be interviewed as long as we don't give their names because they fear deportation. And we agreed not to name their parish because they worry it could be targeted.

NAMIGADDE: About a year ago, the men were in a severe car accident. One family member died.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) When we needed it most, they helped us a lot. And many, many sisters here from this parish came to us to lift our spirits when we were in bed.

NAMIGADDE: The men tell us Mass is the one place they found community since coming to the U.S.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: And not feeling safe enough to go weighs heavy.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Through interpreter) It hits close to your heart. Well, it feels like - it feels horrible.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: After the accident, the parish's migration ministry helped them pay rent and living expenses until they could go back to work as roofers.

NAMIGADDE: The volunteer who helped make that happen doesn't have legal status, either. He came to the U.S. from Mexico 28 years ago.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Through interpreter) Many of us are afraid to go to work, to go to a restaurant, to go to church because everyone, everybody is afraid of encountering ICE.

BLASE CUPICH: We need to be honest, as a country, about why people are here and why they do not have documents.

NAMIGADDE: Cardinal Blase Cupich is the Archbishop of Chicago.

CUPICH: It's because we have failed, and our legislators on both sides of the aisle have failed to enact comprehensive immigration reform.

NAMIGADDE: The Department of Homeland Security tells NPR that agents use discretion when enforcing immigration law at houses of worship, and agents need approval from a supervisor before taking action in locations such as churches.

UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: (Singing in Spanish).

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: In September, St. Oscar Romero Catholic Parish on Chicago's South Side dedicated its three-mile jubilee pilgrimage to praying for migrants. Fr. Carmelo Mendez says Mass attendance there is down about 40%.

CARMELO MENDEZ: We give them the opportunity to come to church, but if they don't feel comfortable, I believe God understands their concerns and their fears.

NAMIGADDE: At the Mass after the event, Mendez preached that all people are equally loved by God.

MENDEZ: (Through interpreter) May God Almighty, Jesus, the immigrant, Mary of the journey inspire us to recognize that we are only passing through here. No matter where you were born, no matter when you migrated, our citizenship is not here but in the presence of the lord.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: At a different parish in one of Chicago's northern suburbs, church attendance is down by about 25%.

NAMIGADDE: The deacon there says the surge of federal agents has made many people scared to go.

UNIDENTIFIED DEACON: We have a group of people bringing the Holy Communion to those people who are in fear for any deportation or any detention.

NAMIGADDE: He's trying to fill in the spiritual gaps by ministering to people online and in their homes. Now, there's a ministry for people to pray the rosary on Zoom, and he brings food to some parishioners several days a week.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: The church remains on high alert.

UNIDENTIFIED DEACON: Before they start the Masses, people watch outside the parking lot, the street if they see any movement or any immigration officer. And before the Mass ended, also, they do the routine walking in the street to protect our community.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: Despite these understandable fears, some immigrants are going to Mass anyway.

NAMIGADDE: Back at the Guatemalan men's parish in Chicago, we also spoke with a woman whose adult children have been begging her to stay home.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter) I told them they weren't going to take that away from me.

NAMIGADDE: She also asked that we withhold her name.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: She used to attend Mass every day, but now she only goes once or twice a week.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter) Seeking God is the most important thing for me. They know that because they say that the church is my second home.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: This grandmother came to Chicago 38 years ago and serves her parish with care, washing linens used at Mass.

NAMIGADDE: She wants her kids to trust that God will keep their parents safe from deportation.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter) I tell them that's not going to happen. God is with us. Go to church more, seek God that you may feel more comforted by Him.

NAMIGADDE: She survived cancer and the loss of her home. She says she can't show weakness because she'll make her kids weak.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: But sometimes she feels the weight of it all.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Through interpreter, crying) I have my children, and I don't see myself separated from them. No. No, I don't think I could endure that. I've endured a lot that has happened to me because I say my God has given me strength. But they don't have the strength that I have, and maybe not the faith.

HERTZLER-MCCAIN: God, she says, is her strength. For her, going to church is worth the risk. For NPR News, I'm Aleja Hertzler-McCain.

NAMIGADDE: And I'm Adora Namigadde in Chicago.

People familiar with the situation told the paper that the two intended to use the jets to expand deportation flights – and for personal travel.
Those sources also claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials had cautioned them that buying planes would be far more expensive than simply expanding existing flight contracts.
Meanwhile, Democrats on the House appropriations committee said in October that during this fall’s record-long government shutdown, the DHS had already acquired two Gulfstream jets for $200m.
A DHS spokesperson told the Journal that parts of its reporting about the plane purchases were inaccurate but declined to provide additional clarification.","The secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kristi Noem, reportedly authorized the purchase of Spirit Airlines jets before discovering the airline didn’t actually own the planes – and that the aircraft lacked engines.

The bizarre anecdote was contained in a Wall Street Journal report released on Friday, which recounted how Noem and Corey Lewandowski – who managed Donald Trump’s first winning presidential campaign – had recently arranged to buy 10 Boeing 737 aircraft from Spirit Airlines. People familiar with the situation told the paper that the two intended to use the jets to expand deportation flights – and for personal travel.

Those sources also claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials had cautioned them that buying planes would be far more expensive than simply expanding existing flight contracts.

Complicating matters further, Spirit, which filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time, in August, did not own the jets and their engines would have had to be bought separately. The plan has since been paused, according to the Journal.

Meanwhile, Democrats on the House appropriations committee said in October that during this fall’s record-long government shutdown, the DHS had already acquired two Gulfstream jets for $200m.

“It has come to our attention that, in the midst of a government shutdown, the United States Coast Guard entered into a sole source contract with Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation to procure two new G700 luxury jets to support travel for you and the deputy secretary, at a cost to the taxpayer of $200m,” Democratic representatives Rosa DeLauro and Lauren Underwood wrote in a letter to the DHS.

A DHS spokesperson told the Journal that parts of its reporting about the plane purchases were inaccurate but declined to provide additional clarification.

Congress had previously approved Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” in July, which dedicates roughly $170bn for immigration and border-related operations, a sum that makes ICE the most heavily funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

In September, the Guardian reported that the Trump administration was moving immigrants detained as part of its deportation agenda in ways that violated their constitutionally protected rights, often by plane.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e438f496ef1aa3d27bab5fca03ba26f0d7485178/423_0_2695_2157/master/2695.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39dd7b1bb501da9b43cab15213406191",N,,2025-11-08 14:17:03.131540

The other major operator of private jails is CoreCivic. Earlier this year Scripps News visited a CoreCivic jail in Kansas that is ramping up operations to eventually begin housing immigrants.

But the company has other detention centers already open, leading to a jump in revenue of 18% last quarter. The company's earnings have sharply increased since 2020.

With the Trump administation aiming to detain thousands more immigrants, both companies see room to bring in even more money from the deportation push.

“Perhaps the United Nations should investigate the ‘human rights crisis’ that is Chicago’s crime rate.” The White House echoed McLaughlin’s criticisms of Chicago’s crime rate in its own statement.
Sanctuary city policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
In February, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council, accusing the body of not living up to its potential.
Established in 2006, the UNHRC is a 47-member body that meets in Geneva each year to discuss human rights issues and adopt resolutions compelling governments to take action.","The mayor of Chicago on Friday invited a panel of independent United Nations experts to examine what he called the federal government’s “abusive immigration crackdowns” in the nation’s third-largest city.

Speaking before members of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson accused President Donald Trump’s administration and federal immigration officials of violating the “dignity of all Chicagoans” with violent raids, and he asked the human rights council to hold a special session to discuss “the worsening human rights crisis in the United States.”

“I call on this council to hold the federal government of the United States to the same standards of accountability you apply elsewhere in the world,” Johnson said in the virtual address. “No country should be above international law. Human rights are universal – or they are meaningless.”

Since the Department of Homeland Security launched its “Operation Midway Blitz” enforcement operation in the Chicago area in early September, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have descended on worksites, dragged residents through neighborhood streets and used chemical irritants to disperse protesters – tactics that a federal judge said “shocks the conscience.”

On Wednesday, immigration officers arrested a teacher after chasing her onto the grounds of a private preschool. The incident appears to be one of the first instances during Trump’s second administration in which immigration officers entered and made an arrest on school grounds – once considered off limits to enforcement actions. DHS disputed that the woman was arrested inside the school, saying she was detained in a “vestibule.”

In his remarks, Johnson characterized these kinds of incidents as stemming from a “moral failure” on the part of the Trump administration.

In a statement to the Washington Post, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin blasted Johnson for “demonizing ICE and CBP law enforcement,” adding that federal officers are facing increasing assaults as they use more aggressive tactics to meet Trump’s deportation goals.

“Mayor Johnson has shown time and time again he does not care about the innocent American lives taken at the hands of gang members, murderers, drug traffickers, and rapists who have no right to be in this country,” McLaughlin said. “Perhaps the United Nations should investigate the ‘human rights crisis’ that is Chicago’s crime rate.”

The White House echoed McLaughlin’s criticisms of Chicago’s crime rate in its own statement.

The enforcement operation is part of the administration’s broader crackdown on “sanctuary cities,” which have long drawn Trump’s ire. Sanctuary city policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

“Operation Midway Blitz” has resulted in the arrests of 3,000 undocumented immigrants throughout Illinois and northern Indiana, according to DHS.

Johnson said the deportation campaign has had a destabilizing effect on the city, and the harms extended beyond immigrant communities.

“In Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood – a proud, predominantly Black community – federal agents carried out what can only be described as a military-style raid designed for social media spectacle,” Johnson said. After the raid, DHS published to social media a video, set to cinematic music, of the operation.

“Helicopters circled overhead. Doors were kicked in. Homes were destroyed. Immigrant residents were detained in one van, while Black families – including young children – were held in another,” Johnson added.

Authorities said that they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Two of the 37 immigrants arrested in that raid were gang members, and dozens of U.S. citizens’ apartments were targeted.

On the city’s West Side, federal agents placed a Black man in a chokehold and forced him to the ground just steps from the doors of the legal nonprofit Westside Center for Justice, Johnson said. Earlier this week, federal agents rammed into the vehicle of Dayanne Figueroa before taking her into custody “for no apparent reason,” he added.

“These are not isolated incidents. They are reminders that the fate of our communities – Black, Brown, immigrant – is bound together,” Johnson said. “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. And in Chicago, we will stand united in defense of our shared dignity, safety and freedom.”

Johnson also sought to draw the U.N. body’s attention to the lapse in federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps. In Chicago, roughly 1 in 5 households receive food assistance, according to official state data.

“As someone with first-hand experience, I can tell you how humiliating it is when you open the refrigerator and you have nothing to eat,” Johnson said. “In the wealthiest country in the world, there is no reason why our federal government should allow hundreds of thousands of Chicagoans to go hungry.”

Friday’s address comes after the Trump administration skipped a review of its human rights record, known as the Universal Periodic Review. In February, Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council, accusing the body of not living up to its potential.

Established in 2006, the UNHRC is a 47-member body that meets in Geneva each year to discuss human rights issues and adopt resolutions compelling governments to take action. Members can also hold crisis meetings, known as “special sessions.”

In his remarks Friday, Johnson slammed the Trump administration for “fail[ing] to meet even the most basic expectations of transparency and accountability before this council.”

“By refusing to submit its Universal Periodic Review report and declining to appear for its review, this administration seeks to evade scrutiny for its violations of human rights – just as it has sought to evade accountability for its actions in cities like mine,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2025-11-08 22:16:50.048296

Baum",,,,,https://truthout.org/articles/rights-groups-sue-trump-admin-over-use-of-israeli-spyware-to-target-immigrants/,"Civil rights attorneys are suing the Trump administration to force the release of records detailing whether federal immigration agencies are using sophisticated Israeli spyware to track, monitor, and target immigrants and activists across the country.
Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world.
“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.
Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups.
“Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.”","Civil rights attorneys are suing the Trump administration to force the release of records detailing whether federal immigration agencies are using sophisticated Israeli spyware to track, monitor, and target immigrants and activists across the country.

The lawsuit, filed on Oct. 30 in federal court by Just Futures Law and the Center for Constitutional Rights, demands that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) comply with Freedom of Information Act requests related to their contracts with tech companies Cellebrite and Paragon Solutions. Both companies have been linked to government surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders, and protesters around the world.

Attorneys say immigrant rights are at urgent risk as the administration escalates arrests, detentions, and protest-related charges under President Donald Trump’s second term.

“The public has the right to know whether and to what extent the U.S. government deploys powerful spyware to infect people’s phones, extract data, and surveil people’s daily communications,” Julie Mao, an attorney at Just Futures Law, said in a press release.

“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE employs various forms of technology to investigate violations of the law, while appropriately respecting civil liberties and privacy interests,” an ICE spokesperson said in response to a request for comment.

CBP did not respond to Prism’s request for comment.

ICE has worked with Israeli spyware company Cellebrite for more than a decade. The agency currently holds two active contracts totaling $11 million with the company, which markets phone-cracking tools that allow law enforcement to extract data from locked devices, according to the attorneys’ press release. CBP, which also holds at least 20 Cellebrite software licenses, has partnered with the firm since 2008, the press release states.

Spyware from the Israel-based Paragon Solutions, known as Graphite, is considered even more invasive. According to technical researchers, the tool can hack into smartphones, including encrypted messaging apps, without the user’s knowledge. ICE entered into a contract with Paragon in September 2024, but the Biden administration paused the agreement due to national security concerns after issuing an executive order limiting the use of spyware by federal agencies. Trump reversed that decision in August, clearing ICE to resume the contract.

Members of Congress sent a letter last month demanding answers from ICE about its use of Graphite, calling the secrecy surrounding the program “deeply alarming.”

Immigrant communities fear these tools could supercharge longstanding surveillance and criminalization. Advocates say the technologies fit into a broader landscape in which immigrants and their supporters have been increasingly treated as threats to public order. Organizers from Dallas to Los Angeles report that social media posts about protests have drawn ICE attention. Family members have had their devices searched during home raids. Community defense networks believe the government is monitoring WhatsApp chats used to coordinate court support and legal aid.

The level of intrusion remains unclear, which is precisely what the lawsuit seeks to change.

“We should not have to go to federal court to force the government to hand over these records,” Ian Head, manager of the Open Records Project at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in the press release. “This administration wants to hide its abusive, Orwellian behavior, but we are fighting back.”

Earlier this year, the Canadian digital watchdog group Citizen Lab published a report tracing Paragon spyware deployments targeting political activists and journalists in Italy, Australia, Canada, and Denmark. Rights advocates fear the same tactics are now being adopted within U.S. borders and directed at already-vulnerable groups.

Surveillance researchers say the expansion reflects a deepening trend: Domestic policing agencies are increasingly using military-grade technology developed for foreign intelligence operations.

“In the wake of 9/11, federal agencies provided considerable funding to state and local law enforcement agencies to collect, analyze, share, and deploy a wide range of new data,” researcher Sarah Brayne told the research organization Data & Society. “Increasingly, local law enforcement agencies recognized these data could be useful for their own quotidian surveillance.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2241666688-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 15:17:44.833662

Interfaith leaders gathered for a prayer service in front of the ICE processing facility shortly after the women were detained. They were joined by protesters who have been demonstrating in Broadview for weeks against the Trump administration.

“We believe that our faith is stronger than fear in any chaos that they can create so we’re here standing in solidarity letting people know we’re going to continue to fight for our people because we believe that we have the power to conquer,” said Reverend Ciera Bates Chamberlain, Live Free Illinois Executive Director.

They oppose federal agents’ use of force including deploying tear gas during Operation Midway Blitz. Some members of the Live Free Illinois group also attempted to hand a letter requesting access inside the facility.

“Our goal is continue to request and demand that people get the type of spiritual care that they need especially under these extreme circumstances while they’re under duress,” said Rev. Chamberlain.

Protesters said they want to send a message and defend the actions of the group of suburban moms who were taken into custody.

“Nothing is more important than the harm that is happening to people we have to get people’s attention to notice what’s actually going on,” said Meg Thomas-Cary, witness. “Someone sitting in the road is not doing harm, people being apprehended harmful.”

The Cook County Sheriff’s Office said the people arrested ranged in age from 23 to 59 years old.

Those arrested are facing charges of obstruction and disorderly conduct.

However, I find that she inadvertently created the appearance of impropriety and bias ….”

McInerney said Joseph created that impression during her interactions with attorneys at the arraignment and by unintentionally violating a court rule when she allowed an off-the-record discussion about ICE’s plans to detain the defendant.

“I therefore recommend that she receive a reprimand,” wrote McInerney. “Moreover, because this proceeding has been public, and to ensure that there is no misunderstanding as to what Judge Joseph is — and is not — being reprimanded for, I recommend that the reprimand be public.”

In 2019, Joseph and a court officer were federally charged with obstruction of justice on allegations that they let Jose Medina-Perez, a Dominican national who has been deported twice, sneak out a back door of Newton District Courthouse after a hearing on drug and fugitive from justice charges.

At the time, the charges led to her suspension from the bench. Federal prosecutors dropped the charges in 2022 when Joseph agreed to refer herself to the state agency for an investigation of misconduct.

At the end of his report, McInerney wrote that Joseph “is a thoughtful, diligent, and conscientious judge undeserving of the harsh public criticism she has received in connection with this matter, and entirely worthy of the opportunity to finally move on from it.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png,N,,2025-11-08 15:17:52.305449

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A federal judge in Oregon ruled Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration failed to meet the legal requirements for deploying the National Guard to Portland after the city and state sued in September to block the deployment.

The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial last week in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.

The administration said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump described as “war ravaged” with “fires all over the place.”

In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to “great deference” in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.

“The trial record showed that although protests outside the Portland ICE building occurred nightly between June and October 2025, ever since a few particularly disruptive days in mid-June, protests have remained peaceful with only isolated and sporadic instances of violence,"" Immergut wrote. “The occasional interference to federal officers has been minimal, and there is no evidence that these small-scale protests have significantly impeded the execution of any immigration laws.”

The Trump administration criticized the judge's ruling.

“The facts haven’t changed. Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.

“The courts are holding this administration accountable to the truth and the rule of law,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in an e-mailed statement. ""From the beginning, this case has been about making sure that facts, not political whims, guide how the law is applied. Today’s decision protects that principle.”

Democratic cities fight back

Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — have been pushing back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty.

Immergut issued two orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.

Immergut has called Trump's apocalyptic descriptions of Portland “simply untethered to the facts.”

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already ordered that the troops not be deployed pending further action by the appeals court. The trial Immergut held further developed the factual record in the case, which could serve as the basis for further appellate rulings.

Demonstrations at ICE building peaked in June

Witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city’s ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump’s National Guard announcement.

The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion.”

Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., because of safety concerns.

R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland’s ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or Trump. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.

Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.

The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer because of property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.

No protection from deportation Migrant rights organizations denounce that expulsions are being carried out without granting detainees due process.","Donald Trump is not satisfied with the results of the immigration crackdown he launched as soon as he moved into the White House after winning the election a year ago. The raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) “haven’t gone far enough,” he said in a recent interview on CBS’s 60 Minutes, where he defended ICE agents’ aggressive tactics, which have sparked protests across the country. The Trump administration claims to have deported more than 400,000 people since taking office — a high number, but still short of the one million deportations the Republican had promised, and harder to achieve than he expected.

Trump had already made it clear on the campaign trail: if he won, he would carry out the largest deportation effort in history. In his first 100 days, the Republican approved 175 immigration-related measures. Most of those actions were aimed at increasing deportations, but they also shut down borders and weakened asylum and refugee programs. The government has turned documented residents into undocumented ones, expelled workers who had committed no crime, separated families, and even detained U.S. citizens.

“He has been far more aggressive than anyone expected, more brutal,” says Matt Barreto, a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). “He has acted with virtually no regard for the law, violating people’s rights and receiving almost weekly warnings from the courts, including from judges he himself appointed, that his actions are illegal.”

Many of his actions are being challenged in the courts, and after his first 10 months in office, it is almost impossible to keep track of all the rulings issued by district judges and appellate courts. Some of those cases have reached the Supreme Court, which — with its conservative majority — has upheld several of Trump’s initiatives, such as allowing the use of racial profiling (whether based on appearance or place of work) to justify an arrest.

The president’s determination to achieve deportations on a historic scale has led him to allocate an enormous sum — $170 billion — for immigration enforcement as part of his “big, beautiful” tax reform, approved in July. The funds will go toward expanding the raids that have multiplied across the country, as well as increasing detention capacity through the construction of new immigration centers.

“One of the biggest changes under the Trump administration has been the shift of immigration enforcement into the interior of the United States,” notes Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute (MPI). ”Under the previous administration, the primary goal was to reduce the number of arrivals at the border.”

As early as January, Trump shut down entry points, and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) recorded just 279 daily apprehensions in September — a 95% drop compared to the daily average during Joe Biden’s presidency, according to official data. By deploying immigration agents inland, Trump has effectively opened the door to a full-scale hunt for migrants.

During the previous administration, the priority was detaining undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes. Trump also vowed to focus on deporting criminals — “the worst of the worst” — but in practice, being undocumented has become synonymous with being a criminal. Only 35% of those detained by ICE have criminal records, compared to 65% in October 2024.

The numbers may not satisfy the president, but they are at record highs. When Trump returned to the White House in January 2025, there were 39,000 detainees in ICE custody. By the end of August, that number had risen to 61,000 and could reach 107,000 by January 2026, according to MPI data. The September average — the most recent month available — stood at 1,178 arrests per day, still below the 3,000 daily target set by Stephen Miller, the White House architect of immigration policy.

The surge in ICE raids has spread fear throughout migrant communities, which have seen once-sensitive locations — churches, schools, and hospitals — lose their protected status. Videos showing agents arresting parents as they drop their children off at school have gone viral, sparking panic among students.

One of the most heavily targeted places is immigration courts. Officials take advantage of migrants’ scheduled check-ins — meant to comply with government requirements — to detain them, turning what should be a routine appointment into a trap.

Targeting Democratic cities

Cities governed by Democrats have been the target of the largest anti-immigration operations. Trump has sent National Guard troops to reinforce what he claims is a crime crisis caused by undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Memphis.

In Chicago, citizens staged a mass protests against Operation Midway Blitz, an aggressive ICE operation in which Blackhawk helicopters were used for arrests. Federal agents fired pepper bullets and tear gas at demonstrators who had gathered outside the Broadview detention center, in a predominantly Black and Latino suburb, to protest the treatment of detainees.

In detention centers like Broadview, children, pregnant women, abuse victims, and migrants with no criminal record are crammed together. Detainees and the organizations that defend them denounce unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and the lack of access to medicine and medical care. Many sleep on the floor, with barely any warm clothing, under bright lights that remain on through the night, making rest impossible. They are also denied communication with their lawyers or families, according to the complaints.

The poor conditions in which detainees are held have been cited as a possible reason why, during fiscal year 2025, 23 people have died in ICE custody — the highest number in 20 years. Several family members reported that the deceased had no known illnesses at the time of their arrest.

ICE detention centers can no longer keep up with the number of detainees, leading to the reopening of closed prisons and the construction of new ones — such as the controversial Alligator Alcatraz facility in Florida, which faces lawsuits for holding inmates in inhumane conditions and for having been built without environmental studies in a protected wetland area. Despite the criticism, the administration plans to create more such centers, allocating $45 billion for the effort.

The lack of space to handle the surge in arrests has led the government to turn to the two largest private prison companies, CoreCivic and GEO Group — both major donors to Trump’s presidential campaign — to manage facilities for housing detainees.

Detention is now the standard prelude to deportation. Once detained, migrants are increasingly unlikely to be released. The percentage of people freed on bail, parole, or supervision fell from 26% in October 2024 to just 3% in September 2025, according to MPI data. In fact, 90% of those detained by ICE in September 2025 were deported directly from detention centers, compared with 63% a year earlier.

No protection from deportation

Migrant rights organizations denounce that expulsions are being carried out without granting detainees due process. Back in March, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1889 to deport more than 200 migrants to El Salvador without trial, accusing them of belonging to the Latin American criminal gangs Tren de Aragua and MS-13.

No evidence was ever presented, and many of those deported — who were imprisoned in the notorious Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT) — had no criminal record. Some, such as the now well-known Kilmar Abrego García, a Salvadoran who is fighting a legal battle against the government and has become a symbol of unjust deportations, even had court orders protecting them from removal.

“This has become a matter of democracy. [Trump] is using his immigration policies to undermine democracy in the United States, defying court orders and ignoring laws passed by Congress,” argues Barreto.

What’s more, to broaden the spectrum of those who can be deported, the government has eliminated legislation granting legal permanent resident status and work permits to millions of people. Among other actions, it has canceled programs like humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which were created to shelter citizens fleeing their countries due to armed conflicts, natural disasters, poverty, and political crises. Hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans, Haitians, Cubans, and Venezuelans have suddenly lost protection from deportation.

For those who cannot be returned to their home countries because the latter refuse to accept them, the administration — with the Supreme Court’s approval — is sending them to third countries such as Rwanda, South Sudan, and Eswatini, where human rights are not respected and governments offer no guarantees about the fate of deportees.

The aggressiveness of the immigration policy that has marked Trump’s first 10 months in office has completely transformed the lives of millions of migrants, as well as those of U.S. citizens. “The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policy is affecting the rights of Americans, as we’ve seen with the detentions, but it has also changed their way of life: now they carry identification documents for fear of being arrested or detained,” says Bush-Joseph. “That wasn’t what people expected.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/TMCJW77JO5OHNK5HEPVHGFNOS4.jpg?auth=72a687105204b0e44111856f9c61c2ea7176491ae7959a1fb77120c25f0bad27&width=1200,N,,2025-11-08 11:01:26.915347

https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/arts/design/as-trump-recasts-history-a-civil-rights-museum-sticks-to-a-messy-past.html

Workers at the newly reimagined National Center for Civil and Human Rights were busy on a recent afternoon assembling an exhibit that begins with a rush of progress: The Civil War has ended and slavery is abolished. Black candidates are elected to public office. Institutions of higher learning, like Morehouse College and Atlanta University, are established to serve Black students. The Greenwood District of Tulsa, Okla., emerges as a hub of prosperity known as Black Wall Street.

Then, the exhibit abruptly shifts.

Greenwood is shown ravaged by fire and bloodshed in an outbreak of racial violence. Across the South, white leaders orchestrate a web of laws that enforce segregation, block access to the polls and keep would-be Black politicians out of positions of power for generations.

“It’s the story of Black progress and white backlash,” said Kama Pierce, the chief program officer and curator of the exhibit at the center in Atlanta, which is reopening on Saturday after a $58 million overhaul and expansion. “We feel like we’re still in this cycle in this country.”

It is not lost on the center’s leaders that a museum devoted to the push and pull of the country’s fitful civil rights history is reopening at a moment when President Trump has used the force of the federal government to dismantle diversity programs and promote a sunnier version of America’s story.

For several years there had been widespread pressure for cultural institutions to wrestle with the enduring reach of racism after the murder of George Floyd. The pendulum has now swung in the other direction.

This year the president issued an executive order assailing a “revisionist movement” that “deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame.” His administration has sought to scrub the Smithsonian Institution of “divisive or ideologically driven language” and replace it with “unifying” descriptions. The leader of the National Portrait Gallery stepped down after the president attacked her public comments about racial and gender inequality.

The work of preserving and amplifying civil rights history in the Deep South has always been fraught. But museum officials and civic leaders in Atlanta said providing an unvarnished depiction of the movement required a renewed level of perseverance in the current climate.

“We learn from our history — some of it we celebrate, some of it we grieve over,” said Shirley Franklin, a former mayor of Atlanta and longtime champion of the center, which first opened in 2014. “The stories always needed to be told,” she said, adding that now “the challenge of telling these stories might be greater, but institutions like the center have an opportunity to fill the gap.”

The museum’s curators said their intention was to neither sensationalize nor sanitize history, but to still have it resonate in a visceral way. To achieve that, they have relied heavily on documentary evidence including photographs and video, statements from participants in important events, and contemporaneous accounts from journalists.

Among the changes is an update to one of the museum’s most popular, and most emotionally taxing, exhibits: a simulation of a sit-in protest at a diner. Visitors perch themselves on stools, put on headphones and place their hands on the counter while listening to taunting and threatening voices.

Now visitors are introduced to the intensive training that demonstrators went through, instilling the need to stick together and remain unflappable. Built-in tissue dispensers were also added, in recognition of how many people walk away shaken and tearful — often before the one-minute, 25-second recording ends.

The museum also created a larger space dedicated to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whose papers the museum has exclusive rights to display. King’s daughter Bernice curated the first of the rotating exhibits. It includes some handwritten correspondence and is focused on lessons on civil disobedience and her father’s broader activism on improving economic opportunity and working conditions and challenging the Vietnam War.

Museum leaders said they refrained from too much interpretation in the exhibits to encourage visitors to draw their own conclusions.

“We don’t exaggerate the sins any more than we exaggerate the triumphs,” said Jill Savitt, the center’s chief executive.

“We’re not putting our thumb on the scale,” she added. “But we’re telling you what the rights are. We’re telling you where in the world people have felt those rights weren’t being respected, and how they mobilized around it.”

The funding for the renovation came largely from private sources, including the foundations of wealthy patrons and large corporations, as well as from the city of Atlanta. With the new offerings, including vastly expanded event space, the center is seeking new revenue streams to insulate it from a harsher landscape.

It does not directly rely on federal support, yet it has still felt the squeeze as the Trump administration slashed funding for arts and humanities. As nonprofits scramble to replace money from lost grants, there is more competition for financial help from independent foundations.

Some have argued that Atlanta’s history, as King’s home base and a nucleus for the civil rights movement, demands it maintain a certain steadfastness, even if it comes at a cost. Mayor Andre Dickens has continued with diversity, equity and inclusion programs despite a federal imperative to disavow them.

Choices such as those have been cast as an extension of an unwritten compact reached generations ago by Atlanta’s political, business and religious leaders to prioritize the pursuit of shared prosperity over racial divisions.

The “Atlanta Way,” as it is known, has been an imperfect bargain. It did not entirely spare the city from deep imbalances rooted in racism and could be deployed as a shiny veneer to paper over entrenched problems. Still, it is widely credited as fueling Atlanta’s success as a capital of commerce and culture.

The National Center for Civil and Human Rights is a manifestation of that mind-set.

The museum shares a parking deck with the World of Coca-Cola and the Georgia Aquarium, two of the city’s most popular attractions. It was built on land donated by the Coca-Cola Company, and other major corporations and philanthropies in Atlanta have been consistent backers, including the family foundation of Arthur M. Blank, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot.

The center was also designed to join a cluster of offerings that have made Atlanta a destination for soaking up civil rights history, including the national park encompassing King’s birthplace and the old sanctuary of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he was pastor.

“We see ourselves as a beacon for those kinds of values,” said Fay Twersky, the president of the Blank Family Foundation.

Museum leaders wanted the exhibits to make clear that their themes are not distant history, but also part of the present.

The center’s mandate covers the broader umbrella of human rights, including disability rights, L.G.B.T.Q. issues and the work to ensure access to basic human needs, like food and water. More attention has been paid to women and gay people, namely the pioneering activists Dorothy Height and Bayard Rustin.

Curators have also dedicated more space to Black empowerment. A modern take on a jukebox was installed to play songs reflecting that collective pride, like James Brown’s “Say It Loud — I’m Black and I’m Proud.”

An elaborate interactive section is being added for children, who had been unserved by past iterations. A secret passage behind a bookcase leads them to a lair for “change agents,” where they learn about the influence of young people in activist movements.

Much of the history the museum covers is despairing, but its leaders want it to be threaded with hope. After all, unsteady progress is still progress. One display has small cards highlighting ways for visitors to become more civically involved, like volunteering with groups helping refugees or supporting local news organizations.

For those unhappy with how things are, the museum has a message: Be engaged, but also be patient. Something different will emerge soon enough.

“No matter where you stand, it’s reform and resistance,” Savitt said.

“You can believe the reforms are positive reforms or negative, but we’re telling a story about that forward march and push back,” she added. “That’s the story of America.”

Rick Rojas is the Atlanta bureau chief for The Times, leading coverage of the South.

They include apps that let federal agents point a cell phone at someone's face to potentially identify them and determine their immigration status in the field, and another that can scan irises. Newly licensed software can give ""access to vast amounts of location-based data,"" according to an archive of the website of the company that developed it, and ICE recently revived a previously frozen contract with a company that makes spyware that can hack into cell phones.

The federal agency is also ramping up its social media surveillance, with new AI-driven software contracts, and is considering hiring 24/7 teams of contractors assigned to scouring various databases and platforms like Facebook and TikTok and creating dossiers on users.

The Trump administration is seeking to employ new technology as it tries to boost deportations to a million a year, a target that could be helped with tech to identify and locate noncitizens subject to removal.

Some Democratic members of Congress are raising legal concerns about the new technologies and are asking questions of ICE that are going unanswered. A group of U.S. senators have called on ICE to stop using a mobile facial recognition app.

""Americans have a right to walk through public spaces without being surveilled,"" Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Mass. told NPR.

Privacy and civil liberties advocates also warn these surveillance tools represent a grave threat and say there is not a sufficient regulatory framework in place or oversight to ensure federal agents are using new technologies in a way that protects privacy and constitutional rights.

""Immigration powers are being used to justify mass surveillance of everybody,"" said Emily Tucker, the executive director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law.

""The purpose of this is to build up a massive surveillance apparatus that can be used for whatever kind of policing the people in power decide that they want to undertake,"" she said.

Scanning Teens' Faces

The way ICE and Border Patrol agents use these technologies was on display in a video posted to TikTok last month by an account in Aurora, Ill. The video appears to show a group of masked Border Patrol agents as they jump out of an SUV and approach two young people on bikes on the sidewalk near East Aurora High School. The agents ask them their citizenship and to show ID.

One of the young men, who is filming the incident and does not appear on camera, says he is 16 and is a U.S. citizen but does not have an ID.

""Can you do facial?"" an officer is heard asking. Another officer then takes out a cell phone and points it as if taking a photo. He then asks the young person's name and the video ends shortly after that.

The person who posted the video did not respond to a message but said in comments on the post that the video was of their cousins. NPR was able to verify the location where the video was shot.

It is not clear which app the officer used. ICE has a mobile facial recognition app known as Mobile Fortify that uses images of people's faces and fingerprints to try to identify people in the field. A Department of Homeland Security document says the app searches for matches against Customs and Border Protection databases, including photos taken when people enter and exit the U.S., and can return information like a subject's name, birth date, alien number, possible citizenship status and ""Possible Overstay Status.""

In another section of the document, it says ICE will receive ""limited biographic data"" if the individual matches a photo from a specific list of targets, called the ""Fortify the Border Hotlist,"" and non-matches ""will not return any additional information.""

It also says individuals cannot decline to be photographed, and that photos are stored for 15 years, even if there is no match.

The existence of the app and documentation on how it works were both first reported by 404 Media, which obtained the DHS document through a Freedom of Information Act request.

This week, the outlet also reported that Customs and Border Protection made a different facial recognition app, Mobile Identify, available on Google's app store for state and local law enforcement agencies that are deputized to work with ICE.

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, called it a ""big leap"" that DHS now can have agents in the field simply point their phone at someone's face and instantly learn details about them.

""The whole idea of anonymity in public, it's really gone when the administration or the government can immediately identify who you are,"" Bier said, adding that this technology could have a chilling effect on people's willingness to attend public protests.

A group of Democratic senators, led by Markey, called on ICE in September to stop using the technology and answer questions about its use. ICE did not respond to their questions and the senators renewed their demand on Monday.

""This type of on-demand surveillance is harrowing and it should put all of us on guard,"" Markey told NPR. ""It chills speech and erodes privacy. It ultimately undermines our democracy.""

In their letter, the senators ask a long list of questions, including the legal basis to use the app, how it was developed, whether U.S. citizens are included in the database of photos the app matches to, whether there are policies for using it to identify U.S. citizens and if it has been used to identify protesters and minors.

Markey told NPR facial recognition is unreliable, especially for people of color, and expressed concern the Trump administration would ""weaponize that technology against anyone who disagrees with the government.""

Neither ICE or DHS responded to NPR's specific questions about mobile facial recognition apps.

An ICE spokesperson said in a statement, ""Nothing new here. For years law enforcement across the nation has leveraged technological innovation to fight crime. ICE is no different. Employing various forms of technology in support of investigations and law enforcement activities aids in the arrest of criminal gang members, child sex offenders, murderers, drug dealers, identity thieves and more, all while respecting civil liberties and privacy interests.""

DHS sent a statement that said, ""While the Department does not discuss specific vendors or operational tools, any technology used by DHS Components must comply with the requirements and oversight framework.""

The growing use of facial recognition technology comes as DHS published a proposed rule that would expand the agency's ability to ask for biometric data from noncitizens and their U.S. citizen relatives when they apply to adjust their immigration status, such as to obtain a green card or citizenship. Under the rule, the agency could ask for facial images, iris scans, finger and palm prints, voice prints and even DNA.

The public has an opportunity to comment on the rule until early January.

Spyware delivered by text

In August, the Trump administration revived a previously paused contract with Paragon Solutions, an Israeli-founded company that makes spyware. A Paragon tool called Graphite was used in Europe earlier this year to target journalists and civil society members, according to The Citizen Lab, a research group based at the University of Toronto with expertise in spyware.

Little is known about how ICE is using Paragon Solutions technology and legal groups recently sued DHS for records about it and tools made by the company Cellebrite. ICE did not respond to NPR's questions about its Paragon Solutions contract and whether it is for Graphite or another tool.

Graphite can start monitoring a phone — including encrypted messages — just by sending a message to the number. The user doesn't have to click on a link or a message.

""It has essentially complete access to your phone,"" said Jeramie Scott, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a legal and policy group focused on privacy. ""It's an extremely dangerous surveillance tech that really goes against our Fourth Amendment protections.""

Adding to an already robust surveillance infrastructure

DHS has been steadily expanding its surveillance capabilities under both Republican and Democratic administrations since its founding in the wake of 9/11.

As of 2022, a report by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology found ICE could locate three out of four U.S. adults through utility records and had scanned a third of adult Americans' driver's license photos.

But Georgetown's Tucker, who co-authored the report, said the situation is more dramatic now because of the Trump administration's aggressive posture on immigration enforcement and willingness to push legal boundaries.

""Even if there weren't robust laws and regulations for rights protection, there were some norms that were seen as not really transgressible basically by all the presidential administrations up until that point,"" Tucker said of the situation a few years ago.

Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.
President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.
They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty.
Immergut issued two orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial.","PORTLAND, Ore. — A federal judge in Oregon ruled Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration failed to meet the legal requirements for deploying the National Guard to Portland after the city and state sued in September to block the deployment.

The ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial last week in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law.

The administration said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump described as “war ravaged” with “fires all over the place.”

In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to “great deference” in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.

“The trial record showed that although protests outside the Portland ICE building occurred nightly between June and October 2025, ever since a few particularly disruptive days in mid-June, protests have remained peaceful with only isolated and sporadic instances of violence,"" Immergut wrote. “The occasional interference to federal officers has been minimal, and there is no evidence that these small-scale protests have significantly impeded the execution of any immigration laws.”

The Trump administration criticized the judge's ruling.

“The facts haven’t changed. Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.

“The courts are holding this administration accountable to the truth and the rule of law,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in an e-mailed statement. ""From the beginning, this case has been about making sure that facts, not political whims, guide how the law is applied. Today’s decision protects that principle.”

Democratic cities fight back

Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — have been pushing back. They argue the president has not satisfied the legal threshold for deploying troops and that doing so would violate states’ sovereignty.

Immergut issued two orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.

Immergut has called Trump's apocalyptic descriptions of Portland “simply untethered to the facts.”

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already ordered that the troops not be deployed pending further action by the appeals court. The trial Immergut held further developed the factual record in the case, which could serve as the basis for further appellate rulings.

Demonstrations at ICE building peaked in June

Witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city’s ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Trump’s National Guard announcement.

The Trump administration said it has had to shuffle federal agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, which it has characterized as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion.”

Federal officials working in the region testified about staffing shortages and requests for more personnel that have yet to be fulfilled. Among them was an official with the Federal Protective Service, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security that provides security at federal buildings, whom the judge allowed to be sworn in as a witness under his initials, R.C., because of safety concerns.

R.C., who said he would be one of the most knowledgeable people in DHS about security at Portland’s ICE building, testified that a troop deployment would alleviate the strain on staff. When cross-examined, however, he said he did not request troops and that he was not consulted on the matter by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or Trump. He also said he was “surprised” to learn about the deployment and that he did not agree with statements about Portland burning down.

Attorneys for Portland and Oregon said city police have been able to respond to the protests. After the police department declared a riot on June 14, it changed its strategy to direct officers to intervene when person and property crime occurs, and crowd numbers have largely diminished since the end of that month, police officials testified.

The ICE building closed for three weeks over the summer because of property damage, according to court documents and testimony. The regional field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, Cammilla Wamsley, said her employees worked from another building during that period. The plaintiffs argued that was evidence that they were able to continue their work functions.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Portland_AP_25312059757662_NAT_1108,N,,2025-11-08 09:56:31.877186

“I think Marylanders recognize that their attorney general ought to, and we are in fact, stepping up to defend the interests of the state.
“Suing the Trump administration over and over again is a total waste of Maryland taxpayer money,” Arikan said Oct. 23.
He cited the “Just Security” website, a litigation tracker of legal challenges to the Trump administration, maintained by the Reiss Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law.
As of Friday, Just Security was tracking 515 cases pending against the administration.. “It’s clear the Trump administration is pushing on the borders of the existing understandings of constitutionalism.","When Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) walked to the podium Thursday to announce a lawsuit against the Trump administration’s plans to keep the new FBI headquarters out of Maryland, he might have had a sense of déjà vu.

Since President Donald Trump (R returned to office on Jan. 20, Brown has walked up to a lot of podiums to announce a lot of legal actions against the administration.

In less than 10 months, Brown’s office has filed or joined other Democrat-led states, in 43 lawsuits against administration actions and has filed or joined in about 70 legal briefs in support of lawsuits by others challenging administration policies — including one on Friday, when Maryland joined 25 states challenging an administration plan to cut food assistance during the government shutdow..

That’s more in less than a year than the 95 lawsuits that former Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) led or joined during fur years of the first Trump term, from 2017 to 2021.

“It’s voluminous. There’s no doubt about that,” Brown said during an interview last month in his Baltimore office.

“I committed to Marylanders I would only bring actions that I think directly impact their rights, their privileges, their benefits, their well-being, and that I would protect the sovereignty of Maryland when challenged by the administration,” he said.

Apparently, he sees a lot of those challenges.

The lawsuits started coming the day after Trump’s inauguration, when Maryland joined New Jersey and 16 other states to block Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The latest was an Oct. 1 lawsuit challenging a policy that would have denied victim assistance funds to anyone who cannot prove their citizenship status.

Maryland sues Trump administration for ‘illegal’ action to keep FBI headquarters in D.C.

They have continued in between, sometimes at a pace of several per week, with lawsuits that challenge the White House’s efforts to rescind previously approved money for schools, to share personal health care informaton with the Department of Homeland Security and to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois.

Maryland has been a supporting player in many of the actions, but he led in others, including lawsuits to restore funding for the AmeriCorps program and to block the mass layoffs of probationary federal workers, and a brief in support of other groups seeking to protect transgender rights.

Brown stresses that his office is not “attacking the president. We’re challenging the actions that he takes.” For instance, he pointed to a suit in May against the U.S. Department of Transportation and Secretary Sean Duffy who wanted to withhold funds from states that don’t comply with White House immigration policy.

“When the president says that he’s going to attach conditions to transportation funding that could jeopardize important projects like the Key Bridge, like the completion of the Purple Line … he’s tying conditions entirely unrelated to transportation, but pursuing his own agenda,” Brown said. “I think Marylanders recognize that their attorney general ought to, and we are in fact, stepping up to defend the interests of the state.

“I invite anyone to come and point out to me something that this [a legal action] is nothing more than a political attack. I think you’d be hard pressed to find one.”

Not everyone agrees.

Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) said the actions of the attorney general’s office against the Trump administration are “politically motivated more than policy motivated.”

“We’ve dumped a lot of extra money into the AG’s office for all kinds of things. And what is the taxpayer seeing for it?” she asked. “We’re getting higher taxes. Housing crisis, an energy crisis. We’re not seeing the fruits of our taxpayer dollars being used efficiently,.

“Suing the Trump administration over and over again is a total waste of Maryland taxpayer money,” Arikan said Oct. 23.

‘Constitutional revolution’

Mark Graber, a constitutional law professor at the University of Maryland’s Francis King Carey Law School in Baltimore, said the lawsuits are political in the sense that only Democratic attorneys general are suing the Trump administration. On the other hand, Graber said those prosecutors are opposing certain actions by the administration.

Graber said some decisions in lower federal courts have favored the Democratic prosecutors in cases heard by judges appointed by Republican presidents. Some federal judges “are supporting these lawsuits in the sense that they’re finding the lawsuits are valid, have solid grounds,” he said.

He said the U.S. Supreme Court has been much more supportive of the president so far. “It’s rather interesting that the Supreme Court appears to be more partisan than the lower federal courts,” Graber said.

He cited the “Just Security” website, a litigation tracker of legal challenges to the Trump administration, maintained by the Reiss Center on Law and Security at New York University School of Law. As of Friday, Just Security was tracking 515 cases pending against the administration..

“It’s clear the Trump administration is pushing on the borders of the existing understandings of constitutionalism. It is attempting a constitutional revolution every bit as revolutionary as the revolution that led to the New Deal and the post-Civil War amendments,” Graber said. “It simply has a very different understanding of the Constitution than has existed previously.”

When asked what can be done to ensure the constitution is adhered to, Graber summarized three actions: file lawsuits, hold peaceful protests “in the streets” and “most importantly, when the time comes, vote.”

‘Political publication’

Not all of the opposition to federal policy has come in the form of a lawsuit or a brief. The attorney general’s office, for example, released a guidance memo Oct. 15 to remind Maryland law enforcement agencies that they must adhere to state law when working with federal authorities.

The guidance was required in legislation approved on the last day of the 2025 General Assembly session dealing with immigration enforcement. Part of the law requires the attorney general to “develop and publish guidance that informs the public and relevant state agencies” about immigration enforcement.

The 11-page document lists what local police “must do, may do and must not do” in a range of interactions with federal authorities, from simple backup to formal joint task force agreements. More specifically, it states Maryland officers “may not enforce civil immigration laws or assist federal agents in enforcing such laws.”

Maryland leads multistate brief calling Trump deployment of Guard ‘unlawful’

The memo highlights the 287(g) agreements that some Maryland sheriff’s department have made with Immigration and Customs Enforcement that let the local law enforcement officials take on certain immigration enforcement abilities. In Maryland, those agreements are largely restricted to the jail-based model of the agreement, where jails can execute administrative immigration warrants on people already in their custody.

But the guidance from the attorney general’s office cautions that “prohibitions on participating in civil immigration enforcement apply even when Maryland officers are operating under an agreement with federal authorities, including an agreement with ICE under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.”

Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), vice chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said the guidance was “well written” and “well researched,” and will not only benefit law enforcement agencies, but the immigrant community as well.

“I think that is exactly why we [General Assembly] asked for such guidance,” she said. “I’m very glad that the attorney general has been so explicit in explaining to us, or to the officers, and giving them the guidance that they need.”

But Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler, whose department has participated in a 287(g) agreement since 2016, called the attorney general’s guidance “more of a political publication tied to the national immigration debate than a practical law enforcement directive.”

“My concern is that it could be misinterpreted in a way that discourages law enforcement from sending aid to federal partners during real criminal emergencies, such as the assaults on federal officers and other acts of violence we have witnessed across the United States,” Gahelr said in a statement last month. “I hope that was not the intent, because the Harford County Sheriff’s Office will always respond when a crime is being committed or when anyone, to include local, state, or federal law enforcement, is under attack while doing their job.”

Brown said the guidance is nothing more than what it claims to be: A guide to help law enforcement agencies and to remind them of what the restrictions are, even with 287(g) programs.

“If you’re undocumented and you are a violent offender, you should be held accountable. And if that accountability means removal from this country, then that’s what it means,” he said. “What I don’t think is prudent with limited law enforcement resources available to any agency is to begin focusing on the enforcement of immigration law.”

On the question of politics vs. policy in the actions the attorney general chooses to take, Sen. Chris West (R-Baltimore County and Carroll), agrees with Arikan that at times it does “seem like a broken record, just day after day” suing the Trump administration.

But West, an attorney, said last month the Democratic attorneys general are not the only ones who play that game. He would like to see attorneys general, both Democratic and Republican, focus more on their constituents and less on the politics.

“Are they really spending their time and the money and the resources at their disposal effectively to represent their constituents? Or are they engaging in efforts which will benefit them politically, but won’t have much real impact on the people of their states?” he asked. “My feeling is what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. My message to both groups is stop it.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/anthony-brown-10-22-2025-1024x8711762608051.jpg?h=b0975d13&itok=DQUJ9Nlj,N,,2025-11-08 09:17:24.331259

Marimar Martinez, who is charged with assaulting a federal officer, was treated at a hospital for gunshot wounds after the confrontation last month.

In a Signal chat, agent Charles Exum shared with other agents a news story that quoted Christopher Parente, Martinez’s lawyer, as saying she “has seven holes in her body from five shots from this agent, who fired within seconds of getting out of this vehicle.”

“I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys,” Exum wrote in his Signal message, which was shared during a court hearing this week.

“Read it. 5 shots, 7 holes,” Exum wrote.

In a text to his brother about the shooting, the agent wrote, “Sweet. My 15 minutes of fame. Lmao.”

In another text a day after the shooting, Exum wrote, “Cool. I’m for another round of f--- around and find out. Lmao.”

Questioned on the witness stand by Parente about the tone of his messages, Exum citied his background as a firearms instructor.

“I take pride in my shooting skills,” he said.

Martinez and her co-defendant, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, have pleaded not guilty to identical charges and are challenging evidence in the case.

The Department of Homeland Security claimed Exum was acting in self-defense when he shot Martinez, a U.S. citizen, on the morning of Oct. 4. An agency statement posted shortly afterward said Border Patrol agents on the scene were “rammed by vehicles and boxed in by 10 cars.”

Parente has said body cam footage shows the agent initiated the contact between his vehicle and Martinez’s.

An updated DHS statement referred to Martinez and Santos as “domestic terrorists.” They have not been charged with terrorism.

The agency’s statement further described Martinez as having been armed during the altercation. A prosecutor informed the judge that she had a concealed carry permit for a pistol that was in her purse but that she did not brandish it. Martinez is not facing firearms charges.

Sen. Chris Murphy decried the DHS narrative as “propaganda” on social media, saying the agency’s version of events doesn’t align with the evidence.

Parente questioned Exum about why he had repairs done on his government vehicle instead of preserving it as evidence, as was done with Martinez’s car. A federal prosecutor acknowledged to U.S. District Judge Georgia Alexakis that a Border Patrol mechanic removed scuff marks and made other repairs to Exum’s Chevy Tahoe.

A trial for Martinez and Santos is set for February.

Many sent a video from that morning of immigration agents running into a day care facility in Chicago’s Roscoe Village neighborhood to pull out a teacher. It was the latest attack against the metropolis by President Trump’s deportation Leviathan, whose so-called Operation Midway Blitz this fall has made its earlier occupation of Los Angeles look like a play date.

Armed agents have sauntered through downtown and manned a flotilla of boats on the Chicago River. They shot and killed a fleeing immigrant and raided an apartment building with the help of a Black Hawk helicopter. In nearby Broadview, home to the region’s main ICE detention facility, rooftop migra shot pepper balls at protesters below, including a pastor. They even tear-gassed a neighborhood that was about to host a Halloween children’s parade, for chrissakes.

From Back of the Yards to Cicero, Brighton Park to Evanston, immigration agents have sown terror throughout Chicagoland with such glee that a federal judge declared that it “shocks the conscience” and issued an injunction limiting their use of force — which they no doubt will ignore.

I was in town to speak to students at the University of Chicago about the importance of reporting on things one may not like. Heaven knows that’s been my 2025. But as I waited to deplane, I checked my email and found something I’ve sorely needed this year:

Hope.

On Tuesday, Democrats won governor’s races in New Jersey and Virginia by wide margins. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York, telling Trump to “Turn. The. Volume. Up” during a soaring victory speech.

Back home in California, 64% of voters favored Proposition 50, the ballot initiative crafted by Gov. Gavin Newsom to create up to five Democratic-leaning congressional districts in response to Trump’s gerrymandering in Texas.

It was a humiliating rebuke of Trumpism. And the tip of the Democratic spear? Latinos.

In New Jersey, where Trump received 46% of the Latino vote in 2024, a CNN exit poll showed just 31% of Latinos siding with the losing GOP candidate for governor. Nearly two-thirds of Latinos in Virginia went against Cuban American Atty. General Jason Miyares, a Republican who also lost. The CNN poll also found that more than 70% of California Latinos voted for Proposition 50, a year after GOP Latino legislators made historic gains in Sacramento.

At the same time, support for Trump has dropped among Latinos. Only 25% of Latinos surveyed in October by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research viewed Trump favorably — a cratering from the 45% who liked him in April. Even more telling, two-thirds of Latino men thought negatively of Trump — despite 51% of that demographic choosing him in 2024.

Latinos’ leftward shift on election night already set off as many thought pieces as Trump did when he captured 48% of the Latino vote — the most a Republican presidential candidate has earned, despite his long history of slurring, maligning and insulting America’s largest minority. Democrats, who have long depended on Latino voters, were shocked, and GOP leaders were delighted, feeling that a demographic that had long eluded them was finally, truly within reach.

This week Latinos sent a loud message: You had your chance, y nada.

House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to play off his party’s collapse among Latinos to NBC News, sniffling, “I do believe that the demographic shift that we were able to see and experience in the 2024 election will hold.”

Mike: time to bring the Republican Party out of its Stockholm syndrome. Your guy has blown it with Latinos. Let him keep doubling down on his madness, and Latinos will continue to flip on ustedes like a tortilla.

Trump’s 2024 victory was the culmination of an extraordinary shift in the Latino electorate that few saw coming — but I did. As I’ve written ad nauseam since 2016, Latinos were beginning to favor the GOP on issues like limited government, immigration restrictions and transgender athletes in high school sports because Democrats were taking them for granted, obsessing over woke shibboleths while neglecting blue-collar issues like gas prices and high taxes.

All this was was happening as the Biden administration made it easier for newly arrived undocumented immigrants to remain, angering those who have been here for decades without similar help. The long-standing tendency for Latinos to sympathize with the latest Latin Americans to cross over eroded, and some became more receptive to Trump’s apocalyptic words against open borders.

Last year 63% of Latinos in California considered undocumented immigrants to be a “burden,” according to a poll by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by The Times.

That happened to be the same percentage of California voters who favored Prop. 187, the infamous 1994 initiative that sought to make life miserable for undocumented immigrants and showed the GOP that xenophobic politics can work.

After the 2024 election, Latinos seemed to be joining earlier Catholic immigrants who were once cast as invaders — Irish, Italians, Poles, Germans — on the road to assimilation and the waiting arms of the Republican party. All Trump had to do was improve the economy and clamp down on the border. If he did the former, Latinos would have been largely supportive of the latter, as long as deportations focused on newcomers.

Instead, Trump wasted his opportunity.

The economy remains stagnant. Trump effectively declared war on Latin America with tariffs real and threatened and by bombing Venezuelan and Colombian boats suspected of carrying drugs without asking permission from Congress.

Trump officials keep issuing punitive policies that crush the dreams of Latinos, like a crackdown on English fluency in the trucking industry and ending federal grants that helped colleges and universities recruit and retain Latino students.

But Trump’s biggest mistake has been his indiscriminate deportation raids. His toxic alphabet soup of immigration enforcement agencies — HSI, ERO, CPB, ICE — largely has ignored the so-called “worst of the worst” in favor of tamale ladies, fruteros and longtime residents. Nearly three-quarters of immigrants in ICE detention as of September have no criminal convictions, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

Trump’s deportation deluge has rained down across the country as his administration repeatedly has exhibited white supremacist tendencies, from effectively blocking all new refugees except South African Boers to pumping out social media garbage extolling a mythical America where white makes right and Latinos exist only as blurry mug shots of alleged illegal immigrants.

No wonder 65% of Latinos feel it’s a “bad time” to be Latino in the U.S. — a 25-percentage-point drop in optimism from March of last year, according to an Axios-Ipsos poll done with Telemundo and released this week.

Trump even is losing credibility among Latino Republicans, with a September 2024 AP-NORC poll finding that 83% of them had a “very” or “somewhat” positive view of the president last year.

Now? Sixty-six percent.

Trump very well can win back some of those Latinos in 2026 if the economy improves. But every time his migra goons tackle innocents, another Latino will turn on him and get ready to fight back.

At the University of Chicago, orange whistles hung around a bronze bust just outside the room where I spoke. They’ve become a symbol of resistance to Trump’s invasion of the City of Strong Shoulders, blown by activists to alert everyone that la migra is on the prowl.

I grabbed one as a memento of my time here and also as a reminder of what’s happening with Latinos right now. Nationwide, we’re warning everyone from the front lines — the streets, the ballot box, the courtroom, everywhere — about the excesses of Trump and warning him what happens if he doesn’t listen.

The platform outlines a series of reforms the group says are necessary to protect civil rights and prevent further harm to vulnerable communities.

The ACLU of New York reports that the Trump administration has “mused about taking over New York” and increasing federal policing, ICE activity, and surveillance, placing immigrant communities at heightened risk. According to the platform, ICE has already used Manhattan’s immigration courts as “the epicenter” of arrests, while federal officials attempt to undermine the city’s sanctuary laws through lawsuits and political pressure.

Advocates argue the next mayor must “defend and strengthen” New York’s sanctuary commitments, as detailed in the platform. Recommendations include passing the New York City Trust Act to allow residents to seek court relief if city agencies violate sanctuary rules, removing carveouts that allow the NYPD and Department of Correction to honor ICE detainers, and expanding legal services such as the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project.

The platform also critiques the NYPD’s renewed use of broken windows policing, citing “racial bias” and an increase in stop-and-frisk, low-level arrests, and misconduct complaints. It was suggested that units like the Neighborhood Safety Teams and Community Response Teams should be disbanded because they are “the worst offenders” in abusive tactics. Advocates also note that immigrant delivery cyclists face criminal penalties for traffic infractions that drivers only receive civil fines for, a disparity the platform attributes to harmful enforcement priorities.

Regarding protest rights, the ACLU states the NYPD has a “history of violently responding to protests” and urges the mayor to implement safeguards outlined in the Payne settlement. Recommendations include ending kettling, limiting drones, curtailing chemical and acoustic weapons, and eliminating the Strategic Response Group, according to the platform.

On surveillance, the report warns the federal government is expanding “invasive, unregulated” technology to monitor immigrants and marginalized communities. The platform calls on the next mayor to regulate facial recognition, license plate readers, and police drones, and to increase transparency around city algorithms so New Yorkers “know when AI tools are making decisions impacting their lives.”

Additionally, the crisis at Rikers Island, which the jail’s conditions call a “humanitarian disaster,” was noted as deaths continue “month after month.” According to the report, the jail population rose above 7,000 due to excessive bail, criminalization of mental illness, and delays transferring people to state prisons. Advocates asked Mamdani to expand early release programs, coordinate with state corrections to accelerate transfers, and commit to closing Rikers as required by city law.

The ACLU also demands the elimination of solitary confinement, withdrawal of any plans to allow ICE to operate on Rikers, and restoration of gender-affirming housing for transgender and nonbinary people. According to the report, the mayor must “protect the rights of every person detained in New York jails.”

In education, the report warns that LGBTQ and immigrant students face increased federal hostility. The platform calls on the mayor to strengthen NYC Public Schools’ protections against ICE access, require all school personnel to receive training on protections for vulnerable students, and reinvest funding from school policing into counselors, nurses, and extracurricular programs. According to the platform, heavy reliance on metal detectors and harsh discipline contributes to the school-to-prison pipeline.

Finally, the platform highlights threats to reproductive and gender justice, urging the mayor to increase investment in abortion access, expand gender-affirming care, and ensure all city agencies offer an X gender marker on identity documents.

The ACLU of New York concludes that the next mayor must “steer New York toward a stronger democracy” by resisting federal crackdowns and protecting the rights of immigrants, incarcerated people, students, and other impacted groups.

WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Friday refused to lift a judge’s order requiring U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration to fully fund this month’s food aid benefits for 42 million low-income Americans during the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.

The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered its ruling hours after the U.S. Department of Agriculture informed states it would be making funds available to fully fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, as ordered in a Thursday ruling by a Rhode Island judge.

USDA sent the memo to states even as the U.S. Department of Justice urged the federal appeals court to block the judge’s order that USDA by Friday use $4 billion set aside for other purposes to ensure Americans receive full rather than reduced SNAP benefits in November.

SNAP benefits lapsed at the start of November for the first time in the program’s 60-year history. Recipients have turned to already strained food pantries and made sacrifices like foregoing medications to stretch tight budgets.

SNAP benefits are paid monthly to eligible Americans whose income is less than 130% of the federal poverty line. The maximum monthly benefit for the 2026 fiscal year is $298 for a one-person household and $546 for a two-person household.

States Begin to Issue Aid

Several states including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts announced after the USDA issued its memo that they had directed state agencies to issue full federal SNAP benefits for November.

“President Trump should never have put the American people in this position,” Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey, a Democrat, said in a statement.”

The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston on Friday afternoon had not yet ruled on the administration’s appeal, despite a request by the Justice Department for it to do so by 4 p.m. EST.

McConnell and another judge had ruled last week that the administration must at least tap $5.25 billion in emergency funding to partially fund SNAP benefits, which cost $8.5 billion to $9 billion per month.

On Saturday, McConnell said the USDA could either use agency contingency funding once it resolved the “administrative and clerical burdens” of paying reduced benefits, or tap additional funding to fully pay out November’s SNAP benefits.

The USDA opted on Monday to use only contingency funding, which after subtracting $600 million for states’ administrative costs would leave $4.65 billion to cover benefits.

On Thursday, McConnell agreed with a coalition of cities and nonprofits represented by the liberal legal group Democracy Forward that the USDA failed to consider it could take weeks or months for some states to change their systems to process reduced benefits, prolonging delays.

The judge, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, accused the Trump administration of withholding SNAP benefits for “political reasons.”

The plaintiffs said in a Friday brief that the administration showed disregard for the harm that would befall nearly one in eight Americans if the 1st Circuit agreed to halt McConnell’s decision and allow anything short of full benefit payments to proceed.

“The Court should deny Defendants’ motion and not allow them to further delay getting vital food assistance to individuals and families who need it now,” the lawyers wrote.

FIRST ON FOX: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that more than 200,000 Americans have applied to be U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents as the agency continues its hiring campaign.

The surge in applications comes despite a substantial 8000% increase in death threats toward the agents, as first reported by Fox News.

""ICE has received more than 200,000 applications from patriotic Americans who want to defend the homeland by removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from the U.S.,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Americans are answering their country's call to serve and help remove murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our country.""

In August, Noem cited a more than 1000% increase in assaults on immigration law enforcement officers — an uptick she noted came amid anti-ICE protests across the country and Democratic rhetoric surrounding ICE's mission.

ICE APPLICANTS SAY THEY WANT TO JOIN TRUMP'S DEPORTATION CAMPAIGN TO DELIVER 'JUSTICE' IN US

Agents have been busy around the country seeking out illegal migrants who have committed crimes in the U.S. and abroad, recently taking to the streets of New York City to make arrests on the city’s infamous Canal Street partially known for selling counterfeit luxury and designer products.

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani sent a message to ICE agents during a speech in Queens the morning after his election victory.

""My message to ICE agents and to everyone across this city is that everyone will be held to the same standard of the law,"" Mamdani told the crowd. ""And there is, sadly, a sense that is growing across this country that certain people are allowed to violate that law, whether they be the president or whether they be the agents themselves.""

OVER 100K AMERICANS RUSH TO JOIN TRUMP'S MASSIVE ICE HIRING SPREE NATIONWIDE, DHS SAYS

New York’s newly-elected mayor isn’t the only Democrat to criticize the administration's deportation efforts. In late October, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said that agents were intentionally targeting ""Brown and Black"" individuals.

""They are literally targeting people who are Brown and Black, whether you are undocumented or not,"" Pritzker told reporters in River City, Ill. ""They’re indiscriminately grabbing people who don’t look like the ICE agents typically and holding them or mistreating them.""

Despite the criticism, agents have carried out mostly successful arrests of illegal migrants, many of whom have committed serious crimes, as part of President Donald Trump’s pledge to deport the estimated millions of individuals who crossed the border illegally under President Joe Biden.

DHS and Secretary Noem’s hiring blitz utilized social media platforms to promote the open positions, implementing a strategy of traditional American imagery to garner interest in the role.

The agency’s various social media outlets even outpaced viewership and impressions from media giants CNN and MSNBC over the summer, as first reported by Fox News Digital.

Democrats made the offer as Americans faced unprecedented disruptions blamed by Donald Trump on the funding lapse, which began on 1 October.
Democrats said they were concerned the legislation would allow Trump to selectively choose which federal workers received pay.
“Americans plagued by high costs fired a political torpedo this week at Donald Trump and Republicans,”Schumer, said on Thursday.
Trump appeared to acknowledge that dynamic, telling senators from his party on Wednesday that the shutdown was “negative for Republicans”.","Republicans rejected a proposal made on Friday by the Senate’s Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, which would end the longest government shutdown in US history by offering Republicans a deal to reauthorize funding in exchange for a one-year extension of tax credits that lower costs for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans.

“Democrats are ready to clear the way to quickly pass a government funding bill that includes healthcare affordability,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Leader Thune just needs to add a clean, one-year extension of the ACA tax credits to the CR so that we can immediately address rising healthcare costs.”

He also proposed “a bipartisan committee that will continue negotiations after the government reopens on reforms ahead of next year’s enrollment period to provide long-term certainty that healthcare costs will be more affordable”.

“Now, the ball is in Republicans’ court. We need Republicans to just say yes,” Schumer said.

John Thune, the Senate majority leader, was unmoved by the offer, with his spokesperson Ryan Wrasse reiterating the demand that the government be reopened before the tax credit issue will be discussed.

“Extending the Covid bonuses *is* the negotiation – something that can only take place after the government reopens. Release the hostage. End the pain,” Wrasse said.

Senate Republicans were more blunt on X: “Hard no, Chuck.”

Thune has moved to keep the Senate in session this weekend, though a deal to end the shutdown remains elusive.

Any compromise would also need to be approved by the House of Representatives, which Republican speaker Mike Johnson has kept on recess since 19 September. That means the 38-day shutdown would not end immediately.

Democrats made the offer as Americans faced unprecedented disruptions blamed by Donald Trump on the funding lapse, which began on 1 October.

The Trump administration has attempted to pause payments under the government’s food aid program for the first time in history, but has been blocked by a court order. The Federal Aviation Administration also slashed commercial air travel, saying weeks of unpaid work by controllers had undermined capacity. About 800 US-linked flights had been canceled as of Friday morning, according to the tracking website FlightAware.

Though Republicans control both chambers of Congress, any spending legislation needs at least some bipartisan support to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancement in the Senate. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, has tried 14 times to get Democrats to support a House-approved bill to continue funding through 21 November, butonly three minority lawmakers voted for it.

Democrats had for weeks insisted that any funding bill include an extension of the tax credits, which were created during Joe Biden’s presidency and will expire at the end of the year. People on ACA plans are expected to soon see their costs jump by an average of 26%, the Kaiser Family Foundation found.

Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House that he expected the shutdown to cut GDP growth by approximately half in the current quarter, though much of that will be made up in the following quarter, assuming the shutdown ends and federal workers receive backpay.

Trump has publicly mulled not giving federal workers, many of whom his administration has maligned, pay for the time the government was shut down.

Later on Friday, Senate Democrats blocked a procedural motion to advance a Republican bill that sought to pay some of the federal workers who had stayed on the job without pay during the shutdown and active-duty troops. The 53-43 tally, which was mostly along party lines, fell well below the 60 vote threshold needed for passage.

Democrats said they were concerned the legislation would allow Trump to selectively choose which federal workers received pay.

Democrats’ resolve to hold strong against the Republican funding proposal was boosted on Tuesday when the party’s candidates swept off-year elections in a number of states, which party leaders attributed to voters being on board with their demands.

“Americans plagued by high costs fired a political torpedo this week at Donald Trump and Republicans,”Schumer, said on Thursday.

“If Republicans were smart, they would get the message after Tuesday that their do-nothing strategy isn’t working. Even Donald Trump knows Americans hold Republicans responsible for this mess.”

Recent polls have shown the GOP taking more of the blame for the shutdown than Democrats, and some in the party have warned that backing down from their demands now would turn off newly reenergized voters.

“I think there will be some pretty substantial damage done to a Democratic brand that has been rehabilitated, if, on the heels of an election in which the people told us to keep fighting, we immediately stop fighting, if we surrender without having gotten anything,” the Democratic senator Chris Murphy told Punchbowl News.

Trump appeared to acknowledge that dynamic, telling senators from his party on Wednesday that the shutdown was “negative for Republicans”.

He has called for them to vote for scrapping the Senate’s filibuster, which allows the minority party to hold up most legislation that does not receive 60 votes. “If Republicans kill the Filibuster, they sail to Victory for many years to come. If they don’t, DISASTER waiting to happen!” Trump wrote on Truth Social Friday.

Thune has said his lawmakers do not support doing that.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22d92e4fb72d1f8761e45b2e32d4c2492c338ac9/0_0_3334_2667/master/3334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fccf9aabb9969cd781bf4616edddd775",N,,2025-11-08 09:56:35.360912

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is speeding up the implementation of new rules that would give the agency tasked with protecting federal government facilities greater authority to charge people for a broader array of offenses on or off those properties.

The changes outlining the powers of the Federal Protective Service, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, were put forward in early January under the Biden administration and were slated to take effect on Jan. 1 of next year but instead went into effect Wednesday. The administration said the rules were being changed ahead of time so they could address a “recent surge in violence.”

They come as protests have surged against President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, especially near buildings associated with immigration enforcement, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices or facilities. They also come as the Trump administration is facing lawsuits in both Chicago and Portland against what critics say is the excessive use of force by federal officers against protesters and others or unjustified attempts to bring in federal forces to protect facilities.

Activists and many political leaders have accused Homeland Security of aggressively suppressing peaceful protests and targeting activists trying to hold them accountable. Critics said the new rules could be used to target protesters.

“DHS is using every tool possible to protect the lives of our law enforcement as they face a surge in violence and lawlessness at many of our federal facilities,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a news release announcing the sped-up schedule. The release cited a shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, an incident that killed two detainees.

The new rules empower officers from the Federal Protective Service to make arrests and charge people for actions near the federal property, and they include new rules regulating unauthorized use of drones and tampering with digital networks.

The Homeland Security news release gave some examples of conduct that the Federal Protective Service could now charge someone for, both on federal property and off, including wearing a mask while committing a crime, obstructing access to federal property and tampering with government IT systems like card readers.

Spencer Reynolds, a former intelligence and counterintelligence lawyer at the Department of Homeland Security who’s now with the Brennan Center for Justice, a think tank, said Congress gave the Federal Protective Service the ability to work and carry out arrests off of federal property as necessary. But he’s concerned that the new regulations codifying these powers will be used as a way to target protesters.

“I see this as being guidance to go after peaceful protests where they are happening in the vicinity or even not in the vicinity of federal property,” he said.

In a report last year issued by the Brennan Center, Reynolds said the FPS expanded dramatically after Sept. 11 and that’s led to “overreach under political pressure.”

In Chicago, a federal judge overseeing a case alleging federal agents carrying out an immigration crackdown there are using excessive force against journalists and protesters said Thursday that she’s going to restrict federal agents’ use of force to prevent the “chilling of First Amendment rights.” U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis said she didn’t feel federal agents’ use of force was justified and that she didn’t find their “version of events credible.”

In Portland, the Trump administration has argued that protests at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building have gotten so out of control that it justifies sending in National Guard troops to protect federal personnel and property where protests are occurring or likely to occur.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut Sunday barred the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, until at least Friday, saying she “found no credible evidence” that protests in the city grew out of control before the president federalized the troops earlier this fall.

The Federal Protective Service is tasked with protecting federal properties. The agency used to fall under the U.S. General Services Administration, which is responsible for purchasing and managing federal real estate, but when the Department of Homeland Security was created in the aftermath of Sept. 11, the FPS was transferred to Homeland Security.",https://firstamendmentwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-07T155438Z_639551886_RC2RRHA8V9YP_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-IMMIGRATION-CHICAGO.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:57:37.485361

There was affordability, the 34-year-old democratic socialist said in his first news conference since winning the election the night before. Then there was what he called “an authoritarian administration” under President Donald Trump.

""It'll be my job to deliver on both,"" Mamdani said. ""It will be my job to stand up for the city.""

Trump, a Queens native, has loomed over the election in his hometown, and he has threatened to punish New York with measures such as cutting the city's funds if voters elected Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens. If Mamdani became mayor, Trump recently said it would be hard for him to give ""a lot of money"" to New York, adding Mamdani would waste the money with his left-leaning politics.

Mamdani has vowed to fight back in court when he takes office in January.

Here’s a rundown of what Trump could do to the nation’s largest city, and what Mamdani can do in response to − as his campaign platform promised − “Trump-proof” New York.

Deploy National Guard

In contrast to some of the other largest cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, New York has been untouched by the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard. Trump could try deploying troops to city streets.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat, has had National Guard at subway stations to reduce transit crime, but has reportedly been preparing to push back on Trump deploying troops into the city.

Lame-duck Mayor Eric Adams forged a bond with Trump after the Justice Department dropped federal corruption charges against Adams so he could help with Trump’s immigration crackdown.

In contrast, Mamdani has discussed forming a coalition with state officials, including Trump’s nemesis, New York Attorney General Letitia James, to sue the federal government if troops get sent. He’s cited the success by LA Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom in lawsuits that blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in California.

Large-scale immigration raids

Other Democratic cities such as Chicago, LA and Boston have seen sweeping immigration raids on streets, construction sites and businesses.

New York had highly publicized immigration enforcement operations shortly after Trump's return to office, but has not had the same scale of enforcement. There was a recent chaotic immigration raid by federal agents on street vendors allegedly selling counterfeit merchandise in lower Manhattan.

Federal agents have targeted people attending immigration court or Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-ins at a Manhattan federal building. The federal actions have sometimes resulted in violence against migrants, including one woman thrown to the ground by an agent.

Mamdani said he’d hold federal agents carrying out Trump’s immigration enforcement to the same legal standard as anyone else, implying that ICE agents could be arrested for assaulting New Yorkers.

“If you violate the law, you must be held accountable,” he said. “And there is sadly a sense that is growing across this country that certain people are allowed to violate that law, whether they be the president or whether they be the agents themselves.”

Mamdani has vowed to make New York the nation’s strongest sanctuary city, which broadly means limiting local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Mamdani has also called to invest $165 million to fund immigration legal defense services. He’s said his administration would survey every city system to protect sensitive data of undocumented people and others.

Behind the scenes, state officials and business leaders are reportedly trying to prevent raids. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie in October successfully persuaded the Trump administration not to conduct enforcement in the California city.

Cut federal funds to NYC

Early in Trump’s second term, Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency revoked $80 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds. Adams’ City Hall has sued the administration for the funding.

Months later, the federal Department of Transportation said it was halting funds to the nation’s largest infrastructure project, which would bolster the busiest U.S. rail corridor underneath the Hudson River between New Jersey and Manhattan, as well as the Second Avenue Subway, also in Manhattan. Withholding about $18 billion, federal officials cited the New York City’s Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program, an equity initiative meant to expand participation by racial minorities in federally assisted contracts.

Trump has threatened to slash even more federal funds to the city if Mamdani was elected. In a Nov. 3 Truth Social post, Trump said, ""it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home.""

Like other Democratic cities and states that have faced cuts to federal benefits, Mamdani has said the city could mount legal challenges to the cuts to recoup lost funds. Some cities and states have seen some success, such as Fresno, California, and North Carolina.

Arrest America’s mayor

Even before Mamdani won the mayoralty, Trump suggested arresting Mamdani and stripping him of his citizenship if Mamdani didn't assist on federal immigration enforcement. Mamdani, born in Uganda, moved to the United States as a child and was raised in Manhattan’s Morningside Heights. He became a naturalized citizen in 2018.

Some right-wing members of Trump's party have called to review Mamdani’s citizenship process in an effort to denaturalize and deport him. Trump has threatened to arrest Democratic elected officials before.

After Mamdani won the election on Nov. 4, he spoke directly to Trump.

""New York will remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and as of tonight, led by an immigrant,"" he said. ""So, hear me, President Trump, when I say this: To get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us.""

Mamdani's line drew perhaps the loudest roar throughout the night.","https://www.southbendtribune.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/03/USAT/87065195007-mamdani-trump.jpg?crop=3577,2012,x0,y335&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-08 17:56:30.935248

Earlier this week, ICE announced that a two-day operation in Oklahoma that yielded 70 arrests, including 34 truck drivers. According to ICE, 26 of the truck drivers had been improperly issued CDLs while the other eight were operating a commercial motor vehicle without a license.

The latest raid was conducted Oct. 28-29 in Oklahoma. In late September, Oklahoma partnered with ICE to arrest about 125 illegal immigrants.

“For the second time in just the past month, the state of Oklahoma and ICE have banded together to bolster public safety along Oklahoma’s highways, identifying and apprehending illegal aliens who are in the country illegally and have been recklessly issued a commercial driver’s license by states like California, Illinois, and New Jersey,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Executive Associate Director Marcos Charles said. “Many of the illegal aliens arrested behind the wheel of an 80,000-pound tractor-trailer can’t even read basic English, endangering everyone they encounter on the roads.”

According to ICE, those arrested originated from 15 different countries, including China, Colombia, Georgia, Guatemala, India, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Venezuela. Additionally, ICE said 36 of the 70 arrested have been convicted of violent crimes and other criminal offenses, including assault and battery, soliciting prostitution and driving under the influence.

“Operation Guardian continues to successfully keep Oklahomans safe,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said. “To lawfully operate a commercial motor vehicle in Oklahoma, you must be here legally, and you must be able to understand English. These are common sense standards that we will continue to enforce.”

ICE also cooperated with Indiana in October to arrest 223 illegal aliens. According to DHS, those arrests included 146 truck drivers.

DOT issues emergency interim final rule

The raids come at a time when the Department of Transportation is cracking down on the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs.

On Sept. 26, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration was issuing an emergency interim final rule to prevent unqualified drivers from operating 80,000-pound trucks on the nation’s highways.

“The process for issuing these licenses is absolutely 100% broken,” he said. “It has become a threat to public safety, and it is a national emergency that requires action right now.”",https://landline.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11-07-25-Oklahoma-ICE-pic.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 12:02:42.859739

In a virtual appearance before the panel’s members meeting in Switzerland, Johnson invited U.N. experts to come to Chicago to witness firsthand abuses committed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during raids he said have wreaked havoc in neighborhoods across the city and suburbs.

“That is why I call on this council to hold the federal government of the United States to the same standards of accountability you apply elsewhere in the world,” Johnson said, urging the group to consider holding a special session on the matter. “Human rights are universal — or they are meaningless.”

Earlier this week, Johnson condemned ICE agents for going inside a North Center preschool and “tearing a teacher out of a classroom in front of” toddlers.

The mayor said video of the incident “shocked the conscience of every single Chicagoan,” adding, “This is not who we are. We … cannot have this in our city or our country.”

Johnson vowed to hold U.S. Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino “accountable for the crimes you have committed against our people.”

During his speech, Johnson accused the Trump administration of seeking to “evade scrutiny for its violations of human rights, just as it has sought to evade accountability for its actions in cities like mine” by refusing to either submit to the U.N. Human Rights Council a Universal Periodic Review Report or appear before the panel.

“This refusal to engage in good faith with international mechanisms for accountability and oversight is a moral failure,” the mayor said. “In Chicago, we live with that moral failure every day. Families torn apart by immigration raids. Raids that have targeted daycare teachers, ride-share drivers and restaurant cooks.”

Johnson went on to describe in detail an immigration enforcement campaign in Chicago that he said has been “marked by violence” and is an “assault on the dignity of all Chicagoans.”

This news should be far more heartening than it is. In any normal version of the United States, it might have been. The administration’s willingness to perpetrate immoral and illegal evil on a daily basis has outpaced efforts by citizens and the judicial branch to stem the tide.

Still, maybe this is hopeful? I mean, if mandatory detention of people suspected of immigration violations is this obviously (and almost unanimously) illegal, doesn’t that mean it eventually has to end?

More than 100 federal judges have now ruled at least 200 times that the Trump administration’s effort to systematically detain immigrants facing possible deportation appeared to violate their rights or was just flatly illegal, according to a POLITICO review.

The rulings come from judges appointed by every president since Ronald Reagan, including 12 appointed by President Donald Trump. One of those appointees took the bench just last month.

Any ruling against Trump and his policies receives the same response: “activist” judges are ruining America and probably love crime. That some of these “activist” judges were appointed by Trump tends to go ignored by the loudmouths engaged in PR work for the nation’s leading producer of unlawful bullshit.

And that’s the case here as well.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” said Tricia McLaughlin, who predicted appellate courts would side with the administration.

The Justice Department echoed DHS, saying “President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda is a top national security priority that this Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend whenever challenged in court.”

But mandatory detention of migrants isn’t something that’s ever been considered legal, much less normal. People accused of criminal acts (rather than the civil violations most immigration offenses are) are generally able to avail themselves of their due process rights, as well as being able to return home until their cases are presented to the court.

That’s not what’s happening to migrants under Trump. Nearly everyone picked up by ICE, CBP, or any number of federal officers now expected to concentrate on civil violations rather than actual crime gets sent to a detention center, reversing three decades of immigration enforcement practice that allowed migrants without prior criminal records or who had longstanding ties to this country to remain free until their cases were called. It’s even worse than that now: ICE is using the same policy revision to deny detained migrants access to legal assistance or to ask judges to release them on bond.

This stems from the administration’s willful misreading of prior policies and previous case law. It applies the term “applicants for admission” (who can be detained until cases are heard) to any migrant its roving goon squads come across, even if they’ve already been in this nation for years and/or are already engaged in asylum requests or nationalization efforts. That’s why the DHS and DOJ are dismissing pending immigration violation hearings: to convert those seeking to remain in this country into indefinite detainees… and then into deportees to whatever country the US government feels like sending them to.

Sure, there’s still an argument to be made (albeit in extremely bad faith) that “liberal” judges are going after Trump just because they don’t like Trump. 87 of these judges were appointed by Joe Biden, Barack Obama, or Bill Clinton. But 27 judges appointed by GOP presidents have reached the same conclusions, including 12 appointed by Trump himself.

The ultimate question is whether or not this will ever matter. The Trump administration seems to feel it won’t. It’s not changing its policies and it is certainly aware that a majority of Supreme Court justices are activists who play for the “right” team. All it has to do is keep the appeals process rolling until the Supreme Court takes up the case. If it loses that one, it might be shocked. But it may also be that the clock runs out on this administration before it manages to generate precedent it doesn’t like. It still has more than three years to go. And until the upper levels of the court system step up to shut this down, its presumptively illegal actions will continue uninterrupted.",https://www.techdirt.com/wp-content/themes/techdirt/assets/images/td-rect-logo-white.png,N,,2025-11-08 02:01:50.861742

Local police have become increasingly reliant on license plate tracking cameras to solve crimes, and federal investigators have noticed. There's been a recent spike in federal searches of local data, which means police departments in some sanctuary states may find themselves illegally sharing information for immigration enforcement. NPR's Martin Kaste has the story.

MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: This isn't new tech. For years now, police have used automatic license plate readers to log when and where random passing cars are seen in traffic. But what is new is how common the cameras have become.

PHIL NEFF: Some of the comments you see are, well, these are only tracking criminals. But that's not true. It's everyone.

KASTE: Phil Neff is the research coordinator at the University of Washington's Center for Human Rights. He's been looking at the internal audits from police departments that store those license plate records in the cloud. The audits show which other law enforcement agencies have looked at their records, and Neff was shocked by how often the inquiries seemed to be coming from the feds.

NEFF: Over the summer, hundreds if not thousands of searches by U.S. Border Patrol - and it would have keywords that were sometimes as vague as, like, investigation or targeting.

KASTE: This could be a problem in a state like Washington, which limits the information that local police can share with immigration enforcement.

RYAN RUTLEDGE: Yeah, it was alarming to hear that, and we wanted to dig in right away and find out what we need to do.

KASTE: Ryan Rutledge is deputy chief of police in Renton, a suburb of Seattle. It was one of the departments singled out by Neff's research. Like other departments, Renton says it didn't mean to share data with immigration authorities, and Rutledge says the city temporarily locked down outside access to its data while it took a closer look at its settings.

RUTLEDGE: You know, did we go in and click a box to give access to these federal agencies? No, we did not.

KASTE: The police departments pointed to what they saw as a lack of clarity about who had access through a setting called national lookup. The data system they're using is run by Flock Safety. That's the company that supplies the license plate readers.

HOLLY BALIN: Flock has never opted any agencies into sharing relationships that they did not opt themselves into.

KASTE: Flock Safety spokesperson Holly Balin says these departments chose to allow access to federal agencies, which is normal and legal in Washington when it's a criminal matter, such as human trafficking.

BALIN: We see agencies cooperate with federal agencies for these complex cases that are very much within the purview of their laws. But again, that's not Flock, to determine whether agencies cooperate with federal agencies or they don't. That is entirely up to them.

KASTE: The problem is the uncertainty over how often the feds are looking at plates for immigration cases. ICE didn't respond to NPR's request for comment, but the Trump administration has strongly and repeatedly criticized sanctuary states, accusing them of illegally obstructing immigration enforcement.

Another sanctuary state, California, bans police from sending license plate data outside its borders, and Attorney General Rob Bonta recently sent letters to 20 local police departments, warning them that their systems were open to law enforcement outside California. He says most of them seemed surprised.

ROB BONTA: It seemed like it wasn't voluntary. It was unwittingly. And they changed the permissions and the sharing, and that was that from 19 of the 20. They fixed the problem.

KASTE: In the case of the 20th, though, the city of El Cajon, Bonta got pushback. City manager Graham Mitchell tells NPR that they're not sharing data with the feds, but they do believe they're allowed to share with police departments in other states. AG Bonta is now suing the city, and he suspects it's funneling data to the feds indirectly through requests from local police in places like Texas, which work closely with ICE.

BONTA: There's search terms that were used, including immigration, immigration enforcement, immigration violation, ICE assist.

KASTE: Some privacy groups say this whole situation shows the larger risk of surveillance when police keep records of average Americans' comings and goings. Bonta acknowledges that risk, but he doesn't go so far as to say the databases aren't worth having, as long as his state enforces clear guardrails on who gets the data. Martin Kaste, NPR News.

Manually archiving electronic communications is not an unprecedented measure for DHS officials, Weissman added.
“After further review, PRIV acknowledged that OCIO could still conduct searches for electronic messages consistent with existing DHS records management policy, which requires custodians to manually save screen shots of electronic messages that contain federal records to DHS systems,” she added.
According to Weissman, DHS is currently exploring new processes for archiving electronic messages from senior agency and Capstone officials.
“Although DHS is working to identify new, secure, technical solutions to allow automatic archiving of electronic messages, DHS has always maintained Department-wide policies requiring all federal records to be preserved, including those sent by electronic message.”","The Department of Homeland Security in April disabled third-party software that automatically archived SMS, Signal and WhatsApp messages sent by senior agency officials, according to court filings made public this week, raising questions about DHS compliance with federal recordkeeping laws.

The revelation of DHS’s move to ditch the TeleMessage archival tool was revealed in sworn testimony by Michael Weissman, the executive director of the Chief Data Officer Directorate within the agency’s Office of the Chief Information Officer, in the case American Oversight v. DHS in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

According to Weissman, use of TeleMessage — which DHS deployed from Sept. 29, 2023, to April 9, 2025 — was halted because of “cybersecurity failures.” The software had lessened the burden on agency officials to archive their communications, in addition to easing the work of responding to discovery and Freedom of Information Act requests.

But TeleMessage was not replaced with a similar archival tool, per Weissman. Since April, DHS employees who had been covered by that system were “again obligated to manually archive their messages in accordance with existing DHS policy,” he wrote.

Those officials were presented with two options for preserving their electronic messages: screenshot and archive a copy of their communications to shared drive work folders, or have DHS’s OCIO assign a technician to manually access their devices and use forensic tools to create a searchable copy of them. The latter method, Weissman noted, is only available to high-ranking DHS officials, such as the secretary and deputy secretary.

Manually archiving electronic communications is not an unprecedented measure for DHS officials, Weissman added. The agency has “never had the ability to archive iMessages due to the technical implementation of Apple’s encryption technology,” he wrote, meaning officials have “always been responsible” for manually archiving those records. iMessages were disabled on DHS-issued iPhones on March 1, 2023, but then reinstated Feb. 20, 2025, per the court filings.

Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, said in a statement that the testimony is essentially an admission that the agency “provided inaccurate information about whether Secretary [Kristi] Noem’s and other top agency officials’ text messages were properly preserved.”

“We’re talking about messages exchanged amid major national controversies — from the deployment of military forces on American streets to inhumane immigration crackdowns and deportations carried out in defiance of court orders,” Chukwu said. “The public deserves to know whether these records still exist, and whether officials destroyed evidence of how those decisions were made. After misleading us for months, DHS wants us to trust that the law is being followed. But the agency has not turned over the records we requested nor has it provided details about whether senior officials’ text messages have been preserved in accordance with the law. It’s time for transparency — not more empty assurances.”

American Oversight’s interpretation appears to refer in part to sworn testimony from Catrina M. Pavlik-Keenan, deputy chief FOIA officer for DHS’s Privacy Office (PRIV), who said the agency’s OCIO initially told her office in late August that because of the move away from TeleMessage, it was unable to search for records requested by the nonprofit.

Based on OCIO’s response, PRIV wrote back to American Oversight and “mistakenly” informed the group that “it was unable to locate or identify any responsive records as DHS no longer had the capability to conduct a search of electronic messages,” Pavlik-Keenan wrote.

“After further review, PRIV acknowledged that OCIO could still conduct searches for electronic messages consistent with existing DHS records management policy, which requires custodians to manually save screen shots of electronic messages that contain federal records to DHS systems,” she added.

William Fischer, the acting chief records officer for the National Archives and Records Administration, meanwhile, said in sworn testimony that NARA became aware of media reports in late August that DHS officials were “unlawfully disposing of electronic federal records.” NARA then sent DHS a letter requesting an investigation into the allegations and a report sent back within 30 days.

“To the best of my knowledge, as of the date of this Declaration, NARA has not received a response to the letter,” Fischer wrote.

According to Weissman, DHS is currently exploring new processes for archiving electronic messages from senior agency and Capstone officials. So far, the agency has “uncovered no evidence” that any federal records have been destroyed or that specific officials have skirted recordkeeping policies.

“DHS policies have never authorized employees to destroy records,” Weissman wrote. “Although DHS is working to identify new, secure, technical solutions to allow automatic archiving of electronic messages, DHS has always maintained Department-wide policies requiring all federal records to be preserved, including those sent by electronic message.”",https://fedscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/GettyImages-2244974791.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 22:56:34.206170

Trump’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to major cities have seen varying success.
The Supreme Court is weighing an emergency application from the administration to let it deploy the National Guard to the Chicago area but has not yet ruled.","A federal judge on Friday ruled President Trump unlawfully called up and planned to deploy Oregon’s National Guard to Portland, the most decisive blow yet to his bid to send troops into Democratic-led cities where protests have centered on federal immigration facilities.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, permanently blocked the president from sending Oregon’s soldiers into the city after determining that the president ran afoul of federal law and stepped on the state’s sovereignty in his bid to send the troops into Portland streets.

It marks the first time a judge has ruled on the underlying legal merits of Trump’s aggressive use of the National Guard, as challenges to his efforts in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington, D.C., continue to move through the courts.

“To be clear, today this Court does not rule that the President can never deploy the National Guard to Oregon, or to any other location, if conditions on the ground justify the Guard’s intervention,” Immergut wrote. “But under the U.S. Constitution, Congress possesses the power to call up the National Guard ‘to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections, and repel Invasions,’ and Congress’s delegation of its power to the President is by statute.

“Unless and until the President lawfully federalizes National Guardsmen…‘National Guard members serve solely as members of the State militia under the command of a state governor,'” she said.

The decision comes on the heels of a three-day trial, which featured testimony from local and federal law enforcement — often in tension — about the nature of the protests at the heart of the case.

Trump called up Oregon’s National Guard in September, promising to protect “war-ravaged” Portland and its U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. State and city officials quickly sued to block his efforts.

The president initially federalized and moved to deploy 200 Oregon troops, but after Immergut temporarily blocked the effort, he sought to send troops from California and Texas into the city, prompting the judge to bar any troops from being deployed. The administration has appealed.

At trial, Justice Department (DOJ) lawyers argued that Trump lawfully federalized the National Guard under a provision of Title 10 that lists three circumstances where the president may do so: an invasion, a rebellion or an inability to execute the law with regular forces.

They claimed that the protests outside Portland’s ICE facility have thwarted federal officers’ ability to do their jobs without help and amounted to rebellion against the government, while maintaining that courts should not review Trump’s determination.

“Congress, in Section 12406, made those decisions for the president to make,” said DOJ lawyer Eric Hamilton, referencing the provision.

Two Federal Protective Service supervisors testified anonymously that the National Guard would alleviate strains, though they conceded that neither requested military assistance.

Immergut noted their testimony in her ruling, in addition to the testimony of Maj. Gen. Timothy Rieger, acting vice chief of the National Guard Bureau, who said he had no personal knowledge of the situation on the ground in Portland when issuing the memo proposing the troops’ assistance.

Portland police provided a different picture of the scene on the ground in testimony.

They said that largely peaceful protests have already been inflamed by the few federal officers on site and pointed to the riots that consumed the city in 2020 to exemplify how tactless policing can rile up crowds.

The officers also used the 2020 demonstrations — which began as peaceful demonstrations after George Floyd’s police killing in Minneapolis but devolved into 200 days of sustained protest and sometimes violent clashes — to undermine the administration’s contention that the city is now under siege.

“It was just an entirely different type of disorder,” Portland Police Bureau Cmdr. Franz Schoening said of the protests five years ago.

A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit paused one of Immergut’s orders last month, but the appeals court vacated that decision and said the full court would rehear the case.

Trump’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to major cities have seen varying success.

Troops are on the ground in California and D.C., but courts have so far blocked deployment in Illinois — though the situation could rapidly change.

The Supreme Court is weighing an emergency application from the administration to let it deploy the National Guard to the Chicago area but has not yet ruled.

The judge temporarily paused a portion of her final judgment for 14 days, so Trump may maintain control of Oregon’s National Guard but not deploy any troops as the administration appeals.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Top-National-Guard-battle_100325_AP_Jenny-Kane.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-07 23:16:59.354967

With the declaration of a national emergency at the U.S. southern border and the classification of migration as “an invasion,” U.S. President Donald Trump made his focus on immigration clear on the first day of his second term, taking action on an issue that was a focal point in his 2024 presidential campaign. Since then, immigration enforcement authorities have received a significant budget boost as they make record numbers of arrests and pursue the president’s goal of 1 million deportations in 2025.

No doubt, Trump’s migration policy over the course of his term will touch upon Latin America. Just over half of the U.S. foreign-born population comes from the region, per 2023 census data—almost 24.5 million people. According to statistics from Pew Research Center, Latin Americans also make up around 74 percent of an estimated 14 million immigrants lacking full legal status in the United States. This includes people with temporary protections from deportation, such as a pending asylum claim, Temporary Protected Status (TPS), or humanitarian parole. The Trump White House has already moved to strip these protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the region, many of whom either have been or can be deported even while these measures make their way through the courts.

During his first term (2017–2021), Trump passed policies that pressured Latin American governments to take more responsibility to deter migration and accept deportees. This term, Trump is resurrecting—or intensifying—several of those policies. Trump is also attempting to end birthright citizenship by reinterpreting the 14th Amendment and threatening a wider set of countries with punitive measures if they don’t comply with his requests around deportation.

Recent Developments

November 7: Temporary Protected Status ends for 250,000 Venezuelans

About a quarter of a million Venezuelan immigrants in the United States are set to lose TPS on November 7. This follows a Supreme Court ruling on October 3 that allowed the Department of Homeland Security to cut short a Biden-era extension to this program that would have provided Venezuelan recipients protection from deportation until October 2026 (see October 3 entry).

This group of Venezuelan TPS holders join another 350,000 Venezuelans under a distinct TPS designation who lost their legal right to live in the United States immediately following the October 3 Supreme Court decision. They are at risk of deportation, unless they can acquire another immigrant status.

October 31: Trump administration sets record low cap on refugee admissions

In a Presidential Determination published on October 31, the Trump White House limited refugee admissions for fiscal year 2026 to 7,500 people. It is the lowest admissions cap since the U.S. refugee resettlement program began in 1980. The cap for fiscal year 2025, set by the Biden administration, was 125,000.

For much of the program’s history, refugees from Latin American and the Caribbean rarely represented more than 10 percent of overall admissions to the United States. However, the number of refugees from the region grew tenfold between 2022 and 2024, an increase largely driven by Venezuelan displacement. In 2024, a record 25,348 Latin American and Caribbean citizens made up around one-quarter of refugees resettled in the United States. Venezuelans represented around half of refugees from the region in 2024, with Guatemalans and Nicaraguans being the second- and third-largest Latin American refugee populations resettled in the United States last year.

The Presidential Determination states that Afrikaners from South Africa will be given priority in admissions, as well as “other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.”

October 3: Supreme Court allows Trump administration to strip Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans

Ruling in favor of an emergency appeal from the Trump administration, a 6-3 Supreme Court majority allowed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to end TPS for Venezuelans. The temporary order from the Supreme Court overrules a previous judgement by a lower court in San Francisco, which had reinstated this protection from deportation until October 2026 and ruled that the DHS did not have the authority to bring an early end to TPS designations (see September 5 entry).

The emergency ruling means that around 350,000 Venezuelans are at immediate risk of deportation. Another TPS designation held by an additional 250,000 Venezuelans is due to expire in November.

September 5: Federal court restores Temporary Protected Status for Haitians and Venezuelans

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco on September 5 ruled against the Trump administration’s early termination of TPS for Haitians and Venezuelans. The ruling restores the rights to live and work in the United States to around 350,000 Venezuelans whose TPS designation expired in April and safeguards this protection from deportation for another 250,000 whose status was due to expire on September 10. It also reaffirms a July order from a federal judge in New York that determined it was unlawful to cut TPS short for the more than 520,000 Haitian immigrants who either possess TPS or are eligible for it.

Chen’s 69-page opinion stated that the DHS decisions to cancel TPS extensions granted by the Biden administration were unprecedented and hasty, and that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem had exceeded her authority in doing so. A DHS response the order argued that “the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program.” The Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling.

In January 2025, shortly before leaving office, the Biden administration extended two TPS designations for Venezuelans until October 2026. Protections for Haitians had previously been extended to February 2026, but Noem’s DHS attempted to bring forward the expiration date to August 2025. Subject to appeal, the 2026 expiration dates for both nationalities remain in place.

September 2: Federal appeals court rules against use of Alien Enemies Act to speed deportations of Venezuelans

In a 2–1 majority decision on September 2, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit determined that the Trump administration cannot use the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants it alleges are members of the Tren de Aragua cartel. The ruling sided with arguments from lower courts and immigration advocates that the eighteenth-century wartime act was not intended to remove alleged gang members.

The 185-page ruling stated that “mass immigration” could not be equated to “sending an armed, organized force to occupy, to disrupt or to otherwise harm the United States,” and that there was “no invasion or predatory incursion” as defined in the AEA. The legal case is likely to return to the Supreme Court for a final ruling.

Earlier this year, in March, the Trump administration invoked the AEA to deport 137 Venezuelans to a megaprison in El Salvador. U.S. government allegations that these deportees belong to Tren de Aragua have been refuted in various investigations. Most of those imprisoned in El Salvador were returned to Venezuela in a July prisoner swap (see July 18 entry).

August 31: Judge blocks repatriation of Guatemalan migrant children

On August 31, a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, DC stopped the repatriation of Guatemalan children who had arrived unaccompanied to the United States. In her emergency ruling, issued while dozens of minors were aboard flights set to depart from Texas, Judge Sparkle Sooknanan ordered that the children could not be removed without a deportation order and that they must remain in the country for at least two weeks as legal challenges to their removal play out. Hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children under the custody of the U.S. government are said to be targets for removal, according to sources cited in a CNN report.

Representatives of the Trump administration claimed the children’s parents had requested their return. In a statement released on August 31, the Guatemalan government said that it is undertaking “coordinated actions” with the United States to reunite unaccompanied minors with their families in Guatemala, an agreement that came out of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem’s trip to Central America in June. The press release added that these actions should be conducted “according to established protocols.”

August 29: Federal appeals court rules that expedited end of Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans is unlawful

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on August 29 came to the unanimous decision that the Trump administration does not have the power to cut short Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations for Venezuelan immigrants. In their opinion, the judges wrote that “no administration has attempted to vacate an existing temporary protection status designation in the 35 years in which the program has existed.” The decision reaffirmed a March ruling by a lower court in San Francisco, but it is unclear how it affects the Supreme Court order issued in May that allows the government to deport Venezuelans who already lost TPS protections due to earlier actions by the government (see previous entries).

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced in February the reversal of a Biden-era measure that extended TPS for some 600,000 Venezuelans until October 2026. Around 350,000 Venezuelans registered under a 2023 TPS designation began losing their protection from deportation in April and another 250,000 registered under a 2021 designation are set to lose their status in September.

August 20: Federal court allows termination of Temporary Protected Status for Hondurans and Nicaraguans

The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit voted on August 20 to permit the Trump administration to end TPS for tens of thousands of Honduran and Nicaraguan immigrants. The ruling is a response to an appeal from the administration to suspend a July 31 decision from U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in California that had paused the government’s effort to withdraw this legal protection from deportation. Thompson had postponed the termination of TPS for these nationalities until at least November, when a hearing to determine the legality of the government’s action is scheduled to take place.

The Central American TPS holders are set to lose this legal status in September, in accordance with a pair of DHS notices published on July 8 (see July 7 entry). According to U.S. government data, there are around 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans residing in the country with TPS. Of these, approximately 21,000 Hondurans and 1,100 Nicaraguans are also green card holders. Those without another legal status will lose access to work permits and become eligible for deportation.

Thompson’s ruling stated that the DHS did not conduct an “objective review of the country conditions” before ending deportation protections and that certain statements from DHS Secretary Kristi Noem “may demonstrate discriminatory intent” toward immigrants. In a rebuttal, the DHS released a statement reiterating its stance that Honduras and Nicaragua are “safe for their nationals to return home.”

July 18: Venezuelan deportees released from El Salvador in exchange for U.S. nationals detained in Venezuela

The governments of El Salvador, the United States, and Venezuela announced on July 18 that around 250 Venezuelans were repatriated from El Salvador’s maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, in exchange for the return of 10 U.S. nationals jailed in Venezuela. Also included in the three-country deal was the release of about 80 Venezuelan political prisoners from domestic jails.

Many of those returned to Venezuela were immigrant detainees that the U.S. government deported to El Salvador in March under an eighteenth-century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). It was reported at that time that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele had agreed with the Trump administration to hold up to 300 third-country deportees in CECOT for a year for a fee of $6 million. A U.S. federal judge subsequently ruled the use of AEA illegal, barring further deportations under this law. However, that decision is subject to an ongoing appeals process.

The five U.S. citizens and five U.S. residents freed from Venezuelan prison were arrested on suspicion of plotting against the Maduro regime, according to Venezuelan authorities. Arrests took place between August 2024 and January 2025.

July 7: Hondurans and Nicaraguans will lose Temporary Protected Status after more than 25 years

In a pair of press releases issued on July 7, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Hondurans and Nicaraguans will come to an end in September 2025. According to DHS notices set to be published on July 8, around 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans have TPS, protecting them from deportation and providing a legal right to live and work in the United States. Those without another legal status will be vulnerable to deportation in two months' time.

The U.S. government first designated TPS for these two countries in 1999, following the destruction wrought by Hurricane Mitch, a category 5 hurricane that remains one of the deadliest Atlantic storms on record. Successive administrations—both Republican and Democrat—continually extended the designation. During the first Trump administration (2017–2021), DHS attempts to terminate TPS for Hondurans and Nicaraguans were held up by legal challenges and then reversed by the Biden administration (2021–2025).

In the press releases, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that these countries have displayed sufficient recovery from the damages of Hurricane Mitch and that conditions were safe for their respective citizens to return home. Both countries are currently under a level 3 travel advisory—the second-highest level issued by the State Department—which warn potential travelers of the risk of crime and, in the case of Nicaragua, the threat of “arbitrary enforcement of laws, the risk of wrongful detention, and limited healthcare availability.”

July 1: Judge blocks early termination of Temporary Protected Status for Haitians

U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan on July 1 ruled that the decision of the DHS to bring an early end to TPS for Haitians was unlawful. In his ruling, Cogan stated that the government had failed to provide sufficient notice to TPS holders and that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ""cannot reconsider Haiti's TPS designation in a way that takes effect before February 3, 2026, the expiration of the most recent previous extension.""

Just days prior, in a statement released on June 27, the DHS announced that Haitian immigrants would no longer have TPS from September 2. Over 521,000 Haitians who either have or are eligible for this legal status in the United States would have been subject to deportation if they did not apply or were ineligible for other forms of legal stay.

According to that release, Secretary Noem “in consultation with the Department of State […] determined that, overall, country conditions have improved to the point where Haitians can return home in safety.” A current State Department travel advisory, however, highlights risks of “kidnapping, crime, [and] civil unrest” in Haiti. Recent UN reports note that up to 90 percent of Port-au-Prince is controlled by armed gangs and that violence is spreading to other parts of the country, while almost 1.3 million people face internal displacement amid record levels of malnutrition.

The attempted termination followed an effort earlier this year by the DHS to rollback a Biden-era extension to TPS for Haitians. A February notice had brought the expiration date forward to August 2025 from February 2026 (see prior entries).

June 9: Travel restrictions come into effect for 19 countries, including Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela

Starting on June 9, the U.S. government will bar Haitian nationals from entering the United States as well as deny entry to Cubans and Venezuelans seeking to travel on common types of business, tourist, student, and academic visas. The restrictions do not apply to persons with a valid visa that was issued before June 9.

President Trump issued a proclamation on June 4 restricting the entry of citizens from a total of 19 countries. Of those, 12, including Haiti, are subject to an almost complete ban on travel and the issuance of any type of visa. The other seven, including Cuba and Venezuela, will not have access to many types of visitor and immigrant visas. However, the proclamation also instructs consular offices to limit the length of stay permitted on other types of non-immigrant visas, such as employment visas.

The Trump administration cited rates of overstay and perceived threats to national security as the reasons for restricting travel and immigration from citizens of these countries. In the case of Haiti, the administration noted that the country “lacks a central authority” able to properly screen potential travellers and immigrants to the United States, representing a national security risk. The U.S. embassy in Port-au-Prince has not processed visa requests for at least two years, according to the Miami Herald.

Likewise, the U.S. government stated that Venezuela lacks a “competent or cooperative authority” responsible for issuing travel documents and citeds difficulties in coordinating deportation arrangements. Despite a few disruptions, there have been regular deportation flights from the United States to Venezuela during the second Trump administration.

The proclamation used similar justifications for including Cuba, adding that it is a “state sponsor of terrorism.” The U.S. embassy in Havana has not issued visitor visas since 2017, resulting in Cubans often traveling to third countries to apply for these visas.

Exceptions to the restrictions for the 19 countries include green card holders, travelers with diplomatic and other types of official visas, certain categories of family reunification visas, and dual nationals who have a passport from a country not included on the list. The Departments of State and Homeland Security will review the list of countries after the first 90 days, then every six months.

June 6: Kilmar Abrego García returned from El Salvador to face charges in the United States

Kilmar Abrego García, a Salvadoran-born man who was deported from the United States to El Salvador’s CECOT prison in March alongside 260 other immigrants, was returned to the United States on June 6 to face criminal charges. He has been accused of two counts related to transporting undocumented migrants “for financial gain.”

Abrego García’s case has attracted attention from top U.S. politicians and international media, particularly after the White House admitted he was mistakenly deported. His deportation resulted in a legal back-and-forth between the Trump administration and federal courts about bringing him back to the country (see prior entries).

May 30: Supreme Court clears the way for deportation of Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan humanitarian parolees

In an emergency order issued on May 30, the Supreme Court overrode a lower-court decision that had suspended the Trump administration’s truncation of humanitarian parole protections for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. This leaves parolees who have not acquired another legal status subject to deportation. Over 530,000 individuals benefited from this two-year protection since it was introduced by the Biden administration—first for Venezuelans in October 2022 and then expanded to the other three nationalities in January 2023, when it became known as the CHNV program.

The Supreme Court order was a response to the government’s emergency appeal of an April 14 ruling issued by Judge Indira Talwani of Massachusetts. Less than two weeks before a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) order ending the CHNV program was due to come into effect, Talwani ruled that early termination of a legal status given to noncitizens should not be carried out en masse, but on a case-by-case basis. In its appeal, the Department of Justice argued that this would place an undue administrative burden on the government and added that the DHS had the right to make these decisions without influence from the judiciary.

The Supreme Court ruling is not a final determination on the legality of the March DHS order that sought to bring the program to an end in April. However, CHNV parolees can still be deported while a lawsuit challenging the DHS order proceeds in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston.

April 30: Federal judge orders that migrant detainees at Guantánamo be given notice before third-country deportation

U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued an order on April 30 instructing the U.S. government to give immigrant detainees being held at the Guantánamo Naval Base in Cuba an opportunity to flag concerns about safety risks if deported to a country other than their own. The order followed the Trump administration’s March 30 deportation of four Venezuelan men—three of whom it alleged were Tren de Aragua members—from Guantánamo to El Salvador’s CECOT prison, despite an order Murphy issued on March 28 restricting expedited third-country deportations.

The Department of Justice had argued in an April 28 hearing that the removal did not violate the judge’s March order because it was conducted by the Department of Defense (DoD) and not the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the agency which Murphy cited in his order. Judge Murphy raised questions about the DoD’s authority to conduct deportations without input from DHS, the agency charged with carrying out immigration enforcement actions.

April 29: President Sheinbaum announces that Mexico has received almost 39,000 deportees since start of second Trump term

During her daily morning press conference on April 29, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum informed that her country had received 38,757 deportees from the United States since President Trump’s return to office on January 20. Sheinbaum added that 33,311 were Mexican nationals and the rest were non-Mexicans the country had accepted for “humanitarian reasons,” although she did not specify their nationalities. She noted that Mexico had not signed any agreement with the United States to act as a “safe third country,” a deal the U.S. government pushed for during the first Trump presidency.

This represents a drop in deportations to Mexico compared to a similar period last year under President Joe Biden. According to government figures cited by Reuters, the Biden administration deported around 52,000 persons to Mexico from February through March of 2024.

April 20: U.S. government informs that Abrego García is out of El Salvador’s CECOT prison

The State Department informed a federal judge on April 20 that a Salvadoran immigrant deported from the United States has been taken out of El Salvador’s high-security mega-prison, known by its Spanish acronym CECOT. In a filing submitted to a district judge in Maryland, the State Department said that Kilmar Abrego García had been transferred out of a CECOT cell a week prior to “a room of his own with a bed and furniture” in the “administrative building” of another detention facility in El Salvador.

Abrego García has become a high-profile case amid the ongoing legal battle between the judicial system and the Trump administration over his deportation. Abrego García—who had been living in the United States since 2011 and in 2019 received protection from deportation—was deported to El Salvador in March alongside 260 other immigrants the U.S. government claimed to be gang members. On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that the government should make every effort to bring him back to the United States, but both the U.S. and Salvadoran administrations have said they are unable to do so. On the back of the Supreme Court order, District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland requested that the government provide daily updates of Abrego García’s condition and whereabouts, and that it document what steps it had taken to facilitate his return. News of Abrego García being moved from CECOT came after Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) visited El Salvador from April 16 to 18 to petition for the Salvadoran’s return to the United States.

Media reports have indicated that many of those deported alongside Abrego García do not have criminal records in the United States. The majority of those removed to CECOT in March were Venezuelan nationals, prompting Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro to call for their release while chiding President Nayib Bukele's ""complicity."" On April 20, Bukele posted an open letter to Maduro on social media platform X offering a “humanitarian deal” to repatriate the 252 Venezuelan detainees in CECOT to Venezuela in exchange for the release of 252 political prisoners from Venezuela’s jails. In response, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab called the proposal “cynical” and asked the Salvadoran governnment to identify each detainee and provide proof of life and medical records.

April 19: Supreme Court blocks use of Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas

In an emergency ruling issued just before 1 a.m. on April 19, the U.S. Supreme Court paused the deportation of a group of Venezuelan immigrants until a lower court had time to decide on the matter. The Trump administration alleges that the Venezuelan immigrants currently detained in Texas are members of Tren de Aragua and had intended to deport the men under the Alien Enemies Act, an eighteenth-century law that had previously only been invoked during active wars.

Lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, who filed appeals on behalf of the immigrants, said that the detainees had not been given opportunity to challenge their removal orders before a judge. A Supreme Court ruling earlier in April, which did not prohibit the use of the Alien Enemies Act for expedited deportations, did however affirm that immigrant detainees should be given sufficient time to appeal a deportation order.

The U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer has requested the Court’s clarification on whether the Venezuelans detained in Texas could be removed using legal procedures other than the Alien Enemies Act.

April 14: Federal judge stops termination of CHNV parole program

U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani of Massachusetts ruled on April 14 that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) cannot shutter the humanitarian parole program that has granted over 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans, and Nicaraguans temporary permission to live and work in the United States. The program, which has been available for these four nationalities since January 2023, was set to end on April 24 in accordance with a 30-day notice published on March 25 by DHS. Parolees whose two-year authorization had not yet expired would have lost their legal status and protection from deportation.

In her order, Judge Talwani wrote that the early termination of a legal status conferred on noncitizens should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. She added in a hearing that DHS had made the decision to end the program with an incorrect understanding of the process, framing parolees as persons who had crossed the border without authorization rather than people who had received permission to enter by air after a vetting process.

April 10: Supreme Court compels return of wrongfully deported Salvadoran migrant

The U.S. Supreme Court on April 10 affirmed a ruling by a district judge that the U.S. government should make all efforts to return Kilmar Abrego García from El Salvador's megaprison. The Trump administration had previously referred to the March 15 deportation of Abrego Garcia alongside 260 other Venezuelan and Salvadoran migrant detainees as an “administrative error.” Abrego García is a Salvadoran who arrived in the United States in 2011 and in 2019 received protection from deportation and permission to work.

The Justice Department (DoJ) argued that the United States has no authority to compel El Salvador to return anyone within its prison system. It also maintained that the U.S. judiciary has no jurisdiction in matters of foreign affairs.

During a visit to the White House on April 14, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said he would not return Abrego García to the United States. Responding to a reporter’s question, he said, “I don’t have the power to return him to the United States.” Both Bukele and the Trump administration have claimed that Abrego García is a member of MS-13, a U.S.-based gang with links to El Salvador that the White House recently designated a foreign terrorist organization. Abrego García’s lawyers have denied this claim and argued that the government has not provided evidence to support it.

Which Cartels and Groups Is Trump Designating as Foreign Terrorist Organizations?

The U.S. government named ten criminal groups FTOs—six from Mexico, two from Haiti, and two associated with Venezuela and El Salvador.

April 9: New York and Texas judges block use of Alien Enemies Act in their states

Judges in New York and Texas issued temporary blocks on the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport immigrants detained within their respective jurisdictions. The orders came despite an earlier Supreme Court ruling that permitted the Trump administration to continue using the eighteenth century wartime act to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be gang members.

On April 7, the Supreme Court ruled against a DC appellate court who had upheld a ban on the deportation of Venezuelan detainees. In a 5-4 decision, the court argued that the case had been filed in the wrong court. However, all nine justices agreed that Venezuelan migrants had to receive advance notice before deportation and sufficient time to challenge the decision before removal.

April 8: Trump administration revokes legal status of CBP One users

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has informed immigrants who used the CBP One mobile application to gain legal entry into the United States that they no longer have permission to live and work in the country and must leave immediately or risk deportation.

In January 2023, the Biden administration expanded the functions of the CBP One app to allow potential migrants to schedule immigration appointments at authorized ports of entry before crossing the U.S.–Mexico border, as a means of discouraging irregular crossings. Those who obtained appointments were usually given a two-year parole to remain and work while applying for other immigration statuses. More than 935,000 immigrants entered the United States via the app, many of whom are Venezuelan, Cuban, and Mexican, according to a January 14 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) press release.

On his first day in office, Trump cancelled appointments scheduled through the CBP One app. His administration has encouraged undocumented immigrants to notify authorities of “self-deportation” through the rebranded “CBP Home” app.

April 7: Two Supreme Court rulings affirm deportation actions

Kilmar Armando Abrego García, a Salvadoran migrant who had been living with protected legal status in Maryland, has been the subject of a judicial back-and-forth since his March 15 deportation in what the Trump administration admits was “an administrative error.”

On April 4, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland ordered that Abrego García should be returned to the United States by midnight on April 5, citing his protection from deportation by a 2019 court order. The Trump administration requested a stay for Xinis’ order.

On April 7, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied that request for a stay. Hours later, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, acting on behalf of the entire court, issued an administrative order indefinitely lifting the deadline set by Judge Xinis, giving the Trump administration more time to comply with her order. Roberts’ order did not touch on the legal issues in Abrego Garcia’s deportation, though a decision whether the Trump administration acted lawfully is expected in the future. Abrego Garcia remains in El Salvador's ""mega-prison.""

In a separate ruling that same day, the Supreme Court said that the administration could continue to deport Venezuelan migrants under Trump's invocation of wartime powers granted under the Alien Enemies Act. However, it added that immigrant detainees must receive prior notice and be given the chance to appeal removal.

March 31: U.S. federal judge pauses end of TPS for Venezuelans

Days before around 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants in the United States were set to lose Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a U.S. judge ruled that the February decision by DHS to cancel the extension of this status was unlawful. The judge’s ruling means that, for now, protections for this group of Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries—as well as another 250,000 Venezuelan TPS holders whose status was set to expire in September—will extend to October 2026. This was the date set in an extension order issued on January 17 under the Biden administration (2021-2025). Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem had attempted to reverse that order.

The Trump administration had one week to appeal the judge’s decision.

March 25: DHS terminates humanitarian parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans

In a notice published on March 25, DHS announced the end of a humanitarian parole program that granted temporary legal status to more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans over the less than three years it was active. The notice advises parolees without an alternative migration status to leave the United States before April 24—the date the program is due to expire—or risk deportation. President Trump had instructed the secretary of Homeland Security to end all parole programs “contrary to the policies of the United States” in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term.

Under the humanitarian parole program, persons applied for entry into the United States through a U.S.-based financial sponsor and were allowed to live and work for two years. The Biden administration introduced the program for Venezuelans in October 2022 and expanded it in January 2023 to include Cubans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, after which it became known as the CHNV program. Before departing office, President Joe Biden announced in October 2024 intentions to sunset the CHNV program and asked parolees to apply for other immigration statuses for which they may have been eligible, including asylum and temporary protected status. It is unclear how many parolees have already obtained another status.

The March 2025 DHS notice states that parolees who have not applied for an alternative legal status will be targeted for deportation. It also notes that the decision to issue the notice just 30 days in advance serves to facilitate the use of expedited removal procedures—i.e. deportation without a hearing before an immigration judge—which can only be used for immigrants who have spent less than two years in the United States.

March 23: Deportation flights to Venezuela resume

A plane carrying 199 deportees arrived in Venezuela on March 23 on the back of an agreement to resume deportation flights from the United States that was announced the day before. The deportation happened in two stages: An ICE-chartered aircraft flew the Venezuelan nationals to a military base in Honduras, where they were then transferred to a plane operated by Venezuela’s state airline to complete the return journey.

This followed a similar agreement negotiated earlier in March by Richard Grenell, the Trump’s administration envoy for special missions, and came despite the Maduro administration’s rebuke of the expulsion of over 200 Venezuelan immigrant detainees to El Salvador’s mega-prison. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had also threatened on social media platform X to increase sanctions if Venezuela stopped accepting deportees.

In February, Venezuela sent three planes to collect around 370 of its nationals with deportation orders from the United States, some of whom had been detained in the U.S. Naval Base in Guantánamo Bay. This followed a meeting between Grenell and Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on January 31, during which the two reportedly discussed sanctions, the release of U.S. citizens imprisoned in Venezuela, and the repatriation of undocumented Venezuelan immigrants.

However, on March 4, the Trump administration revoked oil company Chevron’s license to operate in Venezuela, an economic lifeline for the regime. In response, Maduro said that decision “damaged communication” between the administrations and stopped sending planes for Venezuelan deportees.

In November 2022, the administration of then-President Joe Biden granted Chevron special permission to operate in Venezuela as part of negotiations to facilitate “free and fair elections” in the South American country. Despite later reinstating several sanctions on the Maduro regime in April 2024, citing a lack of progress towards a return to democracy, the Biden administration did not suspend Chevron’s license.

March 15: Trump invokes 18th century law to deport hundreds of Venezuelan immigrant detainees to El Salvador

On March 15, the Trump administration deported 261 immigrant detainees—238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadorans—to El Salvador via Honduras. Some of the deportations were enabled by the president’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the U.S. government to apprehend, arrest, and deport without an immigration hearing any non-citizen above 14 years of age who comes from a “hostile nation or government.""

Although the United States is not formally at war with Venezuela, the Trump administration has claimed that many of the Venezuelan detainees are members of the Tren de Aragua gang, a criminal group the executive order described as “undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.” Tren de Aragua was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, or FTO, in February by the Trump administration.

Around 135 of the 261 flown out of the United States were deported under the Alien Enemies Act. The White House has yet to provide evidence of the deportees’ membership in the Venezuelan gang.

That same day, a federal judge ordered a 14-day block on deportations under this law in response to lawsuits filed by civil rights organizations. However, two deportation flights were already underway by the time of the ruling. The White House has denied allegations that it defied the judge’s ruling by not ordering the deportation flights to return to the United States before they landed on foreign territory.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele—who mocked the judge’s ruling on X—has struck a deal with the Trump administration to imprison 300 suspected Tren de Aragua members in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center for one year for a fee of $6 million dollars. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X this would “save [U.S.] taxpayer dollars” and hailed Bukele as “the strongest security leader in out region [and] a great friend of the U.S.”

The Alien Enemies Act had previously only been invoked three times, each during an active war. It was last used during World War II to detain Japanese and German immigrants in the United States.

March 5: United States suspends military deportation flights

In the first week of March, the U.S. government suspended the use of military planes for deportation flights. In an attempt to fulfill his campaign promise of mass deportations, the Trump administration used military aircrafts to perform deportation operations in February in an unprecedented strategy. Military planes were used to transport migrants to Central American countries and to the Guantánamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, as well as elsewhere in the world.

However, the strategy encountered various challenges. Countries, including Brazil and Colombia, objected to the use of military planes to return their citizens, while Mexico restricted access to its airspace for these aircrafts. Mexico’s restrictions lengthened flight times for military deportation planes destined for Central and South America, adding to the price of flights that reportedly cost around $28,500 per hour. Civilian flights chartered by ICE cost approximately $17,000 according to former ICE officials cited in The Wall Street Journal.

February 24: Homeland Security rolls back TPS for Haitians

Through a February 24 notice, DHS announced that a Biden-era extension of TPS for Haitian immigrants until February 3, 2026 would instead expire on August 3, 2025. This means that the approximately 521,000 Haitians in the United States who either have or are eligible for TPS are set to lose permission to work and protection from deportation. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has until June 4, 2025 to decide whether to re-extend or end this legal status.

Among the justifications cited for the decision to shorten the time frame for these protections, DHS stated that the 2024 deployment of the U.S.-funded and Kenya-staffed Multinational Security Support mission to combat gang violence in Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, represented a “real possibility of an improvement in conditions.” As such, Secretary Noem has committed to reviewing conditions in the country to determine whether it is safe to return Haitians. According to UN estimates, more than 5,600 persons were killed in Haiti in 2024, an increase of over 1,000 from the previous year, with hundreds more wounded and kidnapped. The notice also states that there will be consideration of “whether it is contrary to the U.S. national interest to continue to permit the Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States.”

TPS was first made available to Haitian nationals in 2010 following a powerful earthquake that caused massive destruction in the capital and surrounding areas. Successive governments later extended and added new designations for TPS to protect an increasing number of Haitian immigrants in the United States. In 2018, during Trump’s first term in office, the administration’s attempt to terminate the program was successfully challenged in court.

February 23: New batch of Latin American migrants taken to Guantánamo Bay detention

After deporting the first batch of Venezuelan migrant detainees at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, the military resumed flying immigrant detainees to the site on February 23. Among the nationalities taken to the base are Colombians, Ecuadorans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans. Those considered “high-threat” immigrants are reportedly being held in facilities previously used to imprison suspected terrorists.

Back on February 20, the U.S. administration flew 177 of the 178 Venezuelan migrants detained at the base to Honduras, where they were then picked up by a Venezuelan aircraft to complete the journey to their home country. One of the detainees was returned to the mainland United States.

February 17: Rubio’s Central America trip yields deportation deals

In his first trip as secretary of state, Marco Rubio ventured to Central America and the Caribbean with migration as a priority.

On Rubio’s first stop, Panama, President José Raúl Mulino offered the U.S. government use of a landing strip in a town near the Darién Gap as a base for deportation operations. In a press conference on February 2, Mulino suggested that U.S. deportation flights could depart from the Nicanor Air Base to return migrants to their respective countries of origin, including Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, as well as further afield. This builds upon an agreement signed in July 2024 through which the United States finances deportation flights from Panama.

The first of these flights landed near Panama City on February 13 carrying 119 migrants from various Asian countries including Afghanistan, China, and Pakistan. President Mulino explained they would be transferred to a shelter in the Darién province and from there, returned to their home countries. Similar flights to Costa Rica reportedly began on February 17.

Rubio’s following stop was El Salvador, where he announced on February 3 that President Nayib Bukele had offered to take in deportees of any nationality with a criminal record, including alleged gang members, to be held in El Salvador’s mega prison. Bukele later clarified on X that only “convicted criminals” would be admitted “in exchange for a fee.” Both men added that the proposal included the transfer of convicted U.S. citizens, a procedure experts noted would be legally fraught. Rubio referred to the offer as “an act of extraordinary friendship” that would constitute “the most unprecedented and extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world.”

In Guatemala, President Bernardo Arévalo announced in a joint press conference with Secretary Rubio on February 5 that his country would accept 40 percent more deportation flights from the United States and receive non-Guatemalan citizens. Under the Biden administration, approximately 14 flights landed in Guatemala on a weekly basis, with over 66,000 Guatemalans being returned to their country in the 2024 fiscal year.

February 4: Laken Riley Act and Guantánamo migration detention center

The first signed bill of Trump’s second term deals with migration. The Laken Riley Act, signed January 29, stipulates the federal detention of any migrant accused—but not yet convicted—of theft or a violent crime. It also empowers states attorneys general to sue the federal government if they feel there has been harm due to a failure of immigration enforcement.

During that signing, Trump announced that he would direct construction to expand a migrant detention center in Guantánamo Bay. This was later formalized in a memo. The president claimed that the U.S. military site, located in Cuba, could house up to 30,000 migrants, almost doubling the state’s holding capacity for persons under deportation orders. If constructed, it would be the largest U.S. migrant detention center. Flights carrying detained migrants from the mainland United States to Guantánamo began on February 4.

Best known as the site of a detention and alleged torture facility for suspected terrorists, Guantánamo Bay also hosts facilities that have been used intermittently in recent decades to temporarily house migrants and asylum seekers, including under the Biden administration, and to process or return persons picked up at sea.

January 28: Venezuelans to lose protected status

On January 28, the Department of Homeland Security announced the cancellation of an 18-month extension to TPS for Venezuelans. This reversed an order implemented earlier in January by the previous Biden administration that offered over 600,000 Venezuelans with TPS protection from deportation and legal permission to work until October 2026. The reversal means that protections for around 350,000 Venezuelans registered under a 2023 TPS designation will instead expire on April 2, 2025. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has until July 12, 2025 to make a final determination on whether to extend or end the legal status of Venezuelans registered under a 2021 TPS designation, which is due to expire on September 10, 2025.

Back in 2017, as one of the last acts of his first term, Trump granted Venezuelan migrants protection from deportation for 18 months, using a mechanism similar to TPS.

Following a meeting between Trump’s envoy for special missions, Richard Grenell, and Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro on January 31, Trump stated that Venezuela had agreed to receive deportation flights and offered to provide the means of transportation. Venezuela had stopped allowing the United States to return its citizens in January 2024. The Venezuelan government has not provided details on what was discussed with Grenell, but Maduro stated that they had ""taken a first step” towards a new relationship with the United States.

January 26: Military deportation flights raise regional ire

In his second term, Trump has introduced the use of military aircrafts to carry out deportations, a move experts note is unprecedented in modern history.

Military deportation flights bound for Colombia on January 26 triggered an explosive but short-lived dispute between Trump and Colombian President Gustavo Petro. Early that morning, Petro rescinded flight permissions for two planes carrying Colombian nationals. Petro objected to the use of military vessels and what he considered a lack of “dignified treatment” of those on board.

In response, Trump threatened “decisive retaliatory measures” including: a 25 percent tariff on Colombian goods, to be raised to 50 percent within one week; visa and travel bans for government officials, their families, and “supporters;” and “enhanced” inspections of Colombian nationals at ports of entry. The U.S. embassy in Bogotá also suspended visa processing.

Petro retaliated with the announcement that Colombia would also levy a 25 percent tariff on U.S. goods, along with a missive on X in which he suggested that Trump was plotting a coup, while insisting that he was “not scared of [a] blockade” and that Colombia would “stop looking to the North.” The United States is Colombia’s largest trading partner and purchases around a quarter of all Colombian exports.

However, before the end of the day, both the White House and the Colombian foreign ministry confirmed that deportation flights would resume as normal and that there would be no extra tariffs. The White House added that the tariffs and sanctions would be “held in reserve” should Colombia violate the agreement. Deportation flights resumed on January 28 with Petro sending the Colombian Air Force to carry his citizens to Bogotá.

The diplomatic dispute came just a few hours after the Brazilian government raised similar objections to returning nationals being handcuffed and prevented from using the bathroom on a January 24 deportation flight. When the plane made a stopover in Manaus, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva sent the Brazilian Air Force to collect the returnees and complete the journey to Belo Horizonte without handcuffs. Brazil’s foreign ministry later sent a diplomatic note to the U.S. requesting clarification on the “degrading treatment” of the migrants.

Also on January 24, Mexico blocked U.S. military planes from passing through Mexican airspace but allowed non-military deportation flights to land domestically. Neither government provided a public explanation for the refusal. In Guatemala, military deportation flights were allowed in on January 25 without issue.

January 20: Early executive orders show immigration priorities

Rhetoric about migration featured prominently in Trump’s inaugural address. He spoke several times about what he deemed “the disastrous invasion of our country” and mentioned specific policies—such as “Remain in Mexico” and large-scale deportation—in his address.

Hours later, Trump signed a series of executive orders that actualized many of the migration promises in his speech. That included declaring a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico and categorizing immigration as “an invasion"" under the Constitution, which provides legal justification for the federal government to take expanded action on behalf of the states.

Several of Trump’s executive orders marshaled resources to the border for the construction of infrastructure and the use of technology like drones. He also authorized the Department of Defense to send troops to the border. The first wave of the military included 1,500 troops, who began to reach their new posts on January 23.

Trump also modified several immigration policies. This included significantly reducing the geographical and time constraints on expedited removals, a mechanism that facilitates the deportation of undocumented migrants without an immigration hearing. He also resurrected the Migration Protection Protocols (MPP), better known as “Remain in Mexico.” This policy, first implemented by Trump in 2018, forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. immigration hearings. He suspended the acceptance of refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. He ended the humanitarian parole programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, leaving over 530,000 people in legal limbo. He also shut down a mobile application that migrants in Mexico used to schedule appointments with U.S. immigration, effectively canceling scheduled proceedings.

2024 Campaign

Immigration formed a central pillar of Trump’s 2024 campaign for reelection. On his campaign website, the first two of 20 “core promises” were to “seal the border and stop the migrant invasion” and “carry out the largest deportation operation in American history.” The Trump campaign insisted that his administration would focus on non-U.S. citizens in the country without legal status. More than three-quarters of an estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States come from Latin America and the Caribbean, according to 2022 data compiled by Pew Research Center.

In the run-up to the election, Trump and his now Vice President JD Vance amplified unverified reports of crimes committed by migrants, including Haitians and Venezuelans, to provide grist for their plans to ramp up persecution and deportation of undocumented migrants. This aligned with another of his “core” campaign promises to “stop the migrant crime epidemic, demolish the foreign drug cartels, crush gang violence, and lock up violent offenders.”",https://www.as-coa.org/sites/default/files/styles/metatag_585x422/public/field/image/Deportation_Flight.jpeg?h=9994641b&itok=RjY0lhj_,N,,2025-11-08 02:02:25.433466

Trump Administration takes fight over SNAP funding to Supreme Court

After Rhode Island federal Judge John McConnell ordered the administration to make full payments of November SNAP benefits to the states within a day, the Justice Department filed a notice of appeal Nov. 6.

About 42 million Americans receive SNAP food assistance.

On Nov. 7, the DOJ asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to halt McConnell's order by 4 p.m. EDT.

""There is no lawful basis for an order that directs (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) to somehow find $4 billion in the metaphorical couch cushions,"" the administration said in its request.

The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to intervene.

In response, the Trump administration filed a last-minute appeal on Nov. 7 with the Supreme Court to block the initial court order requiring the government to provide full SNAP food aid benefits.

Fourteen mothers jumped over the barricades and sat in a circle on Beach Street to “demand an end” to the immigration raids that have swept through the Chicago area since the Trump administration launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in September.

Less than a minute later, the women were arrested by Cook County sheriff’s deputies. The sheriff’s office confirmed the arrests and said charges were pending.

“We want to encourage other people who feel strongly about ICE’s actions to step off the sidelines and take our cities back,” said Teresa Shattuck, a mother from Oak Park. “We want to use our collective power and our white privilege in the way it should be used.”

Meghan Carter, another mother from Oak Park, said the women who were arrested understood the risks when they chose to take a stand, adding their experiences paled in comparison to what the detained immigrants inside the facility were enduring.

Carter said the suburban moms were a group of parents “fed up” with seeing immigration agents “terrorizing” their communities.

She also found that the attempt to use National Guard soldiers in Oregon had violated the U.S. Constitution’s 10th Amendment, which gives states any powers not expressly assigned to the federal government.

“The evidence demonstrates that these deployments, which were objected to by Oregon’s governor and not requested by the federal officials in charge of protection of the ICE building, exceeded the president’s authority,” she wrote.

Judge Immergut also disputed the president’s claim that antifa, at least in Portland, is an organized and cohesive group working against the federal government. She said testimony from the regional director for ICE about the level of damage at the Oregon facility or how disruptive the protests were was not believable, noting that demonstrators had “minimally impeded” federal workers. She added that her ruling does not preclude future efforts by the president to deploy the National Guard to Oregon.

Federal lawyers indicated at a three-day trial last week that if Judge Immergut ruled against them, they intended to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. With the legal battle expected to continue, Judge Immergut stayed the portion of her ruling that would have reverted control of federalized guard soldiers back to Oregon’s governor for 14 days, essentially maintaining the status quo. A similar case involving the use of National Guard troops in Illinois is currently before the Supreme Court.

While Democratic leaders in Oregon celebrated the decision on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security objected to the judge’s characterization of the protests in Portland.

“President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,” Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary with the department, said in a statement. “The president’s lawful actions will make Portland safer.”

Daily demonstrations began outside Portland’s ICE building in early June, after the Trump administration ramped up immigration enforcement. The crowds have generally been small — usually fewer than a few dozen people — and peaceful, but protesters have occasionally blocked the building’s driveway. They typically dispersed when federal officers in riot gear appeared.

A few confrontations, however, have turned violent, with federal officers using tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper-spray balls. The protests, now into their fifth month, have strained the Federal Protective Service, the agency charged with guarding U.S. government buildings.

On Sept. 27, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he planned to use “full force” to protect “war-ravaged Portland.” Later that day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asked Gov. Tina Kotek of Oregon, a Democrat, to activate 200 National Guard troops to help federal officers at the ICE building. Ms. Kotek refused, and the Trump administration responded by federalizing the soldiers and preparing to send them into Portland.

The lawsuit argued that the president had failed to demonstrate that the deployment was justified. Under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, a president may use the National Guard on U.S. soil in only three circumstances: a foreign invasion; a rebellion, or threat of a rebellion; or if the laws of the nation cannot be enforced with existing resources.

During the trial last week, administration lawyers argued that the last two conditions applied in Oregon.

In her final ruling, Judge Immergut disagreed on both counts and said the demonstrations, with a few notable exceptions, were largely peaceful and not as disruptive nor as dangerous as federal officials suggested.

The judge also wrote that she had been “deeply troubled” to discover that a small squad of Oregon National Guard troops were deployed at the ICE building after she had temporarily blocked their arrival in October.

At trial, federal lawyers acknowledged that a group of nine Guard soldiers had worked a shift at the facility on Oct. 4 starting in the late morning and stretching into late evening — after the judge had issued a temporary restraining order at 3:40 p.m. A few hours after the order, the administration flew 200 California National Guard troops to Oregon, apparently to replace the Oregon soldiers who had been barred from the ICE building.

“In other words,” she wrote, “defendants had time to order and coordinate the transport of federalized California National Guardsmen from Los Angeles to Portland but needed more time to communicate with the Oregon National Guardsmen at the Portland ICE facility.”

Judge Immergut wrote that while she was not citing the federal government for contempt of court, “this court expects defendants will provide further explanation when ordered to do so.”

“Nonpartisanship is the bedrock of the federal Civil Service,” wrote Judge Cooper, who had approved President Trump’s plan to fire tens of thousands of federal employees this year. “Political officials are free to blame whomever they wish for the shutdown, but they cannot use rank-and-file civil servants as their unwilling spokespeople.”

The ruling, which ordered the government to remove the partisan messaging from employees’ out-of-office email replies, came as a blow to an effort coordinated through the White House to use nominally nonpartisan federal agencies to exert political pressure on Democratic lawmakers, who are pushing to extend health care subsidies in exchange for voting to reopen the government.

Official websites and social media accounts across the federal government have blasted out similar partisan attacks declaring that Democrats or the “radical left” were to blame for the disruption of government services. Several banner messages on government websites said that “President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

Though Judge Cooper made note of that “politically charged language,” the case focused on the email replies sent from the accounts of furloughed Education Department employees. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal workers, had sued to have the email messages taken down.

Judge Cooper said the Education Department’s partisan attacks had “added insult to injury” for federal workers who were sent home without pay.

“The department waited until its furloughed employees lost access to their email, then gratuitously changed their out-of-office messages to include yet another partisan message, thereby turning its own work force into political spokespeople through their official email accounts,” Judge Cooper wrote.

He concluded that the Education Department had “overplayed its hand,” writing that the agency had infringed on its employees rights “by unlawfully compelling its employees’ speech.”

The messages had amounted to a remarkable breach for federal agencies and their typically nonpartisan work force, which normally do not get involved in politics. The Trump administration’s effort to wield government platforms to attack Democrats may also violate the Hatch Act, a law intended to ensure that the federal work force operates free of political influence or coercion, federal employment experts say.

Public interest and ethics groups quickly filed official Hatch Act complaints about the partisan attacks, though the Trump administration has recently moved to weaken enforcement of the law, which is coordinated through the Office of Special Counsel. Mr. Trump withdrew his nominee to head that agency last month after Politico reported that he had sent a series of racist text messages, including telling a group of fellow Republicans that he had “a Nazi streak.”

“Half asleep, I glanced over and saw a call from Washington DC,” Mr. Strawberry wrote. “Curious, I answered, and to my amazement, the lady on the line said, ‘Darryl Strawberry, you have a call from the President of the United States, Donald Trump.’ I put it on speakerphone with my wife nearby, and President Trump spoke warmly about my baseball days in NYC, praising me as one the greatest player of the ’80s and celebrating the Mets. Then, he told me he was granting me a full pardon from my past.”

A White House official on Friday confirmed that Mr. Trump had granted Mr. Strawberry the pardon, saying that the onetime baseball star had served his time and paid back taxes after pleading guilty to one count of tax evasion.

“Following his career, Mr. Strawberry found faith in Christianity and has been sober for over a decade — he has become active in ministry and started a recovery center which still operates today,” the official said.

The official did not answer questions about who had initiated the clemency process in Mr. Strawberry’s case.

In 2010, Mr. Strawberry appeared on “The Celebrity Apprentice” when Mr. Trump was the host.

Another contestant from that season, Rod R. Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois, gained a full pardon from Mr. Trump in February.

In 2020, Mr. Trump commuted Mr. Blagojevich’s 14-year prison sentence in his corruption case, which stemmed from a scheme to sell a Senate seat being vacated by Barack Obama.

Some other prominent recipients of presidential pardons have made overtures to the administration, through people close to Mr. Trump or directly.

“This has nothing to do with politics — it’s about a Man, President Trump, caring deeply for a friend,” Mr. Strawberry wrote. “God used him as a vessel to set me free forever!”

A representative for Mr. Strawberry did not immediately respond to questions about the pardon.

One of baseball’s most fearsome power hitters of the 1980s, Mr. Strawberry was a core member of the New York Mets team that defeated the Boston Red Sox in the 1986 World Series, the second title in franchise history.

He enjoyed a late career renaissance with the crosstown Yankees, winning the World Series with them in 1996 and 1999. He also played for the Yankees in 1998 when they won the World Series, but was replaced on the playoff roster after a colon cancer diagnosis.

For all of his accomplishments in baseball — he hit 335 home runs, was named National League Rookie of the Year in 1983 and won two Silver Slugger awards — Mr. Strawberry’s career was repeatedly derailed by legal troubles and substance abuse.

In the tax evasion case, federal prosecutors accused Mr. Strawberry of failing to report more than $350,000 in income from autograph shows and other promotional appearances from 1986 to 1990.

He could have faced 15 years in prison if convicted of three criminal counts, but was sentenced to six months of home confinement as part of a plea deal in which he admitted to cheating the government out of $100,000 in taxes.

In 2000, Mr. Strawberry was suspended for one year by Major League Baseball for a failed drug test, his third violation of baseball’s drug aftercare program.

In 2002, a Florida judge sentenced Mr. Strawberry to 18 months in prison for the latest of six probation violations. He had previously received probation in connection with a 1999 conviction on drug and prostitution solicitation charges.

Mr. Strawberry served about 11 months before being released in 2003.

In the years since his incarceration, he has frequently spoken to inmates about his poor choices and his struggles with substance abuse.

Last year, the Mets retired his No. 18 at Citi Field.

The proposal, announced by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, never had much hope of moving through the Republican-led Congress. Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to commit to even allowing a vote on extending the Obamacare subsidies, with many Republicans opposed to renewing the tax credits, at least without major changes.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, called the idea a “nonstarter.”

But after weeks of gridlock, it amounted to a major move by Democrats, whose previous proposal for funding the government was tied to a permanent extension of the subsidies and the repeal of a set of deep Medicaid cuts that President Trump signed into law over the summer, among other things.

Mr. Schumer framed the offer as a reasonable off-ramp to a shutdown that has threatened to snarl flights and sap food benefits across the country, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or working without pay.

“Democrats are ready to clear the way to quickly pass a government funding bill that includes health care affordability,” Mr. Schumer said. He called on Mr. Thune to add the extension of health care tax credits slated to expire in December to the stopgap spending bill he has been trying to pass for weeks.

“That’s not a negotiation; it’s an extension of current law — something we do all the time around here, as we all know,” Mr. Schumer said.

He also suggested that lawmakers convene a bipartisan committee that would negotiate a longer-term compromise to bring down the cost of health care subsidies offered through the federal marketplace before next year’s enrollment period.

Earlier this week, a group of moderate Democrats who have been quietly holding bipartisan talks with some centrist Republicans on funding legislation had appeared ready to strike a deal to end the standoff. But Democratic election victories on Tuesday night in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and other states appeared to have stiffened the party’s resolve to continue demanding Republicans relent on the health care tax credits.

After huddling all week in tense closed-door luncheons, Democrats who had been divided on whether to prolong the shutdown or find a quick bipartisan compromise emerged on Thursday saying they remained unified around the issue of addressing health care costs.

But they also narrowed their demands, something many progressives had resisted. Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, had previously rejected the idea of extending the credits for only one year, saying it was insufficient. But Mr. Jeffries said on Friday in a statement that he backed Mr. Schumer’s new proposal.

“We are offering a compromise,” said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said, adding, “Now Republicans just need to say yes and the government reopens.”

Republicans almost immediately rejected the proposal out of hand. Mr. Thune said the new offer was a sign of “progress” but did not bring senators “anywhere close to what we need to do here.”

Representative August Pfluger of Texas, the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, the biggest caucus of House Republicans, also called it a “nonstarter.”

That left a distinct sense of inertia at the Capitol on Friday, where senators had been bracing to work through the weekend but were uncertain of what they would be debating or whether any real progress could be made toward reopening the government.

Mr. Thune had previously signaled that he would call another vote on Friday on advancing yet another temporary spending bill to end the shutdown. He had raised the idea of voting on a new stopgap measure, plus three separate spending measures for programs related to agriculture, military construction and legislative agencies for most of 2026.

But bipartisan talks to finish those spending bills were still continuing on Friday, with several key sticking points unresolved, including the length of the short-term funding bill.

And Democrats were quietly pressing Republicans to include language in the spending bills that would reverse the mass firings of federal workers carried out by the Trump administration during the shutdown.

Instead, Mr. Thune called a vote on advancing G.O.P.-written legislation to pay federal workers during the shutdown. Democrats, who have said they oppose the bill because it would hand Mr. Trump wide latitude to choose which workers received compensation, blocked that measure in a 53-to-43 vote. That fell short of the 60 votes needed.

Three Democrats voted to advance the bill. Republicans picked up the support of one new Democrat who had previously voted to block the measure last month when Republicans called the measure up for a vote, Senator Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico.

Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia voted again to advance it. Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who voted for the bill last month, did not vote.

Prosecutors claimed that the efforts of Mr. McMahon and his co-conspirators were intended to coerce a Chinese couple living in New Jersey to return to China to face corruption charges.

The prosecutors presented the plot as part of Operation Fox Hunt, a decade-long push that Chinese officials claim is aimed at repatriating fugitives. The Justice Department contended that the campaign was part of the Communist Party’s push to control Chinese nationals around the world.

But Mr. McMahon’s defenders say he was tricked into participating in the plot while working as a private investigator. They say he cooperated with the federal investigation, only to face aggressive tactics from prosecutors in the Justice Department during the Biden administration who were intent on making an example of Mr. McMahon.

While he was awaiting sentencing, he and his wife attended Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January. And they had support from people in Mr. Trump’s orbit, including Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, and Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime Trump associate and friend who had urged the president to issue the pardon.

“I am glad that the president pardoned him,” Mr. Lawler said in an interview. “It was the right thing to do.”

That influence campaign followed a formula that has been shown to resonate with Mr. Trump, who has complained that he, too, was harmed by politically motivated investigations. Mr. Trump has used the unfettered presidential clemency power to reward allies and make political points, including casting prosecutions of his supporters as corrupt witch hunts.

A White House official echoed that framing in a statement confirming the pardon of Mr. McMahon. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, argued that the trial was flawed and that Mr. McMahon was tricked into participating in the effort by someone who cast it as an investigation into an individual who had embezzled funds from a construction company.

In reality, the official said, the people who had hired him were actually Chinese spies using his services to track down the individual. The official suggested that Mr. McMahon’s pardon campaign was aided by his career with the New York Police Department, during which he responded to the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the city.

Mr. McMahon’s pardon, like most issued by Mr. Trump, bypassed Justice Department guidelines for vetting and identifying deserving recipients who have served their time and expressed remorse. Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. also flouted the department’s clemency process.

Mr. McMahon applied for a commutation through the Justice Department this year, according to its website. But he would not have qualified for a pardon under its guidelines, since he was still serving his sentence.

Mr. McMahon had been in prison in Michigan until last month, when he was moved to a residential re-entry facility, according to Mr. Lawler, whose district is home to several of Mr. McMahon’s relatives.

“He never should have been prosecuted in the first place,” Mr. Lawler said. “He fully cooperated, gave them all the information that he had on the case, and then the Biden D.O.J. prosecuted him to make an example out of him when he didn’t do anything wrong.”

Mr. Lawler said that Mr. McMahon was suffering from ailments related to his response to the Sept. 11 attacks, and that his brother, a former New York City firefighter, had recently died from an illness believed to be related.

“This is a family that has really been put through the wringer for five-plus years,” Mr. Lawler said.

He credited the former police officer’s wife, Martha Byrne, an actor who appeared in a popular soap opera, with generating support for the pardon.

On social media late on Thursday, Ms. Byrne, who wrote a book about the case, posted a video of herself dancing to the song “Y.M.C.A.” at what appears to be a Trump rally.

“What a week!!! News to follow!!” she wrote.

In an interview on Friday, she called her husband a hero who did nothing wrong.

“And to have the commander in chief, the president of the United States, agree is absolutely incredible to us,” she said. “He understands the D.O.J. and how it can be absolutely brutal to innocent people. And we’re just people. We’re not politicians. We’re not political people.”

Mr. Stone, who received a pardon during Mr. Trump’s first term for obstructing a congressional inquiry into possible Trump campaign coordination with Russia, had hosted Ms. Byrne on his podcast and posted an essay on his website calling for the pardon.

Mr. Stone said he also wrote a letter to the president urging the pardon, but did not talk to any government officials about it and was not paid for his advocacy.

Mr. Trump this week also approved pardons for two Tennessee Republicans — the former House speaker and a former top aide — who had been sentenced weeks earlier on public corruption charges and were scheduled to report to prison later this month.

The Tennessee pardons were reported on Thursday by The Washington Post.

They were confirmed by a White House official.

Yet seven diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks, said that the United States came with a take-it-or-leave-it message to the council.

They said Michael Waltz, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, told diplomats from countries on the Security Council that the alternative to wholesale adoption of the Trump plan was to watch the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas give way to a return to war.

It was unclear if, should the resolution not pass, Israel would resume its military offensive against Hamas in Gaza.

The 10-point draft resolution, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, builds on the Trump peace plan in some respects but leaves major ambiguities, including about how to demilitarize Gaza.

It would authorize a “Board of Peace” to oversee Gaza at least until the end of 2027. It also says the coastal enclave would be managed day-to-day by a “technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip” and calls upon the World Bank to set up a trust fund to finance reconstruction.

An International Stabilization Force would be responsible for “ensuring the process of demilitarizing” the territory, including destroying military infrastructure in Gaza and decommissioning militant groups’ weaponry. But the draft does not go into greater detail about how it would do that if militants refused to comply.

The resolution said that the stabilization force should coordinate with Egypt and Israel to train and support Palestinian police personnel, protect civilians, work to secure humanitarian corridors, and to secure border areas.

Some countries have been skittish about committing soldiers to such a force for fear that their soldiers could come into direct conflict with Hamas. Analysts have also said that Arab states would be unlikely to deploy their soldiers to Gaza if the plan did not include a pathway to establishing a Palestinian state, which Israel’s government opposes.

Mr. Waltz, the Trump administration’s emissary to the United Nations, held one-on-one meetings this week with the permanent members of the Security Council — Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom.

He also met with members of the Palestinian mission to the U.N. according to a senior U.S. official — a signal by the Trump administration that Palestinian leaders were not being frozen out of the process.

Security Council members are expected to provide written feedback to the United States by Friday, the senior American official said. The Trump administration hopes to put the resolution, which was presented to diplomats with the president’s peace plan attached, to a vote in the coming weeks.

The official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy, said that incorporating Mr. Trump’s peace plan into the resolution effectively addressed two pressing issues that had arisen in discussions with Europeans and Arab allies. Those concerns, the official said, were about Palestinian statehood and the role of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza’s future.

Though Mr. Trump’s plan includes a vague reference to the Palestinian aspiration to statehood, it does not outline a pathway to establishing a state. The draft resolution adds no new language on that topic.

Also, the draft resolution, like the Trump plan, would sideline the Palestinian Authority, giving it no role in Gaza until it completes unspecified changes.

The stakes for the Palestinians are high. If adopted, the draft Security Council resolution, which was presented to elected members of the council on Wednesday, would effectively turn Mr. Trump’s peace plan into binding international law.

On Wednesday, Mr. Waltz hosted the Security Council’s 10 elected members at the United States mission to the U.N., to hear their concerns and seek their support for the resolution. That meeting, to which Mr. Waltz also invited representatives of Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, was described in detail by two security council members present at the meeting, and two officials briefed on it, who demanded anonymity to recount it.

According to the four officials, representatives of Pakistan, Denmark and Somalia asked for clarification of the role of the Palestinian Authority in the future of Gaza.

When the representative from Denmark asked about the Palestinian Authority’s role on the Board of Peace and on the technocratic governing committee, Mr. Waltz responded by suggesting answers could be found in the 20-point Trump plan.

A diplomat from Guyana asked Mr. Waltz whether members of the Security Council would know who would sit on the Board of Peace by the time the draft resolution was put to a vote. Mr. Waltz replied that he was uncertain whether the board's makeup would be known by then, but stressed the need to approve the measure anyway to prevent the collapse of the cease-fire.

Though Mr. Waltz was evasive in responding to questions from the group about the Palestinian Authority, he expressed confidence that the deployment of an international stabilization force would trigger a pullback of Israeli soldiers inside Gaza.

Diplomats from Slovenia and Algeria both raised the subject of accountability, noting that the draft resolution omitted any mention of a requirement that the Board of Peace report back to the Security Council. An Algerian diplomat suggested that this would hand the Board of Peace a blank check. Mr. Waltz promised to take those concerns into consideration.

To pass, nine of the 15 Security Council members would need to vote in favor of the draft resolution, and all five permanent members, including Russia and China, would have to support or not veto it.

Weeks ago, France advised the United States on what could be included in a resolution, according to a document seen by The Times, and verified by two U.S. officials, that detailed the French recommendation. It said that the resolution could endorse a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and underscore the goal of helping the Palestinian Authority take responsibility for security in Gaza.

Those suggestions were largely overlooked in the draft resolution shared with members this week. Some elements of France’s advice, however, were worked into the U.S. draft, including language requiring that the international stabilization force abide by international law.

Palestinian analysts speculated that the Americans’ refusal to clarify key parts of the draft resolution was intended to give them room to maneuver.

“The Americans want to control everything,” said Akram Atallah, a London-based analyst originally from the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya. “By keeping things vague, they can do what they want in the future.”

In his meetings this week, Mr. Waltz told his counterparts that the draft resolution had undergone 21 revisions in three weeks, four Security Council diplomats said. They said he stressed that time was not on the side of those pursuing peace in Gaza because the cease-fire was fragile.

That all-or-nothing approach drew criticism from Security Council members, including some Europeans, who said in interviews that the United States could not force its will on them. They added that the Security Council’s role was not to be a rubber stamp.

Still, others privately conceded that the Trump administration’s evident willingness to use levers like tariffs to get its way with other countries had made them leery of challenging the United States.

Approval of the draft resolution would be a significant diplomatic victory for the Trump administration at the United Nations.

The United States has been isolated within the Security Council and the 193-member General Assembly over its staunch support for Israel since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack that ignited the Gaza war. The United States, under both the Biden and Trump administrations, vetoed six Security Council resolutions demanding an immediate cease-fire.

Under the terms of the agreement, Cornell is expected to pay a $30 million fine to the government — a pledge that the president of a Cornell faculty rights group called a “bribe” — and to invest $30 million on programs designed to enhance efficiency and lower costs in agriculture and farming. A land-grant institution, Cornell is known for its agricultural research programs.

The government had been scrutinizing Cornell after accusations of racial discrimination and antisemitism. In April, Trump administration officials asserted that they intended to freeze more than $1 billion in research funding for the school. University officials said at the time that stop-work orders were trickling in but that they were struggling to understand how the administration had arrived at its figure.

By last month, when Cornell’s president, Michael Kotlikoff, delivered his State of the University address, officials were still puzzling over the number. At the end of September, Dr. Kotlikoff said, Cornell had accounted for “nearly $250 million in canceled or unpaid research funds.” Friday’s agreement, however, was expected to resolve the federal funding pauses, no matter the math.

In a statement released to the Cornell community on Friday, Dr. Kotlikoff expressed relief.

“The months of stop-work orders, grant terminations and funding freezes have stalled cutting-edge research, upended lives and careers, and threatened the future of academic programs at Cornell,” he said.

“With this resolution,” he added, “Cornell looks forward to resuming the long and fruitful partnership with the federal government that has yielded, for so many years, so much progress and well-being for our nation and our world.”

Dr. Kotlikoff had vowed not to sign an agreement that would permit the government to “dictate our institution’s policies.”

He got his wish: Cornell’s settlement included a provision declaring the university and the government both “affirm the importance of and their support for academic freedom.” It also said that no part of the settlement could be “construed as giving the United States authority to dictate the content of academic speech or curricula.”

Cornell, however, did agree to provide anonymized admissions data to the federal government through 2028, details the Trump administration has also required from other schools as it scrutinizes whether race is used as a factor in selective college admissions. Justice Department officials said the school will also provide discrimination training to faculty and staff members.

And Justice Department officials said the university would use the administration’s interpretation of a 2023 Supreme Court decision that ended explicit consideration of race in admissions to higher education as long as that guidance is “consistent with relevant judicial decisions.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi laid out in a memo in July how that ruling, along with federal civil rights law, should be applied to schools receiving federal funding.

The agreement, dated Friday, was hashed out last week at the White House following months of talks. It settles investigations of Cornell, as well as its law school, by several federal agencies. Under the arrangement, Cornell’s payments and investments of $60 million will be spread out over three years

As a part of the agreement, Cornell admitted no wrongdoing, and Dr. Kotlikoff said he would personally certify ongoing compliance with the deal, signing off on the veracity of admissions data submissions.

David A. Bateman, the president of Cornell’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said that provision was among many that worried him and other members. He said that the explicit steering of $30 million toward agriculture programs smacked of the federal government directing Cornell priorities.

And referring to the fine, he said, “There’s nothing good to say about the bribe, the $30 million bribe.”

Dr. Bateman said that although any agreement was “strategically unwise and a betrayal of Cornell’s principles,” Friday’s settlement was “not as bad as it could be.” He said he believed that months of campus pressure had positioned Cornell leaders to demand better terms, and that mounting backlash to the White House’s efforts had left the government with less negotiating power.

The Trump administration did not see it that way.

Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said the agreement showed that universities “are refocusing their attention on merit, rigor, and truth-seeking — not ideology.” And Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, called the agreement groundbreaking and said that it will expand agricultural development and productivity.

The agricultural research planned by Cornell will involve the use of artificial intelligence and robotics in farming.

The White House’s attack on Cornell is part of a broader crusade targeting higher education, and particularly the Ivy League. Shortly after taking office, President Trump, who has characterized university leaders as “Marxist maniacs and lunatics,” cut off funding to try to force some campuses to comport with his political agenda.

The investigations of Cornell stemmed largely from a series of campus demonstrations over the Israel-Hamas war and demands by students for university divestment from weapons manufacturers that supplied the Israeli military. Ms. McMahon had accused the school of not doing enough to curb protests that had “severely disrupted campus life” and made Jewish students on campus fearful.

The protests included a March 2024 walkout, an encampment a month later and a disruption at a Statler Hotel on campus where students shut down a career fair that included booths from the arms manufacturers Boeing and L3Harris.

Strained by the funding cuts, which struck a significant blow to university research activities, universities have felt pressure to comply with at least some demands, although they have pushed back on others.

Cornell’s endowment was valued at nearly $12 billion at the end of June — a formidable sum, but one far smaller than many of the university’s Ivy League peers. And as the Trump administration pummeled the university, Cornell leaders made clear that the school was feeling extraordinary financial strain.

In June, university leaders warned that they anticipated layoffs and had begun what they described as “a comprehensive review of programs and head count across the university,” where the work force had climbed by more than 15 percent in about four years.

The suspension of federal funding turned that growth into a crisis.

“We have been using institutional resources to try to plug these funding holes in the short term, but these interim measures are not sustainable,” university leaders wrote. “We must immediately address our significant financial shortfalls by reducing costs and enacting permanent change to our operational model.”

Cornell joined broader lawsuits against funding cuts. But unlike Harvard University, it did not bring a stand-alone challenge to the government.

Of the schools that have struck deals with the government, Columbia University faced the most onerous terms, including a $200 million fine. Like Cornell, it secured an explicit pledge that the government would not use the agreement to dictate academic matters.

Brown University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Virginia have also cut deals with the government. The Penn and Virginia settlements included no financial penalties, while Brown’s included a commitment for the university to spend $50 million on work force development programs.

The Trump administration has been in stop-and-start talks with other schools in recent months, most notably Harvard University. The University of California, from which the government has demanded more than $1 billion to settle claims of civil rights violations, has also been in negotiations with the government.

But a Justice Department lawyer told a federal judge on Thursday that there was “no evidence” that the California system was close to reaching an agreement with the Trump administration.

The legal wrangling concerned the immediate fate of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps roughly one in eight Americans purchase groceries. For weeks, the Trump administration has repeatedly refused to tap an ample reserve of federal funds that would sustain those benefits into November, while the federal government remains closed.

Even though President Trump has long claimed to possess vast powers over federal spending — and has frequently reprogrammed the budget to advance his agenda during the shutdown — he and his aides have maintained that they could not source all of the money to send full nutrition aid to the low-income families that receive them.

A coalition of cities, religious groups and nonprofits sued over that refusal, telling the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island last week that the administration had a legal and moral obligation to supply the necessary funds. Twice, Judge John J. McConnell Jr. agreed, and on Thursday, he directed the White House to tap two accounts at the Agriculture Department that would fund SNAP benefits in their entirety.

By Friday, the Justice Department forged ahead with an appeal, arguing there was no “lawful basis” to force the president to find money in the “metaphorical couch cushions.” But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit declined to impose a temporary halt to the judge’s order, known as an administrative stay, as it began to consider the merits of the government’s case.

Immediately, the Trump administration then urged the Supreme Court to intervene, and asked it to decide in a matter of hours, by 9:30 p.m. Friday. In a series of social media posts, Pam Bondi, the attorney general, denounced the court in Rhode Island and claimed that it could not “dictate its own preferences for how scarce federal funds should be spent.”

The developments on Friday once again created chaos and confusion for the millions of low-income Americans caught in the middle of a federal shutdown that has stretched into its sixth week, the longest in U.S. history. Some of these families have been without aid for days, according to local officials, as their states grappled with conflicting and complicated instructions about the availability of federal funds for SNAP.

Even before the appeals court could rule, some states had resumed provisioning full benefits anyway. They did so by instructing the vendors that manage SNAP to load money onto E.B.T. cards, which is how participants in the program buy groceries.

In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, announced on Friday that she had directed state agencies to ensure that the entire amount of SNAP benefits paid by the federal government would go to recipients this month. She said those funds should start to reach families by Sunday.

“I’m working tirelessly to bring this uncertainty to an end for the nearly three million New Yorkers who rely on this program,” the governor said in a statement.

The Agriculture Department had even issued guidance to states earlier in the day saying that it was preparing to release the funds necessary to restore low-income Americans’ aid, according to a copy viewed by The New York Times. By Friday night, though, it remained unclear if the agency still planned to process those payments, or what would happen if the Supreme Court ultimately approved the administration’s request.

The Agriculture Department declined to answer questions late Friday. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, the legal group that had represented suing cities and nonprofits, criticized the administration for trying again to “take food out of the hands of families, seniors, workers and children.”

“And every time they tried, the courts told them what the law already makes clear: They cannot,” she said in a statement.

Since the start of the shutdown, Democrats and Republicans alike had clamored for Mr. Trump to spare SNAP from any disruption. But the White House repeatedly claimed that it lacked the power to preserve food stamps, a program that the president has long targeted for spending cuts.

By its own admission, the government had tens of billions of dollars left over that it could use to sustain food stamps this month. That included a roughly $5 billion emergency reserve that was specifically enacted by Congress for SNAP, as well as a second pot of money at the Agriculture Department, totaling into the tens of billions and filled primarily with tariff revenue.

Together, those funds well exceeded what would be needed to finance the nutrition benefits. And the Trump administration had already tapped some of the tariff money to prevent interruptions to another federal nutrition program during the shutdown.

But the Trump administration at various points refused to take the same action with SNAP, prompting a series of lawsuits, including the challenge brought by local officials at the federal court in Rhode Island.

Initially, Judge McConnell gave the government discretion on whether to make partial or full payments in November, and the funding source from which it would source that aid. His order required the Trump administration to act quickly and make those payments by this week.

In the end, the Agriculture Department opted for partial funding for food stamps, and the way it devised those payments threatened to leave millions of families with no aid at all, or without benefits for weeks or months. Many states, which sued separately in a case awaiting a ruling in Massachusetts, described the conditions foisted onto the program as unnecessarily burdensome.

That prompted Judge McConnell on Thursday to require the government to tap additional funds to make payments in full. That, he said, would avert any cuts and delays, as he admonished the Trump administration for its actions.

“This should never happen in America,” the judge said during a tense but brief hearing.

“We’re looking at it,” Mr. Trump said of the exemption, “because it’s very difficult for him to get the oil and gas from other areas. As you know, they don’t have the advantage of having sea.”

The meeting had promised to be a mutual admiration summit between two heads of state who have found common ground on issues like immigration. The two leaders spoke of their longstanding support for each other, with Mr. Trump praising Mr. Orban as a great friend who was “beloved” in Hungary, and Mr. Orban calling for a “golden age” of relations with the United States.

But the U.S. sanctions imposed last month on Russia’s two largest energy companies over the war are a sticking point. Hungary gets much of its energy from Russia and Mr. Orban says that the penalties are threatening his country’s sluggish economy as he faces one of the toughest re-election battles of his career.

Mr. Trump has urged European countries to cut their purchases of Russian oil as a way to financially handicap Russia’s military campaign. But on Friday, Mr. Trump sought to draw a distinction between Hungary, which is landlocked and depends on pipelines for oil and gas, and other European countries, which have more seaports.

“It’s a great country, it’s a big country, but they don’t have sea,” he said. “They don’t have the ports, and so they have a difficult problem.”

Mr. Trump said other European countries have seaports but still import Russian oil and gas. “And as they know, I’m very disturbed by that,” he said.

The meeting with Mr. Trump was a test of Mr. Orban’s foreign policy prowess, something the Hungarian leader has tried to highlight as a strength in his campaign. He has openly sympathized with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and, like Mr. Trump, he has broken with much of Europe by calling for Ukraine to cede more land to Russia to secure a cease-fire.

On Friday, Mr. Orban said that his agenda for the meeting with Mr. Trump included economic and military issues, as well as political cooperation. But the main issue, he said, was the war in neighboring Ukraine.

“It’s a most important issue for us, and we would like to discuss with you how we can contribute to help you in your peace efforts,” Mr. Orban told Mr. Trump.

When Mr. Trump asked him later whether he believed Ukraine could win the war, Mr. Orban seemed doubtful. “Miracles can happen,” he replied.

The meeting comes as Mr. Trump’s efforts to broker an end to the war in Ukraine appear to have stalled. Mr. Trump has all but washed his hands of the conflict, and on Friday, before meeting with Mr. Orban, the president continued to offer vague assessments of how and when the conflict might end.

“I think we agree that the war is going to end,” Mr. Trump said. “Sometimes people have to fight it out a little bit longer. But I think we agree that the war is going to end in the not too distant future.”

Mr. Putin, however, has shown no signs of stopping the three-year-old invasion, and this week Russia appeared to be close to capturing Pokrovsk, a strategically important railroad hub in eastern Ukraine.

Days before the U.S. sanctions were announced, Mr. Trump reversed course on a proposed summit with Mr. Putin that would have been held in Budapest. Mr. Trump said he canceled the meeting because he said he didn’t believe Mr. Putin wanted to stop the war, a position he reiterated on Friday.

But asked on Friday if there was a chance the meeting with Mr. Putin in Budapest could still happen, he said: “There’s always a chance.”

Mr. Trump has removed some of the sanctions that the Biden administration imposed on Hungary, largely to punish Mr. Orban for democratic backsliding, though other restrictions remain, including a suspension of the personal income tax treaty between the two countries.

Heading into the meeting, Mr. Orban appeared to be most worried about U.S. sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil. Hungary imports 86 percent of its oil from Russia, an amount that has increased since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to the Atlantic Council research group in Washington.

Without an exemption, Hungary could face secondary sanctions from the United States that could result in fines or being cut off from American financial institutions. Hungary, a member of the European Union and is Mr. Putin’s closest ally in the bloc, is already exempted from E.U. sanctions on Russian crude oil exports.

To get out from under the U.S. sanctions, Mr. Orban might have to bend on another issue: E.U. membership for Ukraine.

Mr. Trump wants Europe to shoulder the bulk of Western assistance to Ukraine. The European Union has agreed to open membership negotiations with Ukraine, which would help Kyiv stabilize the country’s economy.

But Mr. Orban opposes Ukraine joining the bloc, and he said this week on social media that such a move would “bring the war into Europe.”

In recent years, Mr. Orban, an ally of Mr. Putin, has defied most of Europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by refusing to endorse sending military support or E.U. financial aid to Ukraine. But in some cases, he has also avoided outright vetoing aid.

James Batchik, an associate director of the Atlantic Council’s Europe Center, said in an analysis published this week that Mr. Orban’s unwillingness to clear the way on Ukraine’s accession to the European Union runs directly counter to Mr. Trump’s demands that Europe do more.

“Despite Trump’s chumminess with Orban, he has been the roadblock to the action the United States is demanding from Europe,” he wrote, adding that the sanctions mean “Trump has leverage.”

Public records experts say the new record-keeping policy opens ample room for both willful and unwitting noncompliance with federal open records laws in an administration that has already shown a lack of interest in, or willingness to skirt, records laws. That development could be particularly troubling as the department executes President Trump’s aggressive agenda of mass deportations, a campaign that has included numerous accusations of misconduct by law enforcement officials, the experts said.

“If you are an immigration official or an agent and believe that the public might later criticize you, or that your records could help you be held accountable, would you go out of the way to preserve those records that might expose wrongdoing?” said Lauren Harper, who advocates government transparency at the Freedom of the Press Foundation.

The Department of Homeland Security includes key immigration agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. The department did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. But on Friday, after publication of this article, it said in an emailed statement that the application the agency had stopped using “was not the exclusive means of preserving text data,” but did not elaborate on why it had opted for manual record-keeping.

The department has maintained and will continue to maintain records of phone data, including text messages, the statement added, reiterating what department officials had said in a court statement filed on Wednesday.

Still, experts expressed skepticism that the new policy of manual compliance by individual officials could be effective or was designed in good faith.

The policy expects officials to first take screenshots of the text messages on their work phones, send it to their work email, download it on their work computers and then run a program that would recognize the text to store it in searchable formats, according to the department’s guidance submitted to the court.

Under the Federal Records Act, government agencies are required to preserve all documentation that officials and federal workers produce while executing their duties. They have to make federal records available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act unless they fall under certain exemptions.

The new policy was revealed as part of the lawsuit surrounding the department’s unusual response to public records requests filed by American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group.

The agency rebuffed a request for public records related to the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles this summer and to the migrant detention camp in the Everglades known as Alligator Alcatraz. The agency said it had not maintained text message data among top officials since early April.

But department officials, in sworn court statements, said those responses were provided “mistakenly.” They explained that public information officers had erroneously concluded that the agency lacked the ability to locate responsive records, without searching for manual screenshots. Those became the department’s official record-keeping practice for text messages since April 9.

The department is now searching for records that American Oversight has requested. But it failed to meet a deadline to respond to an inquiry from the National Archives on records compliance, according to the court filing. The department cited the government shutdown for delays.

Chioma Chukwu, the executive director of American Oversight, said compliance with federal records laws could be best achieved with a centralized system that allows transparent practices.

“Anytime you are relying on humans to manually archive information, there’s always room for error,” Ms. Chukwu said.

The change in the agency’s record retention policy since early April came after defense and national security officials were mired in an explosive scandal in March for communicating sensitive details of U.S. airstrike plans in Yemen on Signal, a private messaging app. Its users can set messages to disappear after a set time period; the chat group was exposed after a journalist was inadvertently added to the conversation.

Ms. Chukwu said that investigations and lawsuits that followed the Signal controversy showed that the administration officials had frequently used the messenger app’s auto-delete feature.

In May, more than a month after the department opted for the manual screenshot practice, the cybersecurity agency within the Homeland Security Department publicly warned that the application that allowed automated capture of texts, TeleMessage, could be vulnerable to malicious hacking.

But experts in federal public records requirements said such valid security concerns did not exempt the administration from adopting a record-keeping practice or new software that ensures full compliance with the law.

“Regardless of motive, in reverting to a policy of manual archiving of messages about government business, D.H.S. has increased its risk of noncompliance with its obligations to preserve important federal records,” said Jason R. Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives, referring to the Department of Homeland Security.

Ms. Harper said a screenshot of text messages was an inadequate means to preserve communication chains of official government business, even if the administration manages to preserve all relevant messages, as the law requires “a complete copy” to be preserved, including links and attachments.

The new policy “drastically increases the likelihood the agency isn’t complying with the Federal Records Act,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/01/multimedia/07trump-news-promo8p/01nat-snap-jchv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 21:04:03.226640

The footage, obtained by the Boston Globe, shows a frantic commotion inside a vehicle in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, on Thursday. A desperate woman in the passenger seat tries to awaken the man in the driver’s seat, with a crying child in the middle. People can be heard shouting: “He’s having a seizure.” An officer can be seen trying to pull the passengers from the vehicle, while a Fitchburg police officer orders the crowd to “back up” repeatedly.

“They’re trying to rip the baby out of [his] hand,” another bystander says.

ICE said the video did not accurately represent the situation. Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security, said on social media that emergency medical personnel at the scene “found no legitimate medical episode” and the family refused medical care. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a statement on social media wrote: “Imagine FAKING a seizure to help a criminal escape justice.”

Carlos Sebastian Zapata, the man in the video, told the Boston Globe on Friday that he fell unconscious as he feared his wife would be taken into custody. “I wasn’t letting go of my wife because they wanted to take her away,” Zapata told the newspaper.

He said agents pushed him during the attempted arrest, hit him around his ribs and pressed on his neck. “And that’s when I let go of my wife,” Zapata said. “I had convulsions or something.”

ICE confirmed that the operation had been focused on the man’s wife, who was accompanying him at the time. She was identified as Juliana Milena Ojeda-Montoya from Ecuador, and was taken into custody on Thursday.

Officials said Ojeda-Montoya had a warrant out for her arrest after she was charged by local authorities with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon after allegedly stabbing a co-worker and throwing a trash barrel at her.

ICE agents reportedly conducted a traffic stop of the family at 7.00am, and it evolved into an “attempted apprehension”. Agents contacted Fitchburg police around 8.03am, reporting that a growing crowd was posing a threat to the agents.

According to police statements to Boston.com, an officer, a supervisor and a captain were sent to the scene and “confirmed that a crowd was gathering and that the situation was hostile”.

The incident occurred amid Trump’s intensified deportation campaign, which included a large-scale enforcement effort in September known as Operation Patriot 2.0 in Massachusetts. That operation led to the detention of more than 1,400 people in the state for immigration-related reasons.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/017c6ccbe323e46bfd5ad61cdd64062a364217a7/450_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3a1f94413eddc76585dd27c9bd06079f",N,,2025-11-07 21:04:27.293867

TOP TALKER

In a dramatic courtroom moment, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis opened her ruling Thursday not with legal citations, but with Carl Sandburg’s famous ode to Chicago — the “City of the Big Shoulders.” She read aloud the lines challenging those who would “sneer” at a city “so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.”

That Chicago — alive, flawed and defiant — is the one Ellis said she sees from her bench. And with that spirit she issued a sweeping injunction restricting the federal government’s use of force during “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Trump administration’s controversial immigration crackdown.

That gripping coverage comes from the Sun-Times’ Jon Seidel and the Tribune’s Jason Meisner, who documented the testimony and Ellis’ ruling:

“The use of force shocks the conscience,” the judge declared, calling the government’s evidence “simply not credible.” What she’s witnessed over the last six weeks, the judge said, is a campaign that has “shown no signs of stopping,” marked by citizens being tear-gassed “indiscriminately,” struck by pepper-spray balls, and tackled in the street.

Her 90-minute ruling replaces last month’s temporary restraining order with a more permanent injunction that will remain in place until the broader lawsuit is resolved. The order bars agents from using “riot control weapons” on peaceful protesters or journalists without issuing two warnings. It also bans “chokeholds” and similar neck restraints except when “objectively necessary to stop an immediate threat” and mandates that agents display badge numbers “conspicuously in two separate places.”

Ellis also ordered that agents wear body cameras and avoid interfering with members of the press “in most circumstances.” The judge said these limits were not anti-law-enforcement but essential to “a government that conducts itself fairly and according to its own stated regulations and policies.”

Her written order is here.

About the case: It was brought by a coalition of journalists and civil rights groups, who recounted harrowing scenes: a pastor hit in the head with pepper balls while praying, a woman facing a gun for filming an arrest and others who were followed or harassed after criticizing agents online.

According to the Tribune and Sun-Times: Ellis didn’t hide her frustration with testimony from federal officials, particularly U.S. Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who she said “admitted that he lied about whether a rock hit him before he deployed tear gas in Little Village.” Video played in court showed Bovino tackling a protester despite claiming under oath that he “never used force.” Another agent, Kristopher Hewson, insisted he yelled “get ’em” at protesters — but Ellis said the footage clearly showed otherwise. “What he said,” she told the court, “was ‘hit them.’”

The government’s defense crumbled further when it failed to produce evidence of the violence it claimed — despite hundreds of hours of submitted footage. “The [Trump administration] would have people believe that the Chicagoland area is in a vice hold of violence, ransacked by rioters and attacked by agitators.” That, she said, “simply is untrue.”

The Department of Homeland Security blasted the injunction as “an extreme act by an activist judge that risks the lives and livelihoods of law enforcement officers,” according to a statement to Playbook. DHS vowed to appeal, arguing that agents had faced “rioters, gangbangers, and terrorists.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs said Ellis’ ruling was a crucial check on unchecked power. “We have seen democracy in action, and there is nothing that can stop it,” lead attorney Steve Art told reporters after the hearing.

Ellis ended her ruling by quoting John Adams — “Liberty once lost is lost forever” — and Benjamin Franklin’s reminder that free speech is “a principal pillar in a free government.”

THE BUZZ

ELECTION OPTIMISM: Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is riding a wave of optimism after fellow progressive Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City, viewing it as both validation and motivation for his agenda to tax the wealthy to fund social investments. Mamdani has made a similar proposal.

This week’s elections demonstrate that progressives, Democratic socialists and more moderate Democrats can unite around one core issue: “working people,” he told reporters Thursday during his weekly briefing at City Hall.

The mayor is channeling that post-election momentum into defending his $16.6 billion spending plan, even after S&P Global Ratings downgraded Chicago’s outlook from “stable” to “negative” following his decision to reduce the city’s advance pension payment from $271.8 million to $120.2 million. Johnson maintains that the budget remains “very sound.” WTTW’s Heather Cherone has more.

“I know there have been questions around pensions,” Johnson said at City Hall, noting that Chicago no longer has the pension advance fund established under former Mayor Lori Lightfoot. “However, we still were able, even in these very difficult, tumultuous times, to put forth an advanced payment while not cutting services.”

At the heart of Johnson’s plan is a proposal to reinstate a corporate head tax — $21 per month per employee at companies with more than 100 workers — projected to generate $100 million to replace expiring federal funds for violence prevention and community safety programs.

“If you’ve never had to choose between lunch for your children or rent, you may not fully understand the impetus behind this budget,” Johnson said, describing the tax as a modest ask of large corporations. “We have a very clear structural challenge within the city’s finances.”

Business groups have largely opposed the head tax — companies like McDonald’s — and some City Council members have labeled it a “job killer.”

A new survey offers a glimpse of how some Chicago voters feel about the mayor’s proposed budget (opposing it) — and what action they might take if their alderman supports it. In an effort to persuade the City Council to reject the plan, One Future Illinois commissioned nine ward-by-ward surveys conducted by Change Research. One Future Illinois is the same organization that led the opposition to the mayor’s real estate transfer tax proposal last year. The full polling memo is here.

Johnson insists residents are on his side. “Do they believe the ultra-wealthy and big corporations should pay their fair share in taxes? Chicagoans overwhelmingly agree with me,” he said.

“Certain medical conditions — including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions — can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care,” the cable states.
It comes amid a broader Trump administration campaign to dissuade immigrants from coming to the U.S. “It’s no secret the Trump administration is putting the interests of the American people first.
A State Department official stressed to The Hill that the decision to issue a visa has always been at the discretion of an officer.
Public charge policies were shifted under the first Trump administration, greatly expanding who would be considered a public charge.","Applicants for immigrant visas to the U.S. could be rejected if they have certain medical conditions under a new State Department directive, the agency confirmed.

The policy would allow officers to deny visas to immigrants deemed more likely to rely on public benefits should they have medical issues.

Sent to State Department employees through an internal cable, the guidance instructed officers to consider both an applicant’s health and overall financial picture when determining whether to issue a visa.

“Certain medical conditions — including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions — can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care,” the cable states.

“Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?”

The directive appears to resurrect the “public charge” rule from the first Trump administration that sought to deny green cards to any immigrant who received at least one designated public benefit — including Medicaid, nutrition asistance, welfare or public housing vouchers — for more than 12 months within any three-year period.

Fox News first reported the development.

It comes amid a broader Trump administration campaign to dissuade immigrants from coming to the U.S.

“It’s no secret the Trump administration is putting the interests of the American people first. This includes enforcing policies that ensure our immigration system is not a burden on the American taxpayer,” principal deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.

A medical examination is mandatory for all people outside the U.S. applying for an immigrant visa and all refugees coming to the United States. The new directive takes it further.

The cable directs officers to develop “their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future.”

State Department officers don’t have medical training but are asked to weigh a variety of factors when determining whether to issue a visa, including finances and the likelihood those on a travel visa will return to their home country, as well as make judgments about any flags that come up during a criminal background check.

Still, the measure opens the door to a number of refusals, given the widespread nature of some listed conditions.

About 10 percent of the world has diabetes, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 40 percent of Americans are obese. According to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally.

A State Department official stressed to The Hill that the decision to issue a visa has always been at the discretion of an officer.

Officers aren’t being instructed to reject an applicant because they have a certain medical condition, they said, but rather consider the “overall impact” if someone would be unlikely to be able to pay for their own medical care.

“It’s addressed on an individual, case-by-case basis,” the official said.

They gave the example of a diabetic, adding that they would not face rejection because they need insulin, but could be rejected if Medicaid would be needed to cover the drug.

Public charge policies were shifted under the first Trump administration, greatly expanding who would be considered a public charge. Previously, the term only applied to those primarily reliant on the government through cash assistance.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/AP25129717207488-e1752596752686.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-07 21:04:11.246770

Judge Carter has ordered that Mr. Chalco-Beltran not be removed from the country or the Southern District, in order to preserve the court’s jurisdiction.
It’s unclear whether Mr. Chalco-Beltran was charged with or convicted of a crime after entering the country.
Under Mr. Trump, immigrants facing deportation are generally held without bond for the duration of their legal proceedings, breaking with longstanding practice.","A blind Ecuadorean man has been held since Tuesday in a Manhattan lockup without access to a lawyer or any help challenging his detention, according to a petition filed by his sister this week in Manhattan federal court.

The petition, by Eva Magdalena Chalco Chango, who represents herself, accuses the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency of arresting the man, Carlos Anibal Chalco-Beltran, 40, as he left his home on Tuesday and walked to work. It came nearly three years after he was released by an immigration judge to await further proceedings.

Mr. Chalco-Beltran, who had applied for asylum, was placed in a holding cell at 26 Federal Plaza, site of the ICE offices in Lower Manhattan, according to the court filing, which seeks his release. Following reports about overcrowded conditions, a state judge in August ordered ICE to improve the conditions in those holding cells and mandated that detainees be able to make calls to their lawyers.

Mr. Chalco-Beltran is being held with his son, who was also arrested by ICE, and the agency was trying to ensure that the two continue to be held together, a government lawyer told a federal judge, Andrew L. Carter Jr., during a telephone hearing late Friday afternoon.

The judge ordered that Mr. Chalco-Beltran be appointed a pro bono lawyer, and pressed the federal government to provide him with documents that were in Spanish — and Braille.

As ICE arrests have filled up detention centers, the agency has come under scrutiny over how it provides basic medical care and accommodations for detainees with disabilities. The conditions have led to litigation from civil rights groups, reports of medical neglect and congressional scrutiny.

Mr. Chalco-Beltran’s case also underscores the strict approach the Trump administration has taken to detaining migrants who entered the United States during the Biden administration, and had previously been allowed to contest their deportation while living in the community.

In her petition to the court, Ms. Chalco Chango says she has been a caretaker for her brother throughout her life. The petition also includes a document from the New York State Commission for the Blind verifying his disability. The petition did not say whether Mr. Chalco-Beltran’s blindness required special accommodations that he lacks, or describe how he coped in the holding cells of the lockup.

Ms. Chalco Chango said in the filing that the room where her brother was being held does not provide access to paper, a law library or advice to detainees on how to challenge their detentions.

Judge Carter has ordered that Mr. Chalco-Beltran not be removed from the country or the Southern District, in order to preserve the court’s jurisdiction.

The office of Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District, wrote to the judge on Thursday, saying that Mr. Chalco-Beltran remains at 26 Federal Plaza pending arrangements for his transfer to the Orange County Jail in Goshen, N.Y., which is ICE’s only detention facility within the Southern District.

The petition by Ms. Chalco Chango says that her brother was forced to flee his homeland because of threats on his life, and that he sought asylum in the United States after he entered the country near Roma, Texas, on Jan. 18, 2023.

The Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Many migrants like Mr. Chalco-Beltran have been detained by the Trump administration, which has been seeking to hold immigrants in detention indefinitely, even those who previously were found not to be dangerous or a flight risk.

For decades, immigration judges granted bond to detained immigrants who were not perceived as public safety threats, allowing them to live in their communities and attend hearings while deportation cases wound through the courts. It’s unclear whether Mr. Chalco-Beltran was charged with or convicted of a crime after entering the country.

Under Mr. Trump, immigrants facing deportation are generally held without bond for the duration of their legal proceedings, breaking with longstanding practice.

Detention centers have filled up with tens of thousands of immigrants who typically do not have access to lawyers. Unlike in criminal courts, people detained by ICE do not have a constitutional right to a government-funded attorney in immigration court.

That can make it easier for the federal government to deport someone: Studies have found that detainees without lawyers are less likely to obtain relief or protection, and are more likely to be ordered removed from the country.

As prolonged detentions have piled up, efforts to release migrants from detention have spilled over into the federal district courts, where they can file so-called habeas corpus petitions.

Over the past few months, immigration lawyers in New York have said that they had noticed a spike in the number of detained immigrants filing habeas corpus petitions without a lawyer, usually with the help of relatives or community organizers.

All but six of them spoke against the program, describing ICE’s actions with words like “kidnapping,” “dangerous,” and “racial profiling,” with one person saying a partnership would “sell the soul of the city.” Notably, the speakers came from all 14 City Council districts.
“Call times would skyrocket.” He said he’d also likely need more overtime hours to account for the loss of officers working with ICE.
All of this should have served as an indicator of how the day would go for the two unlucky ICE officers sent to answer the Council’s questions.
In fact, the ICE people weren’t even sure Dallas would get $25 million.","It was the meeting that only one person wanted, and he wasn’t in attendance. After Dallas Police Chief Daniel Comeaux told the Citizen Police Oversight Board last month that he had turned down $25 million to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Mayor Eric Johnson fired off a memo directing two City Council committees to meet jointly and reconsider ICE’s offer. The mayor, it seems, was rather bullish on the city’s police officers taking on the task of federal immigration enforcement.

“Clearly,” Johnson wrote, “participation in ICE’s Task Force Mode could provide significant financial benefits to the city.” But more importantly, he said, “This program could act as a ‘force multiplier,’ providing a path for the Dallas Police Department to deploy additional resources to reduce violent crime at lower cost to taxpayers.”

But despite his insistence that the Council should consider the matter, the Mayor of Somewhere Else was … somewhere else on Thursday. In his absence, 12 members of the Council performed the rare feat of doing both nothing (because the decision was Comeaux’s to make and didn’t require their approval) and doing something remarkable by nearly unanimously agreeing that Dallas will not be a city that buddies up with ICE.

Yesterday, before the Council questioned Comeaux and two ICE representatives, 74 speakers had signed up to share their views on the possibility of the city working with ICE. All but six of them spoke against the program, describing ICE’s actions with words like “kidnapping,” “dangerous,” and “racial profiling,” with one person saying a partnership would “sell the soul of the city.” Notably, the speakers came from all 14 City Council districts.

The comments continued until nearly noon, and then the Council’s questions allowed Comeaux to lay out his understanding of his job, his conversations with ICE officials, and why he concluded that 287(g), as it’s called, “is not the program for us” and “would not help us in any kind of way.” He had discussed it with his bosses in the city manager’s office (including City Manager Kimberly Bizor Tolbert and Chief of Public Safety Dominique Artis), several other law enforcement officials, and his own executive team. In short, he realized that the money wasn’t a guarantee, that his officers involved in the program would need to meet a daily quota of immigration arrests for the city to be reimbursed, and that he would likely need to devote 250 officers to the effort. “You take 250 officers from patrol, it would hurt us really bad,” he said. “Call times would skyrocket.” He said he’d also likely need more overtime hours to account for the loss of officers working with ICE.

“You have a really good police department here,” he concluded. Violent crime continues to decline, while the number of outstanding felony warrant arrests is on the rise. The department is making progress in reducing response times. His officers, he said, are earning the trust of the communities they serve, which would be eroded if Black and Brown residents felt that any cop they saw could actually be working for ICE.

Council members seemed to understand Comeaux’s decision and asked friendly questions designed to give him a chance to explain himself. Councilmember Cara Mendelsohn, who chairs the Public Safety Committee, did question whether there needs to be a policy that requires certain big-ticket opportunities to go before the Council, but by and large, Comeaux presented information to a horseshoe that was in his corner.

Latino members of the Council, including Jaime Resendez, Laura Cadena, and Mayor Pro Tem Jesse Moreno, talked about the impact that immigration enforcement has had on their lives. Resendez spoke about his mother and father, who were formerly undocumented residents. Cadena talked about her grandmother in Laredo, who was terrified of the immigration enforcement that focused on Black and Brown people when she was a child. “Just because I wear a suit,” Moreno said, didn’t mean he’d be protected from being profiled by ICE agents today.

All of this should have served as an indicator of how the day would go for the two unlucky ICE officers sent to answer the Council’s questions. At first, they introduced themselves only by their last names—Officer Francis and Officer Ivey. (When pressed later, Ivey did provide her full name—Fern Ivy, a 287(g) program manager with the agency.) The two had been provided (as had Comeaux) a list of questions in advance. Unlike Comeaux, they were not at all prepared to answer any additional questions.

Both often gave contradictory answers to questions based on Comeaux’s explanation of his conversations with ICE. When this was pointed out, they explained that they were from the Dallas Field Office and were not privy to the conversations Comeaux had with officials higher up. If the Council wanted answers and explanations about how much money was on the line, that was really no clearer after Thursday’s meeting.

Other things they didn’t know or could’t explain to the Council’s satisfaction: the length of time it takes to train a police officer for ICE duties, whether there is a quota, what constitutes probable cause, whether immigrants have rights, whether the federal government would indemnify the city against any civil rights lawsuits, and various aspects of the U.S. Constitution. In fact, the ICE people weren’t even sure Dallas would get $25 million. At times, Francis would tell the Council that he couldn’t answer their questions, only for a member to find the answer in an internet search moments later.

All of this visibly frustrated several on the Council and led to this testy exchange between Councilmember Adam Bazaldua and Francis:

“Can you tell me what the 4th Amendment is?”

“I’m not prepared to …”

“How about our 14th Amendment?”

“Where are you from, sir?” Bazaldua said before Francis responded, shifting gears. (Francis spoke with an obvious accent.) Francis began to stammer an answer, but Bazaldua continued: “I think you were afforded due process …” Council members complained that the line of questioning was not appropriate. “I think there’s some irony here,” Bazaldua said. He later apologized if his line of questioning made people uncomfortable but said, “That’s exactly what we’re asking our officers to do” to residents of Dallas.

After a few rounds of questions, the Council didn’t detain Francis and Ivey any longer. The Council batted cleanup, with each member taking time to explain his or her reservations about the whole thing.

And there were a lot of reservations. Moreno said ICE “failed to convince” him. Resendez castigated the mayor for being “reckless” and pitting the Council against law enforcement. “Chief Comeaux made the right call,” he said. Moreno said his discussions with residents and police officers indicate that the city doesn’t want this, and he worries that the city will actually lose officers at a time when it can ill afford to do so. Councilmember Maxie Johnson said that he felt ICE’s responses were “a bit disingenuous.” He added that it’s “hard for me to support any organization that rips apart homes based on skin color. I know what it means to be racially profiled.” And twice he offered a phrase that he said is often used when he’s playing dominoes: “All money ain’t good money.”

Even Mendelsohn said the irrefutable fact that working with ICE would take officers off the street gave her pause. “We cannot afford not to have every officer on the street,” she said.

In the end, even though a vote wasn’t necessary, the Council did agree to postpone any vote on a recommendation indefinitely. If nothing else, Bazaldua said, it would mean the discussion “ends here.”

Mayor Johnson did something remarkable Thursday: he provided a platform for a citizen from every single district in Dallas and nearly every single member of the City Council to speak at length about what they thought of ICE and his “force multiplier.” There was something magical about yesterday. The guy who has struggled to create a reliable coalition on the horseshoe finally whipped the body into a resounding, unified “No.”",https://assets.dmagstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NOKINGS101825janik051.webp,N,,2025-11-07 17:57:02.429498

But Republicans quickly said no, and Thune reiterated that they would not trade offers on health care until the government is reopened.
“We’re back to square one,” said Sen. John Kennedy, adding that he could not predict when the shutdown will end.
Or do they vote to reopen the government and hope for the best as Republicans promise an eventual health care vote, but not a guaranteed outcome?
“I’m not promising anybody anything,” Johnson said Thursday when asked if he could promise a vote on a health care bill.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader John Thune quickly swatted down a Democratic offer to reopen the government and extend expiring health care subsidies for a year, calling it a “nonstarter” as the partisan impasse over the shutdown continued into its 38th day.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer made the offer to reopen the government on Friday as Republicans have refused to negotiate on demands to extend health care subsidies. It was a much narrowed version of a broad proposal Democrats laid out a month ago to make the health tax credits permanent and reverse Medicaid cuts that Republicans enacted earlier this year.

Schumer offered Republicans simultaneous votes to end the government shutdown and extend the expiring health care subsidies, along with a bipartisan committee to address Republican demands for changes to the Affordable Care Act.

“All Republicans have to do is say yes,” Schumer said.

But Republicans quickly said no, and Thune reiterated that they would not trade offers on health care until the government is reopened. “That’s what we’re going to negotiate once the government opens up,” Thune said after Schumer made his proposal on the floor.

Thune said he thinks the offer is an indication that Democrats are “feeling the heat.”

“I guess you could characterize that as progress,” he said. “But I just don’t think it gets anywhere close to what we need to do here.”

Republicans met Friday afternoon with no resolution about steps forward.

“We’re back to square one,” said Sen. John Kennedy, adding that he could not predict when the shutdown will end.

Despite the stalemate, lawmakers in both parties were feeling increased urgency to reopen the government as airlines were forced to cut more than 1,000 flights, government workers remained unpaid and food aid was delayed for millions of people. Thune pleaded with Democrats as he opened the Senate on Friday to “end these weeks of misery.”

It was unclear what may happen next. Thune was keeping the Senate in session over the weekend as a group of moderate Democrats worked on a possible compromise proposal. President Donald Trump called on the Senate to stay in town “until they have a Deal to end the Democrat Shutdown.”

Moderates continue to negotiate

As leaders of the two parties disagreed, the small group of Democrats led by New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen continued to negotiate among themselves and with rank-and-file Republicans on a deal that would end the shutdown.

The group has been discussing for weeks a vote for a series of bills that would pay for parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things — and extend funding for everything else until December or January. The three annual spending bills that would likely be included are the product of bipartisan negotiations that have continued through the shutdown.

But the contours of that agreement would only come with the promise of a future health care vote, rather than a guarantee that Affordable Care Act subsidies are extended by the end of the year. Many Democrats have said that’s unacceptable.

Still, Republican leaders only need five additional votes to fund the government, and the group involved in the talks has ranged from 10 to 12 Democratic senators.

“Unfortunately the Republicans made it very clear that they were not going to go along with the offer that Senator Schumer put on the floor, so we need another path forward,” Shaheen said Friday evening as she left a meeting with the other moderates. “We’re working on it.”

Republicans eye new package of bills

Trump urged Republicans at a White House breakfast Wednesday to end the shutdown quickly and scrap the legislative filibuster, which requires 60 Senate votes for most legislation, so they can bypass Democrats altogether.

“I am totally in favor of terminating the filibuster, and we would be back to work within 10 minutes after that vote took place,” Trump said Friday.

Republicans have emphatically rejected Trump’s call, and Thune has instead been eyeing a bipartisan package that mirrors the proposal the moderate Democrats have been sketching out. But it unclear what Thune, who has refused to negotiate, would promise on health care.

The package would replace the House-passed legislation that the Democrats have now rejected fourteen times. That bill would only extend government funding until Nov. 21, a date that is rapidly approaching after six weeks of inaction.

A choice for Democrats

A test vote on new legislation could come in the next few days if Thune decides to move forward.

Then Democrats would have a crucial choice to make: Do they keep fighting for a meaningful deal on extending the subsidies that expire in January, while prolonging the pain of the shutdown? Or do they vote to reopen the government and hope for the best as Republicans promise an eventual health care vote, but not a guaranteed outcome?

After a caucus meeting Thursday, most Democrats suggested they would continue to hold out for Trump and Republican leaders to agree to negotiations.

“That’s what leaders do,” said Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M. “You have the gavel, you have the majority, you have to bring people together.”

Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said Democrats are “obviously not unanimous” but “without something on health care, the vote is very unlikely to succeed.”

Johnson delivers setback to bipartisan talks

Democrats are facing pressure from unions eager for the shutdown to end and from allied groups that want them to hold firm. Many Democrats have argued that the wins for Democrats on Election Day show voters want them to continue the fight until Republicans yield and agree to extend the health tax credits.

A vote on the health care subsidies “has got to mean something,” said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. “That means a commitment by the speaker of the House, that he will support the legislation, that the president will sign.”

But Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., made clear he will not make any commitments. “I’m not promising anybody anything,” Johnson said Thursday when asked if he could promise a vote on a health care bill.

Asylum Fee Notice

On October 30, 2025, a federal courtissued a temporary stay in Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project v. USCIS, halting implementation of the Annual Asylum Fee (AAF). As a result, USCIS has paused all related payment notices and instructions.

About the Asylum Fee

The AAF was introduced under theHR-1 Reconciliation Bill and outlined in a July 2025 Federal Register Notice. It would have applied to individuals with pending Form I-589 asylum applications for a full fiscal year. USCIS began issuing payment notices in early October, but those notices are now on hold.

Applicants who received AAF instructions should disregard them while the stay remains in effect. USCIS will not issue refunds for fees already paid; however, it recommends retaining receipts. Further guidance will be provided as litigation progresses.

Over 445,000 people have fled their homes in South Sudan this year alone according to the International Committee on the Red Cross.
South Sudan also faces an acute food insecurity crisis, largely driven by escalating conflict.
USCRI urges the Administration to immediately reverse the TPS termination for South Sudan and instead provide an 18-month extension and redesignation.
For more, see USCRI’s piece, “Navigating Instability: A Country Conditions Overview of South Sudan” published in September 2025.","Arlington, VA — November 7, 2025 — The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI) is deeply alarmed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for South Sudan, effective January 5, 2026. This decision undermines both the humanitarian purpose of the TPS program and the United States’ longstanding commitment to protecting individuals from returning to life-threatening conditions.

DHS justified the termination by asserting that South Sudan no longer faces armed conflict posing serious risks to returning nationals. Yet, just last week on October 29, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan warned in an address to the United Nations (UN) General Assembly that “once again, civilians are being bombarded, women are being raped, children are being displaced and forcefully recruited into combat roles, and entire communities are living in fear…” The Commission underscored that South Sudan’s “political transition is falling apart” and that the “peace agreement’s key provisions are being systematically violated.”

As fighting intensifies, South Sudan remains in a dire humanitarian and displacement crisis. Over 445,000 people have fled their homes in South Sudan this year alone according to the International Committee on the Red Cross. Over 2.3 million refugees from South Sudan have sought safety in neighboring countries and more than 1.4 million others remain internally displaced.

South Sudan also faces an acute food insecurity crisis, largely driven by escalating conflict. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report released November 4 found that over 7.5 million people in the country will likely face crisis or worse levels of hunger between April to July 2026 (see more about IPC’s Classification system here). The UN has warned that without urgent humanitarian assistance in affected areas of South Sudan, the food and nutrition crisis will only deepen.

Using the fact that South Sudan has not yet plunged back into “full-scale civil war” as justification for this termination is fundamentally inconsistent with the statutory purpose and intent of the TPS program. Treating a fragile and rapidly deteriorating peace as evidence of conditions for safe return ignores the worsening conditions that would place returning South Sudanese nationals at extreme risk of harm, violence, persecution, and life-threatening insecurity.

USCRI urges the Administration to immediately reverse the TPS termination for South Sudan and instead provide an 18-month extension and redesignation. We further call on Congress and the Administration to reaffirm U.S. leadership in protecting displaced persons and upholding humanitarian principles at a time when lives hang in the balance.

“The facility is privately owned by MTC and is already properly zoned for use as a prison or an ICE facility.
Many attenders spoke against not just having a detention center in the vicinity, but also about the impact of social harms of the crackdown.
And it’s so obviously politically driven.” Marlis Dinning said what she heard at the town hall about the possible detention center was disturbing.
But she vowed to participate in the mounting community pressure to keep the detention center at bay.","In an Arizona town where farmers have long wrested a living off the arid land, reports that a former prison complex may be turned into an immigration detention center have sparked a fierce backlash, with residents seeing the potential transition as the latest undesirable symbol of the Trump administration’s massive escalation of immigration enforcement.

The facility in Marana, a town of about 63,700 people located north of Tucson, sprawls across a flat expanse of desert studded with scrubby bushes and hardy trees. It was shuttered almost two years ago, and the Management and Training Corporation, the private company that owns it, informed the town manager of company plans to operate a detention center in the prison.

During a town hall meeting on 23 October, residents crowded into a school auditorium to learn more from representatives of local government and advocacy organizations about the plan. Many attenders spoke against the jailing of immigrants amid Donald Trump’s crusade to deport as many undocumented immigrants as possible.

Karla Jones, one of the attenders, said she abhorred the idea of having a nearby detention center to hold immigrants – whose only crime in many cases is lacking US legal status, a civil offense – for extended periods of time. “That’s breaking up families,” she said. “And it’s people who are paying taxes, it’s people who are working. So I don’t want my community to support that.”

Federal legislation passed in July provided $45bn for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to build more detention centers for adults and children as part of a larger $75bn, four-year package for the federal agency. To vastly increase detention capacity, the federal government is relying heavily on for-profit private companies that run prisons.

The Utah-based Management and Training Corporation (MTC) is one of those companies. MTC built the Marana prison in the mid-1990s, when the population in the then largely farming community was about 2,000. It was the first private prison in the state.

In 2013, Arizona bought the prison for $150,000. In December 2023, the state – citing high costs and a decreasing incarcerated population – closed it. This past summer, after Arizona lawmakers rejected a bill that would have leased the prison for $1 a year to the federal government for use as an immigration detention center – MTC paid the state $15m to get it back.

Marana’s town manager, Terry Rozema, said there was little the town could do to prevent the use of the building complex as a detention center. “The facility is privately owned by MTC and is already properly zoned for use as a prison or an ICE facility. As such, the town doesn’t have authority to restrict its future use as long as it meets current zoning,” Rozema said in an emailed statement.

Emily Lawhead, MTC’s director of communications, declined an interview but wrote in an email that the company was “in discussions with several public agencies that may have a need for additional bed space”. ICE did not respond to questions regarding plans to use the onetime prison, but an agency spokesperson cited the need for “greater detention capacity” due to “a significant number of arrests”.

MTC already operates five immigration detention centers in California, New Mexico and Texas.

Its record in Arizona is spotty. In 2015, the state canceled a contract with the company after a riot at a prison it operated in the town of Kingman left more than a dozen incarcerated people and guards injured. A subsequent investigation by the Arizona department of corrections concluded that the company had “a culture of disorganization, disengagement and disregard” for state policies. MTC did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about those allegations, but the company has previously described the investigation’s findings as flawed.

Jennifer Allen, a member of the board of supervisors for Pima county, where Marana is located, said that given reports about the poor conditions facing ICE detainees across the country, she and her constituents were concerned about the treatment of people in the Marana facility if it were to be converted and about oversight of the facility. She criticized the federal government for showering immigration enforcement with resources while simultaneously cutting funding for social safety net programs for older adults, children and other vulnerable populations.

At the town hall, the federal government received plenty of criticism for its aggressive immigration agenda. Many attenders spoke against not just having a detention center in the vicinity, but also about the impact of social harms of the crackdown. Some residents brought signs bearing the slogan “Stop the kidnappings, protect your neighbors”, alluding to forceful arrests of immigrants in their homes, at work and in the streets.

Speaking to the crowd, Tucson resident Maximiliano Torres likened the Trump administration’s detention and deportation campaign to Arizona’s 2010 Senate Bill 1070, commonly known as the “show me your papers” law that empowered police to conduct immigration enforcement. Although police can still inquire about immigration status, it’s no longer required because courts have largely struck down the law as unconstitutional.

Recalling the law’s impact, Torres told the crowd: “They turned [crossing the border without authorization] into a criminal act, so they could justify putting those people in prison and forcing the federal government to pay private prisons.”

While Trump has repeatedly promised immigration enforcement efforts would be focused on undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, statistics show that those being held in detention are primarily people without criminal convictions. As of September, 71.5% of the 59,762 immigrants in detention had no criminal conviction, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Many convictions involved traffic violations and other minor offenses.

Under the Biden administration, immigrants with strong community ties and no serious brushes with the law would generally be released and be asked to check in with ICE periodically, since the government prioritized deporting people with criminal convictions, said Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Center. “Now everybody gets arrested, everybody gets detained,” she said.

The Trump administration has significantly expanded mandatory detention to keep immigrants in confinement during proceedings to remove them from the country, she said. “More and more often, people are just giving up and agreeing to be deported instead of sitting in jail trying to fight their case,” the attorney said.

In Marana, resident Tom Flynn left the town hall clutching one of the protest signs. He detests the possibility of an immigrant detention center in his town. “No 1, it’s morally objectionable,” he said. “No 2, it’s a detriment to the overall economy; it reduces the number of people who have been in the area, it depresses home values. And it’s so obviously politically driven.”

Marlis Dinning said what she heard at the town hall about the possible detention center was disturbing. “It seems like all of this has happened behind closed doors,” she said. She’s against the detention of immigrants, many of them asylum seekers who entered the country legally, and who now “have no way to get citizenship”, she said.

After the town hall, Jones was feeling quite unsettled by the overall discussion. But she vowed to participate in the mounting community pressure to keep the detention center at bay. “I really hope we can stop it from opening,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea6ca7745394f7b42e0ad23f76fb29c64e185b2/589_0_3829_3063/master/3829.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bb7ee7af30c547b3951f87cc7eeff14",N,,2025-11-07 17:01:17.752291

8 ICE arrests documented within 5 hours by grassroots organization

Within five hours Wednesday, eight ICE arrests in Hampton Bays and Westhampton Beach were documented by Islip Forward, a group that tracks ICE activity.

One video shows federal agents with guns drawn entering a Colombian bakery, handcuffing a patron and escorting him away. Another video taken about an hour and a half later shows a man laying on the ground on the side of a road, surrounded by ICE agents, before being loaded into a vehicle and driven off.

""We have seen agents now grab folks out of delis and small businesses, operate in public spaces,"" said Islip Forward founder Ahmed Perez, ""and what this has done ... is instill fear in immigrant communities, people who are already scared of leaving their homes.""

CBS News New York asked ICE about this week's targeted enforcement in the Hamptons and has not yet heard back.

Several business owners who spoke to CBS News New York said the presence of masked agents on and off since Jan. 20 is having a chilling effect.

""It's, like, crazy now. Nobody come over here now. Everything slow,"" Hampton Bays Market manager Enrique Ruuz said. ""Nobody buy nothing. Nobody want to go outside.""

Hamptons homeowners have mixed feelings about ICE raids

ICE has reported conducting specific operations in the New York/Long Island area, which they say so far includes the arrests of about 250 individuals with alleged criminal histories.

Homeowners in Hampton Bays have mixed feelings about the increased ICE activity.

""I'm not happy about ICE raids because I don't like to see people being treated badly,"" homeowner Sandra Randle said.

""People who have committed crimes in other countries or people who have committed crimes in this country who are not citizens of this country don't belong here,"" said another homeowner, who didn't want to share his name.

The precise warehouses that Immigration and Customs Enforcement may buy have not yet been determined, but the agency is looking at locations in the southern U.S. near airports where immigrants are most often deported, the DHS official and the White House official said. Selecting such warehouses would “increase efficiency” in deportations, the DHS official said.

A deal to purchase the warehouses, which on average are more than twice the size of current ICE detention facilities, is past the early stages but not yet final, the DHS official and the White House official said. The DHS official described the warehouses as future “mega detention centers.”

Amazon would not be a part of any deal and would not profit from it as the warehouses were built by developers for Amazon but never used or leased by the company, the officials said.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company is not involved in any discussions with DHS or ICE about warehouse space and that it leases and does not own the vast majority of its warehouse space.

It was not immediately clear who owns the warehouses that the government may buy and the DHS official and the White House official did not know how much the deals could be worth. The DHS official said some of the warehouses under consideration were built by developers with Amazon in mind but never used.

Any decision on whether to use such warehouses, or how many, has not yet been finalized, the DHS official said.

The White House referred all questions on the matter to DHS and ICE. DHS and ICE did not respond to comment.

Purchasing large warehouses would be the latest in a series of unconventional — and at times contentious — ideas in the Trump administration’s search for immigrant detention space. The plans underscore ICE’s ambitions to ramp up its detainment of immigrants on a large scale.

ICE has struggled to hit daily arrest quotas and fill hiring goals, and some of its senior leaders are being replaced amid White House frustrations.

Amazon warehouses range in size, averaging approximately 800,000 square feet. The largest is in Wilmington, Delaware, at 3.8 million square feet. By comparison, an ICE detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, houses 1,500 immigrants in 277,000 square feet.

The White House official said ICE would pay for the warehouses with funds from the budget reconciliation package that President Donald Trump signed earlier this year and calls the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

The warehouses would be owned by ICE outright and not contracted through the private prison industry or states, as is the case with other facilities, the DHS official and the White House official said.

If the purchases are finalized, the idea is for ICE to convert the warehouses into detention facilities and likely run them with its own employees, not contractors or military personnel, the DHS official and the White House official said. Prior to the current administration, most ICE detention facilities were run by private prison contractors that both owned and staffed the building with federal funding.

An NBC News poll released earlier this month noted that 51% of voters said the Trump administration has lived up to their expectations on border security and immigration, while 44% said it fell short of their expectations. In addition, 39% of registered voters said they view ICE favorably, while 50% said they view it unfavorably. A Pew Research Center survey from this summer noted, “the Trump administration’s overall approach to immigration is viewed more negatively than positively, with 42% approving and 47% disapproving,” adding the sentiment was largely split along party lines.

Since Trump retook office in January, after campaigning on a promise of mass deportations of immigrants, his administration has tried different approaches to detention facilities, with varied success.

Trump charged the military earlier this year with holding immigrants in tents at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but the plan to hold tens of thousands of immigrants there did not materialize.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250908-chicago-ICE-shield-badge-ac-1025p-7de36a.jpg",N,,2025-11-07 16:04:10.637513

To the chagrin of U.S. allies and rights advocates alike, the U.S. seat sat empty as the council president sought input from the United States — once a stalwart participant and defender of human rights worldwide — as it came up for its turn part of regular review of all U.N. member states.

Council members expressed regret that the United States didn't take part, called on the council president to urge the U.S. to resume its cooperation, and moved to reschedule the U.S. review next year: Such a review can't take place without the “concerned country” taking part. Honduras faced its review earlier in the day Friday.

There's no indication whether the Trump administration would take part next year either. The U.S. already announced in September that it would sit out Friday's review.

The American Civil Liberties Union, an advocacy group, said the Trump administration was ""setting a dangerous example that will further weaken universal human rights at home and abroad,” and pointed to rights concerns in the United States.

“From the discrimination and violence inflicted in the ICE raids, to the attacks on free speech of protesters and journalists, to the deployment of the National Guard in American cities when no crisis exists, the world is watching the United States government attacking the constitutional and human rights of its own people,” said Chandra Bhatnagar, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The council examines the rights records of all 193 U.N. member countries about every four or five years. This was to be the fourth such review of the United States since the 47-member country council was created two decades ago.

Israel, in 2013, became the only other country to reject the council's review process — but ended up taking part nine months later, council officials have said.

U.S. President Donald Trump in February issued an executive order announcing that the United States was withdrawing from the council.

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is setting the record straight on a misleading viral video from Massachusetts of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrest of Juliana Milena Ojeda-Montoya, a criminal illegal alien from Ecuador who in August repeatedly stabbed her coworker with scissors and then threw a trash can at her victim.

On November 6, 2025, ICE conducted a targeted operation to arrest Ojeda-Montoya, a criminal illegal alien who entered the country under the Biden administration. During ICE's targeted vehicle stop of Ojeda-Montoya, her child and husband were in the car. The child was seated in the lap of the mother in the front seat of the car—recklessly endangering the child. The child was not in the safety of a car seat.

Juliana Milena Ojeda-Montoya

Officers informed Ojeda-Montoya they had a warrant for her arrest and requested she give the child to her husband, Carlos Zapata Rivera. She refused until the moment her husband purported to have a medical episode. Her husband, also an illegal alien from Ecuador, refused medical help and displayed absolutely no signs of medical concerns just moments later. ICE called 911 but the illegal alien refused any medical care.

Despite ICE law enforcement officers’ several attempts to deescalate the situation and repeated requests that the father take custody of the child, both parents stated they were willing to put the child into state custody. Once Zapata Rivera realized he would be arrested for immigration violations if he did not agree to take custody of the child, he suddenly decided to be a good father and left with the child.

During the arrest, Ojeda-Montoya resisted, and a crowd of agitators formed. Some of these agitators began shouting obscenities, death threats, and antisemitic remarks at officers including:

""You probably support Israel too...you look like a Jew... I bet you are a f***ing Jew.”

“I'm going to remember those eyes...I'm going to find you... I'm going to come for you... I know you probably have kids... We're going to kill you and your kids... I am going to shoot all of you.”

“Once again, the media ran with a FALSE narrative about our brave ICE law enforcement officers. As usual, here’s the REAL story: ICE targeted a known criminal who repeatedly stabbed her coworker,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Medical personnel found there was no legitimate medical emergency. He was even caught on video on his feet and coherent moments later. Our law enforcement officers requested the father take custody of the child, but he refused. He quickly decided to leave with the child once he realized if he didn’t take custody ICE would arrest him for an immigration violation.”

On February 22, 2023, the U.S. Border Patrol arrested Ojeda-Montoya after she illegally entered the United States near Lukeville, Arizona. She was later released into our communities under the Biden administration in March of the same year. Ojeda-Montoya was transported to Cumberland County Jail in Scarborough, Maine and will remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.
