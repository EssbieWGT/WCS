St. Susanna's pastor, Fr. Stephen Josoma, and the archbishop have been at odds over the ""ICE was here"" nativity scene that the parish's Pax Christi group erected at the beginning of Advent last month.

The archdiocese criticized the scene, which includes a sign saying the Holy Family is ""safe in the sanctuary of our church,"" as ""divisive political messaging."" The statement added: ""The display should be removed and the manger restored to its proper sacred purpose.""

Josoma says the scene is meant to depict ""Incarnation, 2025,"" adding: ""It reflects the context that Jesus would be coming into if he were born today.""

After the archdiocese issued its statement Dec. 5, Josoma said the display would remain as-is until he has a conversation with the archbishop. Josoma said in a telephone interview Dec. 16 that he hoped that would happen in the next couple of days.

He said there's ""no animosity"" between him and Henning and that he looks forward to the conversation.

Terrence Donilon, the spokesman for the archdiocese, said on Dec. 19 that he had ""no update"" on the situation.

What's the truth of Christ's birth that we need to focus on today?

Just over a year after succeeding Cardinal Sean O'Malley, Henning has the chance to surprise his flock with an inspiring move: He could show up at St. Susanna's on Sunday, admit he was wrong to issue such a dismissive criticism, and learn more about what prompted the display in the first place.

A long shot? Probably. But maybe Henning is more inclined to listen than people give him credit for.

When he arrived at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross for his installation as archbishop of Boston last year, he was approached by survivors of clergy sexual abuse. They asked him if he would talk with them.

He approached them and said: ""I'm very sorry, I have to learn. I have to listen.""

His dustup with St. Susanna's presents Henning with a chance to do some of both. And there's nothing like an apology to serve as a gateway to getting at the truth.

That truth — of what this church's nativity scene is really about — brings us to a core principle of Catholic social teaching: subsidiarity.

Subsidiarity is the principle that decisions and actions should happen at the lowest, most local, competent level possible, with higher authorities only stepping in to offer support. That is especially relevant to a parish's work on behalf of immigrants in its midst along with the nativity scene it builds in front of its church.

Both the archdiocese and the parish have done considerable work on behalf of immigrants, with the archdiocese's Catholic Charities operation focused on issues of resettlement, housing and legal defense and the parish focused on support for individual immigrant families.

The parish also supports the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts known as LUCE, which helps warn undocumented people of possible raids by ICE.

A sign beneath the empty crib in the parish nativity sign reads: ""If you see ICE please call LUCE at 617-370-5023.""

The idea of a nativity scene is to help believers imagine as much of the truth of Christ's birth as possible.

Historians trace the first nativity scene to 1223, when St. Francis is said to have set one up in Italy. As Slate reported in 2012:

… The only historical account we have of Francis' nativity scene comes from The Life of St. Francis of Assisi by St. Bonaventure, a Franciscan monk who was born five years before Francis' death.

According to Bonaventure's biography, St. Francis got permission from Pope Honorious III to set up a manger with hay and two live animals — an ox and an ass — in a cave in the Italian village of Grecio. He then invited the villagers to come gaze upon the scene while he preached about ""the babe of Bethlehem.""

The Gospels of Luke and Matthew provide limited accounts of Christ's birth, but each provides some basis for St. Susanna's embellishments. Luke reports that, with no room in the inn, the family was turned away. Matthew casts the Holy Family as refugees, hoping to escape the scourge of King Herod.

Those two Gospels were written 80 to 90 years after Christ's birth, of course, so it's best to look to them more for symbolic truths as opposed to historical fact.

St. Susanna's has explored those truths in various ways in recent years, creating nativity scenes highlighting the climate crisis (Jesus floating in water filled with plastic bottles), family separation (Jesus in a cage) and gun violence (a list of mass shootings).

All of which sets the stage for a discussion Henning could have with the parishioners of St. Susanna's: What's the truth of Christ's birth that we need to focus on today?

What have parishioners heard from people who may be undocumented and fear being picked up by ICE? What are some of the ways parishioners are working with immigrants? How might the archdiocese be more helpful to those efforts?

Earlier this month, Henning visited four parishes in the archdiocese as part of a novena to Our Lady of Guadalupe, often regarded as the spiritual guardian of migrants. Why not pay a visit to St. Susanna's with that same inspiration in mind?

Henning chaired the committee that drafted the statement about ICE enforcement that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued Nov. 12 at their meeting in Baltimore. He's the lead voice in a video montage of bishops speaking up on behalf of immigrants:

As pastors, we the bishops of the United States are bound to our people by ties of communion and compassion in our Lord Jesus Christ. And we are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement.

In its editorial following the bishops' statement last month, NCR asked: ""What about real action?""

The parishioners of St. Susanna's have been taking real action. Their bishop should go learn from them.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-12/12.21.25%20Ice%20was%20here.JPG?h=82f92a78&itok=4Zjzv2wB,N,,2025-12-21 10:57:03.547040

Once detained, immigrants are held without a sentence, without knowing when they might be released or deported.","One in a series detailing how Trump's immigration policies are transforming America.

It was a Trump-era international love story: Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Girl gets detained by ICE.

But the detention of the Lithuania-born Tatjana Vesiolko is an unusual one, even in an era of increasingly strict immigration enforcement. She is entering her 11th month in an immigration lock-up. Al Dallasta, her American fiancé, can't understand why.

""She's essentially lost a year of her life for what?"" Dallasta said of his partner – a billiards champ, slender with a chestnut bob who friends call ""Tia"" for short. ""She's falling apart in there.""

The day President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, he signed seven executive orders that set the stage for a surge in immigration enforcement across the country. Vesiolko was among the first to be swept up in the administration's mass deportation campaign.

The Trump administration is now detaining more immigrants than at any time since World War II. As of Nov. 30, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported a record 65,735 people in immigration detention.

Deportation flights have become more frequent. But the proportion and number of people like Vesiolko, detained longer than six months, is climbing.

Two years ago, according to ICE data, about 1,300 people or 4% of the detained population, had been held for more than 180 days. That number rose to 6,500 people, or 10% of the detained population, in November ‒ Vesiolko among them.

She entered on a visa waiver in 2009 and stayed, without permission. She has no criminal record, holds a valid Lithuanian passport and comes from a country that accepts its nationals. Immigration attorneys say there are no obvious barriers to her removal.

Provided with the details of her case, the Department of Homeland Security sent a statement: ""The delay of her removal was because of the illegal alien's potential inclusion as a member of a class action lawsuit.""

DHS didn't name the lawsuit or respond to USA TODAY's questions for clarification. Dallasta said Vesiolko was never told she might part of a lawsuit, nor was she given a chance to opt out.

Vesiolko's prolonged detention may also be ""a symptom of ICE working in overdrive,"" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for immigration restrictions.

""There is no question that ICE and its partners have been making more arrests than can be efficiently processed for removal,"" she said. ""It sounds like a case of someone who slipped through the cracks.""

Vesiolko, desperate to be out by Christmas, decided to share her story. She spoke to USA TODAY by phone: ""Is this just a mean mistake?"" she asked. ""Have they lost my file?""

Boy meets girl

Before he met Vesiolko, Dallasta, born and raised in Philadelphia, believed a few things with certainty.

That the Eagles are the greatest team in the National Football League. That he would never live on the New Jersey side of the Pennsylvania state line. That he wouldn't likely travel abroad. He had no reason to.

He was a year out of a 14-year marriage that ended in divorce when he logged on to Facebook Dating in 2024.

He and Vesiolko exchanged messages for a few days until she fell silent. Assuming she was done with him, he sent a farewell message telling her she was beautiful and wishing her luck. They met that same night for a date at a Chickie & Pete's pub in New Jersey.

For the next six months, they were inseparable – until agents detained Vesiolko at the airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The couple was returning from their first vacation together. It was Valentine's Day.

He vividly recalls her being pulled aside at the airport: the shock, and the foregone conclusion, when a federal agent told him Vesiolko would be deported. They imagined she would be headed to Lithuania within days.

At home, without her, he broke down crying in the kitchen. She had left him a Valentine's card.

He read it alone.

""There are so many paths life can take,"" she wrote. ""The fact that you and I found each other in a whole world of people is not a coincidence.""

The cost of detention is counted in many ways

Vesiolko has now spent 311 days in custody.

The months have been hard on both of them. Vesiolko, 38, struggles to keep her spirits up; she was a runner and now gets precious little time outside. Dallasta, 43, battles anxiety, which has worsened with Vesiolko's detention. He recently resigned from his job as a safety associate for a major home improvement chain.

With no end in sight to his fiancé's detention, Dallasta tallied up the personal financial costs.

Some $22,000 in fees to immigration attorneys. Another $2,000 in commissary costs. Precisely $6,370 in phone calls to the detention center. His life savings.

Vesiolko counts the costs in holidays missed, dinners she didn't cook, trips they didn't take. And the guilt of what her detention has done to Dallasta.

Her detention is also costing American taxpayers.

The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute calculates that immigration detention costs an average of $152 per detainee, per day. ICE data shows detainees with immigration violations and no criminal record are spending, on average, 48 days in detention.

Past presidential administrations had focused immigration enforcement on violent criminals. Though Trump promised to arrest ""the worst of the worst,"" the mass deportation effort has put all immigrants here without legal documentation at risk for detention and deportation.

After her arrest in Puerto Rico, Vesiolko was sent to Richwood Correctional Center in northern Louisiana.

Over the ensuing months, she made bids to stay in the United States. Because she had entered on a waiver – and such visitors are held to a higher standard of conduct – she was ineligible for bond. ICE didn't respond to her request for humanitarian parole, Dallasta said.

One immigration judge denied her asylum claim, and another issued a final order of removal in June.

She didn't fight it. Dallasta mailed in her passport to ICE.

Dallasta planned to meet her in Lithuania. They imagined a new life in Europe, marrying and applying for Vesiolko to return to the United States as the spouse of an American.

""Before all this happened, I knew I wanted to be with her,"" Dallasta said.

Hope and 'habeas'

Sunday, Dec. 21, marks 180 days from the day her final deportation order took effect. It's also the day the law cracks open a window to potential relief.

Immigration attorneys say Vesiolko could now file what's known as a ""habeas"" petition, a formal legal request asking a court to review the legality of her detention. She doesn't have a lawyer – they're both nearly out of money now – and she has pleaded with her deportation officer to let her buy her own ticket home.

""When people volunteer to pay their own ticket, and they don't have a crime, there's no reason they're not on that commercial airline,"" headed to their native country, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who is not involved in her case.

Under the law, immigration detention operates outside the norms of criminal incarceration.

Immigrants can be detained, indefinitely, without charge. They may hire an attorney but don't have access to government-appointed representation. Once detained, immigrants are held without a sentence, without knowing when they might be released or deported. Immigration judges, which the Trump administration has started calling ""deportation judges,"" are hired and can be fired.

But habeas petitions are a long shot in Louisiana right now, said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. Judges often allow the government to say, ""We're working on it,"" and immigrants remain detained, sometimes for months longer.

Ahmed said detention is key to the Trump administration's messaging. ""This is about, 'If you dare come, you better expect you will be subjected to punishment.'""

In response to a request about Vesiolko's extended detention, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told USA TODAY immigrants have the option to ""self-deport.""

The administration's self-deportation campaign, featuring $1,000 bonuses to immigrants who leave willingly, began in early March, after Vesiolko was detained.

'I have a life out of here'

Vesiolko arrived in America from Moscow with $100 in her pocket and the knowledge that her father – a veteran of Russia's armed forces who hated the United States – would never forgive her.

""When I came here, my father found out and I was scared to go back,"" she said. ""He is a very radical Russian, against America. Everything about America triggers him. I had nowhere to go back.""

She had grown up in Moscow, with her father, his family and her Lithuanian mother.

At age 21, after her parents' messy divorce, she fled to New Jersey, where a friend had relocated. She learned American English.

The years snowballed. Vesiolko worked as a housekeeper, under the table. (Homeland Security noted, ""She freely admitted to being in the country illegally and never filing taxes."") She joined a local pool league, made friends and built an American life.

""Every bar with a pool table, people know me,"" she said.

When she met Dallasta for a first date, she asked him to meet her at a pub where she didn't think she'd run into people she knew.

""But right away, friends spotted me and said, 'Hey pool shark! Be careful with her!' It was a funny first date.""

Now they talk five times a day on pricey detention center phone lines and via 30-cents-per-minute video calls.

She calls Dallasta ""sweet cheeks."" When he started calling her ""freckles,"" she taught him the Russian. Now he says, 'Good night, moya venushka."" My little freckle.

""He reminds me that I have a future,"" she said. ""That I have a life out of here. He reminds me that I am loved.""

The months have dragged on.

Vesiolko has watched other immigrant women come and go, be released or deported. Most of the ones detained long-term with her are there, she says, because they are fighting to stay in the United States. She isn't.

Without knowing how much longer she'll be inside, how much longer before she'll see Dallasta face to face, she holds on to an idea from her mother's Catholicism.

That the seemingly endless detention is a penance.

""If that's the price I pay for being with the love of my life, I can pay that price,"" she said. ""Because I know, after this, I'm going to be so happy.""

Those who help people navigate the nation’s convoluted immigration system say the administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants has brought them a rush of new clients even as it has made it harder to help them.

“It’s a whole different world top to bottom,” said John “Jack” Pinnix, a longtime Raleigh immigration attorney and former national president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA). “It was never a good climate because of a poor court system and horrible backlogs. All that existed before Trump, but Trump has exacerbated it incredibly. It’s a lot nastier, too.”

Immigration law is not among the most lucrative legal practices. Many lawyers in the field do it out of sense of service. But that commitment also adds to the tension as some of their clients face deportation and family separations.

“The stress level is just out of sight,” Pinnix said. “You can’t get some immigration cases out of your mind. You lose one of those and the family is gone.”

Andres Lopez, a Charlotte immigration attorney who works out of the same building that houses the state’s only federal immigration court, said he feels that stress daily. Lopez, who came to the U.S. as a child and is a naturalized citizen, said, “It’s a secondary trauma” to represent clients in a system that now seems intent on deporting as many people as possible.

“We have to represent clients who are fleeing for their lives from situations that are awful. To see clients be dehumanized, humiliated, it certainly has an emotional effect on you as an attorney,” he said.

The Trump administration has fired about 100 of 715 immigration judges, who are employed by the U.S. Department of Justice. Some have been replaced by military judges who are less familiar with immigration law and less inclined to rule against the administration as it seeks to ramp up deportations.

“This administration cares more about numbers than they care about justice,” Lopez said. “It’s all about power, in a way it’s about abusing power and getting away with it.”

Jeremy McKinney, a Greensboro immigration attorney and also a former AILA president, said all areas of the immigration system are now focused on cracking down on undocumented immigrants.

“It’s never been worse because they have turned all the different facets of immigration into one big enforcement apparatus,” he said.

McKinney said federal immigration officers are approaching civil violations with criminal intensity as they round up people suspected of being in the nation illegally.

“You don’t apply force, you don’t need to carry assault rifles, you don’t need to cause traffic accidents to enforce a civil code,” he said. “This is all complete insanity.”

A recent sweep by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents in the greater Charlotte led to the arrest of more than 425 people. McKinney said the numbers would have been higher if immigration advocacy groups and immigration attorneys had not pushed back.

“My goodness, our bar, we have filed dozens and dozens of lawsuits against the federal government challenging their actions,” he said. “At this point, I think my office has sued the federal government at least once a week for the last seven weeks.”

President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” provides billions of additional dollars for immigration law enforcement. But McKinney thinks having masked agents who refuse to identify themselves round up people who are not criminals and sometimes are U.S. citizens can’t continue.

“It’s completely unacceptable to have renegade, masked secret police roaming our streets,” he said. “It’s fundamentally un-American. I think that most people are not going to put up with it anymore.”

What needs to be done, he said, is “Congress has to figure out how to do hard things again” and reform the nation’s immigration laws. Rights need to be clarified, case backlogs cut, paths to citizenship opened and immigration quotas adjusted.

“Somewhere down the line there’s got to be enough of a consensus that we can fix this system and protect the American people and protect American jobs and still be pro-businesses and get this done,” McKinney said. “There has just got to be the willpower to do it.”",https://www.charlotteobserver.com/public/latest-news/w89s40/picture312963722/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/CLT_BORDER_MONDAY_05.JPG,N,,2025-12-21 09:57:16.003241

ICE stated that “one death occurred on December 12, two more on December 14, and the fourth on December 15,” adding that two people died of natural causes, while the other two died of medical complications.

This is the highest number since 2004. The news, confirmed by an ICE press release, has reopened the debate on the conditions in which immigrants are detained while awaiting trial or deportation.

ICE stated that “one death occurred on December 12, two more on December 14, and the fourth on December 15,” adding that two people died of natural causes, while the other two died of medical complications. They are Jean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old Haitian who was arrested by ICE on December 11 and died the next day at Delaney Hall in Newark; Nenko Stanev Gantchev, a 56-year-old Bulgarian who died at the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin, Michigan; Delvin Francisco Rodriguez, a 39-year-old Nicaraguan detained in Natchez, Mississippi; and Fouad Saeed Abdulkadir, a 46-year-old Eritrean who died at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania.

The increase in deaths is mainly due to overcrowding. There are currently around 66,000 people (a record number) being held in relatively small facilities scattered across the United States. ICE lists 131 official centers, but data suggests that between 190 and 400 are being used, including state and local jails and private prisons. Detainees often find themselves without beds, showers, adequate medical care, or quality food because the network is not equipped to accommodate thousands of immigrants every day. The lack of oversight makes the situation even worse. The Trump administration has closed at least two federal agencies that were responsible for oversight and continues to claim that “detainees are in good conditions.”

“There has been NO spikes in deaths,” Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Post. “As bed space has expanded, we have maintained higher standard of care than most prisons that hold U.S. citizens—including providing access to proper medical care.”

Representatives of human rights non-profits, lawyers for some detained immigrants, and several congressmen denounce the deterioration of these facilities. “Four detainee deaths in one week is a red-hot crisis,” commented Eunice Cho, senior counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project.",https://lavocedinewyork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ice.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 10:56:55.010855

Since seeking asylum in the United States in 2022, Mr. Singh has clocked tens of thousands of miles hauling his 53-foot trailer.
‘It’s Just What We as Sikhs Do’ The Sikh entry into American trucking began in the 1980s.
The Department of Transportation crackdown is a frequent topic among Sikh drivers on weekends at Mr. Laut’s gurdwara, a Sikh house of worship.
“Trucking has now become an immigration issue, not a true safety issue,” said Ms. Kaur, who comes from a Sikh trucking family.","The phone vibrated just as Arash Singh curled onto a mattress in the sleeper cab of his semi truck parked in a lot off Interstate 5 in Northern California. As on most evenings, his parents were calling at the start of their day in a tiny village in Punjab, India.

“It’s winter almost. Please always wear a coat,” his mother gently implored on the video call. Mr. Singh nodded into the glow of the screen, before receiving their prayers.

His parents, followers of the Sikh faith, asked God to protect their son on his drive of more than 1,000 miles from Pasco, Wash., to Oxnard, Calif. Seventeen hours, if traffic was light.

“I will be safe,” Mr. Singh assured his mother.

It was an assurance the 25-year-old long-haul truck driver had given himself during his most stressful days on the road. Since coming to the United States a few years ago, Mr. Singh has navigated the perils of America’s highways: the drivers who veer into his lane while texting, ice storms in the Midwest, fellow truckers whose gazes linger on his turban.

Mr. Singh has had more on his mind these days than he would like. Driving a truck is a solitary job, but Sikhs suddenly feel very much in the public eye. While estimates vary, around a quarter of Sikh adults in the United States work in the trucking industry, according to the North American Punjabi Trucking Association, which advocates for Sikh truckers, and they are concentrated on the West Coast. Two fatal crashes since August involving Sikh truck drivers led to increased scrutiny by the Trump administration, which escalated a crackdown on immigrant drivers that had begun with new English-proficiency guidelines in the spring. Those crashes killed six people; one driver was charged with vehicular manslaughter and the other with both vehicular manslaughter and vehicular homicide.

After the first crash, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said foreign drivers without proper training or licenses were a longstanding problem. About 200,000 foreign drivers hold licenses that allow them to drive commercial vehicles. Mr. Duffy issued rules that would make it much harder for many immigrants to drive, amid ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations and persistent verbal attacks from President Trump on immigrants.

“We have a government system designed to keep American families on the road safe,” Mr. Duffy said when announcing the rules. “But that system has been compromised.”

In response, the California Department of Motor Vehicles told at least 17,000 truck drivers that their licenses were being revoked.

On the highways, Sikh drivers, who often wear distinctive turbans, have faced increased harassment since the crashes, said Raman Dhillon, chief executive of the North American Punjabi Trucking Association. His organization, too, has received hate-filled emails in recent months.

“You and your raggedy, reckless drivers need to go back to India,” read one. “You people need to get out of trucking,” said another.

“Everyone is not over here illegally and making mistakes and making the roads less safe,” said Mr. Dhillon, a former truck driver.

Mr. Singh had heard about all the political fuss from other drivers, but he still felt a heaviness when he opened an email on his phone one afternoon in early November.

“We regret to inform you,” it read, “that the D.M.V. will cancel your commercial driver’s license 60 days from the date of this letter.” Mr. Singh had followed the rules in applying for a temporary work permit and commercial license, but to keep his license, according to the letter, he now needed to provide “legal presence documents that meet new federal guidelines,” such as proof of permanent residency or citizenship. He had neither.

Since seeking asylum in the United States in 2022, Mr. Singh has clocked tens of thousands of miles hauling his 53-foot trailer. He has seen more of the United States through the windshield of his 18-wheeler than he had seen of his home country.

“Right now, I am stuck,” he said. “I want to work.”

Not long after he received the letter, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stayed the federal rules.

For now, at least, Mr. Singh could remain on the road.

‘It’s Just What We as Sikhs Do’

The Sikh entry into American trucking began in the 1980s.

Some followers of Sikhism, a minority religion whose adherents are concentrated in Punjab, India, have long pushed for a separate state. In 1984, tens of thousands of Sikhs began fleeing after a deadly dayslong Indian military operation against Sikh separatists and later anti-Sikh riots in the country. Fearing for their lives, many Sikhs joined relatives who had immigrated decades earlier to work the fields in the rich agricultural land of California’s Central Valley.

As American truckers retired, many of the recent transplants filled the void. Today, around 150,000 Sikhs work in the trucking industry in the United States.

For a long time, Dave Laut was one of them.

He arrived in California from Punjab in 2004 and joined his uncle, who was working as a driver.

He now runs a company called FBT in Bakersfield, an agriculture and oil-drilling city two hours north of Los Angeles. These days, his company employs around 380 drivers, more than 60 percent of them from Punjab. It has become a common migration pattern.

But since California began notifying drivers of revoked licenses, Mr. Laut said, he has lost more than 50 drivers. Many of them, he said, fear that immigration officials will stop them at truck stops or along interstates.

“These are great drivers, no accidents, but they are being targeted,” he said on a recent morning from his company’s headquarters, where idling trucks hummed on the 10-acre lot.

Mr. Laut gained his citizenship in 2010 and six years later cast his first presidential vote for Donald J. Trump. He liked Mr. Trump because he was also a businessman and voted for him twice more.

During the president’s first term, Mr. Laut thought the economy was strong and the country focused on lifting up workers. Now, he said, the administration appears to be going after the blue-collar workers who voted Mr. Trump into office.

The Department of Transportation crackdown is a frequent topic among Sikh drivers on weekends at Mr. Laut’s gurdwara, a Sikh house of worship.

“Everyone wants answers,” he said. “But we have few.”

In November, California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, joined more than a dozen other Democratic state attorneys general on a letter to Mr. Duffy. It argued that the proposed rules would disrupt the delivery of food, operation of construction equipment and other essential services, “raising costs and disrupting economic and other important activity across the nation.”

Chris Spear, president of the American Trucking Associations, the industry’s largest trade association, supports the proposed changes.

“If you are here illegally, you cannot have a commercial driver’s license. Period,” Mr. Spear said in a written statement.

The rules would also affect drivers who are legally in the country with pending asylum claims or temporary protected status. Even so, Mr. Spear said, those drivers pose a risk because it is difficult to obtain driving records from their home countries.

In 2021, the American Trucking Associations claimed the country needed 80,000 more drivers. But Mr. Spear said that shortage had largely evaporated. Recent figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that employment of truck drivers has increased around 15 percent since the pandemic. Fatalities from truck crashes last year declined about 11 percent from 2023, according to federal data.

“This is not about anyone’s background,” Mr. Spear said in the statement. “It’s about safety and compliance.”

But that’s not how Manpreet Kaur, a member of Bakersfield’s City Council, sees it.

“Trucking has now become an immigration issue, not a true safety issue,” said Ms. Kaur, who comes from a Sikh trucking family.

“People are scared,” Ms. Kaur said, “and this is yet another immigrant community being targeted.”

A Lonely Road

Mr. Singh clutched the wheel as he drove through miles of dense fog in Northern California. He was nearing the midway point of hauling 15 pallets of potatoes from Pasco to Oxnard.

Before the crashes, he drove across the country, heading east along Interstates 10 and 40. But these days, he avoids states, like Texas and Oklahoma, where he fears being stopped and questioned about his immigration status. Now, he mostly drives up and down the West Coast.

As he drove, Mr. Singh, slender and bookish, talked about his typical routine on the road. He starts most mornings with a cappuccino from Starbucks. To pass the time, he listens to audiobooks about Sikh history or calls a fellow long hauler to chat from his hands-free headset. He listens to his favorite Punjabi rapper, Sidhu Moose Wala, or his new favorite band, Guns N’ Roses.

He keeps the refrigerator in his cabin packed with rice and grilled vegetables from home, but sometimes stops at Indian spots catering to Punjabi truckers. On his rearview mirror hangs a photo of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh religious leader and militant killed in the operation in 1984.

Life on the road can be lonely — meals eaten alone, missed birthdays of relatives back in India. Recently, his father, who is saved in his phone as Dad with an accompanying red heart emoji, sent him a video from a Diwali celebration, and Mr. Singh played it on repeat.

“Every day, I miss my home, but it’s better here,” he said. “I can work and support my family. It’s safer for me here.”

He left Punjab in 2020, fearful he would be targeted by the Indian government. He supports creating a separate Sikh state, something the Indian government strongly opposes. He moved to London, where he worked in construction and improved his English.

In 2022, Mr. Singh flew to Mexico City, then made his way to the U.S. border. He crossed into Southern California and requested asylum, part of a huge influx of immigrants during the Biden administration.

He is often struck by the homeless encampments near highways. He knows that if he is unable to drive, he will be saddled with a truck loan he cannot pay off and limited work options.

As his truck barreled south down Interstate 5, Mr. Singh took the exit at Lost Hills to stop at one of his favorite Punjabi food trucks.

At a diesel pump, two drivers headed to Seattle filled up their tanks.

“You get the letter, brother?” Mr. Singh asked one.

“Yes, and him, too,” the driver said, gesturing to a trucker on the other side of the lot. “What are we supposed to do?”

Mr. Singh did not have an answer. He just wanted to grab a quick bite and get back on the road.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/09/00biz-sikh-truckers-2-46217-cover/00biz-sikh-truckers-2-46217-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 07:57:44.303704

In a statement, the Bush Center said turning away Afghans who assisted the United States runs counter to American values.

The criticism follows a shooting by Abdulrahman Lakanwal, a former Afghan soldier, involving members of the United States National Guard in Washington. In the wake of the incident, the Trump administration halted the granting of asylum and citizenship to migrants from Afghanistan and several other countries.

Lakanwal, who was relocated to the United States in 2021 under the Operation Allies Welcome programme along with his wife and five young children, has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of a National Guard service member.

The Bush Center stressed that the shooter alone is responsible for his actions and that others should not be punished as a result. It added that, like many Americans, Afghans particularly those resettled in the United States are outraged by the shooting.

Following the incident, the United States suspended immigration applications from Afghanistan and several other countries. The Bush Center said the decision means Afghans who assisted the United States but remain stranded in Afghanistan will not be issued travel visas, while the cases of thousands of refugees already in the country will be re-examined.

The statement said officials should focus on what could have been done to prevent the attack, rather than targeting Afghans as a group. It noted that US immigration policies have long required reform and that revisiting vetting procedures could form part of that effort.

The Bush Center said the United States should remember that one of its defining strengths is its history of offering refuge to the poor and the oppressed. It added that America’s values and commitment to freedom are why many Afghan men and women, following the September 11, 2001, attacks, took great risks to stand with the United States and continue to seek a free and just future for their country.

According to the center, many Afghans were forced to flee because of the brutality of the Taliban regime and because of their opposition to it.

Earlier, 61 members of the US Congress also criticised the Trump administration’s actions in a letter to the US secretaries of state and homeland security, accusing the administration of exploiting the attack and collectively punishing Afghan migrants.

The policy shift has heightened fear among Afghan migrants already living in the United States. Immigration lawyers and refugee advocates in the Sacramento area of California, home to one of the country’s largest Afghan communities, have reported an increase in detentions and the cancellation of asylum-related interviews.

The Associated Press reported that since November 26, at least 24 Afghan migrants mostly in Northern California have been detained. In the past week alone, at least nine Afghan men were taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement when they appeared for routine case-status checks.","https://i.afintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/b54c91cc600bc7f7b7e261789cbc5f501eef7216-576x384.jpg?rect=0,41,576,302&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-12-21 07:57:48.781588

Trump has already surged immigration agents into major US cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed ​with residents. While federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses, they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status. ICE and Border Patrol will get $170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 — a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about $19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July. Administration officials say they plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status.

The expanded deportation plans come despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Miami, one of the cities most affected by Trump’s crackdown because of its large immigrant population, elected its first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades last week in what the mayor-elect said was, in part, a reaction to the president. Other local elections and polling ‌have suggested rising concern among ‌voters wary of aggressive immigration tactics. “People are beginning to see this not as an immigration question anymore ‌as ⁠much ​as it ‌is a violation of rights, a violation of due process and militarizing neighborhoods extraconstitutionally,” said Mike Madrid, a moderate Republican political strategist. “There is no question that is a problem for the president and Republicans.” Trump’s overall approval rating on immigration policy fell from 50 percent in March, before he launched crackdowns in several major US cities, to 41 percent in mid-December, for what had been his strongest issue. Rising public unease has focused on masked federal agents using aggressive tactics such as deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods and detaining US citizens.

’NUMBERS WILL EXPLODE’

In addition to expanding enforcement actions, Trump has stripped hundreds of thousands of Haitian, Venezuelan and Afghan immigrants of temporary legal status, expanding the pool of people who could be deported as the president promises to remove 1 million immigrants each year – a goal he almost certainly will miss this year. So far, some 622,000 immigrants ⁠have been deported since Trump took office in January.

White House border czar Tom Homan told Reuters Trump had delivered on his promise of a historic deportation operation and removing criminals while shutting down illegal immigration across ‌the US-Mexico border. Homan said the number of arrests will increase sharply as ICE hires more ‍officers and expands detention capacity with the new funding.

“I think you’re going to ‍see the numbers explode greatly next year,” Homan said.

Homan said the plans “absolutely” include more enforcement actions at workplaces.

Sarah Pierce, director of social policy at the ‍center-left group Third Way, said US businesses have been reluctant to push back on Trump’s immigration crackdown in the past year but could be prompted to speak up if the focus turns to employers.

Pierce said it will be interesting to see “whether or not businesses finally stand up to this administration.”

Trump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. He kicked off a campaign that dispatched federal agents to ​US cities in search of possible immigration offenders, sparking protests and lawsuits over racial profiling and violent tactics.

Some businesses shut down to avoid raids or because of a lack of customers. Parents vulnerable to arrest kept their children home from school or had neighbors ⁠walk them. Some US citizens started carrying passports. Despite the focus on criminals in its public statements, government data shows that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who have not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.

Some 41 percent of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation, agency figures show. In the first few weeks in January, before Trump took office, just 6 percent of those arrested and detained by ICE were not facing charges for other crimes or previously convicted. The Trump administration has taken aim at legal immigrants as well. Agents have arrested spouses of US citizens at their green card interviews, pulled people from certain countries out of their naturalization ceremonies, moments before they were to become citizens, and revoked thousands of student visas.

PLANS TO TARGET EMPLOYERS

The administration’s planned focus on job sites in the coming year could generate many more arrests and affect the US economy and Republican-leaning business owners.

Replacing immigrants arrested during workplace raids could lead to higher labor costs, undermining Trump’s fight against inflation, which analysts expect to be a major issue in the closely watched November elections, determining control of Congress. Administration officials earlier this year exempted such businesses from enforcement on Trump’s orders, then quickly reversed, Reuters reported at the time.

Some immigration hard-liners have ‌called for more workplace enforcement.

“Eventually you’re going to have to go after these employers,” said Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration. “When that starts happening the employers will start cleaning up their acts on their own.”

LONDON: London’s Metropolitan Police have used powers that have been withdrawn to clamp down on pro-Palestine rallies in the capital, legal experts have said.

The Guardian and Liberty Investigates obtained evidence that police officers had imposed restrictions on at least two protests based on the principle of “cumulative disruption.” But that power was withdrawn by the Court of Appeal in May, according to legal experts.

All references to cumulative disruption have been removed from relevant legislation, yet the Home Office and the Met continue to insist that police officers retain the power to consider the concept when suppressing protests.

On May 7, five days after the powers were withdrawn, the Met banned a Jewish pro-Palestine group from holding its weekly rally in north London, citing the cumulative impact on the neighborhood’s Jewish community.

Last month, the Met forced the Palestine Coalition to change the route of its rally on three days’ notice, highlighting the cumulative impact on businesses during Black Friday weekend.

Raj Chada, a partner at Hodge, Jones & Allen and a leading criminal lawyer, said: “There is no reference to cumulative disruption in the original (legislation). The regulations that introduced this concept were quashed in May 2025, so I fail to see how this can still be the approach taken by police. There is no legal basis for this whatsoever.”

The Met appeared “not to care” if it was acting within the law, the Network for Police Monitoring said, adding that the revelation surrounding “cumulative disruption” demonstrated an “ongoing crackdown on protest” that had reached an “alarming point” by police in London.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced plans in October to reintroduce the power to consider cumulative impact in toughened form.

But Nick Glynn, a retired senior officer from Leicestershire Police, said: “The police have too many protest powers already and they definitely don’t need any more. If they are provided with them, they not only use them (but) as in this case, they stretch them.

“They go beyond what was intended. The right to protest is sacrosanct and more stifling of protest makes democracy worth less.”

Cumulative disruption was regularly considered and employed in regulations if protests met the threshold of causing “serious disruption to the life of the community.”

The Court of Appeal withdrew the power following a legal challenge by human rights group Liberty.

Ben Jamal, the Palestine Solidarity Campaign’s director, was reportedly told by Alison Heydari, the Met’s deputy assistant commissioner, that her decision on imposing protest regulations “will be purely around the cumulative effect of your protests.”

She reportedly added that “this is not just about Saturday’s protest but it’s a combination of all the impacts of all the processions so far,” referencing “serious disruption” to the business community.

“You’ve used this route in November 2024, and you’ve used it a few times before then as well. So, there is an impact.”

The repeated disruption to PSC-hosted marches, the largest pro-Palestine events in London, was a “demobilizer,” Jamal said.

It also caused confusion about march starting points and led to protesters being harassed by police officers who accused them of violating protest conditions, he added.

A Met spokesperson told The Guardian: “The outcome of the judicial review does not prevent senior officers from considering the cumulative impact of protest on the life of communities.

“To determine the extent of disruption that may result from a particular protest, it is, of course, important to consider the circumstances in which that protest is to be held, including any existing disruption an affected community is already experiencing.

“We recognise the importance of the right to protest. We also recognise our responsibility to use our powers to ensure that protest does not result in serious disorder or serious disruption. We use those powers lawfully and will continue to do so.”",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/12/21/4669785-399591740.jpg?itok=1S0DaBxW,N,,2025-12-21 10:57:28.517646

For nearly a century after Ellis Island first opened, immigration detention was relatively rare.
The Reagan administration imposed the nation’s first immigration detention quota, ensuring that thousands of migrants—many fleeing violence or seeking family reunification—would be incarcerated at any given time.
Today, the US operates the largest and fastest-growing immigration detention system in the world.
In July, Congress budgeted $45 billion for ICE to build more immigration detention centers, and an additional $30 billion for arrests and deportation.","Early this month, The 19th reported that a 22-year-old mother named Nayra Guzman was kidnapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on her way to the neonatal intensive care unit to see her newborn daughter, just days after a long and complicated delivery. While her daughter remained hospitalized, Guzman—still recovering from a C-section and managing Type 1 diabetes—was taken to an immigration detention center and held for 34 hours without adequate medical care, food, or water, or access to a breast pump.

This is not an isolated failure. It is reproductive violence by design.

Immigration in the US has always been about control—controlling who belongs, who gets to build a family, and who is deemed worthy of safety and care. Early laws like the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and the 1924 Immigration Act codified eugenicist ideas about which communities were deemed “desirable” and which the country sought to exclude. During World War II, Japanese Americans were subject to mass incarceration, families were separated, pregnancies endangered, and women sterilized. More recently, between 2017 and 2021, more than 4,600 children were kidnapped at the US border—1,360 of whom still remain unaccounted for.

Reports show this has been the deadliest year in immigration detention since 2004. Next year is projected to be even worse. People are dying from untreated infections, suicide, dehydration, and preventable complications. Investigations have documented hundreds of human-rights abuses—including pregnant people miscarrying, being shacked across their stomachs during transport, placed in solitary confinement, and denied translation during medical procedures.

We must dismantle the systems that cage people, separate families, and dictate who is allowed to parent safely.

Major medical, public health, and advocacy organizations have long recognized that pregnant and postpartum people should not be incarcerated. Under the Obama administration, ICE was directed to avoid the detention of pregnant people whenever possible, citing serious health risks and the agency’s inability to provide appropriate care. Under both Trump terms, those protections were rolled back. And last month, Intercept uncovered that the Trump administration has been actively concealing how many pregnant people are in ICE custody.

What we don’t know should scare us even more. Until recently, the Department of Homeland Security was required to publish semiannual reports detailing how many pregnant, postpartum, and lactating people were detained, and what care they received. Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, those reports have stopped, and Congress quietly dropped the reporting requirement altogether.

Without even basic reporting requirements, what happens inside detention becomes nearly impossible to track, and people vanish. They are transferred in the middle of the night, across state lines, with no transparency, and no way for their families to know where their loved ones are or if they’re safe.

What we are seeing today are the consequences of a system rooted in racialized policing and mass incarceration—one that criminalizes migration and is built to financially benefit from human suffering. Today, detention quotas and private contracts dictate immigration policy.

For nearly a century after Ellis Island first opened, immigration detention was relatively rare. But by the 1980s, as the ""War on Drugs"" expanded the criminal legal system, immigration enforcement adopted the same punitive logic. The Reagan administration imposed the nation’s first immigration detention quota, ensuring that thousands of migrants—many fleeing violence or seeking family reunification—would be incarcerated at any given time. After 9/11, detention intensified with the “War on Terror” and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Private prison companies secured lucrative federal contracts, new facilities opened nationwide, and immigration violations—many of them civil, not criminal—were now punished with incarceration. ICE’s own data shows roughly 72% of people in detention have no criminal record. Yet thousands are incarcerated for civil violations that carry no criminal penalty under federal law.

As prison beds became profitable, people became commodities. Today, the US operates the largest and fastest-growing immigration detention system in the world. In July, Congress budgeted $45 billion for ICE to build more immigration detention centers, and an additional $30 billion for arrests and deportation. The two biggest private prison companies, CoreCivic and GEO Group, have reported record-breaking profits and described the Trump administration as offering “unprecedented growth opportunities.”

As climate change, war, and economic and political instability drive global displacement and migration, the US has responded with cages instead of care. And apathy feels endless. Politicians who call themselves “pro-life” support policies that detain pregnant people, criminalize pregnancy, and separate families. The American people, exhausted and complacent, have learned to tune it out. Silence has become a coping mechanism.

Working in policy, I live with a constant tension: I know change is incremental, that the system moves slowly, but I am also an abolitionist. I do not believe in prisons or borders. I believe health and reproduction are human rights, and that no one should be imprisoned for migrating or for being pregnant. I think of my policy work as harm reduction—protecting people’s dignity and autonomy now, as we fight for collective liberation in the future.

Calls to release pregnant people from detention are growing. In November, the Democratic Women’s Caucus declared the treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing people in ICE custody “unacceptable,” and last week, Illinois Rep. Delia Ramirez introduced a resolution urging congressional action.

But that demand cannot come from advocates and politicians alone—change depends on ordinary people determined to not look away. Our outrage is long overdue. Call your representatives and let them know that cruelty is a political choice we refuse to normalize. Join groups organizing on the ground, donate to local defense funds, and talk about this in your circles.

In the long term, we must dismantle the systems that cage people, separate families, and dictate who is allowed to parent safely. That vision is at the heart of reproductive justice—because every struggle is connected, and every win brings us closer to the world we deserve.

I was watching television in 1954 when Welch, then the attorney for the U.S. Army, asked Sen. McCarthy, “Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last?”

McCarthy, senator from Wisconsin, had been falsely accusing many people in the government of being Communists and he likewise smeared a young lawyer on Welch’s team. Welch asked Sen. McCarthy the question that made Americans realize that the senator did not have basic decency.

Americans like to think that we are a moral people, and because we are a moral people, we act decently toward all people. A major claim to decency is that we require our police to follow due process in apprehending those who have done wrong. Like all nations we have written law, but in addition to the written law, we have the unwritten law for government officials to follow as they enforce the laws, such as police are not allowed to hide their identity behind a mask. Due process is the fair practice required as the law is enforced. Cruel and unusual treatment by those enforcing the law is an important place to start to consider what is decent and humane treatment.

An example of indecent and inhumane treatment is the treatment of immigration detainees at “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida. It is not consistent with decent treatment of human beings. When people’s heads are pressed down as they are made to walk shackled to their places of confinement, that is not the fair and decent treatment expected in due process.

Due process should be taken for granted by all Americans, and all people residing in the United States, as the way responsible and decent people in the government will act as they carry out the law. This is something that most Americans sense. Sen. McCarthy’s career virtually came to an end after the 1954 hearings in the Senate because people realized that he had stopped acting decently.

The overstepping of due process has been stretched far beyond words as used by Sen. McCarthy. The attacks, for example on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are only a revelation of beginning down the road of indecent behavior by the present Administration. More clearly the actual behavior of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers has often overstepped the kind of decent behavior that officers of the law should follow. This includes chasing people and forcefully arresting them even though they may be American citizens who must hear their rights before being arrested. All citizens also have the right to be represented by a lawyer, which has not been followed by the federal officers.

Many people naturally wonder why America as a prosperous and strong nation cannot take care of its own people and also aid, along with other nations, suffering peoples in the world. In our own nation, Trump prepared the way for indecent and violent behavior by using the concepts of “retribution” and “revenge” in his political language, falsely giving the impression that he has been treated unfairly.

It is really a technique to win the support of people who feel that they have not been treated fairly. By promoting the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, he encouraged violence in political interactions. People who disagree with Trump fear that they may suffer violence against their families and homes. Trump has used very demeaning language for people, especially if they are brown or black people. He is building on emotions of white supremacy and looking down on large segments of the American population that are black or brown. Trump is encouraging racism that America has struggled against from its founding.

Americans like it when other countries want to be like America, but Trump has moved the united States in the opposite direction. America has already lost much of its position of being an ideal nation, yet it is possible to move toward being more like the democracy we used to be in which we emerged from the Great Depression and the racist society we were before the Civil Rights struggle freed us from those eras. Today, our overriding aspiration should be to become a nation where people see decency prevail.

Many South Sudanese TPS holders have settled in Maine, where officials have spent years trying to draw younger workers to its aging labor force.
For decades, numerous South Sudanese arrivals were granted refugee status before 2011, and then Temporary Protected Status.
According to a State Department travel advisory last month, South Sudan is designated as a level 4 destination, the highest ranking.","Alex Lomong is a man of many labels: He’s a Virginia resident, was a decorated Division I athlete on the Ohio State University track team, and is a middle-distance runner whose times put him in sight of qualifying for the Olympic trials.

He is also an immigrant from South Sudan who was granted Temporary Protected Status. Now, with the Trump administration’s plan to end TPS designation for South Sudanese nationals on Jan. 5, Lomong is one of many facing an uncertain future in the United States.

“Ever since I’ve been here, this is the only home I knew,” Lomong, 28, told NBC News.

Born in a small village in what is now South Sudan, Lomong fled with his mother to Kenya in 2003 as violence at home escalated. He came to the United States in 2009 at age 11 on a student visa and quickly emerged as a standout runner. The end of TPS could mean that he, as well as hundreds of others, will be forced to return to a country with widespread famine and political instability.

“Being deported there is basically like a suicide mission,” Lomong said.

TPS provides temporary legal status to people whose home countries are deemed critically unsafe. South Sudan received the designation in 2011 after it seceded from Sudan to become an independent nation. TPS for South Sudanese people has been extended multiple times over the years, and many have depended on it to remain in the United States.

“You have people who have been relying on that status for at least 14 years, who have paid their taxes, worked, built lives here, and contributed to the U.S. economy,” said Mariam Masumi, an immigration lawyer who works with TPS holders in Virginia.

South Sudan remains deeply unstable, with ongoing violence and mass displacement. The United Nations has warned of widespread hunger, saying millions face food insecurity amid conflict and economic collapse. The Trump administration announced on Tuesday that South Sudan is now among a group of five countries newly subject to full U.S. entry restrictions and travel limitations.

Many South Sudanese TPS holders have settled in Maine, where officials have spent years trying to draw younger workers to its aging labor force. For decades, numerous South Sudanese arrivals were granted refugee status before 2011, and then Temporary Protected Status. They fled violence in their home country to brave Maine’s blistering cold and rebuild their lives.

South Sudanese people have since opened grocery stores and churches, and became nonprofit leaders.

John Ochira is the previous president of the South Sudanese Community Association of Maine and founded the Community Champions League, a soccer program for low-income players in the greater Portland area. A naturalized citizen, he came to the United States in 2005 when he was 17 years old.

“I feel super lucky to have come when I came,” Ochira said. “Having come here as a refugee, I was able to naturalize, but not everybody around me has had the privilege to get naturalized.”

TPS allows people already in the U.S. to stay and work legally for a limited time while conditions in their home country are unsafe, but it does not provide a path to permanent residency, said Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager at the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition. Refugee status is granted to people outside the U.S. who face persecution and are resettled with legal status that can lead to citizenship, he said.

Matthew Long, a reverend at Portland’s Sudanese Fellowship Presbyterian Church, said that his community of South Sudanese worshippers panicked after hearing the news of TPS ending. Some, he said, have had trouble finding affordable legal representation.

“We should all be protected by the law in this country, but this is not the case right now,” Long said.

Issac Gang, an associate professor at George Mason University and the U.S. Missions representative for the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, said that the Sudanese community in Washington, D.C., is also preparing for the possibility of deportations in January.

“This status has been around for a while, and a good number of our people have enjoyed the status. Given what’s happening in South Sudan, we never expected it to be terminated, because you look at the war and the civil war and the problems, we didn’t expect a termination,” Gang said.

In October, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan issued a stark warning that political corruption and crisis is leading to an increase in armed violence, deepening grim human rights conditions. According to a State Department travel advisory last month, South Sudan is designated as a level 4 destination, the highest ranking.

“Do not travel to South Sudan for any reason. U.S. citizens are at risk due to unrest, crime, health, kidnapping, and landmines,” the advisory stated.

“South Sudan still remains very much in a dire humanitarian crisis. Hundreds of thousands of people just even in the last year have left the country,” Masumi said. “It’s not even just a reintegration at this point. You’re having people return to a country where, although yes, there’s no full-scale civil war, there’s still a significant amount of problems within the country.”

Now, facing the prospect of being sent back to famine and conflict, TPS holders have few viable pathways to remain in the United States.

“There are very limited options for folks. There may be other venues or pathways for immigration that they could qualify under, but it is very difficult to access them,” Torres said.

Torres said that the asylum system is so backlogged that cases can take eight to 10 years, and the traditional refugee admissions program has been replaced by a new Trump administration system that advocates argue does not follow the requirements Congress set in 1980.

“Under normal circumstances, TPS holders who lose status might shift to another category like asylum, an H-visa, or another visa they qualify for. But those avenues are largely closed, leaving almost no alternative pathways for people to remain in the country,” Torres said.

Even with the possibility of being returned to South Sudan without any living relatives there, Lomong still holds onto his dreams of becoming a U.S. Olympian, like his brother Lopez, who was a 2008 U.S. flag bearer. He also still hopes to build a life here without the constant fear of having to leave.

“I think it’s sad that we are just all a bunch of pawns in this big chess game, and we don’t have a choice to make any moves,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251210-Alex-Lomong-mn-1540-ff5822.jpg",N,,2025-12-21 06:56:43.715454

In D.C., a Defense Department worker looked up from a pile of congressional inquiries to check the clock.","A State Department worker watched on television as President Donald Trump, hours into his second term, signed executive orders that halted relocation flights for Afghan refugees — which her office existed to coordinate. She wondered: What would happen now?

A Veterans Affairs staffer in that agency’s equity office watched Trump sign another document, this one outlawing diversity programs, and thought, “It’s over.” And in a Social Security building, a woman wandered over to her co-worker’s desk worried about Russell Vought, Trump’s pick for budget director. Vought said he wanted to put federal workers “in trauma,” she pointed out, and would soon decide which agencies to cut and by how much.

“It isn’t easy to fire federal employees,” her co-worker told her. “We have all these protections. We’ll be okay.”

He was wrong. The United States’ 2.4 million federal employees were about to get caught up in a once-unthinkable overhaul of the nation’s sprawling bureaucracy, carried out in less than a year by one of the most polarizing presidents in American history.

Missions have shifted or shattered. Entire agencies were deleted. Nearly 300,000 employees were forced out of the federal workforce. The Trump administration froze or shut off billions of dollars in scientific research, gutted or eliminated offices and programs devoted to civil rights and diversity, rewrote the federal hiring system to reward loyalty to the president, and shrank Social Security while installing Immigration and Custom Enforcement agents in hundreds of new offices across the country.

More changes are coming: Trump officials are planning to cut tens of thousands of open positions from the Department of Veterans Affairs, downgrade performance ratings across the government, and replace the State Department’s traditional condemnation of torture and the persecution of minorities worldwide with scrutiny of abortion and youth gender transitioning in other countries.

Reached for comment, White House spokeswoman Liz Huston wrote in an emailed statement: “President Trump was given a clear mandate to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse from federal government. In less than a year in office, he has made significant progress in making the federal government more efficient to better serve the American taxpayer.”

A White House official who declined to give their name also shared 19 bullet points listing Trump’s accomplishments transforming the government in 2025. These included processing a record 2.5 million ratings claims at Veterans Affairs; ending the Biden-era Digital Equity Act, which, the official wrote, “provided billions in handouts based on race”; allowing fossil fuels to be used in federal buildings again; halting operations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; terminating “all federal Fake News media contracts”; requiring that agencies cut 10 existing rules or regulations for every new rule introduced; downsizing the federal bureaucracy; ordering staff back to the office five days a week; and shuttering “radical and wasteful government sponsored” diversity programs.

Several federal agencies did not respond to requests for comment, including Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

This account of what happened inside the U.S. government in 2025 is based on a year’s worth of messages and interviews with more than 1,200 current and former federal workers. More than 200 also agreed to fill out a Washington Post survey asking about their experiences. Thirty participated in nearly 60 hours of video and phone interviews, with many speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs or their families.

This is their story.

Google searches for “federal workers return to office” spiked by 600 percent as soon as Trump ended remote work. Then instructions began to go out.

A Department of Health and Human Services staffer in the Southwest was given five days to move to D.C. A Defense Department worker had two months to report to an office in another state. In Pahrump, Nevada, a Bureau of Land Management employee received an email with the address of the nearest federal building: more than 70 miles away. Edward Brandon Beckham looked at his wife, dying of cancer in home hospice, and knew he couldn’t leave her to commute for three hours a day.

Workers turned a conference room in a Veterans Affairs office in California into desk space for six nurses. Veterans who called to confess thoughts of suicide could hear people speaking in the background. In the Southwest, a woman who conducted background investigations into federal applicants showed up to her new office to find she could hear every word of her co-workers’ conversations — and they could hear hers. She moved into a musty closet, closing the door.

A Customs and Border Protection employee, unable to locate a federal office building, started driving to an international airport that ran flights only on weekends. He walked and shuttled through miles of empty terminals each morning to a desk where he sat, all day, without seeing a single human face. After six months, he quit.

The FBI instructed janitorial staff in Quantico, Virginia, to paint over a colorful mural bearing the words “FAIRNESS,” “COMPASSION” and “DIVERSITY.” Pete Hegseth, the newly confirmed defense secretary, ordered an end to Black History Month celebrations. IT workers at the Transportation Department scraped every mention of “DEI” from their website.

The Social Security Administration shuttered its Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity, where 150 people handled civil rights complaints and harassment cases, and made accommodations for those with disabilities, both SSA workers and members of the public. One disabled staffer learned of the closure by reading media reports and, fighting tears, called her supervisor on his personal number. He knew no more than she did, he said.

At NASA, a worker emailed her office’s equal employment contact with a request. But the automated reply said the recipient “wasn’t found at nasa.gov.”

Dozens of Education Department staffers checked their email to find they were on leave “pursuant to the President’s executive order on DEIA.” One of them, Donna Bussell, couldn’t understand why: Her job was helping administer grants to support Native American students. Then she remembered. She’d once served as president of an affinity group for Native Americans and Alaskans at the department.

A Veterans Affairs psychologist heard from a man who ran treatment groups for LGBTQ+ veterans. He was quitting, he said, because VA had become “hostile.” The psychologist’s LGBTQ+ patients stopped showing up to their appointments.

A National Guard employee and former lawyer responded with questions — How could this possibly work? Will the government be bound by it? He was careful not to type the word “resign.” A Veterans Affairs worker texted his wife: “It’s 100% a ‘here’s your chance to get out paid, you might not get that later.’” In Colorado, a Forest Service staffer opened his diary and wrote: “I advised as many people as I could not to take it. … I am coming to the realization that I have to fight back.”

In D.C., an Education Department staffer waited three weeks, then replied “resign,” because he was sure he’d get fired anyway. In Minnesota, Agriculture Department loan assistant James Barnebee resigned, too. It was an easy decision, even with four children: He had voted for Trump, who campaigned on reducing the size of the government. The president, Barnebee thought, was just doing what he promised.

Erica Hagen, 48, hoped it didn’t mean anything when bosses told her not to wear USAID gear to an event with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was touring Latin America.

Hagen, a program officer in the Dominican Republic, listened as Rubio promised the audience that foreign aid wasn’t gone, just under review. She thought about all the frozen programs she had helped oversee: One treating and preventing HIV. Another educating children in rural areas. A third reducing plastic in the oceans.

Not long after Rubio’s visit, Hagen and her colleagues were sent home, dismissed from their jobs. Someone staged a goodbye ceremony. “Participants will paint rocks with positive images and messages to commemorate the presence and contributions” of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the invitation read. Hagen wrote “RIP USAID” in red and black on an oval rock. She left it on a picnic table with nearly 100 other rocks, which someone eventually nestled under a tree.

She flew to D.C. with her three children and husband to find a final set of off-boarding instructions: She had to cancel her diplomatic passport by punching a hole in it. Everything Hagen owned was wrapped in plastic on a cargo ship, so she drove to her local library to borrow a hole punch.

She closed her eyes as she pressed down, wondering if this was how it felt to dig your grave.

Thousands of probationary workers found out they were fired from prerecorded videos. Some were instructed to leave the building in 30 minutes. The Office of Personnel Management’s acting director told probationary staff, “I understand that this may be unexpected and that this is difficult.” One worker asked, “Who is this guy?”

The Small Business Administration emailed terminated employees a number they could call to appeal. But when one woman phoned, an apartment building answered: “Thank you for calling Westbrooke Place.” A Veterans Affairs supervisor texted a fired subordinate: “It states it’s due to your performance which is not true. … You need to appeal it.”

More mistakes emerged. The Energy Department laid off hundreds of engineers, technicians and managers who maintain America’s nuclear weapons before scrambling to rehire them. Veterans Affairs had to bring back workers who staff the Veterans Crisis Line. The Department of Health and Human Services reinstated employees who oversee aid to survivors of 9/11 and regulate the nation’s food supply, including a neonatologist who helped oversee the quality of infant formula.

About 2 a.m., Elon Musk, the billionaire whom Trump had named to lead a cost-cutting team called the U.S. DOGE Service, shared a picture of himself in gladiator armor and wrote that he was destroying “the woke mind virus.” Later that morning, Forest Service worker Amanda Mae Downey drove to her office in Michigan to sign a letter accepting her firing, unsure how she’d support her three children, sick mother and newly unemployed husband. Above her signature, she wrote in blue: “Received and accepted under duress.”

Puzzled workers spending their Saturdays at dog parks or breweries, or taking their children to Scouting America events, opened a message titled “What did you do last week?” It asked for five bullet points of accomplishments.

A worker at the Food and Drug Administration reported it as spam. An employee at the Department of Housing and Urban Development fed the instructions into ChatGPT, then responded with 20 pages of gibberish. At an airport in the Pacific Northwest, Transportation Security Administration employees who check for weapons were pulled away from their X-ray machines to compose bullet points. Lines swelled.

A Forest Service staffer copied the email verbatim into his diary. “Every week things come more and more into focus,” he wrote beneath it. “We are at war.”

In Virginia, the family of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services worker Caitlin Cross-Barnet checked her into a mental health facility. She was struggling with despair after a difficult hysterectomy, and because she felt Trump was unraveling the government. In daily calls to her husband, she asked about changes to the federal workforce. Six days after the “What did you do” email, she killed herself.

Within two months, as Musk fell out with Trump and prepared to leave the government, most agencies reversed course and told employees to ignore the emails.

Across the government, staff searched for words they hoped would save the work they believed in. NASA employees built a spreadsheet explaining why DOGE shouldn’t cancel the agency’s 13,000 contracts and grants: “Mission essential.” “Worthwhile scientific research.” “Taxpayer dollars … were already spent.”

At the Energy Department, one worker prepared memos arguing that his projects would cut costs for American homes and businesses. Someone decided to cancel many anyway. So he, like other employees, began deleting: Any mention of “carbon.” “Sustainability.” The word “green.”

State Department staffers scrubbed out the terms “diverse” and “inclusive.” One Environmental Protection Agency employee, tasked with eliminating information about race, gender and religion, confided to her diary: “It’s really difficult to have to erase someone’s existence from the federal government.”

At the National Institutes of Health, Elizabeth Ginexi was sent a list of grants to review for DOGE, along with words to watch for: “inclusion,” “race,” “ethnicity.” It felt unscientific. Had she really earned a Ph.D. to do this? Breaking the rules, she called one grantee from her personal phone and told them to revise their study abstract — removing the words “gender” and “minorities.”

Then DOGE arrived at her building. They were easy to spot: Silent young men in their 20s and 30s, always wearing backpacks. Some of her colleagues’ cars were searched in the parking lot. Other employees were stopped in the bathroom and asked for their ID cards. Ginexi began having nightmares about getting fired because she voted for Kamala Harris.

Not long before she decided to resign, she texted a friend: “NIH is being killed.”

Ten thousand health staff, including biomedical scientists and researchers who studied patient safety, lost their jobs. Senior leaders at the NIH received letters offering new posts in remote areas such as Alaska or Billings, Montana. At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those who oversaw chronic disease, HIV and tuberculosis programs were reassigned to the Indian Health Service.

When Tony Schlaff arrived at the Health Resources and Services Administration, he was astonished to see hundreds of people queued up outside. “What’s going on?” he asked. “Everybody is going through a full screening,” the person standing next to him said. Schlaff filed into line and, alongside hundreds of colleagues, waited for nearly two hours, shivering in the frigid wind.

Once indoors, Schlaff watched employees walk through a TSA-style screening machine and undergo badge checks. Some walked back outside, tearful. After half an hour, he got close enough to hear what was happening: “You do not have access to the building,” one security guard told a woman whose badge failed to swipe, which is how she found out she’d been fired. “Leave. Go home.”

In Texas, Shelley Bain awoke to her phone buzzing. Bain, a 66-year-old program specialist for the Administration for Children and Families, checked her email and saw she’d been fired at 4:30 a.m. She made a cup of coffee and calculated. She was losing half the retirement income she’d counted on. She is legally blind, so it would be hard to find another job.

At 6:24 a.m., she texted her children. Her daughter swore. When Bain’s grandchildren woke, she made breakfast and walked them to the bus stop. Before they boarded, she pulled the girls, 12 and 14, aside: “I just got fired, but it will be okay.” She watched the bus pull away, thinking about how she’d probably have to sell her home, a farm outside Dallas where she and her husband had hoped to die.

The spending limits on federal credit cards shrank to $1. Government scientists studying food safety ran short of lab-cleaning fluid. Contractors who help identify U.S. soldiers killed in combat were told to pause their work.

A climate researcher at the U.S. Geological Survey found herself unable to travel for research conferences, restock hydrogen gas or buy Scotch tape. A Food and Drug Administration staffer couldn’t purchase dry ice or environmental swabs, nor pay the highway tolls that safety inspectors incurred driving for work. When colleagues asked what they were supposed to do, she told them to try HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or Trump.

In a Colorado branch of the Forest Service, one man was designated purchaser for the entire office. Anyone who wanted to buy horse fodder or irrigation pipes had to wait until the man returned from weeks-long firefighting trips. The new system meant staff were a week late buying chainsaw fuel, delaying the thinning of flammable forest brush. “In 15 years, I have never seen us so unprepared for fire season,” the local fire management officer told staff at a meeting, according to one worker in attendance.

General Services Administration political appointees imposed a rule mandating they approve project requests, and more than 1,500 built up in an internal tracker, including executed leases and notices saying construction could begin. At NASA, a group of employees wrote several detailed paragraphs, across multiple emails, to justify buying fastening bolts.

Social Security started requiring that one of fewer than a dozen people sign off on expenses for all 1,300 field offices. Staff ran out of paper, printer cartridges and phone headsets, even as calls poured in from Americans asking what Trump might be doing to their benefits.

In one Northeastern office, the fridge broke. In late April, a staffer emailed the office seeking donations: “We are going to purchase a new fridge since the funds that would normally be available for Facilities to provide us with one are still frozen. Before we do, I would like to see if anyone else is interested in contributing.”

It wasn’t Abby McIlraith’s primary job to take calls from survivors — until Texas flooded.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency had long contracted with phone centers to help handle the influx of calls after disasters. But the contracts cost more than $100,000, meaning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem had to approve them, and she was slow to do so, letting some lapse for close to a week.

So McIlraith was assigned to the phones, taking back-to-back calls. She wrote down what people had lost: homes, cars, furniture, appliances. She asked if they had anywhere to stay, if FEMA could help. She listened to people scream about how long they’d been waiting, demand to know why the government was moving so slowly.

Per her orders, she kept each call to a few minutes. Whenever a conversation ended, she had 40 seconds to finish her notes. She watched the timer on her screen count down to the next call.

A few months later, she heard that other employees were signing a letter of dissent, disagreeing with the direction of FEMA under Trump. She wondered if signing would cost her her job, then recalled her week answering phones. McIlraith signed her name — and was placed on leave.

Asked about McIlraith’s account, FEMA shared a written statement from acting press secretary Daniel Llargues asserting Noem’s tighter control over spending “strengthens oversight, safeguards against fraud, waste and abuse, and ensures funding decisions are well-documented and mission-focused.” Noem’s $100,000 rule has already “saved U.S. taxpayers … $10.7 billion,” Llargues added, stating without offering evidence that Noem reviews every contract within 24 hours.

New resignation offers rolled out, agency by agency. As the summer waned, people left.

The NIH lost six directors of institutes focused on infectious disease, child health and the human genome. The Federal Aviation Administration lost its chief air traffic officer, among nearly a dozen other top officials. The Internal Revenue Service lost its chief of staff, chief procurement officer and chief human capital officer — while the Treasury Department lost more than 200 technical experts and experienced managers who helped run the nation’s financial systems.

At a town hall, Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy told staff: “We’re going to lose some knowledge, right? We’re going to lose some expertise as we go through this process.” He asked those staying “to get the best points from those who are leaving.”

In the Midwest, union leader Colin Smalley watched his Army Corps of Engineers unit dwindle. Among the departed: An employee so knowledgeable about rock blasting that the government brought him back the first time he tried to retire. A staffer who was spearheading a novel project to stun invasive carp with electric shocks. How, Smalley asked his wife, could they ever replace someone who knew how to electrify rivers?

A National Park Service staffer in Colorado tallied her park’s losses: Two people employed for 20 years each. One woman who’d been there even longer. A biologist who’d founded a key program the park ran. Soon, everyone was picking up new responsibilities. Bosses filled out time sheets, biologists signed travel authorizations and the staffer, a land surveyor, began leading park tours. Other days, she cleaned bathrooms.

Hearing about a protest against federal cuts, she drew up a poster to carry. “Where have all the rangers gone?” it asked.

In Lander, Wyoming, three Forest Service retirees noticed fences tilting over, docks slipping into lakes, mountain roads caving inward from water pressure. Barb Gustin, 69, began volunteering to keep open Lander’s Forest Service office. Bill Lee, 73, drove hundreds of miles through the forest weekly, fixing broken fences and fallen signs. And Del Nelson, 81, started wiping down five bathrooms a day. He knew money was short, so he used one paper towel per set of toilets.

More than 750,000 were sent home without pay as whole departments shuttered. Some National Park Service staffers left without being told if they could put up signs telling visitors their parks had closed. At the State Department, staffers who’d already been fired were surprised to see furlough notices hit their personal inboxes — a painful accident.

An Agriculture Department employee lined up a second job classifying soils, figuring the shutdown might last for a while. A State Department custodian required to keep working readied herself for another shift cleaning toilets and mopping floors. Education Department employees saw their out-of-office messages altered to blame “Democrat Senators” for the shutdown. On their sixth day working without pay, a skeleton crew of NIH researchers learned a well-liked animal health technician had been taken by ICE to a Louisiana detention center.

“We are going to have to lay some people off if the shutdown continues,” Vice President JD Vance told reporters, even as senior federal officials privately warned such firings would be illegal. An IRS worker wondered whether his disability, which necessitates working from home, meant he would be dismissed first.

In a year when roughly 300,000 had already gone, 4,000 more lost their jobs — dismissals swiftly entangled in lawsuits. In the Oval Office, Trump said he’d fired “people that the Democrats want.” The reductions in force targeted staff who regulated hazardous waste, checked the quality of federal housing and assisted students with disabilities.

Nationwide, flights fell behind schedule. Taxpayer help lines shut down. The president ordered the Pentagon to use research funding to pay service members, while his top deputies claimed they or Trump had found unspecified ways to compensate immigration and law enforcement agents. Workers who’d missed two paychecks in a row, while showing up to the office, watched money flow into gun-carrying colleagues’ accounts.

In Philadelphia, staff at one of the largest food banks noticed shelves growing bare. In Colorado, service members and veterans flooded the Homefront Military Network, asking for help with mortgages, utilities, car payments. Federal workers paid their bills with credit cards and stocked their kitchens from food pantries. Cynthia Brown, of the Government Publishing Office, lost her car to repossession, sold two iPhones and began subsisting on coffee and protein shakes.

Just before the government reopened, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the shutdown would trim as much as $14 billion from the United States’ annual economic output.

Federal workers, grateful to pick up paychecks again, found other worries waiting. Some agencies privately warned staff to expect deep spending cuts in 2026, reflecting Trump’s desired bare-bones budget. Following guidance from a top administration official to stop giving “everyone … an A,” the National Park Service decided to give 80 percent of staff middling performance reviews, which help determine promotions and bonuses. The National Weather Service lagged in hiring hundreds of promised replacement forecasters. And Veterans Affair made plans to slice away as many as 35,000 open jobs.

At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an attorney whose job used to be fighting housing discrimination told himself to stop thinking about things he couldn’t control — and dived into yet another internal personnel case. The Trump administration had stalled all his lawsuits and barred officials at his agency from speaking any language that wasn’t English. They’d even ripped down posters written in Spanish. Overnight, the attorney found himself unable to talk to many of his complainants, or even explain why.

He tried to focus on that day’s assignment — an ethics advisory opinion for a colleague who wanted to sell his house — but kept thinking about what he’d seen in the garage. Months ago, ICE had begun using his New York City federal building as a detention holding center. The evening before, walking to collect his bike, he’d witnessed a family in chains being led into an unmarked van. The attorney could still hear the sound their manacles made, dragging on concrete.

Thousands of miles away in Alaska, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration biologist stopped by a bush outside her building. She wasn’t eager to start another day of “Section 7 consults”: 500-page reports assessing the environmental impact of docks, airports and cable lines. It wasn’t unimportant, but it wasn’t the science she was hired to do — monitoring beluga whales, analyzing samples of stranded ocean mammals for disease, testing the impacts of pollution on pregnant whales. And it meant hours formatting Word documents.

The biologist stared at the bush, delaying a few more seconds. There used to be rocks beneath it, and in the spring, she’d painted some with slogans: “Save the Whales.” “NOAA Saves Whales.” Children began adding their own hand-painted contributions. It felt like hope. Then one day she arrived at work to find all the rocks had been removed. “This is what we’re fighting against, and losing,” she told herself now, looking at the bare earth, and walked into the building.

In D.C., a Defense Department worker looked up from a pile of congressional inquiries to check the clock. Two minutes to 11:30 — his lunch break. Another morning gone with no chance to turn to his studies of rising rates of mental illness among service members. Or his proposals, languishing for almost a year now, on how the government could drive those down.

This job was all he’d wanted to do since a close family member, a veteran, died by suicide. Then his office shrank by half under Trump. The staffers who were supposed to answer questions from Congress lost or left their jobs, and their work became his. Now, whenever the worker snatched time to resurface one of his ideas, he was told there was no money. He kept having the same thought driving to work, doing the dishes, just before he fell asleep: “You’re failing the American people.”

Rather than eat, the worker rose from his desk and walked until he found somewhere secluded. He knelt in prayer.

“If I am supposed to be here, then I am going to keep doing this,” he told God. “But if it’s time for me to go, please open the doors, so I can go.”

He repeats the prayer almost every day, waiting for a sign.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MTXKP5IHUVEP7FHG4VOZCNXR2M.jpg&w=1200,N,,2025-12-21 09:57:20.170175
